https://openalex.org/W1968164782,"Complex networks have been studied intensively for a decade, but research still focuses on the limited case of a single, non-interacting network. Modern systems are coupled together and therefore should be modelled as interdependent networks. A fundamental property of interdependent networks is that failure of nodes in one network may lead to failure of dependent nodes in other networks. This may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures. In fact, a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system of several interdependent networks. A dramatic real-world example of a cascade of failures ('concurrent malfunction') is the electrical blackout that affected much of Italy on 28 September 2003: the shutdown of power stations directly led to the failure of nodes in the Internet communication network, which in turn caused further breakdown of power stations. Here we develop a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures. We present exact analytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that, on removal, will lead to a failure cascade and to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks. Surprisingly, a broader degree distribution increases the vulnerability of interdependent networks to random failure, which is opposite to how a single network behaves. Our findings highlight the need to consider interdependent network properties in designing robust networks."
https://openalex.org/W2014787267,"We used genome-wide sequencing methods to study stimulus-dependent enhancer function in mouse cortical neurons. We identified approximately 12,000 neuronal activity-regulated enhancers that are bound by the general transcriptional co-activator CBP in an activity-dependent manner. A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers. Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis. These findings reveal that a widespread mechanism of enhancer activation involves RNAPII binding and eRNA synthesis."

Systematic studies of more than 25,000 cancer genomes at the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic levels will reveal the repertoire of oncogenic mutations, uncover traces of the mutagenic influences, define clinically relevant subtypes for prognosis and therapeutic management, and enable the development of new cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2147354890,"Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies provide an unprecedented ability to screen entire genomes for genetic changes associated with tumour progression. Here we describe the genomic analyses of four DNA samples from an African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer: peripheral blood, the primary tumour, a brain metastasis and a xenograft derived from the primary tumour. The metastasis contained two de novo mutations and a large deletion not present in the primary tumour, and was significantly enriched for 20 shared mutations. The xenograft retained all primary tumour mutations and displayed a mutation enrichment pattern that resembled the metastasis. Two overlapping large deletions, encompassing CTNNA1, were present in all three tumour samples. The differential mutation frequencies and structural variation patterns in metastasis and xenograft compared with the primary tumour indicate that secondary tumours may arise from a minority of cells within the primary tumour. With the latest DNA sequencing technologies it is now possible to screen an entire genome for the genetic changes associated with tumour progression. This approach has been used to obtain complete sequences of four DNA samples from a 44-year-old African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer: the primary tumour, peripheral blood, a brain metastasis and a first-passage xenograft derived from the primary tumour. Mutational analysis suggests that the metastasis tumour specifically selects a subset of cells from the primary tumour that contain pre-existing mutations, and also develops a small number of de novo mutations. Massively parallel DNA sequencing allows entire genomes to be screened for genetic changes associated with tumour progression. Here, the genomes of four DNA samples from a 44-year-old African-American patient with basal-like breast cancer were analysed. The samples came from peripheral blood, the primary tumour, a brain metastasis and a xenograft derived from the primary tumour. The findings indicate that cells with a distinct subset of the primary tumour mutation might be selected during metastasis and xenografting."
https://openalex.org/W2058302064,"Randomness is a fundamental feature of nature and a valuable resource for applications ranging from cryptography and gambling to numerical simulation of physical and biological systems. Random numbers, however, are difficult to characterize mathematically, and their generation must rely on an unpredictable physical process. Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes or failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control and detect. Here, inspired by earlier work on non-locality-based and device-independent quantum information processing, we show that the non-local correlations of entangled quantum particles can be used to certify the presence of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design a cryptographically secure random number generator that does not require any assumption about the internal working of the device. Such a strong form of randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems only if certified by a Bell inequality violation. We carry out a proof-of-concept demonstration of this proposal in a system of two entangled atoms separated by approximately one metre. The observed Bell inequality violation, featuring near perfect detection efficiency, guarantees that 42 new random numbers are generated with 99 per cent confidence. Our results lay the groundwork for future device-independent quantum information experiments and for addressing fundamental issues raised by the intrinsic randomness of quantum theory."
https://openalex.org/W1993339415,"Interleukin 23 (IL-23) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders. New work in a mouse model has identified a previously unrecognized population of innate lymphoid cells that respond to IL-23 by inducing inflammation through the production of IL-17 and interferon-γ. Further work will be needed to establish whether this newly discovered IL-23-driven pathway contributes to chronic inflammatory diseases such as irritable bowel disease. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-23 has inflammatory effects on innate immune cells and can drive colitis, but the cellular and molecular pathways involved are poorly characterized. Here it is shown that bacterial-driven innate colitis involves a previously unknown population of IL-23-responsive innate leukocytes that produce IL-17 and interferon-γ. These cells may represent a target in inflammatory bowel disease. The key role of interleukin (IL)-23 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders is supported by the identification of IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) susceptibility alleles associated with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. IL-23-driven inflammation has primarily been linked to the actions of T-helper type 17 (TH17) cells1. Somewhat overlooked, IL-23 also has inflammatory effects on innate immune cells2 and can drive T-cell-independent colitis. However, the downstream cellular and molecular pathways involved in this innate intestinal inflammatory response are poorly characterized. Here we show that bacteria-driven innate colitis is associated with an increased production of IL-17 and interferon-γ in the colon. Stimulation of colonic leukocytes with IL-23 induced the production of IL-17 and interferon-γ exclusively by innate lymphoid cells expressing Thy1, stem cell antigen 1 (SCA-1), retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-γt and IL-23R, and these cells markedly accumulated in the inflamed colon. IL-23-responsive innate intestinal cells are also a feature of T-cell-dependent models of colitis. The transcription factor ROR-γt, which controls IL-23R expression, has a functional role, because Rag-/-Rorc-/- mice failed to develop innate colitis. Last, depletion of Thy1+ innate lymphoid cells completely abrogated acute and chronic innate colitis. These results identify a previously unrecognized IL-23-responsive innate lymphoid population that mediates intestinal immune pathology and may therefore represent a target in inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2113337076,"The four receptors of the Notch family are widely expressed transmembrane proteins that function as key conduits through which mammalian cells communicate to regulate cell fate and growth. Ligand binding triggers a conformational change in the receptor negative regulatory region (NRR) that enables ADAM protease cleavage at a juxtamembrane site that otherwise lies buried within the quiescent NRR. Subsequent intramembrane proteolysis catalysed by the gamma-secretase complex liberates the intracellular domain (ICD) to initiate the downstream Notch transcriptional program. Aberrant signalling through each receptor has been linked to numerous diseases, particularly cancer, making the Notch pathway a compelling target for new drugs. Although gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have progressed into the clinic, GSIs fail to distinguish individual Notch receptors, inhibit other signalling pathways and cause intestinal toxicity, attributed to dual inhibition of Notch1 and 2 (ref. 11). To elucidate the discrete functions of Notch1 and Notch2 and develop clinically relevant inhibitors that reduce intestinal toxicity, we used phage display technology to generate highly specialized antibodies that specifically antagonize each receptor paralogue and yet cross-react with the human and mouse sequences, enabling the discrimination of Notch1 versus Notch2 function in human patients and rodent models. Our co-crystal structure shows that the inhibitory mechanism relies on stabilizing NRR quiescence. Selective blocking of Notch1 inhibits tumour growth in pre-clinical models through two mechanisms: inhibition of cancer cell growth and deregulation of angiogenesis. Whereas inhibition of Notch1 plus Notch2 causes severe intestinal toxicity, inhibition of either receptor alone reduces or avoids this effect, demonstrating a clear advantage over pan-Notch inhibitors. Our studies emphasize the value of paralogue-specific antagonists in dissecting the contributions of distinct Notch receptors to differentiation and disease and reveal the therapeutic promise in targeting Notch1 and Notch2 independently."
https://openalex.org/W2165412300,"Primary cilia are tiny hair-like structures expressed on the surface of eukaryotic cells. They participate in a wide range of biological processes such as sensing the extracellular environment to regulating numerous signalling pathways during development. Ciliary dysfunction has been linked to a group of human disorders known as ciliopathies. This study presents a functional genomic screen using RNA interference (RNAi) to identify human genes involved in control of ciliogenesis. Several positive and negative modulators of ciliogenesis with broad ranging functions were identified. Development of specific inhibitors that target key proteins may provide novel strategies to treat ciliopathies. Primary cilia are tiny hair-like structures expressed on the surface of eukaryotic cells. They participate in a range of processes, such as sensing the extracellular environment and regulating signalling pathways during development. Here, a functional genomic screen is presented that used RNA interference to identify human genes involved in controlling ciliogenesis. Several positive and negative ciliogenesis modulators with broad-ranging functions were found. Primary cilia are evolutionarily conserved cellular organelles that organize diverse signalling pathways1,2. Defects in the formation or function of primary cilia are associated with a spectrum of human diseases and developmental abnormalities3. Genetic screens in model organisms have discovered core machineries of cilium assembly and maintenance4. However, regulatory molecules that coordinate the biogenesis of primary cilia with other cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, vesicle trafficking and cell–cell adhesion, remain to be identified. Here we report the results of a functional genomic screen using RNA interference (RNAi) to identify human genes involved in ciliogenesis control. The screen identified 36 positive and 13 negative ciliogenesis modulators, which include molecules involved in actin dynamics and vesicle trafficking. Further investigation demonstrated that blocking actin assembly facilitates ciliogenesis by stabilizing the pericentrosomal preciliary compartment (PPC), a previously uncharacterized compact vesiculotubular structure storing transmembrane proteins destined for cilia during the early phase of ciliogenesis. The PPC was labelled by recycling endosome markers. Moreover, knockdown of modulators that are involved in the endocytic recycling pathway affected the formation of the PPC as well as ciliogenesis. Our results uncover a critical regulatory step that couples actin dynamics and endocytic recycling with ciliogenesis, and also provides potential target molecules for future study."

https://openalex.org/W2015710217,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of genetic disease. Pathogenic mutations in mtDNA are detected in approximately 1 in 250 live births and at least 1 in 10,000 adults in the UK are affected by mtDNA disease. Treatment options for patients with mtDNA disease are extremely limited and are predominantly supportive in nature. Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted maternally and it has been proposed that nuclear transfer techniques may be an approach for the prevention of transmission of human mtDNA disease. Here we show that transfer of pronuclei between abnormally fertilized human zygotes results in minimal carry-over of donor zygote mtDNA and is compatible with onward development to the blastocyst stage in vitro. By optimizing the procedure we found the average level of carry-over after transfer of two pronuclei is less than 2.0%, with many of the embryos containing no detectable donor mtDNA. We believe that pronuclear transfer between zygotes, as well as the recently described metaphase II spindle transfer, has the potential to prevent the transmission of mtDNA disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2039013541,"Most heritable traits, including many human diseases, are caused by multiple loci. Studies in both humans and model organisms, such as yeast, have failed to detect a large fraction of the loci that underlie such complex traits. A lack of statistical power to identify multiple loci with small effects is undoubtedly one of the primary reasons for this problem. We have developed a method in yeast that allows the use of much larger sample sizes than previously possible and hence permits the detection of multiple loci with small effects. The method involves generating very large numbers of progeny from a cross between two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and then phenotyping and genotyping pools of these offspring. We applied the method to 17 chemical resistance traits and mitochondrial function, and identified loci for each of these phenotypes. We show that the level of genetic complexity underlying these quantitative traits is highly variable, with some traits influenced by one major locus and others by at least 20 loci. Our results provide an empirical demonstration of the genetic complexity of a number of traits and show that it is possible to identify many of the underlying factors using straightforward techniques. Our method should have broad applications in yeast and can be extended to other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2076034830,"Translation by the ribosome occurs by a complex mechanism involving the coordinated interaction of multiple nucleic acid and protein ligands. Here we use zero-mode waveguides (ZMWs) and sophisticated detection instrumentation to allow real-time observation of translation at physiologically relevant micromolar ligand concentrations. Translation at each codon is monitored by stable binding of transfer RNAs (tRNAs)—labelled with distinct fluorophores—to translating ribosomes, which allows direct detection of the identity of tRNA molecules bound to the ribosome and therefore the underlying messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence. We observe the transit of tRNAs on single translating ribosomes and determine the number of tRNA molecules simultaneously bound to the ribosome, at each codon of an mRNA molecule. Our results show that ribosomes are only briefly occupied by two tRNA molecules and that release of deacylated tRNA from the exit (E) site is uncoupled from binding of aminoacyl-tRNA site (A-site) tRNA and occurs rapidly after translocation. The methods outlined here have broad application to the study of mRNA sequences, and the mechanism and regulation of translation. Single-molecule studies allow biological processes to be examined one molecule at a time, as they occur. Here, Uemura et al. have utilized single-molecule approaches with a recently developed technique known as zero-mode waveguide detection, which concentrates reactions in zeptolitre-sized volumes (a zeptolitre is 10−21 litre) to examine real-time translocation by the ribosome. With this set-up, they are able to follow binding of tRNAs to the ribosome and find that tRNA release from the E and A sites is uncoupled. Single-molecule studies allow biological processes to be examined one molecule at a time, as they occur. Here, zero-mode waveguides have been used to concentrate reactions in zeptolitre-sized volumes, making it possible to study real-time translocation by the ribosome. The binding of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to the ribosome could be followed; the results show that tRNA release from the exit site is uncoupled from tRNA binding to the aminoacyl-tRNA site."
https://openalex.org/W2112262745,"Hereditary hypotrichosis simplex is a rare autosomal dominant form of hair loss characterized by hair follicle miniaturization. Using genetic linkage analysis, we mapped a new locus for the disease to chromosome 18p11.22, and identified a mutation (Leu9Arg) in the adenomatosis polyposis down-regulated 1 (APCDD1) gene in three families. We show that APCDD1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed in human hair follicles, and can interact in vitro with WNT3A and LRP5-two essential components of Wnt signalling. Functional studies show that APCDD1 inhibits Wnt signalling in a cell-autonomous manner and functions upstream of beta-catenin. Moreover, APCDD1 represses activation of Wnt reporters and target genes, and inhibits the biological effects of Wnt signalling during both the generation of neurons from progenitors in the developing chick nervous system, and axis specification in Xenopus laevis embryos. The mutation Leu9Arg is located in the signal peptide of APCDD1, and perturbs its translational processing from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. APCDD1(L9R) probably functions in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit the stability and membrane localization of the wild-type protein. These findings describe a novel inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway with an essential role in human hair growth. As APCDD1 is expressed in a broad repertoire of cell types, our findings indicate that APCDD1 may regulate a diversity of biological processes controlled by Wnt signalling."

Here, we show that this down-regulation extends to Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine release, as intestinal macrophages expressed TLR3–TLR9 but did not release cytokines in response to TLR-specific ligands. Likely contributing to this unique functional profile, intestinal macrophages expressed markedly down-regulated adapter proteins MyD88 and Toll interleukin receptor 1 domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon β, which together mediate all TLR MyD88-dependent and -independent NF-κB signaling, did not phosphorylate NF-κB p65 or Smad-induced IκBα, and did not translocate NF-κB into the nucleus.

The mechanisms underlying the inflammation anergy of intestinal macrophages in normal mucosa are not known. Here, we show that a high proportion of intestinal macrophages displayed TLR3, TLR5, and TLR7–9, and a small proportion expressed TLR4 and TLR6 but did not release pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to the corresponding TLR ligand. Moreover, intestinal macrophages did not express detectable MD-2 and could not respond to rough LPS, even in the presence of MD-2 expression via gene transfection, predicting a downstream block in the signal transduction pathways that regulate cytokine gene transcription. Confirming this prediction, intestinal macrophages expressed barely detectable levels of key proteins in the MyD88-dependent and -independent NF-κB signal pathway and expressed Smad-induced IκBα, the negative regulator of NF-κB, but they did not phosphorylate IκBα or NF-κB and did not translocate NF-κB into the nucleus. Furthermore, intestinal stroma-associated TGF-β profoundly inhibited NF-κB signaling and TLR-mediated cytokine release in blood monocytes, the exclusive source of intestinal macrophages. These findings indicate a mechanism in which stromal TGF-β-induced Smad signaling and dysregulation of NF-κB signal proteins mediate the differentiation of pro-inflammatory blood monocytes into inflammation anergic intestinal macrophages.

Using the human macrophage nucleofector kit (Amaxa), intestinal macrophages (7 × 105/100 μl of nucleofector solution) were transfected with 2 μg of pDUO-hMD-2/TLR4 (InvivoGen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of culture, the expression of MD-2 and TLR4 was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells (2 × 106) were stained with phycoerythrin-, allophycocyanin-, phycoerythrin-cyanin 5 (PE-Cy5)-, or FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to CD13, CD14, HLA-DR (BD Biosciences), TLR1–9 (eBiosciences), and MD-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control monoclonal antibodies of the same isotype and fluorochrome and analyzed by flow cytometry. For intracellular staining, cells were permeabilized prior to staining with the relevant antibodies and matching control monoclonal antibodies. Data were evaluated using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Supernatants of cells (2 × 106/ml) cultured for 24 h in the absence or presence of rough LPS (Salmonella minnesota R595; Alexis), smooth LPS (Salmonella abortus equi; Alexis), soluble CD14 (Alexis), or TLR1–9 ligands (Invitrogen) in the absence or presence of IFN-γ, anti-IL-10, or anti-IL-4 antibodies (R & D Systems) were analyzed for TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 and RANTES by ELISA (R & D Systems). TLR ligands included the following: TLR1, Pam3CSK4 (0.2 μg/ml); TLR2, heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (5 × 108 cells/ml); TLR3, poly(1:C) (25 μg/ml); TLR4, LPS (1 μg/ml); TLR5, Salmonella typhimurium flagellin (100 ng/ml); TLR6, FLS1 (Pam2CaDPKH PKSF) (10 ng/ml); TLR7, imiquimod (0.5 μg/ml); TLR8, SSRNA40 (0.5 μg/ml); and TLR9, ODN2006 (5 μm). Intestinal macrophages and autologous blood monocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) stimulated for 2 h (for IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α mRNA) or 12 h (for IL-10 and TGF-β mRNA) with smooth LPS (1 μg/ml) were harvested, and RNA was isolated (QIA RNeasy kit, Qiagen), and cDNA was generated from total RNA (transcriptor first strand cDNA synthesis kit, Roche Applied Science). Target genes were amplified in 25-μl mixtures containing TaqMan Universal PCR master mix and the following 6-carboxyfluorescein/dihydrocyclopyrroloindole tripeptide minor groove binder (FAM/MGB)-labeled primer-probe sets: IL-1β (assay ID Hs00174097_m1, Ref. Seq. NM_000576.2), IL-6 (Hs00985639_m1, Ref. Seq. NM_000600.2), IL-8 (Hs00174103_m1, Ref. Seq. NM_000584.2), and TNF-α (Hs00174128_m1, Ref. Seq. NM_000594.2), all from Applied Biosystems. All primers were chosen to span exon junctions and to exclude nonspecific amplification of genomic DNA. Expression of endogenous control gene 18 S rRNA (Ref. Seq. X03205.1) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ref. Seq. NM_002046.3) was determined simultaneously with VICTM/6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (VIC/TAMRA)-labeled primer probe sets in a multiplex PCR setup. Real time PCR was run for 40 cycles (15 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 60 °C) on a Chromo4 PCR system (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with Opticon MonitorTM software, version 3.1. Relative expression rates of target genes in unstimulated versus stimulated cells were calculated using the method of Pfaffl (15Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25872) Google Scholar). All PCRs were performed twice, once with each reference gene, and data are presented as the geometric mean of both reactions. Total cellular RNA was extracted (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) (16Sankaran S. George M.D. Reay E. Guadalupe M. Flamm J. Prindiville T. Dandekar S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) from intestinal macrophages, and autologous blood monocytes from two donors and cDNA were synthesized (Superscript Choice System, Invitrogen) utilizing an oligo(dT)24 primer. Biotinylated cRNA was synthesized using a BioArray HighYield RNA transcription labeling kit (ENZO Diagnostics) and purified through RNeasy nucleic acid columns. cRNA quality was evaluated by hybridization to Test3 GeneChips (Affymetrix), and only samples whose 3′:5′ ratios were less than three were utilized for subsequent hybridization to HuGene U95-AV2 GeneChips (Affymetrix). After scanning, fluorescence data were processed by the GeneChip operating system (version 1.1, Affymetrix). Background correction, normalization, generation of expression values, and analysis of differential gene expression were performed using dChip analysis software (DNA-Chip analyzer (dChip), version 1.3, Harvard University) in compliance with minimal information about microarray experiment (MIAME) guidelines (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Fold differences were calculated by comparing the fluorescence intensities of each probe set per gene on the array for intestinal macrophages to blood monocytes. A fold difference ≥2.0 plus p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. The Affymetrix GeneChip Operating System data files (*.cel. and *.chp) have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Cells (1 × 106) were incubated (37 °C) with smooth LPS (1 μg/ml), and at the indicated time cold PBS was added, and the cells were washed, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% saponin (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD Biosciences), stained with anti-p-NF-κB p65-FITC or anti-p-IκBα-FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data were evaluated with CellQuest. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 10 × 106 cells treated with smooth LPS (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C using the NE-PER kit (Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents, Pierce). NF-κB DNA binding was detected using the NF-κB transcription factor ELISA (Panomics, Inc.), based on the ability of activated NF-κB p50 to bind an NF-κB consensus binding site on a biotinylated oligonucleotide immobilized on streptavidin-coated wells in a 96-well plate. Bound NF-κB was detected by anti-NF-κB antibody (R & D Systems), and the signal was quantified by horseradish peroxidase-tetramethylbenzidine (HRP-TMB) binding at 450 nm using an EL800 ELISA reader (Biotek Instruments, Inc.). Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of S-CM (500 μg of protein/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, exposed to smooth LPS (1 μg/ml) for 1 h, fixed and permeabilized (20 min with Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD Biosciences), and washed (Cytoperm Buffer, BD Biosciences). After rinsing, cells were blocked with casein protein (DAKO) for 1 h and incubated with rabbit anti-NF-κB p65 antibodies (0.05 mg/ml) for 90 min (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or irrelevant antibody. Cells were washed, incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min, washed with PBS, and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (5 min) for the identification of nuclei. Cells were visualized by confocal microscopy, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence intensity of NF-κB was converted to histograms using IPLab software version 3.6 (BD Biosciences Bioimaging). Cells (10 × 106/ml) were pelleted, resuspended in cold RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), homogenized, incubated for 30 min, and supernatants collected by centrifugation, and protein levels were determined. Extracts were diluted in SDS sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and boiled for 3 min, and proteins were separated by acrylamide (12.5%) gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 (1 h at room temperature) and incubated with antibodies to MyD88, TRIF/TICAM, TRAF6, IκBα, p-IκBα, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad4, or Smad7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:2000 to 1:10,000 in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS/Tween 20, blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:50,000 in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20; 1 h at room temperature) and bands detected using the chemiluminescent method (SuperSignal West Dura, Thermo Scientific). Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-actin or anti-p53 antibodies (Calbiochem and kind gift of Dr. E. Benveniste, University of Alabama at Birmingham) to ensure equal loading on all gels. Data were analyzed by t test/Mann-Whitney U test, where appropriate. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless stated otherwise. Mononuclear phagocytes interact with LPS through CD14 and TLR4. CD14, which is present in membrane-bound and soluble forms, does not transduce the LPS signal, whereas TLR4 in association with the secreted protein MD-2 (TLR4-MD-2) does (17Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Smooth LPS, which contains the O-antigen side chain composed of oligosaccharide subunits, binds TLR4-MD-2 only in the presence of CD14 (CD14-dependent), leading to NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (18Jiang Z. Georgel P. Du X. Shamel L. Sovath S. Mudd S. Huber M. Kalis C. Keck S. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Beutler B. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In contrast, rough LPS, which lacks the O-antigen, can bind directly to TLR4-MD-2 and induces NF-κB activation through both CD14-independent and -dependent binding. We first investigated the response of intestinal macrophages to smooth LPS. Intestinal macrophages do not express CD14 (2Smith P.D. Smythies L.E. Mosteller-Barnum M. Sibley D.A. Russell M.W. Merger M. Sellers M.T. Orenstein J.M. Shimada T. Graham M.F. Kubagawa H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2651-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 3Smythies L.E. Sellers M. Clements R.H.

Orenstein J.M. Kearney J.F. Graham M.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the addition of sCD14 to cultures of intestinal macrophages did not induce the cells to produce IL-6 in the presence of smooth LPS (Fig. 1A). However, sCD14 enhanced inducible cytokine release by monocytes and was required for cytokine release by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). Intestinal macrophages, unlike autologous monocytes, exposed to increasing concentrations of rough LPS also produced no detectable TNF-α (Fig. 1B). Helicobacter pylori urease, which we have shown induces cytokine production by monocytes through an LPS-independent mechanism (19Mai U.E. Perez-Perez G.I. Wahl L.M. Wahl S.M. Blaser M.J. Smith P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), also induced no detectable TNF-α from intestinal macrophages but induced abundant TNF-α from blood monocytes (Fig. 1B). As an additional control, we also determined the ability of monocyte-derived macrophages cultured for 1, 2, and 5 days to release TNF-α after stimulation with rough LPS, smooth LPS, or flagellin (the ligand for TLR5). Monocyte-derived macrophages released progressively lower levels of TNF-α over this time course, but even on day 5 the cells released large amounts of inducible TNF-α compared with unstimulated cells (p < 0.01) (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, monocyte-derived macrophages do not acquire the inflammation anergy characteristic of intestinal macrophages, even after 5 days of culture, unlike monocytes cultured in the presence of normal S-CM over the same period (3Smythies L.E. Sellers M. Clements R.H. Mosteller-Barnum M. Meng G. Benjamin W.H. Orenstein J.M. Smith P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, untreated intestinal macrophages spontaneously expressed manyfold lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (265-fold; p < 0.01), IL-6 (3.7-fold; p < 0.09), IL-8 (182-fold; p < 0.03), TNF-α (17-fold; p < 0.24), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β (26-fold; p < 0.03), but expressed equivalent levels of IL-10 (p < 0.05), compared with untreated monocytes, from the same donors (Fig. 1C, left panel). In addition, LPS-treated intestinal macrophages displayed a profound inability to up-regulate cytokine gene expression for IL-1β (p < 0.02), IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p < 0.05), TNF-α (p < 0.02), IL-10 (p < 0.03), and TGF-β (p < 0.003) compared with LPS-stimulated monocytes (Fig. 1C, right panel). Thus, intestinal macrophages do not respond to either smooth LPS, even in the presence of sCD14, or rough LPS, indicating that intestinal macrophages either do not express TLR4 and/or MD-2 or have aberrant downstream signaling in the NF-κB activation pathway. Consistent with our previous finding that intestinal macrophages do not express CD14 protein or mRNA (2Smith P.D. Smythies L.E. Mosteller-Barnum M. Sibley D.A. Russell M.W. Merger M. Sellers M.T. Orenstein J.M. Shimada T. Graham M.F. Kubagawa H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2651-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 3Smythies L.E. Sellers M. Clements R.H. Mosteller-Barnum M. Meng G. Benjamin W.H. Orenstein J.M. Smith P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), intestinal macrophages expressed reduced mRNA levels of transcription factors involved in CD14 promoter activation, including CEPBα, CEPBβ (p < 0.03), and Sp1, compared with autologous blood monocytes (Fig. 2A). These findings implicate down-regulation of CD14 expression in intestinal macrophages at the level of the CD14 promoter. In addition, intestinal macrophages expressed low levels of TLR4 protein (Fig. 2B), in keeping with our earlier report that they express TLR4 transcripts (2Smith P.D. Smythies L.E. Mosteller-Barnum M. Sibley D.A. Russell M.W. Merger M. Sellers M.T. Orenstein J.M. Shimada T. Graham M.F. Kubagawa H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2651-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but did not express detectable MD-2 protein or mRNA (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2B), even after stimulation (p < 0.04) (data not shown). Importantly, monocyte-derived macrophages cultured for up to 5 days in vitro did not acquire the phenotype of intestinal macrophages (supplemental Fig. 1B). Moreover, TLR4-MD-2-transfected intestinal macrophages, 4% of which expressed both TLR4 and MD-2 (Fig. 2C, inset, and supplemental Fig. 2), did not release detectable levels of inducible TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-8 in response to rough LPS (Fig. 2C, left panel). In contrast, control intestinal macrophages spiked with 4% monocytes (as well as HEK293 cells transfected to express TLR4 and MD-2, data not shown) produced substantial levels of cytokine following LPS exposure (Fig. 2C, right panel). To establish whether the inflammation anergy of intestinal macrophages extends to other TLR-specific ligands, we characterized primary intestinal macrophages for TLR expression and TLR-mediated cytokine responses. Intestinal macrophages expressed TLR3 and TLR5–9 comparable with (or greater than) the expression levels for autologous blood monocytes (Fig. 3A and Table 1), yet did not release detectable TNF-α, IFN-α, IL-8, and IL-10 (Fig. 3B) or IL-1, IL-6, or IFN-β in response to TLR-specific ligands in the presence or absence of IFN-γ, anti-IL-10, or anti-IL-4 antibodies (data not shown). In sharp contrast, autologous blood monocytes stimulated with the same ligands released large amounts of TNF-α, IFN-α via poly(I-C) stimulation of TLR3 (Fig. 3B, upper panel inset), IL-8, and IL-10 (Fig. 3B), as well as IL-1 and IL-6 (data not shown). Thus, compared with blood monocytes, intestinal macrophages are profoundly and globally down-regulated for the production of an array of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. Because TLR1–9 (excluding TLR3) share the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, whereas TLR3 and TLR4 signal through a MyD88-independent pathway involving the adapter protein TRIF, we next determined whether the inflammation anergy of intestinal macrophages is due to dysregulated NF-κB activation pathways.TABLE 1TLR expression by human intestinal macrophages and autologous blood monocytesTLRIntestinal macrophagesBlood monocytespMeanaMean percentage of positive cells (n = 6) is shown.S.E.MeanS.E.TLR11.420.481.150.030.29TLR21.080.0486.351.720.001TLR379.92967.111.280.165TLR45.81.7621.34.320.0001TLR545.212.2848.110.680.422TLR617.24.126.32.520.022TLR739.115.893.14.960.015TLR863.918.958.113.50.405TLR959.313.2871.8815.320.242a Mean percentage of positive cells (n = 6) is shown. Open table in a new tab To determine whether the inability of intestinal macrophages to release inducible cytokines was due to ineffective translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus where it binds to target promoters, we first examined intestinal macrophages and autologous blood monocytes for phosphorylated NF-κB (p-NF-κB p65). Intestinal macrophages did not express constitutive or LPS-inducible p-NF-κB p65 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, NF-κB was rapidly phosphorylated in LPS-stimulated blood monocytes, achieving within 5 min maximal expression that was maintained for up to 30 min (Fig. 4A). We next examined intestinal macrophages and autologous blood monocytes for the ability to translocate cytoplasmic NF-κB into the nucleus. Cells were treated with LPS, and cytoplasmic and nuclear preparations were monitored for p50. Blood monocytes displayed a progressive increase in nuclear NF-κB p50, whereas intestinal macrophage nuclear levels of NF-κB p50 did not change after exposure to LPS (Fig. 4B). Moreover, nuclear NF-κB p50 levels were significantly lower in intestinal macrophages compared with blood monocytes at each time point (p < 0.006). These findings indicate that intestinal macrophages neither activate NF-κB nor translocate NF-κB into the nucleus in response to bacterial LPS. We next investigated whether the inability of intestinal macrophages to activate NF-κB was due to dysfunctional elements in the NF-κB activation pathway.

PARP-1 attaches ADP-ribose units to target proteins, including itself as a post-translational modification that can change the biochemical properties of target proteins and mediate recruitment of proteins to sites of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis. Independent of its catalytic activity, PARP-1 binds to chromatin and promotes compaction affecting RNA polymerase II transcription. PARP-1 has a modular structure composed of six independent domains. Two homologous zinc fingers, Zn1 and Zn2, form the DNA-binding module. Zn1-Zn2 binding to DNA breaks triggers catalytic activity. Recently, we have identified a third zinc binding domain in PARP-1, the Zn3 domain, which is essential for DNA-dependent PARP-1 activity. The crystal structure of the Zn3 domain revealed a novel zinc-ribbon fold and a homodimeric Zn3 structure that formed in the crystal lattice. Structure-guided mutagenesis was used here to investigate the roles of these two features of the Zn3 domain. Our results indicate that the zinc-ribbon fold of the Zn3 domain mediates an interdomain contact crucial to assembly of the DNA-activated conformation of PARP-1. In contrast, residues located at the Zn3 dimer interface are not required for DNA-dependent activation but rather make important contributions to the chromatin compaction activity of PARP-1.

Using NAD+ as a donor, PARP-1 can polymerize multiple units of ADP-ribose to create long and branched polymers termed poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). This post-translational modification can change the biochemical properties and cellular location of acceptor proteins. The main substrate of PARP-1 in the cell is PARP-1 itself (automodification activity), although PARP-1 also ADP-ribosylates various substrates, including core histones, histone H1, and transcription regulatory proteins (3Poirier G.G. de Murcia G.

Thus, PARP-1 acts as an early responder to DNA damage that can influence the kinetics of DNA repair by recruiting repair factors and imparting local changes in chromatin structure. PARP-1 involvement in DNA repair has made it a promising drug target in the treatment of cancer (19Helleday T. Petermann E. Lundin C. Hodgson B. Sharma R.A. Nat. Rev.

PARP-1 is a modular protein of 114 kDa (human) containing multiple independent domains that perform distinct functions (Fig. 1A). Two homologous zinc fingers, Zn1 and Zn2, at the extreme N terminus of PARP-1 are responsible for binding to DNA strand breaks, which dramatically stimulates PARP-1 activity (23Gradwohl G. Ménissier de Murcia J.M. Molinete M. Simonin F. Koken M. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 24Ikejima M.

An internal automodification domain contains a BRCA1 C-terminal fold involved in mediating protein-protein interactions and three lysines that are targeted for automodification (13Masson M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain (CAT) is located at the extreme C terminus of PARP-1. DNA binding studies using a Zn1-Zn2 domain fragment indicate that PARP-1 binds to DNA as a dimer (27Pion E. Ullmann G.M. Amé J.C. Gérard D. de Murcia G. Bombarda E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14670-14681Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and kinetic analysis of PARP-1 activity indicates that PARP-1 is a catalytic dimer (28Mendoza-Alvarez H. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22575-22580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, dimerization of PARP-1 molecules is thought to be a critical step in DNA-dependent PARP-1 activation (29Bauer P.I. Buki K.G. Hakam A. Kun E. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is not established how other PARP-1 domains are involved in DNA-dependent activation. We identified and determined the crystal structure of the novel Zn3 zinc binding domain located between the Zn1 and Zn2 zinc fingers and the automodification domain of PARP-1 (Fig. 1, A and B) (30Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Zn3 domain is critically required for DNA-dependent PARP-1 activity (30Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Tao Z. Gao P. Hoffman D.W. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5804-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Zn3 domain structure consists of a unique type of zinc-ribbon fold and an α-helical N-terminal region (Fig. 1B). Importantly, the structure is entirely unrelated to the Zn1 and Zn2 domain structures and is therefore expected to have a distinct function. Zinc-ribbon folds frequently mediate protein-protein interactions (32Gamsjaeger R. Liew C.K. Loughlin F.E. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar); therefore, this is a likely role for the zinc-ribbon fold of the Zn3 domain. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal tail of the Zn3 domain forms an extensive interface between two Zn3 monomers that are related by 2-fold crystallographic symmetry (Fig. 1C). Although the isolated Zn3 domain is a monomer in solution, conserved residues are involved in forming the Zn3 homodimer interface. This led us to suggest that the Zn3 domain might exist as a dimer in the DNA-activated state of PARP-1. Current models indicate that PARP-1 functions as a catalytic dimer; therefore, it was speculated that the Zn3 dimer might participate in assembling two molecules of PARP-1 for activation. Notably, a recent NMR study reported a monomeric structure of the Zn3 domain in which the C-terminal tail interacts with the N-terminal helical region (31Tao Z. Gao P. Hoffman D.W. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5804-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), rather than forming the homodimer contacts observed in the x-ray structure. It is therefore possible that the Zn3 domain can adopt two conformational states, which might have functional relevance in the context of full-length PARP-1. To better define the role of the PARP-1 Zn3 domain, we have created 23 structure-guided mutations in both the zinc-ribbon fold of the Zn3 domain and the region forming the Zn3 dimer interface in the crystal structure. Biochemical analysis of the PARP-1 mutants indicates that the zinc-ribbon fold of the Zn3 domain is essential for DNA-dependent activity of PARP-1, but it is not required for basal PARP-1 activity in the absence of DNA. Point mutations located on one face of an extended loop of the zinc-ribbon fold drastically affect the catalytic turnover of the DNA-dependent PAR synthesis reaction (kcat), without altering the affinity for NAD+ (Km) or the DNA binding affinity (KD). We suggest that the zinc-ribbon fold of the Zn3 domain is essential for the assembly of an activated enzyme upon PARP-1 binding to DNA. In contrast to mutation of the zinc-ribbon fold, mutation of residues located at the crystallographic Zn3 dimer interface does not affect the catalytic activity of PARP-1, indicating that this interface does not play a role in activating PARP-1. Interestingly, a number of these Zn3 mutations are deficient in their ability to compact chromatin structure, revealing that the Zn3 domain contributes to the ability of PARP-1 to modulate chromatin structure. Thus, two distinct functions for the Zn3 of PARP-1 have been identified and mapped to two different structural regions of the Zn3 domain. Full-length wild-type (WT) PARP-1 (residues 1–1014) and mutants and PARP-1 ΔZn3 (deletion of residues 215–374) were cloned in the pET28 expression vector with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The WT PARP-1 Zn3 domain (residues 216–366) and the W318R mutant Zn3 domain constructs were cloned in the pET24 expression vector with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag as described previously (30Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All mutations and deletions were performed using the QuickChange Protocol (Stratagene) and verified by automated sequencing (Kimmel Cancer Center). PARP-1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)Rosetta2 (Novagen). Cells were grown in LB media containing 100 μm ZnSO4 and induced with 200 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C for 20 h. Cells were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (and other protease inhibitors) and lysed using a cell disrupter (Avestin). Cell debris was pelleted for 2 h at 40,000 × g, and the supernatant was then filtered and loaded onto a 5-ml HP-chelating column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni(II) and preequilibrated in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. The column was washed in three consecutive steps with lysis buffer containing the following: 1) 20 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl; 2) 20 mm imidazole, 1 m NaCl; and 3) 20 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 400 mm imidazole (500 mm NaCl), diluted to the appropriate salt concentration (see below), and then loaded onto a 5-ml HP heparin column (GE Healthcare). For full-length WT PARP-1 and mutants and ΔZn3 PARP-1, the heparin column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm TCEP, and 1 mm EDTA, and eluted with a gradient from 250 mm to 1 m NaCl. For WT and W318R Zn3 domains, the heparin column was equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl, and the elution gradient was from 50 to 500 mm NaCl. Full-length WT and most mutants (see below for exceptions), ΔZn3 PARP-1, and WT and W318R Zn3 domains were next passed over a Sephacryl S200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm TCEP, and 0.1 mm EDTA. In the case of mutants Q241L, F357Y, L348D/V350D, and P358G/P359G, proteins were dialyzed in gel filtration buffer after elution from the heparin column. PARP-1 automodification reactions were performed essentially as described previously (30Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). WT PARP-1 and mutants (0.62 μm) were first preincubated with 1 μm duplex DNA for 10 min at room temperature (22 °C). 5 mm NAD+ was then added to the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for various times. In the complementation experiments, ΔZn3 PARP-1 (0.62 μm), the Zn3 domain (0.62 μm), full-length E988A (0.31 μm), and W318R (0.31 μm) were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to DNA addition. NAD+ was then added, and the reactions were allowed to proceed for 1- and 10-min time points. In each experiment, reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-loading buffer containing 0.1 m EDTA. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE (gel percentages listed in figure legends) and stained with Imperial protein stain (Pierce). WT PARP-1 and mutants (0.5 μm) were preincubated with 1 μm DNA for 10 min at room temperature. 0.2 μm radiolabeled 32P-NAD+ (0.16 μCi) or 0.2 μm unlabeled NAD+ was added for the indicated time points. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-loading buffer containing 0.1 m EDTA. The samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was either treated with Imperial protein stain (Pierce) when unlabeled NAD+ was used or exposed on a phosphorimager screen and read on a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare) when radiolabeled NAD+ was used. An 18-nucleotide DNA strand (5′-GGGTTGCGGCCGCTTGGG-3′) was annealed to a complementary 18-nucleotide DNA strand that carried a fluorescein derivative (6-carboxyfluorescein) on the 5′ terminus. The binding reactions were performed in 12 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 0.12 mm EDTA, 5.5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, and 4% glycerol. Reactions contained 5 nm DNA probe and various concentrations of protein. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence polarization data were collected on a Victor3V plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The observed binding constant was obtained from a nonlinear least squares fit to the data using a two-state binding model (SigmaPlot). The kinetics of PARP-1 automodification were analyzed using a colorimetric assay that measures the incorporation of biotinylated NAD+ (bNAD+, 6-biotin-17-NAD) into polymers of ADP-ribose (PAR). bNAD+ serves as a substrate for PARP-1 (33Zhang J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); therefore, the amount of biotin in PAR is proportional to the amount of PAR synthesized. All steps of the assay were performed at 22 °C. Histidine-tagged PARP-1 proteins were immobilized on Ni2+-chelating plates (5 PRIME) in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 18 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, and 10 μg/ml BSA. 20 nm PARP-1 was used in DNA-dependent reactions (40 nm of 18-bp duplex), and 60 nm PARP-1 was used in DNA-independent reactions. Reactions were initiated by the addition of NAD+ at various concentrations (15–1000 μm). The ratio of NAD+ to bNAD+ was 99:1; therefore, 1000 μm NAD+ is 990 μm NAD+ and 10 μm bNAD+ (bNAD+ from Trevigen). Reactions were quenched by the addition of 150 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (4.5 m final concentration). The reaction wells were washed three times with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% BSA (PBS/BSA). Streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) was added to each reaction for a 30-min incubation (1:20,000 dilution or 1:12,000 dilution in PBS/BSA, for DNA-dependent and DNA-independent, respectively). Reaction wells were then washed three times with PBS/BSA. 75 μl of the streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase substrate Ultra-TMB (Pierce) was added to each reaction well, and this reaction was quenched with 75 μl of 2 n sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was read on a Victor3V (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); the absorbance at 550 nm (A550) was subtracted from the A450 reading to account for nonuniform variations in the plastic plates. A biotinylated, histidine-tagged peptide (biotin-Ser-Trp-His-His-His-His-His-His-His-His) of known concentration was immobilized on the Ni2+ plate and served as a standard for converting the A450 reading into a quantity of biotin. The amount of ADP-ribose was then estimated as 100 times the amount of biotin, following the 99:1 ratio of NAD+ to bNAD+. A background A450 reading was performed for each NAD+ concentration in the absence of PARP-1 to account for nonspecific binding of bNAD+ and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase to the reaction well. Time points in the linear portion of the reaction profile were measured for each NAD+ concentration to provide initial rates. Initial rates were plotted versus total NAD+ concentration (supplemental Fig. S1), and fitting the Michaelis-Menten model to the data yielded Km (μm) and Vmax values (μmol/min/mg). Vmax was divided by the molecular weight of PARP-1 (115,000 g/mol) to calculate kcat (s−1). The kinetic parameters presented in Table 1 represent the average of three independent experiments.TABLE 1Kinetic analysis of the PARP-1 automodification reactionKmVmaxkcatμm(μmol·min−1·mg−1)s−1DNA-dependent PARP-1 automodification activity Wild type86.5 ± 39.02.58 ± 0.844.95 ± 1.61 T316A79.1 ± 25.80.011 ± 0.00370.022 ± 0.007 W318R31.4 ± 17.50.0018 ± 0.00110.0035 ± 0.0022DNA-independent PARP-1 automodification activity Wild type109.5 ± 31.30.00148 ± 0.000280.00284 ± 0.00054 T316A51.7 ± 13.30.000879 ± 0.000180.00169 ± 0.00034 W318R94.8 ± 51.00.000552 ± 0.000380.00106 ± 0.00073 Open table in a new tab Chromatin assembly was performed using recombinant ACF, as described previously (8Wacker D.A.

An ∼3.2-kb DNA plasmid (pERE, a plasmid containing four tandem estrogen response elements upstream of the adenovirus E4 core promoter (35Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar)) was assembled into chromatin using purified native Drosophila core histones, Acf-1, ISWI, and human NAP-1, under conditions described previously (8Wacker D.A. Ruhl D.D. Balagamwala E.H. Hope K.M. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7475-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The assembly reaction was incubated for 2.5 h at 27 °C. ACF-assembled chromatin (30-μl aliquots containing 150 ng of DNA) was incubated without or with PARP-1 or PARP-1 mutant (33, 66, or 132 nm) for 30 min at 27 °C. We then added 5 μl of MNase (5 milliunits; United States Biochemical Corp.) and incubated the samples for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were deproteinized with proteinase K and phenol/chloroform extraction. The deproteinized samples were run on a 1.3% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. All MNase assays were run a minimum of three times to ensure reproducibility. In vitro transcription assays with ACF-assembled chromatin were performed as described previously (8Wacker D.A. Ruhl D.D. Balagamwala E.H. Hope K.M. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7475-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The chromatin (15-μl aliquots containing 75 ng of DNA) was incubated with or without 40 nm WT PARP-1 or mutant, 300 μm ATP, and 300 μm NAD+ as indicated for 30 min at 27 °C. Next, 10 nm estrogen receptor α (ERα) and 100 nm 17β-estradiol were added as indicated, followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature. These samples were preincubated for 15 min with HeLa cell nuclear extract as a source of the polymerase II transcriptional machinery and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C after addition of rNTPs to allow transcription to occur. The synthesized RNA was analyzed using primer extension, followed by separation on an 8% urea-polyacrylamide gel with autoradiographic analysis. Quantification was performed using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) with ImageQuant software. All reactions were performed in duplicate, and at least three independent experiments were performed to ensure reproducibility. Structure-based mutagenesis was used to study the role of the Zn3 domain of PARP-1. Two defining regions of the Zn3 domain revealed by the x-ray crystal structure were the focus of site-directed mutagenesis experiments of full-length PARP-1, the zinc ribbon fold and the Zn3 dimer interface. The first region of interest (residue 290 to 332) forms a zinc-binding motif reminiscent of a zinc-ribbon fold (Fig. 2A) (30Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Tao Z. Gao P. Hoffman D.W. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5804-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Zinc-ribbon folds are often involved in mediating protein-protein interactions (32Gamsjaeger R. Liew C.K. Loughlin F.E. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A unique aspect of the Zn3 zinc-ribbon fold is a large loop that extends from the Zn3 domain structure (amino acid residues 314–320, Fig. 2A; Fig. 1B, “extended loop”). We have previously suggested that the Zn3 domain is important for mediating an interdomain contact that is critical for PARP-1 DNA-dependent activity (30Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This was based on the fact that a fragment, including the first three zinc fingers (Zn1-Zn2-Zn3; residues 1–366), could restore DNA-dependent activity of a BRCA1 C-terminal WGR-CAT fragment of PARP-1 (residues 379–1014), whereas a fragment lacking the Zn3 domain could not (Zn1-Zn2; residues 1–234), despite having a robust affinity for DNA. Thus, deletion of the Zn3 domain dramatically compromises PARP-1 activity without compromising DNA binding affinity (30Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Tao Z. Gao P. Hoffman D.W. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5804-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Previous mutagenesis experiments targeting the Zn3 domain are likely to have disrupted the fold of the Zn3 domain (30Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36Trucco C. Flatter E. Fribourg S. de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and therefore are comparable with a deletion mutant, which does not provide insights into the importance of particular regions of the Zn3 structure. Here, mutagenesis was focused on the extended loop of the Zn3 domain (residues 314–320) that is formed of well conserved surface-exposed residues that could likely be involved in domain-domain interactions important for PARP-1 activity but are not likely to be important for the fold and stability of the Zn3 domain. Single-point alanine mutants of full-length PARP-1 were created for each residue of the extended loop from Asp-314 to Lys-320; residue Ala-317 was substituted with a glycine and a serine (Fig. 2A). Each of the mutants was first tested in a DNA-dependent automodification assay (Fig. 2B). In this assay, PARP-1 automodification was assessed by monitoring a shift in mobility on SDS-PAGE upon PAR addition to the PARP-1 polypeptide. The majority of the single-point mutants of the extended loop showed an activity level comparable with WT PARP-1. However, the T316A and the W318A mutants were severely deficient in automodification activity as compared with WT PARP-1. A slight shift in mobility was visible after 10 min of incubation for the T316A mutant, although the W318A mutant had no detectable activity in th"

An α2-selective cardiac glycoside could provide important insights into physiological and pharmacological properties of α2. The isoform selectivity of a large number of cardiac glycosides has been assessed utilizing α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1 isoforms of human Na,K-ATPase expressed in Pichia pastoris and the purified detergent-soluble isoform proteins.

By contrast, ouabain shows moderate selectivity (≈2.5-fold) for α1 over α2 (KD α1 ≤ α3 < α2). Binding affinities for the three isoforms of digoxigenin, digitoxigenin, and all other aglycones tested are indistinguishable (KD α1 = α3 = α2), showing that the sugar determines isoform selectivity. Selectivity patterns for inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity of the purified isoform proteins are consistent with binding selectivities, modified somewhat by different affinities of K+ ions for antagonizing cardiac glycoside binding on the three isoforms. The mechanistic insight on the role of the sugars is strongly supported by a recent structure of Na,K-ATPase with bound ouabain, which implies that aglycones of cardiac glycosides cannot discriminate between isoforms.

However, digoxin is now less used than in the past due to the narrow therapeutic window and drug toxicity. Cardiac glycosides are produced in mammals as well as plants. As reviewed recently (1Schoner W. Scheiner-Bobis G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C509-C536Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) five different cardiac glycosides have been identified in mammalian tissues including the cardenolides ouabain and digoxin and the bufadienolides marinobufagenin, telocinobufagin, and 19-norbufalin. Cardiac glycosides inhibit Na,K-ATPase and control cellular Na+ and K+ gradients and also activate cellular signaling pathways that mediate control of gene expression and tissue growth (2Xie Z. Askari A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2434-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 3Li Z. Xie Z. Pflugers Arch. 2009; 457: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, a multiplicity of physiological functions could be affected by the multiplicity of endogenous cardiac glycosides, but this is not well understood (1Schoner W. Scheiner-Bobis G. Am. J. Physiol.

The Na,K-ATPase consists of both α and β subunits, including four isoforms of α (α1, α2, α3, α4) and three isoforms of β (β1, β2, β3) (6Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar) and FXYD (1Schoner W. Scheiner-Bobis G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C509-C536Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 2Xie Z.

Physiol. 2006; 68: 431-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). α1 is almost ubiquitously distributed, whereas other isoforms are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific fashion. α2 is found mainly in muscle (skeletal, smooth, and cardiac), α3 is found primarily in nervous tissue, and α4 is found only in testicles. Human heart expresses α1, α2, and α3 isoforms and β1 (8Sweadner K.J. Herrera V.L. Amato S. Moellmann A. Gibbons D.K. Repke K.R. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes α2 is concentrated in the T-tubules adjacent to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), 2The abbreviations used are: SRsarcoplasmic reticulumC12E8octaethylene glycerol mondodecyl etherSOPS1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phosphor-l-serine]CGcardiac glycosideBPblood pressureMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. whereas α1 is more evenly distributed in T-tubules and SR (9Berry R.G. Despa S. Fuller W. Bers D.M. Shattock M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 73: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle and brain astrocytes, α1 is uniformly distributed, but α2 and α3 show a punctuated distribution, overlying the SR (10Juhaszova M. Blaustein M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). sarcoplasmic reticulum octaethylene glycerol mondodecyl ether 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phosphor-l-serine] cardiac glycoside blood pressure 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Increased force of contraction of cardiac muscle induced by cardiac glycosides is the result of inhibition of Na,K-ATPase. Raised intracellular Na+ concentration limits Ca2+ extrusion via the 3Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, leading to enhanced Ca2+ uptake into the SR by the Ca-ATPase and increased calcium-induced calcium release during excitation-contraction coupling. Cardiac glycoside-induced toxicity is associated with excessive inhibition of Na,K-ATPase, accumulation of Ca2+ ions (i.e.“calcium overload”), and “spontaneous” SR Ca2+ release that can trigger delayed after-depolarizations and cardiac arrhythmias (11Bers D.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2008; 70: 23-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Experiments with mice engineered to have ouabain-sensitive α1 and insensitive α2 isoforms (α1S/Sα2R/R) or ouabain-insensitive α1 and α2 (α1R/Rα2R/R) instead of the wild type with ouabain-insensitive α1 and ouabain-sensitive α2 (α1R/Rα2S/S) have shown that α2 can play a predominant role in cardiac glycoside-induced positive inotropy (12Dostanic-Larson I. Lorenz J.N. Van Huysse J.W. Neumann J.C. Moseley A.E. Lingrel J.B. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R524-R528Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and also that α2 carries a large fraction of the Na,K-pump current in T-tubules of cardiac myocytes (13Despa S. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C321-C327Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Very recent work shows that α2 preferentially modulates Ca2+ transients and SR Ca2+ release in cardiac myocytes compared with α1 (14Despa S. Wu Y. Lingrel J.B. Stefani E. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 2010; 98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similarly, α2 plays an important role in contractility of vascular smooth muscle and control of blood pressure (15Blaustein M.P. Zhang J. Chen L. Hamilton B.P. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R514-R523Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Zhang J. Lee M.Y. Cavalli M. Chen L. Berra-Romani R. Balke C.W. Bianchi G. Ferrari P. Hamlyn J.M. Iwamoto T. Lingrel J.B.

Experiments with α1S/Sα2R/R, α1R/Rα2S/S, and α1R/Rα2R/R mice also provide strong evidence for endogenous mammalian cardiac glycosides by showing differential responses to physiological stimuli and states that alter blood pressure (12Dostanic-Larson I. Lorenz J.N. Van Huysse J.W. Neumann J.C. Moseley A.E. Lingrel J.B. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2006; 290: R524-R528Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Lingrel J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In view of the accumulated information on α1 and α2 isoforms, one could envisage that α2-selective cardiac glycosides could provide important insights into the physiological role of α2 and, in particular, complement the information obtained from genetically engineered mice. At the pharmacological level an α2-selective cardiac glycoside could induce cardiac contraction with minimal Ca2+ overload and so act as a safer cardiotonic agent than conventional cardiac glycosides. Structure-activity analyses of inhibition of Na,K-ATPase by cardiac glycosides or displacement of bound [3H]ouabain have been conducted for many years; see for example Refs. 18Schönfeld W. Weiland J.

As summarized in Ref. 23Forbush B. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1983; 19: 167-201Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, essential structural features of active cardiac glycosides include rings A/B and C/D that are cis-fused and B/C rings that are trans-fused, a hydroxyl group at C14, and an unsaturated lactone attached at C17 of the steroid. The sugar at C3 of the steroid is not essential for inhibition but strongly affects binding affinity and rates; see Table 1B and Ref 23Forbush B. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1983; 19: 167-201Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar. Despite the great potential interest in isoform selectivity of cardiac glycosides, there is little clear-cut information. Variations in potency of digitoxigenin monoglycosides as inhibitors of kidney (α1β1) and brain (α1, α2, α3) Na,K-ATPases were attributed to isoform selectivity, and a role of the sugar was proposed (24From A.H. Fullerton D.S. Ahmed K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 94: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, most native tissues except kidney (α1β1) contain mixtures of isoforms, and it is difficult to differentiate interactions of cardiac glycosides with the individual isoforms and exclude possible complicating factors. Because, for example, human cardiac membranes express α1, α2, and α3 isoforms (8Sweadner K.J. Herrera V.L. Amato S. Moellmann A. Gibbons D.K. Repke K.R. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), healthy cardiac tissue would not be useful for this purpose even if it was readily available. Individual human isoforms have been expressed in Xenopus oocytes (α1–3, β1–3) (25Crambert G. Hasler U. Beggah A.T. Yu C. Modyanov N.N. Horisberger J.D. Lelièvre L. Geering K. J. Biol.

This system permits accurate analysis of cardiac glycoside binding and inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity of the individual human isoforms, leading to the finding that several digitalis glycosides show moderate but highly significant selectivity for α2 (and α3) compared with α1.TABLE 1Binding constants of Cardiac Glycosides to P.

Expression of the Na,K-ATPase was induced by adding 0.5% methanol daily for 5 days at 25 °C for a1β1 and a3β1 and at 20 °C for a2β1 clones (30Lifshitz Y. Petrovich E. Haviv H. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M.

Cells were collected, washed, and broken with glass beads, and membranes were prepared as described (31Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

Membranes were stored at −80 °C in a solution containing 10 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.4, and 25% glycerol with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, chemostatin, and leupeptin). About 2 g of membrane protein was obtained per 100 g of cells. Procedures for solubilization of membranes in n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, binding to BD-Talon beads, and washing and elution of purified Na,K-ATPase have been described in detail (28Cohen E.

The three purified isoform complexes (0.3–0.5 mg/ml) were eluted from the BD-Talon beads in a solution containing 170 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tricine·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml C12E8, 0.05 mg/ml SOPS, 0.01 mg/ml cholesterol, 25% glycerol. The proteins were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined with BCA (B9643 Sigma). [3H]Ouabain binding to yeast membranes (200–300 μg of protein) was assayed at 37 °C for 1 h in medium containing 10 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm vanadate-Tris, 1 mm EGTA-Tris (32Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jørgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Binding of ouabain or competitive displacement by other cardiac glycosides was assessed by varying the total concentrations of ouabain or other cardiac glycosides at constant [3H]ouabain (between 1 and 2 nm; specific activity 30–40 Ci/mmol). Full curves of bound versus free ouabain were generated, and KD values were estimated using a one-site model B = Bmax [Ouf]/([Ouf] + KD), where [Ouf] refers to the concentration of free ouabain, and B and Bmax have their usual meaning. Fitted dissociation constants, KD, were obtained using Kaleidagraph. For other inhibitors K0.5 was calculated using a one-site inhibition model, B/BCG=0 = K0.5/([CG] + K0.5). B refers to the [3H]ouabain bound at a particular concentration of the cardiac glycoside (CG), and BCG=0 refers to the [3H]ouabain bound at 1–2 nm [3H]ouabain in the absence of other cardiac glycosides. The KD CG was calculated from K0.5 by taking into account ouabain-CG competition as KD CG = K0.5/(1+[Ouf]/ KD Ou). With KD Ou values α1β1 9.2 nm, α2β1 21.5 nm, and α3β1 11 nm, respectively (see Table 1), and 1 nm total ouabain, the values of 1 + [Ouf]/KD Ou were 1.06, 1.03, and 1.06, respectively. Binding of each cardiac glycoside was estimated in 3–5 separate experiments. Average KD values ± S.E. for each isoform were calculated, and statistical significance was calculated by the unpaired Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. The selectivity ratios KD α1/KD α2 and KD α1/KD α3 were calculated as the quotient of the individual KD values. The error of the ratios of KD α1/ KD α2 and KD α1/ KD α3 are calculated from the S.E. KD values using the formula S.E. KDα1KDα2/3=(KDα1KDα2/3⋅ S.E. α2/3)2+S.E.α12KDα2/3(Eq. 1) Digoxin binding was measured in the same conditions as ouabain ([3H]digoxin ∼7 nm stock, specific activity 40 Ci/mmol). Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity of the detergent-soluble α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1 complexes by cardiac glycosides was done as described (29Haviv H. Cohen E. Lifshitz Y. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12855-12867Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Lifshitz Y. Petrovich E. Haviv H. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Garty H. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 14937-14950Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Before assay, the proteins were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The inhibitors were added to the recombinant enzyme (≈0.08–0.2 μg of protein) in 400 μl of reaction medium containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm histidine, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01 mg/ml SOPS, 0.001 mg/ml cholesterol, and 0.005 mg/ml C12E8 in 48-well plates. The reaction (37 °C for 1 h) was started by the addition of 1 mm ATP. Pi release was measured with a malachite green dye to detect the phosphomolybdate (Pi Color Lock, Innova Biosciences). The percent inhibition VCG/V0 was calculated for each cardiac glycoside concentration, and Ki values were obtained by fitting the data to the function VCG/V0 = Ki/([CG] + Ki)+ c (using Kaleidagraph). V0 and VCG represent the control rate and rate of Na,K-ATPase activity at particular concentrations of cardiac glycosides, [CG], respectively. The constant c represents a small fraction of uninhibited activity (range 0–10%). Including c improves the fit. Inhibition was estimated in 3–5 separate experiments, average Ki values ± S.E. were calculated, and the significance of differences was calculated by the unpaired Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered significant. Most cardiac glycosides were dissolved in 70-100% ethanol. Bufalin, marinobufagenin, and gitoxin were dissolved in DMSO. Stock solutions were diluted in 50% ethanol or 50% DMSO. Inhibitors were added directly to the reaction medium containing membranes ([3H]ouabain binding) or pure enzymes (Na,K-ATPase activity), so that the final ethanol or DMSO concentration was 1%. Didigitoxosyl digoxigenin was prepared by selective degradation of digoxin as described (33Satoh D. Aoyama K. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1970; 18: 94-99Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The product was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and shown to be close to 80% pure. The three isoform complexes were expressed in P. pastoris, yeast were grown in large quantities, membranes were prepared, and the isoform proteins were purified (see “Experimental Procedures”). Ouabain binding capacities of the membranes expressing α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1 were 25–30, 20–25, and 20 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. Fig. 1 presents a gel of a typical purification experiment. The β1 subunit appears as two bands that are glycosylated to different degrees and are easily deglycosylated by endoglycosidase H to produce a single band of 37 kDa (28Cohen E. Goldshleger R.

Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12855-12867Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Between 1 and 2 mg of purified proteins were obtained per gram of membranes, with Na,K-ATPase activities of α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1, respectively, of 12–15, 6–8, and ≈10 μmol of Pi/mg/min. The high level isoform expression permits accurate determination of [3H]ouabain binding and competitive displacement of [3H]ouabain by many cardiac glycosides (Fig. 2, Table 1). 3The accuracy of these measurements crucially depends on two factors. The first is a high signal to background ratio. At 1 nm [3H]ouabain, 50–70% of the total radioactivity is bound (about 10,000 cpm per sample) and is displaced by increasing concentrations of other cardiac glycosides to a very low background level (about 200 cpm per sample), i.e. roughly a 50-fold ratio. Second, at 1 nm ouabain, corrections of the K0.5 for [3H]ouabain-CG competition to calculate KD values are very small. The ligand conditions (3 mm with MgCl2 and 1 mm vanadate-Tris) are optimal for high affinity ouabain binding to an E2-vanadate conformation (32Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jørgensen P.L.

Fig. 2 depicts typical displacement curves for three digitalis glycosides, digoxin, digitoxin, and a semisynthetic derivative, β-methyl digoxin as well as three aglycones, digoxigenin, digitoxigenin, and bufalin, a bufadienolide (see Table 1 for structures). For digoxin, digitoxin, and β-methyl digoxin, the curves for α2 and α3 are shifted to the left of the curves for α1, with little or no difference between α2 and α3. By contrast, for all three aglycones the curves are superimposable. A single-site displacement model was used to calculate values of KD, compiled in Table 1. Digoxin, β-methyl digoxin, and digitoxin indeed show a moderate but highly significant selectivity for both α2 and α3 over α1, up to 4-fold (see also Table 1, Group B). The three aglycones digoxigenin, digitoxigenin (see also Table 1, Group B), and bufalin (see also Table 1, Group F) show essentially identical affinity for all three isoforms, i.e. they show no isoform selectivity. Experiments like those in Table 1 were carried out on four different preparations of membranes expressing the different isoforms, with essentially similar results. The observation that the aglycones do not discriminate between the isoforms implies that α2/α3:α1 selectivity depends on the sugar residues. To test this hypothesis more systematically as well as the effect of the number and nature of the sugar substituents and the possible influence of the steroid and lactone moieties, we have performed similar experiments on a large number of glycosides and aglycones. These results are collected together in Table 1 into five main groups, B, C, D, E, and F. Group B consists of the digoxigenin and digitoxigenin glycosides with one, two, three, or four digitoxose substituents (see also Fig."
https://openalex.org/W1985193869,"The proproliferative transcription factor KLF5 plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. KLF5 is a short-lived protein that can be rapidly degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms regulating protein stability remain poorly understood. In this study, the tumor suppressor Fbw7, a component of the SCF complex (SCF(Fbw7)) E3 ubiquitin ligase, specifically promoted the degradation and ubiquitination of KLF5 but had little effect on the stability of KLF4. Fbw7 interacted with KLF5 in a CDC4 phosphodegron (CPD)-dependent manner. Three CPDs were found in the KLF5 protein. Simultaneous mutation of these CPDs significantly abolished Fbw7-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, Fbw7 deficiency dramatically delayed KLF5 turnover and led to the accumulation of KLF5 protein in cancer cells. Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta could phosphorylate and promote Fbw7-mediated KLF5 degradation. More importantly, Fbw7 negatively regulated the biological activity of KLF5 in gene regulation and cell proliferation. Taken together, these data indicate that Fbw7 is a key negative regulator controlling KLF5-mediated cell proliferation and suggest an additional mechanism linking the loss of Fbw7 function to tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2136851348,"Low birth weight is associated with glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in later life. Good evidence indicates that the environment plays an important role in this relationship. However, the mechanisms underlying these relationships are defined poorly. Islets are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress, and this condition combined with fibrosis is thought to be instrumental in T2D pathogenesis. Here we use our maternal low-protein (LP) rat model to determine the effect of early diet on oxidative stress and fibrosis in pancreatic islets of male offspring at 3 and 15 mo of age. Islet xanthine oxidase (XO) expression was increased in 15-mo LP offspring, which suggests increased oxidative-stress. Manganese superoxide-dismutase (MnSOD), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (antioxidant enzymes) were reduced significantly in LP offspring, which indicated impairment of oxidative defense. Expression of fibrosis markers collagen I and collagen III also increased in 15-mo LP offspring. Angiotensin II receptor type I (ATIIR1), induced by hyperglycemia and oxidative-stress, was significantly up-regulated in 15-mo LP offspring. Lipid peroxidation was also increased in 15-mo LP animals. We conclude that maternal protein restriction causes age-associated increased oxidative stress, impairment of oxidative defense, and fibrosis. These findings provide mechanisms by which suboptimal early nutrition can lead to T2D development later in life.—Tarry-Adkins, J. L., Chen, J.-H., Jones, R. H., Smith, N. H., Ozanne, S. E.

IntroductionCells change their shape during the diverse motile processes, and the cytoskeletal structural reorganization is a fundamental element in cellular motility and contractile processes. There are two types of actin cytoskeletal architectures, filopodia and lamellipodia, both playing an important role in such motile events. Filopodia are slender projections, which extend from the leading edge of migrating cells and play an important role in a wide range of cell motilities such as cancer cell migration (1Bennett R.D.

These findings have raised the idea that myosin-X plays a critical role in the production of filopodia.Myosin-X is composed of an N-terminal motor domain that hydrolyzes ATP and converts chemical energy to mechanical work; a neck region consisting of three IQ motifs that bind calmodulin light chains; a stable α-helix domain, which may lengthen the working stroke; a coiled-coil region for possible dimerization; and a unique globular tail domain at the C-terminal end (see Fig. 1A) (14Berg J.S.

However, we recently found that the myosin-X without the tail domain, including the FERM domain, can initiate filopodia upon dimer formation, suggesting that the dimer formation of myosin-X is critical for the initiation of filopodia (16Tokuo H. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However the filopodia produced by myosin-X lacking the tail domain were short and unstable, unlike the filopodia induced by full-length myosin-X (10Bohil A.B. Robertson B.W. Cheney R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12411-12416Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 11Zhang H. Berg J.S. Li Z. Wang Y. Lång P. Sousa A.D. Bhaskar A. Cheney R.E. Strömblad S. Nat.

This observation is presumably due to the transportation of the cargo molecules that are required for the production of long and stable filopodia. But the underlying mechanism and the role of the tail domain are unknown.In vitro assays have been performed to characterize the motor activities of myosin-X (17Homma K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29381-29391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Kovács M. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

It was shown by enzyme kinetic analysis that myosin-X is a high duty ratio motor that is suitable for a processive movement (17Homma K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29381-29391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another report suggested that myosin-X is a low duty ratio motor, although it may move processively in the cell while tethering with the membrane (18Kovács M. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15071-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was reported that myosin-X moves processively along actin bundles, but not single actin filaments with a velocity of ∼600 nm/s (19Nagy S. Ricca B.L. Norstrom M.F. Courson D.S. Brawley C.M. Smithback P.A. Rock R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9616-9620Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that myosin-X can transport its cargos in cells only in the places where actin forms bundles such as filopodia. Quite recently, it was reported that the movement of single myosin-X molecules toward the filopodial tips can be observed in living cells (20Kerber M.L. Jacobs D.T. Campagnola L. Dunn B.D. Yin T. Sousa A.D. Quintero O.A. Cheney R.E. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 967-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the live imaging using the fluorescent microscope became the bridge between the in vitro properties of the molecules and their physiological function. Understanding the movement of myosin-X in filopodia is not simple. It is critical to directly observe the movements of myosin-X during various stages of filopodia protrusion (initiation, extension, and retraction) to understand the mechanism underlying myosin-X-induced filopodia formation.In the present study, we observed the real-time movement of myosin-X fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in filopodia of living cells using a total internal reflection fluorescent (TIRF) microscope (21Sako Y. Yanagida T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: SS1-SS5Crossref Google Scholar). This enabled us to specifically observe the filopodia attached to a glass surface in living cells. Using the kymograph method described recently (20Kerber M.L. Jacobs D.T. Campagnola L. Dunn B.D. Yin T. Sousa A.D. Quintero O.A. Cheney R.E. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 967-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) for the wild-type myosin-X movement, we analyzed the role of integrin-β binding FERM domain on the movements of myosin-X at the single-molecule level. Based upon the obtained results of TIRF observation of wild-type myosin-X (M10-FULL) and deletion mutant of FERM domain (M10-ΔFERM), we propose a working model of the myosin-X-induced filopodia-elongation mechanism.RESULTSTo study the role of the globular tail domain on the movement and function of myosin-X in filopodia extension in living cell, we produced two GFP-tagged myosin-X constructs, a full-length construct (M10-FULL, 1–2052 amino acids) and a FERM domain-truncated construct (M10-ΔFERM, 1–1752 amino acids) (Fig. 1, A and B). We found that the overexpression of either M10-FULL or M10-ΔFERM induced a large number of filopodia, in which myosin-X localized at the filopodial tips (Fig. 1, C and D). The filopodia length induced by M10-ΔFERM was shorter than that by M10-FULL (Fig. 1E), whereas the number of filopodia was not affected by deleting the FERM domain (Fig. 1F). This is consistent with a previous report (11Zhang H. Berg J.S. Li Z. Wang Y. Lång P. Sousa A.D. Bhaskar A. Cheney R.E. Strömblad S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of GFP-tagged myosin-X constructs at the tip of the filopodia was quite strong, suggesting that the myosin-X molecules form a cluster at the tip (Fig. 1, C and D).Using a TIRF microscope, we monitored the movement of myosin-X molecules in filopodia in detail during initiation, extension, and retraction of the filopodia protrusion processes (supplemental movies S1 and S2). As shown in Fig. 2A, M10-FULL started to assemble on the membrane at the leading edge, thus initiating the filopodium. Similar assembly of M10-ΔFERM was also observed (not shown), suggesting that the FERM domain is not critical for the assembly of myosin-X at the leading edge. We analyzed the kinetics of the assembly of myosin-X at the membrane using the GFP fluorescence intensity as an index (Fig. 2B). The increase in fluorescence intensity showed exponential kinetics. This result suggests that the rate of myosin-X assembly at the filopodia initiation site is proportional to myosin-X or myosin-X complex concentration at the initiation site. The exponential increment of the fluorescence was also observed for the M10-ΔFERM (Fig. 2C). The time constants of the exponential curves were plotted in the histograms for both constructs, and no obvious differences of the distributions were found (Fig. 2, D and E). These results suggest that the FERM domain is not essential for the initiation of the filopodia protrusion. This observation is consistent with previous results showing that the motor domain, but not the tail, is critical for the initiation step of filopodia formation (16Tokuo H. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It should be mentioned that the accumulation of GFP signals plateaued after the exponential phase, and we found that this correlated with the movement of the spots toward filopodia.FIGURE 2Assembly of myosin-X on the membrane when the protrusion was initiated.

Mean values of the extension and the retraction of M10-FULL were 69 ± 50 and −10 ± 17 nm/s (n = 1047 and 906; 43 filopodia in 27 cells). Those of M10-ΔFERM were 124 ± 59 and −16 ± 20 nm/s (n = 737 and 1179; 49 filopodia in 29 cells), respectively (p < 0.001 by paired t test in the both the extension and the retraction). H and I, histograms of the length from the initial position to the position of the direction change for M10-FULL (H) and M10-ΔFERM (I). Lines indicate fitting of a single Gaussian function with peaks at 2.4 ± 1.4 μm for M10-FULL (n = 150 in 11 cells) and 2.3 ± 1.4 μm M10-ΔFERM (n = 157 in 14 cells) (p = 0.60). It should be noted that the bleaching time estimated by GFP photobleaching under the condition used in this study (100-ms exposure of the charge-coupled device) was much longer than the rate of decrease GFP-M10-ΔFERM fluorescence at the filopodial tips.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We analyzed the individual elastic movements of filopodial tips by monitoring the GFP signal of the myosin-X constructs (Fig. 3, D and E). We identified the tip of filopodia by weak background fluorescence due to GFP-myosin-X inside the filopodia that enabled us to distinguish the position of filopodial tip from the rest of the area. Filopodia were extended several microns from the cell body with significant flexibility, showing a “snake-like” track (Fig. 3, D and E, red), and then slowly retracted (Fig. 3, D and E, green). Fig. 4 shows the time courses of the distance of tip positions from the initiation. Interestingly, we found rapid retraction (shortening) of filopodia at the beginning of the retraction followed by a slow steady-state retraction (Fig. 3, D and E, blue, and Fig. 4). This phenomenon was observed in 85 of the total 96 traces (88.9%) for both constructs. The velocity of this rapid retraction was much larger than the average rate of actin retrograde flow (24Vallotton P. Danuser G. Bohnet S. Meister J.J. Verkhovsky A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Vallotton P. Gupton S.L. Waterman-Storer C.M. Danuser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9660-9665Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The distance between the tip position and the initiation site was plotted as a function of time, and it was found that the extension velocity was decreased just before the rapid retraction (Figs. 3D, 3E, and 4). We monitored the velocity calculated with the distance-time plots (Fig. 4, A and B) for every 1 s during the extension and for every 2 s during the retraction periods except for the rapid retraction (Fig. 3, F and G). The graph for M10-ΔFERM was fitted with single Gaussian distribution with the peak of 113 nm/s and S.D. of 56 nm/s (Fig. 3G, red line), whereas that for M10-FULL was not well fitted with single Gaussian distribution (Fig. 3F, black line), but instead well fitted with a double Gaussian distribution (50 ± 25 nm/s and 108 ± 54 nm/s (peak ± S.D.) (Fig. 3F, red line). Because the values of 108 nm ± 54 nm of M10-FULL were very similar to those of M10-ΔFERM (113 ± 56 nm), it is thought that the FERM domain caused the second slow distribution of 50 nm/s during filopodia extension. It should be mentioned that these values agree with the movement of the filopodial tips obtained using a light-field imaging (26Sheetz M.P. Wayne D.B. Pearlman A.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Mallavarapu A. Mitchison T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Because the FERM domain interacted with the membrane via integrin-β (11Zhang H. Berg J.S. Li Z. Wang Y. Lång P. Sousa A.D. Bhaskar A. Cheney R.E. Strömblad S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the second peak of 50 nm/s (Fig. 3F) was likely to be due to the anchoring of myosin-X on the actin filament to the attached membrane.FIGURE 4Movement of the filopodial tips of GFP-M10-FULL or GFP-M10-ΔFERM overexpressing cells. A and B, five typical traces of the distance of tip positions from the initiation to the retraction in overexpressed GFP-M10-FULL (A) and GFP-M10-ΔFERM (B). Each color indicates an individual filopodium. C, average traces for GFP-M10-FULL (blue, n = 43 in 27 cells) and GFP-M10-ΔFERM (red, n = 49 in 29 cells). Traces were averaged between the original position and the point where direction changed (arrowhead). The mean velocities of the extension just before the direction change were 79.3 nm/s and 128.8 nm/s for GFP-M10-FULL and GFP-M10-ΔFERM, respectively. Those of the retraction just after the direction change were 7.8 nm/s (GFP-M10-FULL) and 14.1 nm/s (GFP-M10-ΔFERM), respectively. The distances of the rapid retraction (arrowhead) were 241 ± 101 nm (GFP-M10-FULL) and 385 ± 200 nm (GFP-M10-ΔFERM) (p < 0.001 by paired t test). The durations of the rapid retraction were 1.9 ± 1.7 s for GFP-M10-FULL and 1.0 ± 0.5 s for GFP-M10-ΔFERM (p = 0.006). The maximum velocities of the rapid retraction were 461 ± 277 nm/s or GFP-M10-FULL and 927 ± 390 nm/s for GFP-M10-ΔFERM (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quite interestingly, the length of the filopodial extension during each cycle of protrusion, determined as the distance from the initiation site just before the rapid retraction, was ∼2.4 ± 1.4 μm (Fig. 3H). This was too short to explain the population of long filopodia (over 5 μm, Fig. 1E). With this length of filopodial extension, the probability of the formation of long protrusion of 5 μm was only 3.6% according to a Gaussian function with a peak at this mean value. Moreover, the length of the extension was not influenced by deletion of the FERM domain (Fig. 3I), whereas the overall length of the induced filopodia was significantly different between the two constructs (Fig. 1E). Although the mean of each extension length was not affected by FERM deletion, the extension time was shorter for M10-ΔFERM than M10-FULL, because the velocity increases by FERM deletion.To understand this apparent discrepancy, we further analyzed the filopodia extension-retraction processes in living cells. A critical finding was that the filopodia showed multiple extension-retraction cycles (Fig. 5A, and supplemental movies S5 and S6). After the puncta of GFP-M10-FULL on the tip moved forward during the elongation, it slowly moved back and then divided into two spots; one moving forward and the other stationary during the next extension phase (Fig. 5A, yellow and red lines). The stationary spot began to diffuse slowly during the second filopodia extension phase (Fig. 5A, blue rectangles). This result suggests that the stationary GFP-myosin-X diffused without interacting with the actin filaments after the first retraction. On the other hand, the fluorescent spot moving forward toward the tip represents GFP-myosin-X interacting with actin. This finding indicates that the filopodia extension is achieved by this phased-extension (cycle-by-cycle) mechanism and, thus, producing long filopodia (Fig. 5B). Supporting this view, the deletion of the FERM domain greatly decreased the probabilities of the second/third extension (Fig. 5C), but not the extension length of each cycle (Fig. 3, H and I). This can explain why the overall length of the produced filopodia is significantly decreased by the deletion of the FERM domain (Fig. 1E). The time between the first and the second extension phase (duration time) was a little less for the FERM domain deletion mutant, i.e. 85 s for M10-FULL and 69 s for M10-ΔFERM, respectively (Fig. 5D). Because M10-ΔFERM tends to diffuse during the retraction phase, it would be less probable to induce the second filopodia extension phase at longer duration time.FIGURE 5Phased extension of filopodia. A, time courses of TIRF images of phased extension in a M10-FULL-overexpressed cell. Yellow lines indicate the second extensions. Red lines indicate the third extension. Blue rectangles indicate the GFP fluorescence that gradually disappeared. Scale bar is 2 μm. B, typical trace of the tip position during the second and third extensions. Positions (red circle) were obtained every 1 s. C, probabilities of second/third extensions. 158 filopodia in 25 cells were counted for M10-FULL, and 1157 filopodia in 36 cells were counted for M10-ΔFERM. The error bars are standard errors. We monitored the phased retraction until each observed filopodium was completely retracted. Therefore, the absence of the second extension is not related to observation times (p < 0.001 by paired t test between M10-FULL and M10-ΔFERM). D, histograms of the duration times (see B) until the next extension for M10-FULL (left) and M10-ΔFERM (right). Mean duration times were 85.1 s (M10-FULL, n = 61 in 25 cells) and 68.9 s (M10-ΔFERM, n = 32 in 36 cells), respectively (p = 0.21).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the relationship between the second extension and the cell adhesion, we observed the filopodia protrusion unattached to the substratum as well as those attached by using the three-dimensional confocal microscope (22Watanabe T.M. Higuchi H. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 4109-4120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We succeeded in tracking 15 unattached filopodia from the initiation to the retraction (Fig. 6). Even though the myosin-X stayed on the filopodial tips, neither phased-extension nor rapid-retraction was observed for all the 15 unattached filopodia tested (Fig. 6, C and D). These results support the idea that adhesion is required for the phased extension of filopodia.FIGURE 6Elongation of unattached filopodial tips using three-dimensional tracking technique.

https://openalex.org/W1980257381,"During development axons encounter a variety of choice points where they have to make appropriate pathfinding decisions. The optic chiasm is a major decision point for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons en route to their target in order to ensure the correct wiring of the visual system. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to the class of small non-coding RNA molecules and have been identified as important regulators of a variety of processes during embryonic development. However, their involvement in axon guidance decisions is less clear.We report here that the early loss of Dicer, an essential protein for the maturation of miRNAs, in all cells of the forming retina and optic chiasm leads to severe phenotypes of RGC axon pathfinding at the midline. Using a conditional deletion approach in mice, we find in homozygous Dicer mutants a marked increase of ipsilateral projections, RGC axons extending outside the optic chiasm, the formation of a secondary optic tract and a substantial number of RGC axons projecting aberrantly into the contralateral eye. In addition, the mutant mice display a microphthalmia phenotype.Our work demonstrates an important role of Dicer controlling the extension of RGC axons to the brain proper. It indicates that miRNAs are essential regulatory elements for mechanisms that ensure correct axon guidance decisions at the midline and thus have a central function in the establishment of circuitry during the development of the nervous system."

Because the active site of the single E2, Ubc9, recognizes the substrate through binding to a consensus tetrapeptide ΨKXE (Ψ, a hydrophobic amino acid; K, the target lysine, X, any amino acid, and E, glutamic acid), SUMO acceptor sites are to date predominantly identified through mutagenesis of target lysine residues on consensus tetrapeptides (3Bernier-Villamor V.

Tryptic digestion of mammalian sumoylated proteins results in peptides with a long side chain on the target lysine residues (see Fig. 1A). The commonly used proteomics techniques are not readily applicable for identification of these branched peptides, which show highly complicated fragmentation patterns in MS/MS analyses when compared with linear peptides. One way to circumvent this problem is a threonine-to-arginine substitution (T95R) on the C terminus of human SUMO-1 (14Knuesel M. Cheung H.T. Hamady M. Barthel K.K. Liu X. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1626-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The arginine residue leads to a tryptic cleavage of the long side chain, whereas two glycine residues remain on the lysine residue as a signature tag (+114.0429 Da), which represents the sumoylation site. This approach is still challenging due to poor detection sensitivity and lack of specific purification techniques for the peptides containing the sumoylation sites (sumoylated peptides) in complex tryptic digests. To facilitate the in vivo identification of sumoylation sites, we have developed a novel combined strategy using a further engineered human SUMO-1 construct. In addition to the easily detectable signature tag, this strategy also provides enrichment capability of sumoylated peptides. Application of our substrate-unbiased approach on HeLa cells resulted in identification of both consensus and non-consensus sumoylation sites, providing novel insights into SUMO target recognition. The experimental procedures are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. The purified sumoylated proteins (92 μg in 470 μl) were reduced for 1 h at 37 °C by the addition of 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT; one sample volume), basified by the addition of 200 mm Tris base (one sample volume), and then digested overnight (∼20 h) at 37 °C by the addition of LysC (4.6 μg; Wako) in H2O (one sample volume). The resulting solution consisted of 50 mm Tris, 25% phosphate-buffered saline, 2 m urea, 5 mm DTT (pH ∼9). To quench the digestion, the solution was acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. The resulting LysC digest was desalted with three pieces of OMIX pipette tips C18 (Varian) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, an aliquot of the digest was loaded onto the OMIX tip that was pretreated with acetonitrile (ACN; 2 × 100 μl) and 1% trifluoroacetic acid (2 × 100 μl). After washing the OMIX tip with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (2 × 100 μl), the LysC digest was eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% ACN (100 μl). Three eluates were combined in a 1.5-ml tube and then evaporated. The enrichment method using Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B beads (GE Healthcare) was developed based on previous reports by Liu et al. (15Liu T. Qian W.J. Strittmatter E.F. Camp 2nd, D.G. Anderson G.A. Thrall B.D. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 5345-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Liu T. Qian W.J.

The desalted LysC digest was reduced for 1 h at 37 °C by the addition of 5 mm DTT in a Tris-HCl/EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4; 10 μl). To capture cysteine-containing peptides, the reduced digest was shaken for 1 h with the Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B beads that were pre-equilibrated and suspended in the Tris-HCl/EDTA buffer (∼50 μl of beads in 100 μl). After spinning the tube, unbound peptides were removed as a supernatant. The beads were washed by rotation for 10 min with the Tris-HCl/EDTA buffer (500 μl), 2 m NaCl (500 μl), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% ACN (500 μl), and then the Tris-HCl/EDTA buffer (500 μl). After removal of a supernatant, the beads were shaken for 1 h at 37 °C with modified trypsin (920 ng; Promega) in the Tris-HCl/EDTA buffer (50 μl) and then incubated at 37 °C overnight (∼20 h) to perform on-bead digestion. The resulting tryptic digest, which was expected to contain sumoylated peptides, was collected as the supernatant, further eluted by shaking the beads for 10 min with the Tris-HCl/EDTA buffer (2 × 50 μl), and then combined in a tube. Although the tryptic digest was not expected to include cysteine-containing peptides, this digest was reduced for 1 h at 37 °C by the addition of 100 mm DTT in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH ∼9; 15 μl) and then alkylated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark by the addition of 500 mm iodoacetamide in the Tris-HCl buffer (15 μl). The alkylation was quenched by the addition of 500 mm DTT in the Tris-HCl buffer (15 μl) to prevent side reaction from excess iodoacetamide (17Boja E.S. Fales H.M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). After acidification with 10% trifluoroacetic acid (15 μl), the treated tryptic digest was desalted according to Rappsilber et al. (18Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Anal.

Briefly, a C18 microcolumn was made with three pieces of Empore C18 disk (3M) packed into a 200-μl pipette tip. The tryptic digest was loaded onto the C18 microcolumn that was pretreated with ACN (50 μl) and 0.1% formic acid (50 μl). After washing the column with 0.1% formic acid (5 × 50 μl), the tryptic digest was eluted with 0.1% formic acid, 80% ACN (50 μl) and then evaporated. After reconstitution with 0.1% formic acid, an aliquot (8.5% v/v) and another aliquot (85% v/v) of the desalted tryptic digest were evaporated for LC-MS/MS analysis and fractionation, respectively. The aliquot (85% v/v) of the desalted tryptic digest was fractionated by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography according to Ishihama et al. (19Ishihama Y. Rappsilber J. Mann M. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, an SCX microcolumn was made with a piece of Empore styrenedivinylbenzene-reverse phase sulfonate (SDB-RPS) disk (3M) packed into a 200-μl pipette tip. The SCX microcolumn was pretreated with ACN (20 μl), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% ACN (20 μl), 500 mm AcONH4, 15% ACN (20 μl), and then 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% ACN (3 × 100 μl). The desalted tryptic digest was reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% ACN (50 μl) and loaded onto the SCX microcolumn. The pass-through and the following washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% ACN (50 μl) were collected and combined as a pass-through fraction. Elution was performed stepwise with 2, 4, 20, 100, and then 500 mm AcONH4 in 15% ACN (50 μl), and the eluates were collected separately. To ensure the elution, the SCX microcolumn was treated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% ACN (10 μl), and the eluate was collected as an ACN fraction. All the seven fractions were diluted by the addition of 1% formic acid to a final volume of 200 μl and then desalted with the Empore C18 microcolumn as described above. Each half of the samples was analyzed by LC-MS/MS using either a QSTAR Pulsar hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) or an LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The detailed procedures are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. The peak lists were subjected to database searches using an in-house Mascot server (version 2.2; Matrix Science) against the Swiss-Prot database (version 57.3, Homo sapiens) supplemented with His-SUMO-1C, LysC (API_ACHLY), trypsin (TRYP_PIG), and bovine serum albumin (ALBU_BOVIN) (total 20,336 sequences). The search criteria allowed for two missed tryptic cleavage sites and specified protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.010559 Da), cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.021469 Da), cysteine N-ethylmaleimide modification (+125.047684 Da), methionine oxidation (+15.994919 Da), phosphorylation of serine/threonine/tyrosine (+79.966324 Da), and diglycine modification of lysine (+114.042923 Da) as variable modifications. Mass tolerances in MS and MS/MS modes were 0.05 and 0.15 Da for the QSTAR data, respectively, whereas they were 5 ppm and 0.8 Da for the LTQ Orbitrap data, respectively. MS/MS spectra of sumoylated peptides suggested with a Mascot expectation value less than 0.05 were inspected manually for identification. The QSTAR MS/MS spectra were centroided before the manual inspection. In case sumoylated peptides were identified with only one of the mass spectrometers, the identical peptides suggested with the other mass spectrometer were inspected manually although the expectation value was not less than 0.05. A sumoylated peptide containing a known sumoylation site was manually inspected although the expectation value was high. Sumoylated peptides, which showed slightly high expectation values (i.e. a Mascot score >15), were considered as candidates and inspected manually. One of the candidate peptides, which showed well annotatable fragment ions and reasonable fragmentation pattern, was subjected to biological validation. To facilitate in vivo identification of sumoylation sites of human proteins, we have developed an enrichment method based on a modified, cysteine-tagged form of SUMO-1 (Fig. 1B). Two proteases are used. LysC digestion provides a cysteine-containing branched peptide that can be specifically retained by covalent binding to a thiol-specific resin (Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B, GE Healthcare), and trypsin releases the target peptide from the immobilized cysteine tag. As a result, peptides containing an extra mass of two glycine residues on a lysine residue are obtained, allowing identification of sumoylation sites by mass spectrometry. To create cysteine-tagged SUMO-1 (SUMO-1C), we mutated several residues of His-SUMO-1 and tested these mutants using human PARP-1 as a model substrate (4Blomster H.A. Hietakangas V. Wu J. Kouvonen P.

PARP-1 is a stress-inducible SUMO substrate, and for practical reasons, we used a DNA-binding mutant PARP-1 H53R that is moderately sumoylated also under non-stress conditions. 6H. A. Blomster, unpublished observations. Mutation of some residues, i.e. Ile88 and Glu93, in SUMO-1 resulted in a loss or severely compromised PARP-1 sumoylation, whereas others left its sumoylation intact. These mutations were combined to create His-SUMO-1C containing C52S, H75K, V87K, V90C, Q92C, and T95R, which still retained the sumoylation capability and is marked with X in Fig. 1C. The applicability of our enrichment method was tested without substrate overexpression using the following experimental setup. The His-SUMO-1C construct was expressed in HeLa cells followed by metal affinity purification under denaturating conditions and removal of unconjugated His-SUMO-1C by a 30-kDa regenerated cellulose cut-off membrane (supplemental Fig. 2). Purified sumoylated proteins were subjected to the cysteine tag peptide enrichment as described above. The resulting samples were fractionated with an SCX microcolumn and analyzed by LC-MS/MS with QSTAR Pulsar and LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometers. The obtained MS/MS data were searched using Mascot against the Swiss-Prot human database, with variable modifications including the diglycyl lysine residue as a sumoylation site. We found 14 sumoylated peptides, which were derived from 12 substrate proteins (Table 1, supplemental Tables 1 and 2). According to the Swiss-Prot database, 7 of the 12 substrate proteins were assigned to the nuclear or nuclear membrane compartment, 2 were unassigned, and 3 were assigned to reside outside the nucleus, in membranes, or even cellular projections. Among the sumoylated peptides, 3 and 11 were sumoylated on consensus and non-consensus sites, respectively. This result supports our earlier presented hypothesis that SUMO substrate recognition mechanisms would be more versatile than earlier anticipated and that numerous SUMO substrates would be targeted by yet unknown mechanisms, independent of the consensus tetrapeptide (4Blomster H.A.

The identified sites included two well known consensus sites, Lys524 of Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) and Lys11 of SUMO-2 (22Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J.

SIM sequences were found in close proximity in 6 of the 11 non-consensus sites (data not shown). Our results are consistent with the model of the SIM-dependent non-consensus targeting (7Zhu J. Zhu S.

The lack of SIM residues nearby the remaining identified non-consensus sites indicates that there are also other, yet undefined, specificity determinants that govern the targeting of non-consensus sumoylation. Hundreds of SUMO substrates have been reported in recent proteomics studies (4Blomster H.A. Hietakangas V. Wu J. Kouvonen P. Hautaniemi S. Sistonen L. Mol. Cell.

However, without a verified sumoylation site assignment, the insights of non-consensus sumoylation sites mentioned here are clearly beyond reach.TABLE 1Sumoylated peptides observed in vivo by cysteine tag peptide enrichment and LC-MS/MSSwiss-Prot accession numberEntry nameProtein nameSUMO sitePeptide sequencea(GG-)K, diglysyl Lys (sumoylation site); Ac-, acetylated protein N terminus; pT/pY, phosphorylated Thr/Tyr.QSTARbMass tolerances for precursor and fragment ions were 0.05 and 0.15 Da, respectively.LTQ OrbitrapcMass tolerances for precursor and fragment ions were 5 ppm (Orbitrap) and 0.8 Da (LTQ), respectively.Mascot scoreExpectation valueMascot scoreExpectation valueP46060RAGP1_HUMANRan GTPase-activating protein 1Lys524516LLVHMGLL(GG-)KSEDK52816.11.529.50.011Lys8Ac-2ASEDIA(GG-)KLAETLAK1548.50.00025Q13263TIF1B_HUMANTranscription intermediary factor 1-βLys779775LTED(GG-)KADVQSIIGLQR79028.20.2141.60.0012P63165SUMO1_HUMANSmall ubiquitin-related modifier 1Lys7Ac-2SDQEA(GG-)KPSTEDLGDKK1743.00.01232.50.026Lys2524L(GG-)KVIGQDSSEIHFK3730.20.018P61956SUMO2_HUMANSmall ubiquitin-related modifier 2Lys118EGV(GG-)KTENNDHINLK2114.36.616.80.72Q16666IF16_HUMANγ-Interferon-inducible protein Ifi-16Lys561560L(GG-)KTEPEEVSIEDSAQSDLK57858.90.00006Q9UPN6RBM16_HUMANPutative RNA-binding protein 16Lys186pTFNSELYSLNDY(GG-)KPPISKAK2537.00.012Q9UG01IF172_HUMANIntraflagellar transport protein 172 homologLys4Ac-1MHL(GG-)KHLR730.00.014Q99518FMO2_HUMANDimethylaniline monooxygenase (N-oxide-forming) 2Lys492486NAIFTQ(GG-)KQRILKPLK50016.30.023Q96QD9FYTD1_HUMANForty-two-three domain-containing protein 1Lys140139R(GG-)KANLLR14522.80.028Q9UBD0HSFX1_HUMANHeat shock transcription factor, X-linkedLys215211RVGV(GG-)KSAPR21921.10.036Q9UBG0MRC2_HUMANC-type mannose receptor 2Lys11421139LLQ(GG-)KPLR114521.90.043Q8IYA6CKP2L_HUMANCytoskeleton-associated protein 2-likeLys198198(GG-)KPDPKLpYTR20626.80.3317.90.36a (GG-)K, diglysyl Lys (sumoylation site); Ac-, acetylated protein N terminus; pT/pY, phosphorylated Thr/Tyr.b Mass tolerances for precursor and fragment ions were 0.05 and 0.15 Da, respectively.c Mass tolerances for precursor and fragment ions were 5 ppm (Orbitrap) and 0.8 Da (LTQ), respectively. Open table in a new tab As examples of MS/MS spectra inspected manually, we present Lys524 of RanGAP1 obtained with LTQ Orbitrap XL and Lys198 of cytoskeleton-associated protein 2-like (CKAP2L) obtained with QSTAR Pulsar (Fig. 2, A and B). The remaining MS/MS spectra are found in supplemental Fig. 3. Low energy collision-induced dissociation of LTQ and QSTAR provided losses of glycine residue(s) from the sumoylation sites (Fig. 2, supplemental Fig. 3). The losses accompanied dominant fragment ions and especially precursor-related ions. When compared with the QSTAR Pulsar, the modern LTQ Orbitrap XL provided a larger number of sumoylated peptides due to the superior sensitivity and precursor mass accuracy (Table 1). LTQ MS/MS used in this study provided many fragment ions, which should result in the good Mascot scores for identification. However, due to the relatively low mass accuracy and resolution provided by LTQ MS/MS, annotation of fragment ions with charge states was ambiguous in some cases (e.g. an ion at m/z 502.4 in Fig. 2A), and the MS/MS spectra of sumoylated peptides were hard to analyze manually. To our knowledge, sumoylation of CKAP2L has not been reported previously. By manual inspection of the MS/MS spectrum obtained with QSTAR (Fig. 2B), most of the predominant ion peaks were annotated as peptide fragment ions. Because QSTAR MS/MS provides isotope-resolved ion peaks, charge states of the fragment ions could be verified. Intensive fragment ions, y6, y8, and their doubly charged forms corresponded to the proline-induced fragment ions. Diglycine modification of the ϵ-amino group of the peptide N-terminal lysine residue apparently induced b1 and a1 ions instead of the b2 and a2 ions that are frequently observed by QSTAR MS/MS. An ion observed at m/z 115.08 corresponds to fragment GG (theoretical m/z 115.05). Because none of the ion peaks matched to the threonine-containing fragment ions with neutral loss of H3PO4, this peptide should be phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue (25Imanishi S.Y. Kochin V.

The novel site of CKAP2L was confirmed by expressing HA-CKAP2L WT and HA-CKAP2L K198R together with WT SUMO-1 in HeLa cells. After HA immunoprecipitation and Western blotting against SUMO-1, a complex pattern of several sumoylated bands corresponding to several sumoylation sites of HA-CKAP2L WT was detected (Fig. 2C, supplemental Fig. 1). The finding that two sumoylated bands marked with asterisks were lost in the HA-CKAP2L K198R mutant, i.e. the upper band on top of a smear and the lower band on top of another band (Fig. 2C), demonstrates that CKAP2L is sumoylated on Lys198 and that our method can be used to identify novel non-consensus sites of sumoylation. Recently, Hsiao et al. (6Hsiao H.H. Meulmeester E. Frank B.T. Melchior F. Urlaub H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 2664-2675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported an informatics tool to facilitate identification of endogenous sumoylated peptides, which are branched with the long side chains, i.e. C termini of SUMOs (Fig. 1A). This tool linearizes expected sumoylated peptides in silico to simplify the MS/MS database search. However, the peptide identification was achieved mainly with detection of predominant fragment ions originating from the C termini of SUMOs, and sufficient numbers of the fragment ions from the substrate peptides, required for confident identification of the sumoylation sites, were not observed (6Hsiao H.H. Meulmeester E. Frank B.T. Melchior F. Urlaub H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 2664-2675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our enrichment strategy using the removable cysteine tag facilitates considerably the in vivo identification of sumoylation sites. Similarly to the recent advances in phosphopeptide enrichment (25Imanishi S.Y. Kochin V. Ferraris S.E. de Thonel A. Pallari H.M. Corthals G.L. Eriksson J.E. Mol. Cell.

Taken together, the results of our study validate a useful tool for sumoylation studies that already in this study gave novel insight into non-consensus sumoylation motifs. As the method is readily available for a broad spectrum of research environments, it will certainly be helpful in unraveling SUMO-targeting mechanisms and facilitate identification of novel SUMO consensus and non-consensus sites.

IntroductionThe BCL-2 family of proteins plays a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis mainly by regulating the outer mitochondrial membrane integrity (1Chipuk J.E. Moldoveanu T. Llambi F. Parsons M.J. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). They are classified into two functional groups: anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic. They each share conserved BH regions. The anti-apoptotics (BCL-2, BCL-w, BCL-XL, MCL-1, and A1) share up to four BH regions named BH1–4, 4The abbreviations used are: BHBCL-2 homologyITCisothermal titration calorimetryRDCresidual dipolar couplingMCL-1myeloid cell leukemia 1cBIDcalpain cut BIDcMCL-1core domain of MCL-1PDBProtein Data BankHSQCheteronuclear single quantrum coherence. and prevent cells from entering apoptosis. The pro-apoptotics can be further grouped into the effectors and BH3-only proteins. The effectors, BAX and BAK, contain three BH (BH1–3) regions and promote cell death by oligomerization and mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization. The BH3-only proteins share the BH3 region of sequence similarity. Members of this group include BID, BIM, BAD, BMF, BIK, PUMA, Noxa, HRK/DPS (Harakiri), NIP3, bNIP3, and MULE. The BH3 region is 16 to 25 amino acid residues long and can promote apoptosis when introduced into cells. The three groups of BCL-2 proteins form a delicately balanced network of opposing functions that regulates the fate of the cell.MCL-1 belongs to the anti-apoptotic family but is unique due to its short half-life, the presence of an extra N-terminal sequence, and its particular selectivity in binding BH3 peptides. Its concentration in vivo is tightly regulated at multiple levels, and its N-terminal sequence presents many sites for post-translational modifications, including polyubiquitination (2Warr M.R.

In that aim, we optimized the expression and purification of various human MCL-1 constructs, and characterized their binding affinities to a panel of human BH3 peptides using a combination of structural and thermodynamic approaches.BID, a BH3-only protein, performs its pro-apoptotic activity after it is proteolytically activated to a truncated form that is known as tBID (13Li H.

Multiple structures of MCL-1 in complex with BH3 peptides are crucial for the development of small molecule inhibitors specifically targeting MCL-1 or capable of broadly interacting with all anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins.The first obstacle to structural studies of MCL-1 is the difficulty in producing stable protein due to heterogeneity brought about by degradation during bacterial expression and subsequent purification. The problem of degradation was solved by the deletion of the N-terminal sequence (32Day C.L. Chen L. Richardson S.J. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Hinds M.G. J. Biol.

Day C.L. Smith B.J. Huang D.C. Fairlie W.D. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6217-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These are a requirement not only for solving the solution structure, but also for drug screening by NMR. In this study, we report the use of limited proteolysis to produce a calpain cleavage product (cMCL-1) that is the first human construct suitable for NMR studies. In its free form, 95% of the cMCL-1 backbone signals could be assigned and this will enable future screening for compounds that specifically target MCL-1.We took advantage of the high quality NMR spectra to study ligand binding by cMCL-1. All tested peptides that bound MCL-1 with micromolar to nanomolar affinities perturbed the NMR signals of cMCL-1 similarly (data not shown), which indicates that they induce the same conformational change in cMCL-1 upon binding. Detailed analysis of the chemical shift changes showed that the cMCL-1 residues with the largest changes are mainly located in the hydrophobic groove of cMCL-1 formed by the BH1–3 regions (Fig. 2, B and C). This represents a universal feature of all pro-survival BCL-2 complexes. We determined the selectivity of MCL-1 for BH3 ligands by comparing the binding affinities measured by ITC (Fig. 1, B and C). The failure of MCL-1 to bind BAD-BH3 and its strong preference for BIM-BH3, Noxa-BH3, and MULE-BH3 are consistent with results reported by other groups, although the values vary somewhat due to differences in the methods and peptides used (34Day C.L.

For example, the shorter PUMA-BH3 (residues 131–150, our work) has a much lower affinity to human MCL-1 than reported for a longer peptide (residues 130–155) binding to mouse MCL-1 (34Day C.L. Smits C. Fan F.C. Lee E.F. Fairlie W.D. Hinds M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 958-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).The higher affinity of longer peptides may be due to their greater helical propensity or the presence of binding elements outside of the consensus BH3 region. In the case of BID-BH3 binding to human MCL-1, we observed almost 10-fold higher affinity for a longer biosynthetically prepared peptide comprising residues 76–106 than for the chemically synthesized peptide comprising residues 80–99 (Fig. 1C). ITC measurements with the longer BID-BH3 peptide yielded affinities of 85 nm for MCL-1-ΔN119-ΔC23 and 40 nm for MCL-1-ΔN151-ΔC7. These are similar to the values reported for a 34-residue mouse BID peptide binding to mouse MCL-1 (34Day C.L. Smits C. Fan F.C. Lee E.F. Fairlie W.D. Hinds M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 958-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).A detailed examination of the cMCL-1·BID-BH3 structure shows that there is an extra hydrophilic interaction between the side chains of Gln79 in the N terminus of the peptide and Asp242 in the binding pocket of cMCL-1 (Fig. 5D). This interaction may contribute to the higher affinity observed for the longer BID-BH3 peptide. The structure also explains the low affinities of MCL-1 in binding BAD-BH3 and ABT-737, the hotly studied BCL-2 inhibitor. The overlay of our structure and the crystal structure of BCL-XL·BAD-BH3 (2BZW) reveals that the biggest conformational difference between MCL-1 and BCL-XL lies in helix α3 (Fig. 6A). The better formation of helix α3 in MCL-1 leads to its restriction in peptide binding (33Czabotar P.E. Lee E.F. van Delft M.F. Day C.L. Smith B.J. Huang D.C. Fairlie W.D. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6217-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Fig. 6B presents that the conformations of the first hydrophobic residues (h1) in BH3 peptides varies largest, and Met231 in MCL-1 helix α3 prevents the engagement of Tyr105 in BAD-BH3 by spatial confliction. Superimposing our structure with the crystal structure of BCL-XL·ABT-737 complex (Fig. 6C) clearly shows that the hydrophobic groove in BCL-XL is narrow and deep, whereas the one in cMCL-1 is wider and shallower. As a result, the pocket formed by Phe228, Met231, and Phe270, which accommodates the binding of Leu90 in BID-BH3, results in spatial restriction that blocks binding of the chloral-biphenyl group in ABT-737 (Fig. 6D). Similarly, the side chain of Val216 hinders the engagement of the nitrophenyl and the thiophenyl groups in ABT-737 spatially.The N-terminal sequence of MCL-1 has always been deleted in structural studies due to its lack of structure; however, its regulatory functions have garnered attention recently. With two PEST regions, it not only plays a vital regulating role in the subcellular localization of MCL-1 (48Germain M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32233-32242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but also provides critical sites for polyubiquitination (2Warr M.R. Acoca S. Liu Z. Germain M.

It has been reported that calpain inhibitors can prevent the degradation of MCL-1, indicating that calpain digestion of MCL-1 could possibly play a physiological role. Here, using four human MCL-1 constructs with different N-terminal deletions, we further explored the effects of this intrinsically unstructured sequence, unique to MCL-1, on BH3-peptide binding. HSQC spectra of the labeled BID-BH3 peptide bound to different unlabeled MCL-1 constructs were very similar suggesting that the N-terminal sequence does not influence the structure of the bound peptide (Fig. 1D). In addition, whereas the N-terminal sequence does not alter the binding preference of MCL-1; its deletion always led to higher binding affinity. This may be due to nonspecific steric crowding from the N terminus or it may arise from low affinity binding of the N terminus to the MCL-1 hydrophobic pocket. Whatever the mechanism, proteolytic processing of MCL-1 by caspase, granzyme, and other proteases may be expected to increase not only the stability but also the affinity of MCL-1 binding of the BH3 regions of pro-apoptotic proteins.BID, the only pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein known to assume a globular-fold, has been widely studied in research on the direct activation of BAX and BAK; however, its regulation by anti-apoptotic proteins is always carried out using the BID-BH3 peptide, and whether the protein will behave similarly to the peptide has remained an open question. In 2006, Brady and colleagues (16Clohessy J.G. Zhuang J. de Boer J. Gil-Gómez G. Brady H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5750-5759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) reported that MCL-1 directly interacts with tBID in vivo to inhibit the release of cytochrome c. In this study using a calpain-activated form, we were able to detect the direct interaction between cBID and cMCL-1 in vitro. This interaction is very slow in solution and requires 16 h for completion as detected by NMR. This is most likely due to the kinetic barrier for the dissociation of the N- and C-terminal fragments, which is postulated to increase the accessibility of the BH3 region. In the undissociated complex, the cBID BH3 region is not available for cMCL-1 binding. The interaction of cBID and cMCL-1 can be accelerated by conditions that destabilize cBID. Addition of 0.1% of the detergent IGEPAL decreased the interaction time to less than 1 h (data not shown). The HSQC NMR spectra of cMCL-1 (Fig. 3B) suggests that cBID binds cMCL-1 very tightly. The strong similarity of cMCL-1 spectra in complex with BID-BH3 or cBID (Fig. 3, C and D) confirms that cBID forms a stable heterodimer by engaging its BH3 region in the hydrophobic pocket of cMCL-1. This result is consistent with the recently reported direct interaction between tBID and BCL-XL (49Yao Y. Bobkov A.A. Plesniak L.A. Marassi F.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 8704-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we report a human MCL-1 construct (cMCL-1) suitable for NMR studies, the solution structure of a human MCL-1·BH3 complex, and critical features of the highly anticipated MCL-1·activated BID complex. By NMR and ITC, we show that the N-terminal sequence of MCL-1 affects its binding affinity but not selectivity. Together these results will be valuable for future drug screening and design of compounds that specifically target human MCL-1. IntroductionThe BCL-2 family of proteins plays a pivotal role in regulating apoptosis mainly by regulating the outer mitochondrial membrane integrity (1Chipuk J.E. Moldoveanu T. Llambi F. Parsons M.J. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). They are classified into two functional groups: anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic. They each share conserved BH regions. The anti-apoptotics (BCL-2, BCL-w, BCL-XL, MCL-1, and A1) share up to four BH regions named BH1–4, 4The abbreviations used are: BHBCL-2 homologyITCisothermal titration calorimetryRDCresidual dipolar couplingMCL-1myeloid cell leukemia 1cBIDcalpain cut BIDcMCL-1core domain of MCL-1PDBProtein Data BankHSQCheteronuclear single quantrum coherence. and prevent cells from entering apoptosis. The pro-apoptotics can be further grouped into the effectors and BH3-only proteins. The effectors, BAX and BAK, contain three BH (BH1–3) regions and promote cell death by oligomerization and mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization. The BH3-only proteins share the BH3 region of sequence similarity. Members of this group include BID, BIM, BAD, BMF, BIK, PUMA, Noxa, HRK/DPS (Harakiri), NIP3, bNIP3, and MULE. The BH3 region is 16 to 25 amino acid residues long and can promote apoptosis when introduced into cells. The three groups of BCL-2 proteins form a delicately balanced network of opposing functions that regulates the fate of the cell.MCL-1 belongs to the anti-apoptotic family but is unique due to its short half-life, the presence of an extra N-terminal sequence, and its particular selectivity in binding BH3 peptides. Its concentration in vivo is tightly regulated at multiple levels, and its N-terminal sequence presents many sites for post-translational modifications, including polyubiquitination (2Warr M.R.

These modifications are involved in regulating its activity in binding pro-apoptotic proteins, or in regulating its concentration by either promoting or blocking its degradation.

One way to develop specific human MCL-1 targeting drugs is to explore its interactions with other partners, specifically BH3-only proteins (12Fesik S.W. Nat. Rev.

In that aim, we optimized the expression and purification of various human MCL-1 constructs, and characterized their binding affinities to a panel of human BH3 peptides using a combination of structural and thermodynamic approaches.BID, a BH3-only protein, performs its pro-apoptotic activity after it is proteolytically activated to a truncated form that is known as tBID (13Li H.

Here, we addressed the in vitro heterodimerization between a calpain-digested construct of each protein (cMCL-1 and cBID) by size exclusion chromatography and NMR titrations. In addition, we present the structure of cMCL-1·hBID-BH3 complex solved by NMR spectroscopy. The work reveals the structural basis of peptide recognition and insights for the rational design of drugs to specifically target MCL-1."
https://openalex.org/W1640068223,"Several important signaling pathways require NAD as substrate, thereby leading to significant consumption of the molecule. Because NAD is also an essential redox carrier, its continuous resynthesis is vital. In higher eukaryotes, maintenance of compartmentalized NAD pools is critical, but so far rather little is known about the regulation and subcellular distribution of NAD biosynthetic enzymes. The key step in NAD biosynthesis is the formation of the dinucleotide by nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs). The three human isoforms were localized to the nucleus, the Golgi complex, and mitochondria. Here, we show that their genes contain unique exons that encode isoform-specific domains to mediate subcellular targeting and post-translational modifications. These domains are dispensable for catalytic activity, consistent with their absence from NMNATs of lower organisms. We further demonstrate that the Golgi-associated NMNAT is palmitoylated at two adjacent cysteine residues of its isoform-specific domain and thereby anchored at the cytoplasmic surface, a potential mechanism to regulate the cytosolic NAD pool. Insertion of unique domains thus provides a yet unrecognized enzyme targeting mode, which has also been adapted to modulate subcellular NAD supply."
https://openalex.org/W2048143906,"Mtl1 is a member of the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which functions as a cell wall sensor for oxidative stress. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis revealed a cluster of genes that were down-regulated in the absence of Mtl1. Many of these genes were potentially regulated by the general stress response factor Msn2/Msn4. In response to rapamycin, caffeine, glucose starvation and oxidative stress provoked by H2O2, mtl1 presents a significant loss of viability as well as a deficiency in the transcriptional response mediated by Msn2/Msn4. The Mtl1 function was required (i) to induce ribosomal gene repression, (ii) to induce the general stress response driven by the transcription factor Msn2/Msn4, and (iii) to activate the CWI pathway in response to both glucose starvation and oxidative stress. We also detected higher cAMP levels in the mtl1 mutant than in wild type cells indicative of up-regulated RAS2-PKA activity. Disruption of TOR1, disruption of RAS2, or hyperactivation of Rho1 restored both the viability and the transcriptional function (both ribosomal and Msn2/Msn4-dependent gene expression) in the mtl1 mutant to almost wild type levels when cells were starved of glucose or stressed with H2O2. Taking our results together, we propose an essential role for Mtl1 in signaling oxidative stress and quiescence to the CWI pathway and to the general stress response through Rho1 and the inhibition of either the TOR1 or RAS2 functions.

The PKC1-MAPK pathway is integrated by several cell-wall proteins that are putative cell-membrane receptors of different stimuli; they are the Wsc1-Wsc4 family, Mid2, and Mtl1. They transmit signals to Rom2, which activates the G protein Rho1, which in turn activates the kinase Pkc1 (a protein that has high degree of homology with other isoforms of PKC in eukaryotic cells). Pkc1 activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase module: Bck1 (that is the MAPKKK) phosphorylates the redundant MAPK kinases Mkk1 and Mkk2, and together they activate Slt2, the last kinase member of the pathway. Two downstream events correlate with Slt2 activation: transcriptional activity driven by Rlm1 and Swi6 phosphorylation (5Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol.

Tor2 functions in both complexes, whereas Tor1 only participates in the TORC1 complex. The cellular function regulated by TOR contains a general mechanism; that is, the sequestration of the transcription factors Msn2/Msn4, Gln3 (17Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), and Rtg1/Rtg3 (18Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The Tor function also regulates ribosomal protein expression in response to environmental conditions via PKA (20Martin D.E. Soulard A. Hall M.N. Cell. 2004; 119: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Ras signals via the cAMP-PKA pathway regulate the cellular metabolism in response to the carbon source (21Broach J.R. Deschenes R.J. Adv.

The Msn2/Msn4 transcription factor binds and activates genes containing the stress response element (CCCCT) in response to a wide variety of stresses, including nutritional, osmotic, acidic, and oxidative stress (17Beck T.

Some authors have suggested that the RAS/cAMP pathway could be a novel TOR effector branch (29Schmelzle T. Beck T. Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Both the TOR and cAMP-PKA pathways regulate the expression of genes needed to overcome the diauxic and stationary phases (30Cardenas M.E. Cutler N.S. Lorenz M.C. Di Como C.J. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 31Garreau H. Hasan R.N. Renault G. Estruch F. Boy-Marcotte E. Jacquet M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2113-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in whose regulation Msn2/Msn4 transcriptional activity has been reported to be essential (32Powers 3rd, R.W. Kaeberlein M. Caldwell S.D. Kennedy B.K. Fields S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). They also coregulate the expression of genes involved in fermentation and aerobic respiration (33Chen J.C.Y. Powers T. Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The CWI pathway is also required for viability in quiescence as Slt2 phosphorylation is necessary for cells to survive in stationary phase and upon rapamycin treatment (10Torres J. Di Como C.J.

Biol. 2002; 12: 588-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we have employed a genomic approach to identify possible novel regulatory functions for the gene MTL1 and have demonstrated that Mtl1 signals toward Msn2/Msn4 transcriptional function in response to various stresses such as rapamycin, oxidative stress, and glucose starvation. We have also presented evidence to demonstrate that the Mtl1 function is required to down-regulate Tor1 and Ras2 activity upon glucose starvation and oxidative stress. This down-regulation is necessary to ensure cell viability in response to both types of stress. We show that Mtl1 is the member of the CWI pathway that acts as a sensor for oxidative stress and glucose starvation by activating the kinase Slt2. However, Slt2 activation is only visibly important for cell viability in conditions of quiescence. Yeasts were grown in SD medium (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, and the required amino acids) (35Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Diamide, hydrogen peroxide, caffeine, and rapamycin were purchased from Sigma. Diamide was dissolved in DMSO. Hydrogen peroxide was prepared in sterile distilled water. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. MTL1 was disrupted either by the one-step disruption method using the kanMX4 module, as described in Vilella et al. (1Vilella F. Herrero E. Torres J. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9149-9159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), or by using the natMX4 module (36Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). RAS2 and TOR1 were disrupted by the same procedure but using the LEU marker.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this workStrainRelevant genotypeReferenceCML128MATa leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1 his4 can1rGallego et al.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pPkc1 contains Pkc1 under the tetO7 promoter and is also tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope, as initially described in Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz et al. (37Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz M. Torres J. Arino J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33468-33476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) under the name of pMM126. Plasmid pSlt2 is a YEP352 derivative containing the Slt2 ORF under its own promoter and tagged with hemagglutinin in the C terminus; this plasmid was described in Vilella et al. (1Vilella F. Herrero E. Torres J. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9149-9159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the pSlt2 plasmid for overexpression analysis and also to determine total Slt2 protein using the anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody. The plasmid pBCK1-20 is a pRS413 derivative bearing the constitutively activated BCK1–20 allele (38Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The plasmid pRho1* contains the LEU marker and bears the Rho1his368 allele, which is constitutively activated, bears the hemagglutinin epitope in the C-terminal position, and is cloned under the Gal1 promoter. This plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Tobias Schmelzle. The plasmid pMsn2-GFP contains the LEU marker, cloned under the ADH1 promoter in a centromeric plasmid, as originally described in Görner et al. (44Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Francisco Estruch. This plasmid was originally described as functional, but we checked its functionality in an msn2msn4 background. We demonstrated that it efficiently suppresses both the lack of viability and the deficiency in the transcription of HSP12 and CTT1 that were observed in the double mutant msn2msn4 in response to the stresses used in this study. For microarray analysis, wild type and mtl1 cells were grown in SD minimum medium at 30 °C to a final A600 0.6. Total RNA from S. cerevisiae was extracted from 25 ml of each culture by mechanical disruption following the instructions for the RNeasy Midi kit manufacturer (Qiagen). RNA concentration was measured at 260 nm, and sample quality was checked using RNA Nano Labchips in a 2100B Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). For each experimental condition (wt and mtl1Δ strain), two microarray experiments corresponding to two biological replicates were processed and analyzed. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using a “One-cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit” (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). After cDNA purification using the “GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module” (Affymetrix), this DNA was used as a template for the in vitro transcription to obtain the biotin-labeled cRNA. The cRNA obtained was fragmented and hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip® Yeast Genome S98 array for 16 h at 45 °C. Hybridized microarrays were washed and stained with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate in a GeneChip® Fluidics Station 450. All these procedures were carried out as suggested by the manufacturer. Hybridized cRNA was finally identified by the fluorescence signal in a GeneChip® 3000 scanner. After scanning, numerical data were obtained and processed with GCOS software (Affymetrix). We evaluated different parameters that accounted for the quality of the hybridization. The noise value was less than 2.51 (commonly between 1.5 and 3), the scaling factor was between 0.22 and 0.41, and the background was between 107 and 50.6. The arrays showed percentages of “Present” probe sets ranging between 72.3 and 79.5. The signals from the arrays were linearly scaled to an average signal value of 100. Data from mutant and WT strains were compared in pairs, obtaining a total of four comparisons. For further analysis, a selection of significant results was carried for each comparison using the statistical criteria implemented by the GCOS software. Those genes labeled as “Absent” by the detection algorithm (using a p value of < 0.04) in both arrays of a comparison were discarded for the analysis. Those genes that gave “Increase” or “Decrease” values, according to the change algorithm (using a p value of <0.0025) in all four comparisons were used for further analysis. The signal log ratio was obtained as the mean of the signal log ratio obtained in each of the four comparisons; genes with signal ratios of >2 or <0.5 were selected for additional analysis. Probes on the yeast genome S98 chips that did not correspond to specific open reading frames were disregarded in this analysis. RNA purification, Northern blot, and probe labeling with digoxygenin were carried out according to Gallego et al. (39Gallego C. Garí E. Colomina N. Herrero E. Aldea M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7196-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Probes covering the entire open reading frame, without adjacent sequences, were generated by PCR from genomic DNA. Both methods were performed as described in Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz et al. (37Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz M. Torres J. Arino J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33468-33476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The methodology for the use of both anti-phospho-p44/42 and anti-Swi6 antibodies was that previously described in Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz et al. (37Angeles de la Torre-Ruiz M. Torres J. Arino J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33468-33476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit (NA931, Amersham Biosciences) was used at a 1:10,000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline-Tween buffer containing 1% milk fat. In all cases chemiluminescent detection was performed using the Supersignal substrate (Pierce) in a Lumi-Imager (Roche Applied Science). The Amersham Biosciences cAMP Biotrak Enzyme-immunoassay system was used to determine intracellular levels of cAMP. Strains wt, mtl1, ras2, ml1ras2, tor1, mtl1tor1 were grown in SD selective media at 30 °C. We performed the experiment using exponentially growing cultures (A600 0.6) and stationary cultures grown for up to 3 days. We basically followed the method described by Swiegers et al. (40Swiegers J.H. Pretorius I.S. Bauer F.F. Curr. Genet. 2006; 50: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to obtain the samples. A total of 40 ml of each of the exponentially growing cultures (and the corresponding amount of cells for the stationary cultures) was harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at room temperature for 4 min. After that, the wet weight was determined, the cells were subsequently resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer 1B (Amersham Biosciences), and 150 μl of glass beads were added. The suspension was vortexed for 30 min at 8 °C and then spun down for 10 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant (100 μl) was used for the protocol; that is, intracellular cAMP measurement using the non-acetylation enzyme-immunoassay procedure with the novel lysis reagents described in the kit. Our group previously demonstrated that Mtl1 functions as a cell-surface sensor for oxidative stress (1Vilella F. Herrero E. Torres J. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9149-9159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To gain a further insight into the role that Mtl1 plays in cell integrity, we decided to analyze the genome-wide gene expression profile of the mtl1 mutant strain. The transcriptional profile of this mutant growing in SD medium was compared with the wild type strain CML128 under the same conditions using Affymetrix GeneChip® Yeast Genome S98 arrays, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Microarray analysis of this profile revealed the presence of 102 genes that were repressed (-fold ≤0.5) (supplemental Table S1) and 13 that were induced genes (-fold ≥2) (supplemental Table S2) as a consequence of the MTL1 deletion. A functional classification of these genes was carried out according to MIPS and GO Databases using FUNSPEC. This analysis revealed the presence of several statistically significant functional groups (p value less than 0.01) within the repressed response. These included electron transport and energy uptake, stress response, and sugar and aromatic compound utilization among others (supplemental Table S3). Interestingly, and as deduced from the YEASTRACT data base, an important group of the repressed genes was potentially regulated by Msn2/Msn4 (34 of 102 repressed genes); most of these related in one way or another to the stress response (Table 2).TABLE 2Genes down-regulated in mtl1 strain, which are potentially regulated by Msn2/Msn4Gene/open reading frameFunctionBiological processALD3Aldehyde dehydrogenase activityStress responseCTT1Catalase activityDAK1Glycerol kinase activityDDR2GAD1Glutamate decarboxylase activityGRE1HSP12HSP26Unfolded protein bindingMCR1Cytochrome-b5 reductase activitySIP18Phospholipid bindingSSA4Unfolded protein bindingTRX3Thiol-disulfide exchange intermediate activityPHM7UnknownSOL46-Phosphogluconolactonase activityNQM1Transaldolase activityYHR033WYKL151CAIM33YMR090WAGX1Alanine-glyoxylate transaminase activityAmino acidsPOT1Acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase activityLipid metabolismTES1Acyl-CoA thioesterase activityTKL2Transketolase activityCarbohydratesYJR096WAldehyde reductase activityTSA2Thioredoxin peroxidase activityHomeostasisECM4Glutathione transferase activityCell wallFMP45TFS1Lipid binding/protease inhibitor activityProtein catabolismVPS73Substrate specific transmembrane transporter activityTransportSPS100SporulationHBT1ConjugationYLR294CHydrogen-transporting ATP synthaseRespirationGTT1glutathione transferase activityOthersYDL124Wα-Keto amide reductase activity, α-keto ester reductase activity Open table in a new tab In an initial characterization of Mtl1 we focused our efforts on studying the possible relationship between Mtl1 and Msn2/Msn4. First, and to validate our data, we performed Northern blot assays with samples taken from mtl1 and wt strains growing exponentially. We then tested HSP12, GRE1, TRX3, and DDR2 gene expression, as they are potentially regulated by the transcription factor Msn2/Msn4. In all cases we observed that the basal levels of these transcripts were lower in the mtl1 mutant than in the wt cells; this confirmed the results obtained in the genomic study described above and validated our genomic analysis (Fig. 1A). To ascertain the physiological significance of the previously mentioned results, we proceeded to screen mtl1 survival under different conditions, inferred from mtl1 global transcription analysis. We hypothesized that a possible cause of the gene down-regulation observed in the mtl1 background was a defect in the Msn2/Msn4 function. As the Msn2/Msn4 is a transcription factor involved in the general stress response, we decided to screen the survival response of the mtl1 mutant to various stresses in which Msn2/Msn4 is involved: rapamycin, hydrogen peroxide, and glucose deprivation. In Fig. 1B we show that Mtl1 is needed for cell survival in response to rapamycin, hydrogen peroxide, caffeine, and carbon deprivation, whereas in stationary phase (not shown), cell survival is undistinguishable from wt cell. All these phenotypes are consistent with a defect affecting the general stress response; they also resemble those already described for msn2msn4 mutants (41Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Estruch F. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the transcriptional regulation of CTT1 and HSP12 in wt and mtl1 mutant cells growing exponentially (time 0) or treated either with rapamycin or hydrogen peroxide or deprived of glucose (Figs. 1, C and D). We observed that the mtl1 mutant was deficient in the transcriptional induction of HSP12 and CTT1 upon treatment with rapamycin or peroxide or glucose deprivation. The regulation of these genes under these conditions was exerted by the Msn2 function because HSP12 and CTT1 genes were not induced in response to the three conditions in an msn2msn4 mutant (Fig. 1E). Moreover, we overexpressed Msn2 in both wt and mtl1 strains and observed that higher Msn2 levels were sufficient to complement the defects in HSP12 and CTT1 transcription (both regulated by Msn2/Msn4) in mtl1 cells in response to all the treatments to almost wild type levels (Fig. 1, C and D). Msn2 overexpression was also able to rescue the defect in mtl1 cell growth provoked by each of the previously mentioned stress types (Fig. 1B). Moreover, and in line with the previously mentioned results, Msn2 overexpression also restored the logarithmic levels of HSP12 and CTT1 transcription (Fig. 1, C and D). In view of these results and given that in the absence of Mtl1 function a wide cluster of genes regulated by Msn2 were down-regulated with respect to the wild type strain, we concluded that Mtl1 signals to Msn2 and regulates its function in response to the blockade of the TOR function, hydrogen peroxide, and glucose deprivation. It is well known that Msn2 has a cytoplasmic localization when cells grow exponentially in rich medium and also that Msn2 translocates to the nucleus in response to several types of stress. We decided to investigate how the lack of Mtl1 function affected the subcellular localization of Msn2 to find an explanation for the transcriptional deficiency observed in the mtl1 mutant. To do this, we studied in vivo GFP-Msn2 localization in mtl1 mutant cells. In response to either hydrogen peroxide or rapamycin, Msn2 translocates to the nucleus in both wt and mtl1 cells. However, in mtl1 cells, we observed a significant delay in Msn2 translocation to the nucleus compared with wt cells (Fig. 2A). The timi"
https://openalex.org/W2076514367,"Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step for homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism via the trans-sulfuration pathway and is also responsible for the production of H2S through the desulfhydration reaction. Our recent studies demonstrate that renal ischemia/reperfusion decreased the CBS activity leading to Hcy accumulation and H2S reduction in the kidney, which in turn contributed to kidney injury. Both Hcy and H2S play important roles in physiological and pathological processes. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanism by which CBS activity was regulated in the kidney. The left kidney of Sprague-Dawley rat was subjected to 45 min of ischemia followed by 6 h of reperfusion. Ischemia/reperfusion caused a significant decrease in CBS mRNA and protein levels in the kidney. As a consequence, there was a marked reduction in the CBS enzyme activity. Transfection of kidney proximal tubular cells with transcription factor (Sp1) small interfering RNA caused a marked reduction in CBS mRNA, indicating a pivotal role for Sp1 in regulating CBS expression in kidney cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay detected a lower Sp1 activity in kidneys subjected to ischemia/reperfusion as compared with that in a sham-operated group. ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Sp1 was responsible for a decreased transcriptional activity of Sp1 in the kidney upon ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that reduced kidney CBS gene expression during ischemia/reperfusion is mediated via a decrease in Sp1 transcriptional activity.

Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS, EC 4.2.1.22) is a key enzyme that regulates the metabolism of Hcy and H2S (1Eto K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42680-42685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hcy is an intermediate amino acid formed during the conversion of methionine to cysteine and is central to the supply of methyl groups that are critical to normal cell function. Hcy can be metabolized via two major pathways, namely the remethylation pathway (remethylation of Hcy to methionine) and the trans-sulfuration pathway (trans-sulfuration of Hcy to cysteine) (2Wang L. Jhee K.H. Hua X. DiBello P.M. Jacobsen D.W. Kruger W.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CBS catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the trans-sulfuration pathway (2Wang L. Jhee K.H. Hua X. DiBello P.M. Jacobsen D.W. Kruger W.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When Hcy metabolism is impaired, an increase in its concentration in the blood occurs, a condition termed hyperhomocysteinemia. Regarded as a risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases (3Lentz S.R. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 4Refsum H. Ueland P.M.

BMJ. 2002; 325: 1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar), Hcy, at elevated levels, also affects the function of other organs such as liver and kidney (6Distrutti E. Mencarelli A. Santucci L.

Nephrol. 2008; 28: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The kidney plays an important role in regulating Hcy concentrations in the circulation. It is estimated that the kidney is responsible for the removal of ∼20% of Hcy from the systemic circulation (8House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Metabolism of Hcy in the kidney (up to 78%) is primarily through the trans-sulfuration pathway, in which the CBS enzyme regulates the rate-limiting step by condensing Hcy with serine to form cystathionine (8House J.D. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Impaired kidney function is inversely correlated with the Hcy level in the circulation (9Francis M.E. Eggers P.W. Hostetter T.H. Briggs J.P.

CBS is also responsible for the endogenous synthesis of H2S from cysteine and Hcy through a β-replacement reaction (10Singh S. Padovani D. Leslie R.A. Chiku T. Banerjee R. J. Biol.

At physiological concentrations, H2S acts as an essential gaseous neurotransmitter (12Moore P.K. Bhatia M. Moochhala S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 609-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and has the ability to attenuate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in animal models (13Elrod J.W.

Fiorucci S. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our recent study indicates that a reduction of endogenous H2S production is associated with kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury (16Xu Z. Prathapasinghe G. Wu N. Hwang S.Y. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F27-F35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because of the critical roles of CBS in regulating Hcy and H2S levels, it is of great importance to understand the mechanisms that govern CBS regulation.The active form of the CBS enzyme is a homotetramer that is composed of four identical polypeptide monomers (17Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Each monomer (63 kDa) consists of three domains: the heme-binding domain (N-terminal amino acids), the catalytic core domain (the central amino acids), and the regulatory domain (C-terminal amino acids). The CBS activity is regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Previous studies have mapped the transcriptional start sites of five human CBS mRNA isoforms, among which CBS-1a and -1b form the vast majority of transcripts and CBS-1b promoter has the greatest promoter activity (18Kraus J.P. Oliveriusová J. Sokolová J. Kraus E. Vlcek C. de Franchis R. Maclean K.N. Bao L. Bukovsk Patterson D. Paces V. Ansorge W. Kozich V.

Several transcription factors, Sp1/Sp3, nuclear factor Y, and upstream stimulatory factor 1, have been suggested as potential transactivators for the human CBS-1b basal promoter (20Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem.

The significance of Sp1/Sp3-binding sites has been confirmed in human cells to be responsible for the predominant regulation of CBS-1b promoter activity (20Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). According to the 5′-end DNA sequence of rat gene, there are two homologous Sp1-binding sites in the promoter region of the CBS gene (23Roper M.D. Straubhaar J.R. Kraus E. Sokolová J. Hrebícek M. Kraus J.P. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the transcriptional regulation of CBS expression in rodents.Kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury is often experienced by patients in the perioperative period, which leads to a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Ischemia/reperfusion injury is a result of decreased blood flow to the tissue followed by restoration of blood flow to the ischemic area. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a common clinical finding in patients with chronic kidney disease or acute renal failure (24Friedman A.N. Bostom A.G. Selhub J. Levey A.S. Rosenberg I.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2181-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have investigated the role of CBS in Hcy and H2S metabolism in a rat model with kidney ischemia/reperfusion (16Xu Z. Prathapasinghe G. Wu N. Hwang S.Y. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F27-F35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol.

Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ischemia/reperfusion causes a reduction of CBS activity leading to Hcy accumulation in the kidney (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hcy, at elevated levels, exacerbates oxidative stress and cell death in the kidney (25Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 292: F1354-F1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have also observed that ischemia/reperfusion leads to a reduction of H2S levels in the kidney (16Xu Z. Prathapasinghe G. Wu N. Hwang S.Y. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F27-F35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Administration of exogenous H2S donor or anti-Hcy antibodies reduces ischemia/reperfusion-induced cell death and significantly improves kidney function (16Xu Z. Prathapasinghe G. Wu N. Hwang S.Y. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F27-F35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2007; 292: F1354-F1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although metabolic acidosis and nitric oxide accumulation contribute to the reduced CBS activity in the kidney, the correction of pH and removal of excess nitric oxide cannot fully restore CBS activity (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of CBS activity in the kidney.The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which CBS expression was regulated in the kidney during ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results demonstrated that ischemia/reperfusion caused a reduction of CBS mRNA gene expression leading to a decrease in CBS protein levels and enzyme activity. Further analysis revealed that ischemia/reperfusion-induced reduction in CBS expression was due to a decrease in the transcriptional regulation by transcription factor Sp1. Activation of ERK resulted in increased phosphorylation of Sp1, which accounted for decreased transcriptional activation of CBS gene expression in the kidney during ischemia/reperfusion.DISCUSSIONCBS plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of Hcy and H2S in our bodies. Perturbations of CBS activity can lead to an imbalance in Hcy and H2S metabolism. The results obtained from the present study have identified a novel mechanism by which CBS is regulated in the kidney during ischemia/reperfusion. Sp1 is found to play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of CBS gene expression in the kidney. Increased phosphorylation of Sp1 is mediated via ERK, which in turn contributes to a reduced DNA binding activity of Sp1 and subsequently a decrease in the CBS gene expression. As a consequence, there is a significant decrease in CBS enzyme activity, causing an elevation of the Hcy level and a decline of the H2S level in the kidney.The CBS activity is tightly regulated at the transcriptional (20Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Ge Y. Konrad M.A. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and post-translational (41Zou C.G. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16802-16808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) levels. In the present study, upon ischemia/reperfusion, both the CBS mRNA and protein levels in the kidney were significantly decreased. A reduction of CBS expression was also detected in kidney proximal tubular cells. Several lines of evidence suggested that Sp1 was directly involved in the down-regulation of CBS gene expression in the kidney. First, the EMSA demonstrated that the DNA binding activity of Sp1 was markedly reduced in the kidney upon ischemia/reperfusion. Second, results from the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed a significant decrease in the binding of Sp1 to the promoter region of CBS gene in the kidney subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. Third, the role of Sp1 in the transcriptional regulation of CBS gene expression was further investigated in tubular cells that were transiently transfected with Sp1 siRNA. Inhibition of Sp1 activation caused a marked reduction of CBS gene expression in those cells. Although a few transcriptional factors, such as Sp1, Sp3, nuclear factor Y, and upstream stimulatory factor 1, have been suggested to regulate the expression of the human CBS gene (20Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), only two homologous Sp1 sites have been identified in the promoter region of the rodent CBS gene (23Roper M.D. Straubhaar J.R. Kraus E. Sokolová J. Hrebícek M. Kraus J.P. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Currently, little information is available regarding the regulation of CBS expression in rats. The results from the present study suggested that Sp1 played an important role in regulating CBS gene expression in the rat kidney. Decreased transcriptional activity of Sp1 upon ischemia/reperfusion led to a significant reduction of CBS expression in the kidney.Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed 778-amino acid transcription factor that recognizes the GC-rich sequences in the promoters of eukaryotic genes (42Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As shown in the present study, the critical and indispensable role of Sp1 in the regulation of rat CBS expression in the kidney is in agreement with its role in regulating human CBS expression in other tissues or cells reported in previous studies (20Ge Y. Matherly L.H. Taub J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43570-43579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Maclean K.N. Kraus E. Kraus J.P. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2002; 192: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and glycosylation, have been indicated as important mechanisms in the regulation of Sp1 binding to the promoter regions of targeted genes (44Majumdar G. Harrington A. Hungerford J. Martinez-Hernandez A. Gerling I.C. Raghow R. Solomon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 45Tan N.Y. Khachigian L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2483-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Sp1 protein can be phosphorylated at various sites leading to changes in the DNA binding and its transcriptional activity (40Lacroix I. Lipcey C. Imbert J. Kahn-Perlès B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9598-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 45Tan N.Y. Khachigian L.M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Human Sp1 has 61 putative phosphorylation sites, with 48 of these residues being serine, 10 threonine, and 3 tyrosine (45Tan N.Y. Khachigian L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 2483-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Serine residues in human and rodent Sp1 proteins have been shown to be the most common sites for phosphorylation (42Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 48Liao M. Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1449-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been shown in the liver, hepatoma cells, and lymphocytes that increased phosphorylation of Sp1 leads to a decrease in the Sp1-DNA binding activity and a reduction of the transcriptional activity (40Lacroix I. Lipcey C. Imbert J. Kahn-Perlès B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9598-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 46Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, increased phosphorylation of Sp1 may not always lead to a decrease in its transcriptional activity. It has been reported that Sp1 phosphorylation causes an increase in the Sp1-DNA binding activity in rat endothelial cells (49Yun S. Dardik A. Haga M. Yamashita A. Yamaguchi S. Koh Y. Madri J.A. Sumpio B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34808-34814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of Sp1-DNA binding and transcriptional activity by phosphorylation may be tissue- and cell-specific. To examine whether ischemia/reperfusion altered the phosphorylation status of Sp1 in the kidney, we performed an immunoprecipitation with anti-Sp1 antibodies followed by Western immunoblotting analysis with anti-phosphoserine antibodies. Serine-phosphorylation of Sp1 was significantly increased in the kidney subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. It has been reported that phosphorylation of Sp1 can be achieved through MAP kinase pathways such as ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), or p38 in different types of cells and in various disease models (50Milanini-Mongiat J. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20631-20639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 51Benasciutti E. Pagès G. Kenzior O. Folk W. Blasi F. Crippa M.P.

However, which MAP kinase pathway is involved in the phosphorylation of Sp1 remains elusive. In the present study, the ERK activity was markedly elevated in the kidney subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. Treatment of tubular cells with PD98059, an inhibitor that prevents ERK activation, not only restored ischemia/reperfusion-impaired Sp1-DNA binding activity but also corrected CBS expression in those cells. Taken together, these results suggested that an increased ERK-mediated phosphorylation in Sp1 might represent one of the mechanisms that account for a reduction of Sp1-DNA binding activity and subsequently a decrease in CBS expression in the kidney upon ischemia/reperfusion.CBS is a pyridoxal-5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme in which heme is a cofactor associated with its N-terminal domain (17Meier M. Janosik M. Kery V. Kraus J.P. Burkhard P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3910-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Heme acts as a redox sensor to regulate CBS activity, and changes in the redox status of heme can affect CBS activity (41Zou C.G. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16802-16808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 53Taoka S. Ohja S. Shan X. Kruger W.D. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25179-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). From acidic to physiological pH, heme in the CBS is in the ferric form, whereas at alkaline pH, heme is in the ferrous form, which predominates in the more active form of CBS (54Pazicni S. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Oliveriusová J. Rees K.A. Parks R.B. Clark R.W. Rodgers K.R. Kraus J.P. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14684-14695Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have detected a higher CBS activity in the kidney tissue with pH levels ranging from 7.5 to 9.0, and the optimum enzyme activity was at pH 8.5 (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The pH is decreased in the kidney during the ischemia period because of metabolic acidosis, which in turn causes a significant reduction of CBS activity (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Correction of pH by an alkaline solution could partially restore the CBS activity and reduce cell death (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Apart from ischemia-induced acidosis, there is a marked increase in NO production in the kidney during the reperfusion period (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide can interact with the heme in the CBS especially under alkaline conditions, causing an inhibition of CBS activity (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 55Taoka S. Banerjee R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 87: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we have found that during the reperfusion period, the pH in the kidney increases, thus rendering the CBS more susceptible to nitric oxide inhibition (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Administration of nitric oxide scavenger partially restores the CBS activity and hence reduces Hcy levels (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and increases H2S levels (16Xu Z. Prathapasinghe G. Wu N. Hwang S.Y. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F27-F35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in the kidney. However, correction of tissue pH and scavenging of excess nitric oxide are unable to fully restore ischemia/reperfusion impaired CBS activity (26Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. Xu Z. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results indicate that additional mechanism(s) might be involved in the regulation of CBS activity in the kidney. The results obtained from the present study unveiled that reduced CBS gene expression might constitute an important molecular mechanism responsible for the reduction of CBS activity in the kidney upon ischemia/reperfusion, which in turn led to an accumulation of Hcy and a reduction of H2S in the kidney (16Xu Z. Prathapasinghe G. Wu N. Hwang S.Y. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F27-F35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Prathapasinghe G.A. Siow Y.L. O K. Am. J. Physiol.

Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F912-F922Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In summary, the present study, for the first time, has identified a novel mechanism accounting for a reduced CBS expression in the kidney during ischemia/reperfusion. Increased Sp1 phosphorylation via ERK activation resulted in a decreased Sp1 transcriptional regulation of CBS gene expression in the kidney upon ischemia/reperfusion. As a consequence, the CBS-mediated Hcy and H2S metabolism is impaired, leading to a significant increase in the Hcy level and a marked decrease in the H2S level in the kidney. Such an imbalance in Hcy and H2S homeostasis contributes to ischemia/reperfusion-induced kidney injury. Better understanding the unique pathways that regulate CBS activity will help preserve the function of this enzyme in balancing Hcy and H2S homeostasis in the kidney.

Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS, EC 4.2.1.22) is a key enzyme that regulates the metabolism of Hcy and H2S (1Eto K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42680-42685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hcy is an intermediate amino acid formed during the conversion of methionine to cysteine and is central to the supply of methyl groups that are critical to normal cell function. Hcy can be metabolized via two major pathways, namely the remethylation pathway (remethylation of Hcy to methionine) and the trans-sulfuration pathway (trans-sulfuration of Hcy to cysteine) (2Wang L. Jhee K.H. Hua X. DiBello P.M. Jacobsen D.W. Kruger W.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CBS catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the trans-sulfuration pathway (2Wang L. Jhee K.H. Hua X. DiBello P.M. Jacobsen D.W. Kruger W.D. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When Hcy metabolism is impaired, an increase in its concentration in the blood occurs, a condition termed hyperhomocysteinemia.

https://openalex.org/W2066755643,"Our goal was to identify the reaction catalyzed by NAT8 (N-acetyltransferase 8), a putative N-acetyltransferase homologous to the enzyme (NAT8L) that produces N-acetylaspartate in brain. The almost exclusive expression of NAT8 in kidney and liver and its predicted association with the endoplasmic reticulum suggested that it was cysteinyl-S-conjugate N-acetyltransferase, the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the last step of mercapturic acid formation. In agreement, HEK293T extracts of cells overexpressing NAT8 catalyzed the N-acetylation of S-benzyl-l-cysteine and leukotriene E4, two cysteine conjugates, but were inactive on other physiological amines or amino acids. Confocal microscopy indicated that NAT8 was associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Neither of the two frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms found in NAT8, E104K nor F143S, changed the enzymatic activity or the expression of the protein by ≥2-fold, whereas a mutation (R149K) replacing an extremely conserved arginine suppressed the activity. Sequencing of genomic DNA and EST clones corresponding to the NAT8B gene, which resulted from duplication of the NAT8 gene in the primate lineage, disclosed the systematic presence of a premature stop codon at codon 16. Furthermore, truncated NAT8B and NAT8 proteins starting from the following methionine (Met-25) showed no cysteinyl-S-conjugate N-acetyltransferase activity when transfected in HEK293T cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that NAT8 is involved in mercapturic acid formation and confirm that NAT8B is an inactive gene in humans. NAT8 homologues are found in all vertebrate genomes, where they are often encoded by multiple, tandemly repeated genes as many other genes encoding xenobiotic metabolism enzymes.

Taken together, these findings indicate that NAT8 is involved in mercapturic acid formation and confirm that NAT8B is an inactive gene in humans. NAT8 homologues are found in all vertebrate genomes, where they are often encoded by multiple, tandemly repeated genes as many other genes encoding xenobiotic metabolism enzymes."

The mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70) machinery components are highly conserved among eukaryotes, including humans. However, the functional properties of human mtHsp70 machinery components have not been characterized among all eukaryotic families. To study the functional interactions, we have reconstituted the components of the mtHsp70 chaperone machine (Hsp70/J-protein/GrpE/Hep) and systematically analyzed in vitro conditions for biochemical functions. We observed that the sequence-specific interaction of human mtHsp70 toward mitochondrial client proteins differs significantly from its yeast counterpart Ssc1. Interestingly, the helical lid of human mtHsp70 was found dispensable to the binding of P5 peptide as compared with the other Hsp70s. We observed that the two human mitochondrial matrix J-protein splice variants differentially regulate the mtHsp70 chaperone cycle. Strikingly, our results demonstrated that human Hsp70 escort protein (Hep) possesses a unique ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 as well as to prevent the aggregation of unfolded client proteins similar to J-proteins. We observed that Hep binds with the C terminus of mtHsp70 in a full-length context and this interaction is distinctly different from unfolded client-specific or J-protein binding. In addition, we found that the interaction of Hep at the C terminus of mtHsp70 is regulated by the helical lid region. However, the interaction of Hep at the ATPase domain of the human mtHsp70 is mutually exclusive with J-proteins, thus promoting a similar conformational change that leads to ATPase stimulation.

IntroductionMitochondria are ubiquitous, complex, and essential organelles of eukaryotes. Several biochemical reactions in iron metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, urea metabolism, nucleotide biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation are carried out within this organelle (1Hatefi Y.

The mtHsp70s are the most abundant and are usually present as one or two copies in the mammalian mitochondrial matrix compartment (9Kaul S.C. Deocaris C.C. Wadhwa R. Exp.

In the mammalian system, human mtHsp70 is commonly referred to as “mortalin” or glucose-regulated protein (GRP75) (11Bhattacharyya T. Karnezis A.N. Murphy S.P. Hoang T. Freeman B.C. Phillips B.

The mouse mitochondrion contains two isoforms of mtHsp70 termed as “mot-1” and “mot-2.” Both isoforms are involved in several important cellular processes. In contrast to murines, human mitochondria have only one mtHsp70 encoded by the HSPA9 gene, which functionally corresponds to mouse mot-2 (9Kaul S.C. Deocaris C.C. Wadhwa R. Exp.

DNA Res. 2000; 7: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, in human mitochondria, there are two members of type-I class Hsp40 isoforms reported, which are usually referred to as hTid-1L (Larger isoform) and hTid-1S (Smaller isoform). However, the physiological importance of these two J-proteins is still unclear (13Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The different nucleotide states of human mtHsp70 are regulated by the nucleotide exchange factor: human GrpEL1 (14Choglay A.A.

U.S.A. 1994; 91: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Similarly, a mammalian mitochondrion also possesses an ortholog of recently discovered “yeast Zim17” termed as hsp70 escort protein, “Hep” (16Burri L. Vascotto K. Fredersdorf S. Tiedt R. Hall M.N.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The physiological role of Hep in human mitochondrial matrix compartment is poorly understood. In vivo, the functional cycle of interaction of an unfolded mitochondrial client protein is initiated in the ATP-bound state of mtHsp70. The binding of the client protein in the peptide binding cleft and simultaneous interaction of J-domains of J-proteins with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 results in ATP hydrolysis, and thus stabilizes the interaction of a client polypeptide by converting Hsp70 to the ADP-bound state (18Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Nucleotide release factors cause exchange of ADP for ATP, resulting in dissociation of bound clients, and prime Hsp70 for a second cycle of interaction (19Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C.

Genomics. 2009; 9: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).In the mammalian system, the mtHsp70 machinery plays a very critical functional role for protein quality control in the matrix compartment, thereby regulating mitochondria biogenesis. Importantly, the altered expression and specific mutations in the mtHsp70 chaperone machinery lead to severe mitochondrial disorders. In humans, the levels of mtHsp70 are highly up-regulated in all types of tumors and have been used as biomarkers to detect tumor invasiveness (22Wadhwa R. Takano S. Kaur K. Deocaris C.C. Pereira-Smith O.M. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Reduced expression of mtHsp70 is commonly observed in Parkinson disease and other age-related diseases leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (23Leverenz J.B. Umar I. Wang Q. Montine T.J. McMillan P.J. Tsuang D.W. Jin J. Pan C. Shin J. Zhu D. Zhang J. Brain Pathol. 2007; 17: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, a single point mutation in the C-terminal region of mtHsp70 (G492E, referred as MDS mutant) is associated with a hematopoietic defect similar to the myelodysplastic syndrome, presumably due to loss of chaperone function (24Craven S.E. French D. Ye W. de Sauvage F. Rosenthal A. Blood. 2005; 105: 3528-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that altered expression of mammalian Hsp40 isoforms (hTid-1L and hTid-1S) leads to several cellular phenotypes, including apoptosis, malignancy, and cardiac-related disorders such as dilated cardiomyopathic syndrome (13Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Hayashi M. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Wood M. Fearns C. Tatake R.J. Lee J.D. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite these critical cellular roles, little functional information at the biochemical level of human mtHsp70 chaperone machinery is available.To address the functional importance of mammalian mtHsp70 chaperone machinery components in mitochondria biogenesis, we have undertaken the reconstitution of the human mtHsp70 machine to analyze its unique properties at the biochemical level as compared with the well explored model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our studies identified several novel biochemical features that are distinct from other Hsp70 systems and are critical for the mammalian mitochondrial function. Although mtHsp70 is highly conserved across species, we observed significant differences in sequence-specific binding toward mitochondrial client proteins and the mechanism of regulation through co-chaperones such as J-proteins. From our results, it is evident that such changes are mainly attributable to overall variations in the architecture of the substrate binding domain acquired during the evolution. Additionally, we have unraveled several novel properties of Hep, such as its unique nature to stimulate ATPase activity of mtHsp70 as well as prevention of aggregation of non-native unfolded proteins. By reconstitution analysis, we have uncovered several biochemical defects associated with the MDS mutant to understand the functional relevance of mtHsp70 machinery in disease conditions.DISCUSSIONOur major goal in this study was to understand the molecular mechanism of action of various components of the mitochondrial chaperone machine in human mitochondria. To gain insights into the molecular mechanism of mammalian mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone function, we reconstituted and analyzed the chaperone properties of the human mtHsp70 chaperone machine components utilizing well established in vitro biochemical tests. Our analysis reveals four distinct and novel biochemical aspects that are important for understanding the chaperone function of human mtHsp70 and its co-chaperones.The first aspect reveals a sequence-specific interaction of human mtHsp70 with the peptide substrates derived from mitochondrial targeting sequences of client proteins. Importantly, human mtHsp70 shows very weak affinity toward shorter and less hydrophobic peptide substrates such as P5, whereas it shows higher affinity toward larger peptides that contain more hydrophobic sequences, such as Cox4 when compared with yeast Ssc1. Notably, C-terminal helical lid deletion mutants were able to interact with the P5 peptide close to the wild type level, indicating that the SBD of human mtHsp70 possesses a partial open conformation as compared with E. coli DnaK and Ssc1. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the lidless variant of DnaK showed 5-fold enhanced koff in ADP-bound state as compared with wild type DnaK, thus promoting it into open conformation (44Buczynski G. Slepenkov S.V. Sehorn M.G. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27231-27236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, our data indicates that the lidless variant of human mtHsp70 exhibits ∼2.5-fold lower koff for P5 as compared with wild type. Therefore, we speculate that the overall fold and relative orientation of a 6- amino acid shorter helical lid over the SBD of human mtHsp70 significantly differs when compared with other Hsp70s.The second aspect demonstrates the mechanism of regulation of the chaperone activity of human mtHsp70 by J-protein splice variants: hTid-1L and hTid-1S. Our analysis shows that hTid-1S is more efficient in regulating the ATPase cycle of mtHsp70 due to its robust stimulating activity as compared with hTid-1L. This raises an intriguing question about the involvement of 33 amino acids from the C-terminal end of hTid-1L in negatively regulating its ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70. On the other hand, it is possible that an insertion of 6 new amino acids at the C terminus of hTid-1S leads to gain of function, thus stimulating more efficiently. Also, both J-protein isoforms displayed differential abilities in preventing aggregation of denatured rhodanese. The functional differences between these two J-protein variants may be the primary reason for opposite phenotypes seen at the cellular level as reported (13Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Third, our analysis uncovers a detailed novel mechanism in which the Hep protein modulates the chaperone function of human mtHsp70. Our observation provides the first direct evidence showing that the stability of Hep interaction is also dependent on the C-terminal region of human mtHsp70. Based on our GST pulldown analysis, we hypothesize that C-terminal domain α-helices C, D, and E are directly involved in negatively regulating the Hep interaction in wild type protein. This is supported by two important observations. First, the truncation of C to E α-helices enhances the interaction of Hep in the case of the M600 deletion mutant. Second, a restoration of the wild type level of interaction in M584 and M555 deletion mutants suggests that amino acids from 584 to 600 might be critical for Hep binding at the C terminus of human mtHsp70. Similarly, an enhanced interaction with Hep was also observed in arch or SBD human mtHsp70 cleft mutants due to retention of C-terminal contact sites, comprised of amino acids 584 to 600 in these mutants. However, the negative regulation by C-terminal C, D, and E α-helices may largely be ineffective in mutant proteins due to alteration in the positioning of these helices relative to the β-sandwich domain.On the other hand, we do not rule out the possibility that deletion of α-helices (C, D, and E) may overall influence the relative orientation of the SBD and ATPase domain of human mtHsp70 by altering the position of the interdomain linker region, thus promoting a favorable conformation for better Hep binding in M600 and arch/cleft point mutants. Recent experimental evidences are in favor of this hypothesis wherein the interdomain linker region has been shown to play a critical role for binding Zim17 to the ATPase domain of mtHsp70 in yeast (45Blamowska M. Sichting M. Mapa K. Mokranjac D. Neupert W. Hell K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4423-4431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Such rearrangements in the domain interface in mutants may promote a higher propensity to generate self-aggregation prone conformers in non-nucleotide or the ATP-bound state thereby enhancing their binding with Hep protein. Also, the functional significance of C-terminal D and E α-helices is well established in bacterial DnaK (46Slepenkov S.V. Patchen B. Peterson K.M. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5867-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our result emphasize the importance of C, D, and E α-helices in regulating the interaction of Hep with mtHsp70 in human mitochondria.The nature of Hep interaction at the C terminus of wild type human mtHsp70 is unique and distinct from substrates or J-proteins. Two biochemical evidences presented here support our hypothesis. 1) The preformed Hep-human mtHsp70 complex in the presence or absence of nucleotides is not destabilized by excess levels of P5 peptide, indicating its different nature of interaction at the C terminus. 2) All deletion and point mutants of human mtHsp70 significantly retained their ability to stimulate ATPase activity as compared with J-proteins. However, the increased Hep interaction with the human mtHsp70 mutants did not show significant enhancement in stimulation of ATPase activity. We speculate that the physical interaction through the C terminus of human mtHsp70 is dispensable for modulating the conformational changes necessary for activation of the ATPase domain to hydrolyze the ATP.Interestingly, despite the absence of J-domain, Hep showed a unique ability to stimulate ATPase activity of human mtHsp70. However, we conclusively rule out the possibility of Hep functioning as a nucleotide exchange factor, as speculated earlier based on the stimulatory activity of Hep observed in single turnover experiments (26Zhai P. Stanworth C. Liu S. Silberg J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26098-26106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our biochemical data demonstrate that the mechanism of Hep action closely resembles the type-I J-protein function. To further confirm the specificity of stimulation, we have identified critical amino acid residues of the N terminus of human mtHsp70 that are essential for inducing the conformational changes during ATP hydrolysis. Surprisingly, these residues were found canonical with those that are essential for J-protein stimulation by DnaJ and hTid-1S for E. coli DnaK and human mtHsp70, respectively. Besides, binding of hTid-1S can be competed out by Hep or vice versa, indicating that the interaction sites of these two proteins at the ATPase domain of human mtHsp70 are mutually exclusive. The overlap in binding sites between Hep and hTid-1S indicates that they may induce similar conformational changes in the ATPase domain that results in acceleration of ATP hydrolysis. However, the rate at which they couple conformational changes to the ATP hydrolysis in the chaperone cycle might differ due to differences in ATPase stimulation activities between them.Besides interacting with Hsp70 partner proteins, our in vitro biochemical experiments reveal that Hep also possesses human mtHsp70-independent functions. For example, Hep exhibits bona fide chaperone activity, because it can bind unfolded substrates such as rhodanese, preventing its aggregation even in the absence of the Hsp70 partner protein similar to type-I J-proteins. Based on these chaperone-specific functions performed by Hep, we propose that Hep represents a member of a new class of co-chaperone for Hsp70 evolved for higher eukaryotic mitochondria biogenesis. However, the specific mitochondrial client protein other than Hsp70 requiring the assistance of Hep to prevent aggregation in response to various physiological stress stimuli is yet to be elucidated.The fourth aspect focuses on understanding the chaperone-specific functional defects associated with MDS mutant. The mutant shows significant defects in interacting with J-protein co-chaperones (hTid-1S and hTid-1L) as well as the reduced rate of nucleotide exchange ability by GrpEL1. The basal ATPase activity is significantly elevated and together with the loss of stimulation by client peptides indicates an interdomain communication defect associated with this novel loop mutant. Therefore, we hypothesize that the loss of mtHsp70 activity in the MDS mutant impedes the import of many precursor proteins and their subsequent folding in the matrix leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results establish that the loss of chaperone function may be the leading cause of myelodysplastic syndrome. To evaluate the importance of this residue in other Hsp70s, we made a similar mutation at the corresponding position in yeast Ssc1, which resulted in a lethal phenotype signifying the importance of this residue in the proper functioning of mtHsp70. 3A. V. Goswami, B. Chittoor, and P. D'Silva, unpublished data. Our biochemical insights will provide further understanding of this syndrome at the physiological level.In summary, our results establish and highlight several unique and distinct biochemical features of the human mitochondrial chaperone machine (mtHsp70/J-protein/GrpE/Hep) that are critically required for protein quality control in the mitochondrial matrix. Additionally, it confirms the need for multiple co-chaperones for proper mitochondria biogenesis required for fulfilling cellular demands in the mammalian system. Besides, our investigation also provides key insights to connect the involvement of chaperone function in a diseased state such as myelodysplastic syndrome. Together, our results provide a better platform for the future investigation on mtHsp70-based therapeutic design in treating various mitochondrial disorders.

Similarly, a mammalian mitochondrion also possesses an ortholog of recently discovered “yeast Zim17” termed as hsp70 escort protein, “Hep” (16Burri L. Vascotto K. Fredersdorf S. Tiedt R. Hall M.N.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The physiological role of Hep in human mitochondrial matrix compartment is poorly understood. In vivo, the functional cycle of interaction of an unfolded mitochondrial client protein is initiated in the ATP-bound state of mtHsp70. The binding of the client protein in the peptide binding cleft and simultaneous interaction of J-domains of J-proteins with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 results in ATP hydrolysis, and thus stabilizes the interaction of a client polypeptide by converting Hsp70 to the ADP-bound state (18Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar). Nucleotide release factors cause exchange of ADP for ATP, resulting in dissociation of bound clients, and prime Hsp70 for a second cycle of interaction (19Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C.

Importantly, the altered expression and specific mutations in the mtHsp70 chaperone machinery lead to severe mitochondrial disorders. In humans, the levels of mtHsp70 are highly up-regulated in all types of tumors and have been used as biomarkers to detect tumor invasiveness (22Wadhwa R. Takano S. Kaur K. Deocaris C.C. Pereira-Smith O.M. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 2973-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Reduced expression of mtHsp70 is commonly observed in Parkinson disease and other age-related diseases leading to mitochondrial dysfunction (23Leverenz J.B. Umar I. Wang Q. Montine T.J. McMillan P.J. Tsuang D.W. Jin J. Pan C. Shin J. Zhu D. Zhang J. Brain Pathol. 2007; 17: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, a single point mutation in the C-terminal region of mtHsp70 (G492E, referred as MDS mutant) is associated with a hematopoietic defect similar to the myelodysplastic syndrome, presumably due to loss of chaperone function (24Craven S.E. French D. Ye W. de Sauvage F. Rosenthal A. Blood. 2005; 105: 3528-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that altered expression of mammalian Hsp40 isoforms (hTid-1L and hTid-1S) leads to several cellular phenotypes, including apoptosis, malignancy, and cardiac-related disorders such as dilated cardiomyopathic syndrome (13Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Hayashi M. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Wood M. Fearns C. Tatake R.J. Lee J.D. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite these critical cellular roles, little functional information at the biochemical level of human mtHsp70 chaperone machinery is available.To address the functional importance of mammalian mtHsp70 chaperone machinery components in mitochondria biogenesis, we have undertaken the reconstitution of the human mtHsp70 machine to analyze its unique properties at the biochemical level as compared with the well explored model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our studies identified several novel biochemical features that are distinct from other Hsp70 systems and are critical for the mammalian mitochondrial function. Although mtHsp70 is highly conserved across species, we observed significant differences in sequence-specific binding toward mitochondrial client proteins and the mechanism of regulation through co-chaperones such as J-proteins. From our results, it is evident that such changes are mainly attributable to overall variations in the architecture of the substrate binding domain acquired during the evolution. Additionally, we have unraveled several novel properties of Hep, such as its unique nature to stimulate ATPase activity of mtHsp70 as well as prevention of aggregation of non-native unfolded proteins. By reconstitution analysis, we have uncovered several biochemical defects associated with the MDS mutant to understand the functional relevance of mtHsp70 machinery in disease conditions."

Here we report on the ability of exogenous GrB to insert into and function within a proteinase K-resistant mitochondrial compartment. We identified Hax-1 (HS-1-associated protein X-1), a mitochondrial protein involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, as a GrB substrate within the mitochondrion. GrB cleaves Hax-1 into two major fragments: an N-terminal fragment that localizes to mitochondria and a C-terminal fragment that localizes to the cytosol after being released from GrB-treated mitochondria. The N-terminal Hax-1 fragment major cellular impact is on the regulation of mitochondrial polarization. Overexpression of wild-type Hax-1 or its uncleavable mutant form protects the mitochondria against GrB or valinomycin-mediated depolarization. The N-terminal Hax-1 fragment functions as a dominant negative form of Hax-1, mediating mitochondrial depolarization in a cyclophilin D-dependent manner. Thus, induced expression of the N-terminal Hax-1 fragment results in mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent lysosomal degradation of such altered mitochondria.

The capacity of GrB to initiate a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade that features permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and release of apoptogenic proteins has been tied directly to cleavage of Bid (7.Casciola-Rosen L.

GrB-generated tBid activates the downstream executioners of the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade, Bax and/or Bak (11.Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). However, mitochondria of Bid-deficient cells continue to release cytochrome c in response to GrB, suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism(s). Our recent studies demonstrated that GrB induces a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade by cleaving Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that resides on the mitochondrial outer membrane in a complex with a potent proapoptotic BH3-only protein, Bim. GrB-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 releases sequestered Bim, allowing the execution of a distinct apoptotic cascade (12.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol.

The mitochondrial function of BH3-only proteins, including Bid and Bim, is strictly Bax/Bak-dependent (14.Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes.

Accordingly, Bax/Bak-deficient cells are relatively resistant to GrB-mediated apoptosis, but mitochondria continue to undergo significant depolarization that cannot be attributed to currently described mechanisms of GrB-mediated apoptosis (10.Pardo J.

Mitochondrial polarization (i.e. maintenance of its inner membrane potential) is ultimately controlled by the mechanisms responsible for the opening of a multiprotein pore, the permeability transition pore (PTP), at the contact sites between the outer and the inner mitochondrial membranes (17.Tsujimoto Y. Nakagawa T. Shimizu S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1297-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The PTP complex is putatively composed of a voltage-dependent anion channel at the outer mitochondrial membrane, adenine nucleotide translocase in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and cyclophilin D (Cyp-D), a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase in the mitochondrial matrix. Recent studies involving knock-out mice for each of these components provided evidence that only Cyp-D represents a necessary regulatory component for the PTP opening mechanism, whereas adenine nucleotide translocase and voltage-dependent anion channel participate in the process to a limited extent (18.Nakagawa T.

Disruption in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) due to the opening of the PTP has profound consequences for mitochondrial respiration, energy production, and hence, cell survival. Recent studies have shown that Hax-1 is essential for maintenance of the MMP in myeloid and epithelial cells (23.Klein C. Grudzien M. Appaswamy G. Germeshausen M. Sandrock I. Schäffer A.A. Rathinam C. Boztug K. Schwinzer B. Rezaei N. Bohn G. Melin M. Carlsson G. Fadeel B. Dahl N. Palmblad J. Henter J.I. Zeidler C. Grimbacher B. Welte K. Nat.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50295-50301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Hax-1 was originally identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen, associating with HS-1 (hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1), a major substrate for tyrosine kinase activity (25.Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Kitamura D. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar). Hax-1 possesses two Bcl-2 homology domains BH1 and BH2, a PEST sequence, and a putative transmembrane domain. In addition, Hax-1 has limited sequence similarity to BNIP3, a BH3-only protein that is up-regulated in response to oxidative stress. Hax-1 is reportedly cleaved by the mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2, a serine protease that is released into the cytosol during apoptosis to antagonize inhibitors of apoptosis (24.Cilenti L. Soundarapandian M.M. Kyriazis G.A. Stratico V. Singh S. Gupta S. Bonventre J.V. Alnemri E.S. Zervos A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50295-50301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the biological significance of Omi/HtrA2-mediated Hax-1 cleavage is not fully understood. Hax-1 has also been identified as an endogenous inhibitor of caspase-9 in cardiac myocytes (26.Han Y. Chen Y.S. Liu Z. Bodyak N. Rigor D. Bisping E. Pu W.T. Kang P.M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia resulting from a homozygous germ line mutation in Hax-1 is associated with increased apoptosis in myeloid cells (23.Klein C. Grudzien M. Appaswamy G. Germeshausen M. Sandrock I. Schäffer A.A. Rathinam C. Boztug K. Schwinzer B. Rezaei N. Bohn G. Melin M. Carlsson G. Fadeel B. Dahl N. Palmblad J. Henter J.I. Zeidler C.

Why a null mutation of a ubiquitously expressed gene causes a myeloid-specific phenotype is unclear. Current speculation suggests that the tissue-specific effect of Hax-1 may be due to intrinsic differences in the regulation of apoptosis in neutrophils. However, compared with fibroblasts from normal donors, stressed Hax-1-deficient fibroblasts from severe congenital neutropenia patients showed a more rapid loss of their membrane potential, suggesting that Hax-1-mediated stabilization of the MMP is not limited to neutrophils (23.Klein C. Grudzien M. Appaswamy G. Germeshausen M. Sandrock I. Schäffer A.A. Rathinam C. Boztug K. Schwinzer B. Rezaei N. Bohn G. Melin M. Carlsson G. Fadeel B. Dahl N. Palmblad J. Henter J.I. Zeidler C. Grimbacher B. Welte K. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Indeed, the likelihood that Hax-1 acts as a mitochondrial antiapoptotic protein in other cells has been verified by a Hax-1-null mouse model (28.Chao J.R. Parganas E. Boyd K. Hong C.Y. Opferman J.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 2008; 452: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Loss of Hax-1 resulted in postnatal lethality as well as lymphocyte and neuron apoptosis. Hax-1 interacts with mitochondrial proteases Parl and Omi/HtrA2. These interactions enable Hax-1 to present HtrA2 to Parl and thereby facilitate the processing of HtrA2 to an active protease localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. It has been further determined that in lymphocytes, the presence of processed HtrA2 delays the accumulation of mitochondrial outer membrane-associated activated Bax. Promotion of cell survival by Hax-1 was also elucidated in cardiomyocytes, where it functions in the regulation of calcium signaling through dynamic interactions with phospholamban and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) (29.Vafiadaki E.

In the current study, we show that GrB is targeted to mitochondria and that Hax-1 is processed by GrB within a proteinase K-resistant mitochondrial compartment. Hax-1 cleavage by GrB generates a two-pronged assault on the conservation of the MMP; it eliminates antiapoptotic full-length Hax-1 and produces an N-terminal fragment that functions to disrupt the MMP and to enhance the outer membrane permeability for the release of apoptogenic proteins. Human GrB was purified from cytolytic granules of the human YT NK cell line, as described previously (36.Hanna W.L. Zhang X. Turbov J. Winkler U. Hudig D. Froelich C.J. Protein Expr.

Chem. 2006; 281: 14314-14320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was obtained from Ambion as a Custom Select siRNA along with the Silencer Select Negative Control 1. In addition, three distinct Cyp-D siRNAs and their negative control (with matching GC content) were obtained from Invitrogen as the Stealth Select 3 RNAi reagent (HSS115357-9) and the Stealth RNAi Negative Control Med GC, respectively. Transfection of HCT116 and T-REx-293 cells was carried out as described previously (38.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Hou W. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). N-terminal (Edman) radiosequencing of [3H]leucine- and [35S]methionine-labeled Hax-1 fragments generated by GrB digestion of in vitro translated full-length Hax-1 and MALDI mass spectrometry of a tryptic digest of unlabeled Hax-1 also generated by in vitro translation were carried out by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory of Yale University. To obtain an enriched mitochondrial fraction, Jurkat, MCF7, Hct116, or T-REx-293 cells were suspended in mitochondrial buffer (MIB) composed of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and lysed by Dounce homogenization, as described previously (12.Han J.

Briefly, nuclei and debris were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 650 × g, and a pellet containing mitochondria was obtained by two successive spins at 10,000 × g for 12 min. To obtain the cytosolic fraction, the postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To obtain the enriched mitochondrial fraction, the mitochondria-containing pellet was resuspended in MIB and layered on a Percoll gradient consisting of four layers of 10, 18, 30, and 70% Percoll in MIB. After centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g, the mitochondrial fraction was collected at the 30/70 interface. Mitochondria were diluted in MIB containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (at least a 10-fold dilution required to remove Percoll). The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by a 40-min spin at 20,000 × g and used immediately. Purity was assessed by electron microscopy and by enzyme marker analysis, as described previously (38.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Hou W. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinowich H. J.

After treatment with the MitoTracker Deep Red dye according to the manufacturer's instructions, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Images were captured by a confocal Olympus Fluoview 1000 system using a ×100 oil immersion objective with the companion FV10-ASW1.6 imaging software at 25 °C. The digital images were split and merged using ImageJ, and image contrast and brightness were adjusted with Adobe Photoshop. Quantitation of colocalization was measured using Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). For this purpose, two-color confocal micrographs that contain defined positive regions of each protein were segmented using conventional thresholding tools. The thresholded images were compared by simple Boolean math. The numbers of positive pixels for each protein were determined using a logical AND operator, and the percentages of overlay were assessed. Isolation of total RNA from Jurkat T-cells, first strand cDNA synthesis, and PCR were carried out as described previously (38.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Hou W. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A full-length Hax-1 amplicon that extended 9 nucleotides into the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, respectively, was generated with the following primer pair (forward and reverse): 5′-CGCGGATCCAGTACGGGAATGAGCCTC-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAACAAGGCTACCGGGA-3′. The putative Hax-1 amplicon was size-selected on a 1% agarose gel and restriction enzyme-digested with BamHI and SalI (New England Biolabs). The digested Hax-1 amplicon was ligated into either a Tet-inducible vector, pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen), for stable expression in T-REx-293 cells or the constitutive expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) for in vitro translation experiments. Both plasmids had been previously digested with BamHI and XhoI. Following transformation (Escherichia coli Top10F′ (pcDNA4/TO); DH5α (pCR3.1)), randomly picked colonies underwent DNA sequence analysis (University of Pittsburgh DNA Sequencing Core Facility) to confirm sequence integrity. Both single substitution Asp to Ala full-length Hax-1 clones, D148A and D159A, were produced from the WT Hax-1 clone (see above) by overlap extension using PCR. Single point mutations for D148A(GAT → GCT) and D159A(GAC → GCC) were introduced by mutated forward and reverse primers that overlap the specific Asp residue that was changed to Ala. The mutated primer pairs (forward and reverse) for D148A were as follows: 5′-TTGGAGAGTGCTGCAAGAAGTGAATCCCCCCAA-3′ and 5′-ACTTCTTGCAGCACTCTCCAAGACCCCCCCAAA-3′; for D159A, 5′-CCAGCACCAGCCTGGGGCTCCCAGAGGCCATTT-3′ and 5′-GGAGCCCCAGGCTGGTGCTGGTTGGGGGGATTC-3′. PCR, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation to pCR3.1, and sequence analysis to confirm both Asp to Ala conversions were carried out as above. The double mutant D148A/D159A Hax-1 clone was constructed from either single mutation clone (D148A or D159A) by overlap extension using PCR with the same mutated primers described above. PCR, restriction enzyme digestion, ligation to pCR3.1, and sequence analysis to confirm both Asp to Ala conversions were carried out as above. The N- and C-terminal GrB Hax-1 fragment-encoding clones whose cDNA inserts correspond to fragments generated by GrB cleavage at Asp148 were produced from the WT Hax-1 clone. The N-terminal fragment was produced from a primer pair consisting of the forward primer for full-length Hax-1 (see above) and the reverse primer 5′-ACGCGTCGACCTAATCACTCTCCAAGACCCC-3′. The C-terminal fragment was made with the forward primer 5′-CGCGGATCCACGGGAATGGCAAGAAGTGAATCCCCCCAA-3′ and the reverse primer for full-length Hax-1 (see above). The C-terminal GrB fragment containing the D159A mutation was generated with C-terminal fragment primers and the full-length D159A clone (see above). PCR was carried out with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System kit (Roche Applied Science). Restriction enzyme digestion, ligation to pcDNA4/TO or pCR3.1, and sequence verification were as described above for full-length Hax-1. Isolation of total RNA from HeLa cells, and first strand cDNA synthesis using oligo (dT)12–18 and PCR were performed as described (38.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Hou W. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A full-length AIF clone (which encodes the longest isoform of three variants) that extends 6 nucleotides into the 5′-untranslated region and 3 nucleotides into the 3′-untranslated region was produced with the following primer pair (forward and reverse): 5′- CGGGGTACCGCCGAAATGTTCCGGTGTG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCGCTTCAGTCTTCATGAATGTTG-3′. The putative AIF full-length amplicon was size-selected on an agarose gel (0.9%) and digested with KpnI and EcoR I (New England Biolabs). It was ligated into pCR3.1 that had also been digested with KpnI and EcoRI. Following transformation (E. coli DH5α), randomly picked colonies underwent DNA sequence analysis as described above. The cell line T-REx-293 (Invitrogen) (human embryonic kidney cells that stably express the Tet repressor) was stably transfected with the linearized Tet-inducible plasmids pcDNA4/TO, pcDNA4/TO/lacZ (Invitrogen), pcDNA4/ TO/Hax-1 (full-length), pcDNA4/TO/N-Hax-1 (Tet N-Hax-1), and pcDNA4/TO/C-Hax-1 (Tet C-Hax-1). All procedures involving linearization, transfection, and stable clone selection were carried out as described previously (38.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Hou W. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16223-16231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. To prepare cell extracts, cultured cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 20 min, cells (2.5 × 106/0.5 ml) were disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Cellular extracts were obtained as the supernatants resulting from centrifugation to remove nuclei at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Flow cytometry was utilized to measure alterations in MMP and in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The cationic fluorescent dyes 1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzamidazolocarbocyanin iodide (JC-1) and 3,3′-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide (Invitrogen) were utilized for MMP measurement. 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCFDA; Invitrogen) was utilized for measurement of ROS production. The staining was performed according to the manufacturer's procedures, and mitochondrial alterations were quantified by the Beckman Coulter Epics XL-MCL and analyzed with the EXPO32 software. ATP levels were measured by the ATPLite kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's procedure. This method is based on mono-oxygenation of luciferin, catalyzed by luciferase in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and oxygen, resulting in a luminescent signal that is proportional to the ATP concentration. Full-length Hax-1, D148A mutant Hax-1, D159A mutant Hax-1, double mutant D148A/D159A Hax-1, GrB N-terminal (Met1–Asp148) and C-terminal (Ala149–Arg279) Hax-1 fragments as well as the D159A mutant C-terminal Hax-1 fragment cDNAs were expressed in the TNT T7 transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Each coupled transcription-translation reaction contained 1 μg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 50 μl in a methionine-free reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture supplemented with 35S-labeled methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, the reaction products were immediately used or stored at −78 °C. Proteins in cell lysates, cell extracts, mitochondria, cytosol, or nuclei were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Following probing with a specific primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).

During this process, repeated rounds of DNA synthesis are characterized by lack of late anaphase and cytokinesis. Physiologically, the majority of the polyploid megakaryocytes in the bone marrow are cell cycle arrested. As previously reported, cyclin E is essential for megakaryocyte polyploidy; however, it has remained unclear whether up-regulated cyclin E is an inducer of polyploidy in vivo. We found that cyclin E is up-regulated upon stimulation of primary megakaryocytes by thrombopoietin. Transgenic mice in which elevated cyclin E expression is targeted to megakaryocytes display an increased ploidy profile. Examination of S phase markers, specifically proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin A, and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine reveals that cyclin E promotes progression to S phase and cell cycling. Interestingly, analysis of Cdc6 and Mcm2 indicates that cyclin E mediates its effect by promoting the expression of components of the pre-replication complex. Furthermore, we show that up-regulated cyclin E results in the up-regulation of cyclin B1 levels, suggesting an additional mechanism of cyclin E-mediated ploidy increase. These findings define a key role for cyclin E in promoting megakaryocyte entry into S phase and hence, increase in the number of cell cycling cells and in augmenting polyploidization.

Megakaryocytes (MKs) 2The abbreviations used are: MKmegakaryocytepre-RCpre-replication complexPBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleFACSfluorescent-activated cell sortingTgtransgenicWtwild typePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenqRT-PCRquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCRTPOthrombopoietin. are bone marrow precursor cells responsible for the production of platelets, which are renewed on a daily basis (1Balduini C.L. Savoia A. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2004; 30: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a process termed megakaryopoiesis, multipotent hematopoietic stem cells commit toward becoming megakaryocyte progenitors. This is followed by differentiation of progenitors into mature MKs while concomitantly undergoing polyploidization (reviewed in Ref. 2Kaushansky K. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3339-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The major regulator of megakaryopoiesis is thrombopoietin (TPO), which signals through the c-mpl receptor (reviewed in Ref. 3Ravid K. Lu J. Zimmet J.M. Jones M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 4Kaushansky K. Drachman J.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3359-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The maturation of MKs includes both endoreplication (also known as endomitosis or polyploidization) and cytoplasmic maturation (reviewed in Ref. 5Deutsch V.R. Tomer A. Br. J. Haematol. 2006; 134: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The mature MK grows in size severalfold the diameter of a normal diploid (2N) cell and can obtain a DNA content of up to 128N, with the average being 16N (6Kaushansky K. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Tomer A. Blood. 2004; 104: 2722-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). During this process, MKs increase the production of proteins necessary for platelet biogenesis and function (8Paulus J.M. Blood. 1970; 35: 298-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature MKs form proplatelet extensions that fragment and give rise to platelets (9Italiano Jr., J.E. Patel-Hett S. Hartwig J.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). megakaryocyte pre-replication complex phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescent-activated cell sorting transgenic wild type proliferating cell nuclear antigen quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR thrombopoietin. The mechanism by which MKs become polyploid is still not well understood. Following a series of normal cell divisions, MKs enter a cell cycle with a brief G1 phase, followed by a typical S phase and a very short G2 phase (6Kaushansky K. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Next, MKs undergo endoreplication, which represents a mitotic cell cycle that is terminated at the late anaphase stage. Repeated rounds of endoreplication eventually give rise to a polyploid megakaryocyte. The regulatory mechanisms that control polyploidization have been partially explored, with a major focus on the regulation of mitotic phase and cytokinesis (10McCrann D.J. Yezefski T. Nguyen H.G.

Blood. 2009; 114: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As to mitotic regulation, it became clear that it is different in MK cell lines and primary MKs, as the former show decreased levels of cyclin B in polyploid MKs (14Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Wang Z. Liu D.X. Pagano M. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1387-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), while primary MKs display cyclin B during endomitotis (16Roy L. Coullin P. Vitrat N. Hellio R. Debili N.

Vainchenker W. Debili N. Blood. 1998; 91: 3711-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have focused on the G1 phase of the MK cell cycle as a regulatory phase of polyploidy. The first study in this area showed that cyclin D3, which is highly expressed at early G1 phase, is up-regulated in MKs (18Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D3 transgenic mice indicated that overexpression of this cyclin results in an increase in polyploidy (19Zimmet J.M. Ladd D. Jackson C.W. Stenberg P.E. Ravid K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7248-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies using the HEL megakaryocytic cell line showed that G1 phase CDK/cyclin complexes (Cdk2/cyclin D3 and Cdk2/cyclin E) exhibit increased activity during G1 to S phase transition as well as S phase progression (20Datta N.S. Williams J.L. Long M.W. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 639-650PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 overexpression in vivo was also shown to correlate with an increase in MK ploidy level, although in a less pronounced manner than cyclin D3 (21Sun S. Zimmet J.M. Toselli P. Thompson A. Jackson C.W. Ravid K. Haematologica. 2001; 86: 17-23PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of cyclin D1/cdk4 in GATA1-deficient MKs rescues their growth and polyploidization (22Muntean A.G. Pang L. Poncz M. Dowdy S.F. Blobel G.A. Crispino J.D. Blood. 2007; 109: 5199-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cyclin E is a 52-kDa protein that is highly expressed in the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. Its expression is regulated by members of the E2F-transcription factor family (reviewed in Ref. 23Lee M.H. Yang H.Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The mammalian cyclin E family is composed of two highly related proteins, cyclin E1 and E2 (24Gudas J.M. Payton M. Thukral S. Chen E. Bass M. Robinson M.O. Coats S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 612-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zariwala M. Liu J. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2787-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These cyclins serve as regulatory components that bind and activate cell cycle-dependent kinases. Members of this family primarily associate with cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk3 (26Möröy T. Geisen C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1424-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Hwang H.C. Clurman B.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The most prominent role of cyclin E is to complete phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a process initiated by the cyclin D/Cdk4 complex in early stages of G1 phase (28Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 29Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated Rb loses affinity for E2F transcription factors and results in the release and activation of E2F factors. In turn, activated E2F factors lead to up-regulated S phase regulators, such as b-myb and cyclin A (26Möröy T. Geisen C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1424-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recently, studies indicated that cyclin E has an additional role besides Cdk-mediated functions. Cyclin E was shown to facilitate the loading of minichromosomal maintenance factors (Mcm) to the origin of replication, thus enabling the formation of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) and the subsequent entry of cells to S phase (30Geng Y. Lee Y.M. Welcker M. Swanger J. Zagozdzon A. Winer J.D. Roberts J.M. Kaldis P. Clurman B.E. Sicinski P. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 127-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cyclin E1 and E2 double knock-out mice show impairment of endoreplication of trophoblast giant cells and MKs (31Geng Y. Yu Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Schneider J.E. Bhattacharya S. Rideout W.M. Bronson R.T. Gardner H. Sicinski P. Cell. 2003; 114: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Apart from these two cell types, cyclin E is overall excessive for mouse embryonic development. An additional study also supports the requirement of both cyclin E1 and E2 for endoreplication of trophoblast giant cells of the placenta (32Parisi T. Beck A.R. Rougier N. McNeil T. Lucian L. Werb Z. Amati B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4794-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that in the absence of cyclin E, cell cycle functions can be carried out by other G1 and S phase cyclins, with the exception of MK and trophoblast polyploidy. Therefore, S phase re-entry during polyploidization is a rate-limiting step. However, while cyclin E is essential for MK polyploidy, it remained unclear whether up-regulated cyclin E is an inducer of polyploidy in vivo. In the current study, we examined the inducibility of cyclin E by TPO in primary murine MKs and the role of this cyclin in polyploidization. We generated a transgenic (Tg) mouse model that specifically overexpresses cyclin E1 in MKs. Our results clearly demonstrate a role for cyclin E in promoting S phase entry and polyploidy. Furthermore, we show that up-regulated cyclin E results in accumulation of cyclin B1, suggesting an additional mechanism in cyclin E-mediated polyploidy increase. Femoral and tibial bone marrow was isolated as previously described (19Zimmet J.M. Ladd D. Jackson C.W. Stenberg P.E. Ravid K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7248-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow was collected from femurs and tibias of transgenic and control mice using a 23-gauge needle and CATCH buffer (1× Hank's balanced salt solution, 0.38% sodium citrate, 1 mm adenosine, 1 mm theophylline, 5% fetal bovine serum). Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g at 4 °C. Red blood cell lysis was performed using 10 ml of lysis buffer (17 mm Tris, 14 mm NH4Cl). After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and cells were washed with 10 ml of CATCH buffer. When indicated, cells were cultured with 25 ng/ml of TPO (human PEG-rhMGDF; gift from Kirin Pharma Company) in IMDM media (Invitrogen, cat. 21056) containing 10% bovine calf serum, 1000 IU/ml penicillin, and 1000 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, cat. 15070-063). For cell synchronization, MKs were treated for 6 h with 200 μm monastrol (Calbiochem, cat. 475879), as previously described for MKs (11Geddis A.E. Kaushansky K. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A plasmid containing the 1.1-kb rat PF4 promoter followed by a 1.7-kb fragment of the 3′ region of the human β-globin gene (33Zhang Y. Nagata Y. Yu G. Nguyen H.G. Jones M.R. Toselli P. Jackson C.W. Tatsuka M. Todokoro K. Ravid K. Blood. 2004; 103: 3717-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was digested with NotI and SacI followed by DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, cat. M0210S) reaction and dephosphorylation reaction with CIP (alkaline phosphatase, Invitrogen, cat. M0290S). The cDNA sequence corresponding to the human cyclin E1 (CCNE1), contained in the pCMV6-XL4 vector, was amplified via PCR using the following primers: forward primer 5′-ATGCCGAGGGAGCGCAGG-3′, reverse primer 5′-TCACGCCATTTCCGGCCCG-3′ and cloned into a pcR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, cat. K200001). DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the cDNA sequence of the insert. Upon amplification of the plasmid, EcoRI digestion was performed followed by Klenow reaction. The cyclin E fragment was ligated with the blunted PF4-plasmid. The resulting plasmid was digested with XhoI and AatII to release the transgene from the vector backbone. The PF4-cyclin E fragment was purified via electroporation and microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized FVB/N strain mouse oocytes to produce transgenic mice, as previously described (34Ravid K.

Possible cyclin E litters from three different founder lines were screened for the human cyclin E1 gene using tail genomic DNA isolation as follows: tails were digested in 300 μl of digestion buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 7.6, 25 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS) and 6 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K (American Bioanalytical, Natick, MA, cat. AB00925). Tails were incubated overnight at 55 °C. The digested tails were spun down at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and treated with 1.5 μl of 100 mg/ml RNase A type III (Sigma, cat. R5125) for 20 min at 37 °C. After cooling the samples to room temperature, 100 μl of Protein Precipitation Solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, cat. 1045697) was added and incubated on ice for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and transferred to a new tube and 300 μl of 100% isopropanol was added. After mixing, the samples were spun down at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and washed with 300 μl of 70% EtOH. The final pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0). The human cyclin E1 transgene was screened by polymerase chain reaction using 100 ng of genomic DNA, sense primer 5′-CCTTCTGCGAAAATTCCAA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGCACGTTGAGTTTGGGTAA-3′ for 30 cycles at 57 °C to generate a fragment of 684 bp as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. MKs were prepared for analysis by Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis. BM cells were washed twice with staining buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, and PBS, pH 7.2). MKs were labeled with a MK- specific antibody, anti-CD41-FITC, (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, cat. 553848). Following two washes with staining buffer, BM cells were resuspended in staining buffer and anti-FITC labeled microbeads (10 μl per 10 × 106 cells, Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, cat. 37-048-701). Cells were loaded onto an equilibrated large cell separation column (Miltenyi Biotech, cat. 130-042-202) supplied with a 23-gauge needle for flow resistance and processed as described by the manufacturer. The bound CD41-FITC labeled MKs were eluted with 1 ml of staining buffer. These cells were further analyzed for purity using Flow cytometry, based on CD41-FITC labeling (BD-FACSscan flow cytometer using a CellQuest software, BD Biosciences). Homogenization of primary murine MKs was performed using QiaShredder columns (Qiagen, cat. 79654). RNA isolation was carried out using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, cat. 74104) following the manufacturer's instructions. For cDNA preparation, reverse transcription was achieved using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, cat. 205310). The cDNA was used for quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, performed using mouse cyclin E1 (Mm01266311_m1 Ccne1) and human cyclin E1 (Hs00233356_m1 Ccne1) TaqMan® gene expression primers and probes (Applied Biosystems). Samples were run on an Applied Biosystems Sequence Detection System 7300. Data were normalized to GAPDH (Applied Biosystems, 4352339E) and 18 S rRNA (Applied Biosystems, 18 S rRNA 4319413E) and analyzed using the ΔΔCT method. The MK-enriched fraction was collected, and total protein was extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche, Complete, Indianapolis, cat. 11697498001), 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 125 nm ocadaic acid, and vortex at 4 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was assayed using Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, cat. 500-0006). SDS loading buffer was added to the protein lysate and was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer onto a PVDF membrane. Proteins were detected by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-CD41 (diluted 1000-fold) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. sc-15328), mouse monoclonal anti-BM28 (Mcm2) (diluted 1000-fold) (BD Pharmingen, cat. 610700), mouse monoclonal anti-Cdc6 (diluted 1000-fold) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. sc-9964, rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin E (diluted 1000-fold) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-481), mouse anti-human cyclin E (diluted 1000-fold) (BD Pharmingen, cat. 551160)), rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin A (diluted 1000-fold) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-751), mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin B1 (diluted 1000-fold) (BD Pharmingen, 554177) and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (diluted 10000-fold) (Sigma, cat. A5441). BM cells suspended in PBS were centrifuged (3 × 105 cells/slide) to microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) by a Cytospin3 (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) for 5 min at 120 × g. Cells were fixed in 3.7% fresh paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized with 90% methanol. Slides were washed three times with PBS and were blocked with 3% fetal bovine serum in PBS followed by incubation with 5 μg/ml of mouse anti-human cyclin E (BD Pharmingen) or 5 μg/ml of mouse IgG isotype (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat. sc-2025). Following washes with PBS, slides were incubated with 4 μg/ml goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes). Following washes in PBS, slides were then mounted with coverslips using Vectashield Mounting Medium for fluorescence with DAPI (4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, cat. H-1200). All slides were observed with an Olympus ×70 inverted fluorescence microscope with a ×40 objective. Images were documented with a Hamamatsu CCD camera (Hamamatsu photonics) and analyzed with ImagePro software (Media Cybernetics Inc). Ploidy analysis was conducted as previously described (35Nguyen H.G. Yu G. Makitalo M. Yang D. Xie H.X. Jones M.R. Ravid K. Blood. 2005; 106: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were washed in PBS followed by overnight fixation with 70% EtOH at −20 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 10% bovine calf serum and 2% mouse serum in PBS. FITC anti-CD41 (BD-Pharmingen, cat. 553848) or FITC rat-IgG1 κ isotype control (BD-Pharmingen, cat. 554684) labeled antibody was added at a dilution of 1:200 (0.625 μg/106 cells) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS, cells were treated with 0.1 mg/ml ribonuclease A (Sigma, cat. R51), followed by DNA staining with 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide (Invitrogen, cat. P1304MP). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C prior to analysis on a BD-FACSscan flow cytometer using a CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For S phase labeling, 5′-bromo-2′deoxyuridine (Sigma, cat. B9285) was injected intraperitoneally (1 mg/400 μl PBS) into 7-week-old wild-type and cyclin E transgenic mice. The mice were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation 2 h after injection. Bone marrow was collected and MKs were fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were treated with 2 n HCI/0.5% Triton X-100 solution followed by neutralization with sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich cat. 71999). DNA was stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc., cat. H-1200) and FITC-BrdU antibody (BD Biosciences, cat. 347583) was used to detect BrdU incorporation. Bone marrow from a non BrdU-injected mouse (concomitantly processed) was used to determine FITC-BrdU antibody specificity. MKs were identified with a fluorescence microscope and determined based on size and morphology. Bone marrow slides were prepared, observed, and processed as described above for immunofluorescence analysis. Blood (0.5–0.6 ml) was collected via cardiac puncture. Blood was analyzed using the Hemavet multispecies hematology analyzer (Drew Scientific, Dallas, TX, cat. HV950FS) for platelet, red blood cells, and lymphocytes as well as mean platelet volume. To explore a possible role of cyclin E during polyploidization, we first determined the effect of the ploidy-promoting cytokine, TPO on MKs. Bone marrow cells were isolated from wild-type (Wt) mice and cultured with TPO for 0, 6, and 12 h. MKs were purified using a MACS® magnetic bead purification system and purity of the MK fraction was estimated at ∼83% based of FACS analysis (Fig. 1A). This is an underestimation in terms of mass, considering the large size of MKs compared with other contaminating diploid cells. qRT-PCR indicated a 2.5-fold increase of cyclin E1 after 12 h of TPO stimulation, as compared with non-stimulated MKs (Fig. 1B). In addition to GAPDH, expression was normalized to 18 S rRNA (supplemental Fig. S1A). Western blot analysis for murine cyclin E also showed a 2.5-fold expression increase after 12 h of TPO stimulation, compared with non-stimulated MKs (Fig. 1, B and C). FACS analysis confirmed the effect of TPO on MK polyploidy (Fig. 1D). These results suggest a role for cyclin E during MK polyploidy. To further investigate the role of cyclin E in MK polyploidy, transgenic mice specifically overexpressing cyclin E1 in MKs were generated with 1.1 kb of the rat PF4 gene promoter driving the expression of the transgene exclusively in the megakaryocytic lineage (19Zimmet J.M.

Three transgenic (Tg) founder lines were generated (nos. 11, 38, 39), of which founder line 11 and 38 were used for continued analysis (Fig. 2A). Transgene expression at the mRNA and protein levels were examined using real-time PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1B, Figs. 2C and 3). Endogenous cyclin E1 levels remained largely unaltered (Fig. 2B, lower panel) between Wt and cyclin E Tg MKs. Lack of transgene expression in non-megakaryocytic cells confirmed its MK-specific targeting (Fig. 2C, right panel). The level of total cyclin E1 (endogenous and transgene) was increased in the transgenic mice, further confirming the overall up-regulation of cyclin E1 in our transgenic mouse model (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, transgenic cyclin E was highly expressed in interphase MKs, as depicted in immunostained cells in Fig. 3 (example of MK in the middle panel).FIGURE 3Immunofluorescence detection of hCyclin E in MKs. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirms human cyclin E expression in bone marrow-derived MKs of the transgenic mouse model (line 11 is shown) or wild-type matching controls (Wt). Human cyclin E (hcyclin E) antibody was used, followed by a secondary staining with goat anti- mouse Alexa-488 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HeLa cells were used as a positive control. Cells were also stained with DAPI (blue) to visualize DNA using fluorescent microscopy. Large polyploid MKs are readily identifiable.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we explored the relationship between cyclin E and polyploidy. For this reason, bone marrow cells were harvested from Wt and cyclin E transgenic mice. Flow cytometry analysis was applied to determine the DNA content in CD41-positive MKs (Fig. 4). Data indicated that cyclin E overexpression results in a significant increase in polyploidy, as compared with the Wt ploidy profile distribution. Data shown here are for transgenic line 11. A similar ploidy profile was obtained in line 38 (supplemental Fig. S2). TPO-stimulated bone marrow cultures showed no difference in MK ploidy distribution between Wt and transgenic cells. This suggested that TPO dominates over the effect of cyclin E overexpression, possibly via its ability to stimulate other factors, including endogenous cyclin E gene (supplemental Fig. S3). Given the fact that the ploidy of MKs is increased in the cyclin E transgenic mice, we sought to investigate whether cyclin E affects the number of circulating platelets in the peripheral blood. Platelet counts and mean platelet volume (MPV) showed no difference between the two groups (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). This suggested that MK fragmentation and platelet production are highly regulated processes involving a number of factors besides cyclin E. The percentage of CD41 (MK marker) positive bone marrow cells was not significantly changed in cyclin E Tg mice, as compared with wild type (supplemental Fig. S4C). Platelet function was also tested via ADP-induced platelet aggregation and no significant difference was found between Wt and cyclin E Tg mice (data not shown). As predicted from the tissue-specific expression of cyclin E, other hematopoietic lineages, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and lymphocytes were unaffected (supplemental Fig. S4D). It has been reported that cyclin E is highly expressed during late G1 and early S phase of the cell cycle (26Möröy T. Geisen C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1424-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, only a maximum of 15% of the MK population in fresh bone marrow cells is engaged in S phase (18Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that up-regulation of cyclin E serves to increase the percentage of MKs undergoing DNA synthesis. To address this question, we measured protein levels of the S phase markers Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin A (Fig. 5, A and B). PCNA and cyclin A are up-regulated 2-fold in cyclin E Tg MKs, as compared with Wt (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the fraction of cell cycling MKs was determined via in vivo BrdU staining of cells. The percentage of BrdU-positive MKs was ∼2-fold higher in the cyclin E Tg MKs, as compared with Wt. In accordance, we observed a similar fold increase in the protein levels of PCNA and cyclin A (Fig. 5, C and D). Overall, these data show that cyclin E promotes G1/S phase cell cycle progression, which in MKs also promotes polyploidy. In some cell types, cyclin E is known to promote progression to S phase by facilitating the formation of the pre-RC (30Geng Y. Lee Y.M. Welcker M. Swanger J. Zagozdzon"
https://openalex.org/W2089496739,"The mouse hair coat comprises protective “primary” and thermo-regulatory “secondary” hairs. Primary hair formation is ectodysplasin (Eda) dependent, but it has been puzzling that Tabby (Eda-/y) mice still make secondary hair. We report that Dickkopf 4 (Dkk4), a Wnt antagonist, affects an auxiliary pathway for Eda-independent development of secondary hair. A Dkk4 transgene in wild-type mice had no effect on primary hair, but secondary hairs were severely malformed. Dkk4 action on secondary hair was further demonstrated when the transgene was introduced into Tabby mice: the usual secondary follicle induction was completely blocked. The Dkk4-regulated secondary hair pathway, like the Eda-dependent primary hair pathway, is further mediated by selective activation of Shh. The results thus reveal two complex molecular pathways that distinctly regulate subtype-based morphogenesis of hair follicles, and provide a resolution for the longstanding puzzle of hair formation in Tabby mice lacking Eda."

The mid-point redox potential of the b-heme was determined by optical titration (Em + 234 ± 10 mV). A profile of periplasmic c-type cytochromes expressed in T. selenatis under selenate respiring conditions was undertaken. Two c-type cytochromes were purified (∼24 and ∼6 kDa), and the 24-kDa protein (cytc-Ts4) was shown to donate electrons to SerABC in vitro. Protein sequence of cytc-Ts4 was obtained by N-terminal sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, and based upon sequence similarities, was assigned as a member of cytochrome c4 family. Redox potentiometry, combined with UV-visible spectroscopy, showed that cytc-Ts4 is a diheme cytochrome with a redox potential of +282 ± 10 mV, and both hemes are predicted to have His-Met ligation.

https://openalex.org/W1995301112,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling is strongly associated with cell growth and regulates the rate of synthesis of the rRNA precursor, the first and the key stage of ribosome biogenesis. In a screen for mediators of IGF-I signaling in cancer, we recently identified several ribosome-related proteins, including NEP1 (nucleolar essential protein 1) and WDR3 (WD repeat 3), whose homologues in yeast function in ribosome processing. The WDR3 gene and its locus on chromosome 1p12-13 have previously been linked with malignancy. Here we show that IGF-I induces expression of WDR3 in transformed cells. WDR3 depletion causes defects in ribosome biogenesis by affecting 18 S rRNA processing and also causes a transient down-regulation of precursor rRNA levels with moderate repression of RNA polymerase I activity. Suppression of WDR3 in cells expressing functional p53 reduced proliferation and arrested cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. This was associated with activation of p53 and sequestration of MDM2 by ribosomal protein L11. Cells lacking functional p53 did not undergo cell cycle arrest upon suppression of WDR3. Overall, the data indicate that WDR3 has an essential function in 40 S ribosomal subunit synthesis and in ribosomal stress signaling to p53-mediated regulation of cell cycle progression in cancer cells."

Cytosolic calcium is a critical regulator of platelet function, including granule secretion, integrin activation, and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure.

This limits PS exposure and so may prevent excessive platelet procoagulant activity. Stimulation of GPVI resulted in significantly higher and more sustained Ca2+ signals in PKCθ−/− platelets. PKCθ acts at multiple distinct sites. PKCθ limits secretion, reducing autocrine ADP signaling that enhances Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. PKCθ thereby indirectly regulates activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. However, PKCθ also directly and negatively regulates store-independent Ca2+ entry. This pathway, activated by the diacylglycerol analogue, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol, was enhanced in PKCθ−/− platelets, independently of ADP secretion. Moreover, LOE-908, which blocks 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol-induced Ca2+ entry but not store-operated Ca2+ entry, blocked the enhanced GPVI-dependent Ca2+ signaling and PS exposure seen in PKCθ−/− platelets.

https://openalex.org/W1988521628,"We have reported that epithelial adenosine 2B receptor (A2BAR) mRNA and protein are up-regulated in colitis, which we demonstrated to be regulated by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Here, we examined the mechanism that governs A2BAR expression during colitis. A 1.4-kb sequence of the A2BAR promoter was cloned into the pFRL7 luciferase vector. Anti-microRNA (miRNA) was custom-synthesized based on specific miRNA binding sites. The binding of miRNA to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of A2BAR mRNA was examined by cloning this 3′-UTR downstream of the luciferase gene in pMIR-REPORT. In T84 cells, TNF-α induced a 35-fold increase in A2BAR mRNA but did not increase promoter activity in luciferase assays. By nuclear run-on assay, no increase in A2BAR mRNA following TNF-α treatment was observed. Four putative miRNA target sites (miR27a, miR27b, miR128a, miR128b) in the 3′-UTR of the A2BAR mRNA were identified in T84 cells and mouse colon. Pretreatment of cells with TNF-α reduced the levels of miR27b and miR128a by 60%. Over expression of pre-miR27b and pre-miR128a reduced A2BAR levels by >60%.

We have demonstrated that deletion of the A2BAR gene protects against murine colitis (10Kolachala V.L. Vijay-Kumar M. Dalmasso G. Yang D. Linden J. Wang L. Gewirtz A. Ravid K. Merlin D.

In addition, A2BAR antagonists mitigate colonic inflammation in murine models of colitis (11Kolachala V. Ruble B. Vijay-Kumar M. Wang L. Mwangi S. Figler H. Figler R. Srinivasan S. Gewirtz A.

In this study, we examined the regulation of A2BAR expression in the colon by TNF-α, a critical proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and whose antagonism constitutes an effective therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease (12D'Haens G.

K1612; Hanover, MD). Invitrogen Ncode microRNA (miRNA) First-strand cDNA Module kit was catalogue no. 45-6612. iQ SYBR Green Supermix was from Bio-Rad. Pre-miRNAs and anti-miRNAs for 27b, 128a, and let 7c, and the lipid-based SiPort NeoFX transfection reagent for tranfection of pre-miRNAs were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The cAMP immunoassay kit was from Applied Biosystems (Bedford, MA), isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), adenosine was from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA), and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, molecular weight 50,000) was from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). To identify the targets of human miRNAs for the A2BAR receptor, we used PicTar software, an algorithm that identifies miRNA targets. The miRNA target database contains all animal miRNA sequences from miRBase. The sequence database was scanned against the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) that have been predicted in all available species in Ensemble. The interface links each miRNA to a list of predicted gene targets. A2BAR has four putative miRNA target sites (miR27a, miR27b, miR128a, and miR128b) in the 3′-UTR of A2BAR mRNA. Fig. 3 shows the binding sites and target miRNA alignments for the A2BAR 3′-UTR. The 402-bp 3′-UTR of A2BAR, encompassing the predicted miRNA sequences, was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pMIR-REPORT luciferase miRNA expression reporter (Applied Biosystems catalogue no. AM5795) with HindIII and SpeI. Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (MRC, Inc.). Reverse transcription was performed per the Invitrogen Ncode miRNA first-strand cDNA module kit protocol. Nuclear run-on assay was performed according to the protocol of Dr. Yan (14Yan Y. Dalmasso G. Nguyen H.T. Obertone T.S. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were isolated from T84 cells that were untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 2–4 h. Cells (5 × 107) were pelleted in a test tube and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed on ice for 10 min in lysis buffer, containing 0.3 m sucrose, 0.4% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation (15 min at 500× g), the nuclear pellet was resuspended and subjected to an additional 5-min lysis to remove any remaining intact cells. Following centrifugation, the nuclei were purified by centrifugation through a 2.0 m sucrose cushion. The nuclei were resuspended in 300 μl of transcription buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). After sequential pretreatment with 1 μl of 50 μg/ml RNase A and 2.5 μl (100 units) of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), the in vitro elongation reaction was initiated with 0.25 mm each ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP. The reaction proceeded for 25 min at 30 °C. After incubation with RNase-free DNase, RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ammonium acetate and isopropyl alcohol, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in water. cDNA was synthesized with the Fermentas First-strand synthesis system and amplified by real-time PCR using A2BAR-specific primers and 18S as an internal control. T84 cells were grown and maintained in culture as described (15Sitaraman S.V. Wang L. Wong M. Bruewer M. Hobert M. Yun C.H. Merlin D. Madara J.L. J. Biol.

Confluent stock monolayers were subcultured by trypsinization. Experiments were performed using cells plated for 7–8 days on permeable supports of 4.5-cm2 inserts. Inserts (0.4-μm pore size; Costar, Cambridge, MA) were rested in wells that contained medium until steady-state resistance was achieved, as described (16Kolachala V. Asamoah V. Wang L. Srinivasan S.

Caco2-BBe cells and HT29-Cl.19A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 14 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using the iCycler sequence detection system (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 50 ng of reverse-transcribed cDNA was amplified (40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 55 °C for 1 min), using 10 μm gene-specific primers. The primers were: mouse A2BAR forward, ATGCAGCTAGAGACGCAAGA and reverse, GTTGGTGGGGGTCTGTAATG; human A2BAR forward, TTCTGCACTGACTTCTACGG and reverse, TTTATACCTGAGCGGGACAC; mature miR27b forward, TTCACAGTGGCTAAGTTCTGC and reverse, universal qPCR primer provided in the kit (Invitrogen Ncode miRNA First-strand cDNA synthesis and reverse transcription qPCR kit); mature miR128a forward, TCACAGTGAACCGGTCTCTTTT and reverse, universal qPCR primer.

Fold induction was calculated using the Ct method (ΔΔCT = (Ct target − Ct internal control) treatment − (Ct target − Ct internal control) nontreatment), and the final data were derived from 2−ΔΔCT. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University approved all procedures that were performed on the animals. In addition, all experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the U.S. Public Health Service. Six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at our facility. They were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle and allowed free access to pelleted diet and tap water at controlled temperatures (25 ± 2 °C). Colitis was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by ad libitum oral administration of 3% (w/v) DSS in tap water for 6 days. Age-matched male wild-type C57BL/6 mice that received tap water served as controls. Mice were observed daily and evaluated for changes in body weight and the development of clinical symptoms. To study the regulation of A2BAR by miRNA, pre-miR27b and/or pre-miR128a (A2BAR target miRNAs) and a plasmid that contained the associated miR27b and miR128a binding sites in A2BAR (pMIR-3′-UTR) were co-transfected into subconfluent Caco2-BBe cells. The binding of miRNAs to A2BAR 3′-UTR mRNA was reflected by pMIR-REPORT luciferase activity. Anti-miR27b and/or anti-miR128a was introduced into HT29 cells to study the blockade of miR27b and miR128a. Endogenous A2BAR mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR 48 h after transfection. The positive control for blocking efficiency was anti-miR let 7c, which regulates high mobility group A2 (HMGA-2) mRNA. HT29-Cl.19A cells were washed and equilibrated with Hanks' solution; then, the cells were untreated or treated with 100 μm adenosine (basolateral). cAMP measurements were made in whole cell lysates in the presence of 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine using a competitive cAMP immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence was read on a Luminoscan Ascent (Thermo Labsystems, Needham Heights, MA). To study the suppression of endogenous miRNA function, anti-miR27b and anti-miR128a (Ambion AM17000, 17100) were introduced into HT29 cells, and A2BAR signaling was measured by estimating the levels of adenosine-mediated cAMP production with and without transfection of the blockers. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test or analysis of variance (Prism 4.0; GraphPad, San Diego, CA). A p value < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Our previous studies demonstrated that A2BAR mRNA and protein were up-regulated in cells that were pretreated with TNF-α. To understand better the regulation of A2BAR, we performed experiments using a luciferase reporter construct that contained the A2BAR promoter (pFRL7 1.4A2BAR). The 5′-flanking region of A2BAR was obtained from Homo sapiens chromosome 17S from the PAC (P1-derived artificial chromosome) RPCI-1 121M24 map 17p11 (a gift from Dr. R. Reinhardt, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany) by PCR, yielding a 1.4-kb fragment of the region. The human A2BAR promoter sequence was submitted to NCBI GenBank under accession number DQ351340. The isolated 1.4-kb and 2.5-kb fragments were subsequently cloned into the pFRL7 luciferase vector (13Malo M.S. Mozumder M. Chen A. Mostafa G. Zhang X.B. Hodin R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 350: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) at the KpnI and NcoI restriction sites to yield the pFRL7 1.4 A2BAR plasmid. The transcriptional start site, as determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the Gene Racer kit (Invitrogen), was 119 bp upstream of the translational start site. COS-7 or Caco2-BBe cells were transfected with pFRL7 1.4A2BAR and treated 72 h later with TNF-α for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 1, the relative luciferase activity in pFRL7 1.4 A2BAR total lysates (11.6 ± 1.3) was ∼10 times greater than that in empty vector transfectants (1.9 ± 0.13). TNF-α, however, did not increase A2BAR promoter activity (11.01 ± 0.3), despite the increase in A2BAR mRNA levels (9Kolachala V. Asamoah V. Wang L. Obertone T.S. Ziegler T.R. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2647-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Also, TNF-α had no effect on luciferase activity from a longer 2.5-kb fragment of the A2BAR promoter. To clarify the effect of TNF-α on A2BAR transcription, we performed nuclear run-on assays using nuclei from vehicle- or TNF-α-treated T84 cells. After in vitro elongation with dNTPs, the RNA was extracted, and novel A2BAR mRNA synthesis was quantified by real-time PCR using A2BAR-specific primers. There was no significant difference in A2BAR mRNA levels between vehicle- and TNF-α treated nuclei. These data indicate that TNF-α does not affect A2BAR transcription and suggest that TNF-α regulates A2BAR by a post-transcriptional mechanism. This experiment was repeated three times, each yielding similar results. One of the primary mechanisms by which gene expression is post-transcriptionally regulated is miRNA. We determined whether A2BAR was regulated by miRNA. First, we performed an on-line search of miRNAs using the pictar and targetscan databases and identified four putative miRNA target sites (miR27a, miR27b, miR128a, and miR128b) in the 3′-UTR of A2BAR mRNA (Fig. 2). All four miRNAs were expressed in T84 cells. To determine the effect of TNF-α on miRNA and A2BAR mRNA levels, we pretreated T84 cells for various times with TNF-α (10 ng/ml). Pretreatment of T84 cells with TNF-α increased A2BAR mRNA levels by ∼35-fold, (*p < 0.03, n = 6) (Fig. 3A) compared with untreated cells. Pretreatment with TNF-α reduced the levels of miR27b and miR128a by 60% (*p < 0.001, n = 6) (Fig. 3B), whereas miR27a and miR128b levels were unaffected (data not shown). These data establish a direct correlation between A2BAR mRNA and the miR27b and miR128a miRNAs. Pre-miRNA precursors are small, partially double-stranded RNAs that mimic endogenous precursor miRNAs. To examine the regulation of A2BAR by miR27b and miR128a, we transfected T84 cells with pre-miR27b or pre-miR128a. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested, and A2BAR mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection of pre-miR27b or pre-miR128a decreased A2BAR mRNA levels by 50% compared with untransfected cells (pre-miR27b 43.4 ± 4.83, *p < 0.001; pre-miR128a 30.3 ± 6.1, *p < 0.003), whereas 18S mRNA (control) was unaffected by pre-miR27b or pre-miR128a transfection. A commercial negative control pre-miRNA, containing a nontargeting sequence that had no homology to A2BAR, had no effect on A2BAR mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that miR27b and miR128a influence A2BAR mRNA levels. Next, we sought to determine the effect of inhibition of miR27b or miR128a on A2BAR mRNA. Cells were transfected with custom-synthesized blockers of the miR27b or miR128a binding sites, and A2BAR mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 4B, anti-miR27b and anti-miR128a increased A2BAR mRNA levels by 5.3 ± 0.9-fold (*p < 0.01) and 2.2 ± 0.02-fold (*p < 0.005), respectively, compared with vector-transfected cells. 18S mRNA did not change, demonstrating the specificity of the miR blockers for A2BAR mRNA. These data support the results of the pre-miRNA experiments and further demonstrate that miR27b and miR128a regulate A2BAR mRNA levels. To determine whether the effects of miR27b and miR128a on A2BAR mRNA levels were reflected in functional alterations in A2BAR, we measured adenylate cyclase activity in HT29-Cl.19A cells that were transfected with anti-miR27b or anti-miR128a. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated basolaterally with adenosine (100 μm), and cAMP levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 4C, cAMP levels were significantly higher in miR27b (0.07 ± 0.01, *p < 0.02) and miR128a transfectants (0.08 ± 0.01, *p < 0.016) compared with untransfected cells (0.04 ± 0.004), suggesting that the up-regulation of A2BAR mRNA in anti-miR27b- and anti-miR128a-transfected cells effects an increase in A2BAR levels. We have shown that A2BAR mRNA and protein levels are increased during colitis. To determine whether miR27b or miR128a levels correlate inversely with A2BAR mRNA during colitis, we measured miR27b, miR128a, and A2BAR mRNA levels by real-time PCR in a DSS model of colitis. All mice that were fed 3% DSS for 7 days developed signs of severe colitis (clinical score: 9.4 ± 1.0; histological score: 9.1 ± 2.3), presented as bloody diarrhea and weight loss. Consistent with our previous observations (9Kolachala V. Asamoah V. Wang L. Obertone T.S. Ziegler T.R. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2647-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), A2BAR mRNA levels increased 2.3 ± 0.3-fold (*p < 0.05), compared with control mice that received water (Fig. 5A). Notably, miR27b levels decreased 33.4 ± 6.6-fold (*p < 0.005) in colitic mice compared with control mice that received water (Fig. 5B). There was no change in miR128a levels (data not shown). These data demonstrate that there is an inverse correlation between miR27b and A2BAR mRNA, supporting evidence for a post-transcriptional mechanism of A2BAR regulation by miRNA. To confirm that miRNA functions through an interaction with the A2BAR 3′-UTR, we co-transfected pre-miR27b and/or pre-miR128a with the A2BAR 3′-UTR luciferase reporter construct pMIR-REPORT. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, introduction of pre-miR27b or pre-miR128a significantly inhibited 3′-UTR-dependent A2BAR luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (25–100 nm, n = 8, *p < 0.0001). Further, co-transfection of pre-miR27b (50 nm) and pre-miR128a (50 nm) produced a robust additive inhibitory effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 6C). We performed the luciferase assay with an additional group, in which we co-transfected the A2BAR 3′-UTR and the A2BAR promoter. We observed no additional increase in luciferase activity beyond that induced by the 3′-UTR alone (Fig. 6D), suggesting that A2BAR expression is regulated by miRNA. miRNAs are short RNAs in introns and intergeneic regions that regulate gene expression. A large primary miRNA (pre-miRNA) is transcribed and processed to a pre-miRNA hairpin, which is converted in the cytoplasm into a mature miRNA that targets genes that harbor complementary sites in their 3′- or 5′-UTRs (18Lytle J.R. Yario T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9667-9672Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 19Lai E.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). miRNAs are up- and down-regulated in several disease conditions. We have demonstrated that A2BAR protein levels increase after treatment with proinflammatory cytokines but that A2BAR promoter activity is unaltered. We also examined miRNAs in bioinformatics databases that were complementary to the A2BAR 3′-UTR to determine whether miR27b and miR128a regulated the levels of A2BAR mRNA and protein. In our previous studies, we observed the up-regulation of A2BAR by TNF-α in colonic epithelial cells and in the DSS mouse model of colitis (9Kolachala V. Asamoah V. Wang L. Obertone T.S. Ziegler T.R. Merlin D. Sitaraman S.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2647-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Using a pFLR7 promoter-reporter construct that contained either the 1.4-kb and 2.5-kb fragments of the A2BAR promoter, we found that TNF-α did not increase A2BAR promoter activity (Fig. 1). A2BAR, however, has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated during hypoxia through hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-binding elements (20Kong T. Westerman K.A. Faigle M. Eltzschig H.K. Colgan S.P. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and by b-myb (21St. Hilaire C. Yang D. Schreiber B.M. Ravid K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 103: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively. Our luciferase assays were performed with whole cell lysates, which should have harbored all of the transcription factors that regulate the promoter. Studies by our laboratory and others have noted the transcriptional regulation of genes by TNF-α by 4–6 h, suggesting that the transcriptional mechanism is active in our luciferase assay (22Theiss A.L.

Sartor R.B. Gut. 1998; 42: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Yu Y. Zeng H. Lyons S. Carlson A. Merlin D. Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2003; 285: G282-G290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly, by nuclear run-on assay, we observed no increase in A2BAR transcription in response to TNF-α. Although the involvement of other cis- or trans-elements and signaling pathways that regulate A2BAR transcription further upstream of the 2.5-kb element cannot be ruled out with these assays, these data strongly suggest that TNF-α up-regulates A2BAR through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Thus, we speculated that A2BAR regulation was mediated by A2BAR-specific miRNAs. A search of bioinformatics databases identified miR27b and miR128a as containing target sequences in the 3′-UTR of A2BAR. Treatment of colonic epithelial cells with TNF-α inhibited miR27b and miR128a by 60%, which was associated with a 5-fold increase in A2BAR mRNA levels (Fig. 4, A and B). Colonic tissue from mice with DSS-induced colitis experienced a 50% reduction in miR27b levels (Fig. 5B). These findings implicated miR27b and miR128a in the regulation of A2BAR mRNA. Our studies were unable to determine the relative contribution of miR27b and miR128a because the consensus binding sites for them in the A2BAR 3′-UTR overlap significantly (Fig. 2). miRNAs constitute a prominent class of regulatory genes in animals, representing ∼1% of all predicted genes, suggesting that sequence-specific, post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that are mediated by these small RNAs are ubiquitous (25Lau N.C. Lim L.P. Weinstein E.G. Bartel D.P. Science. 2001; 294: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2697) Google Scholar, 26Lai E.C. Curr.

Science. 2001; 294: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis using synthetic pre-miRNAs (miRNA precursor molecules) and a reciprocal set of anti-miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs are small, chemically modified, double-stranded RNA molecules that mimic endogenous mature miRNA molecules. These molecules are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex, which is also responsible for miRNA activity. In contrast to miRNA expression vectors, pre-miRNAs can be used in dose-response studies because they can be introduced directly into the cell by transfection. Inside cells, pre-miRNAs up-regulate miRNA activity (28Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4250) Google Scholar), enabling one to analyze miRNA function. Transfection of pre-miRNA reduced A2BAR mRNA levels in T84 cells (Fig. 4A). In reciprocal experiments, blockade of miR27b and miR128a, as a result of the introduction of specific anti-miRNAs, increased A2BAR mRNA levels (Fig. 4B). Anti-miRNAs also enhanced adenosine-mediated cAMP production (Fig. 4C), indicating an increase in A2BAR function and directly linking miR27b and miR128a to the regulation of A2BAR expression (29Meister G. Landthaler M. Dorsett Y. Tuschl T. RNA. 2004; 10: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). miRNAs have important functions in the regulation of genes. Several studies have demonstrated that miRNAs govern basic cellular functions. Studies by Care et al. (30Carè A. Catalucci D. Felicetti F. Bonci D. Addario A. Gallo P. Bang M.L. Segnalini P. Gu Y.

In our experiments, co-transfection of pre-miR27b or pre-miR128a with an A2BAR 3′-UTR reporter construct increased luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). Co-transfection of pre-miR27b and pre-miR128a resulted in the additive inhibition of luciferase activity (Fig. 6C). By luciferase assay, co-tranfection of the 3′-UTR of A2BAR and the A2BAR promoter resulted in no additional increase in luciferase activity beyond that induced by 3′-UTR alone, suggesting that miRNA plays the significant role in the regulation of A2BAR expression (Fig. 6D). Recent bioinformatic and experimental evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of genes (>30%) are subject to miRNA-mediated regulation (32Nilsen T.W. Trends Genet. 2007; 23: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Our studies on the possible function of miRNAs in colonic inflammation demonstrate that miR27b and miR128a are critical regulators of A2BAR expression. Because A2BAR antagonism ameliorates colitis, our results suggest that the regulation of A2BAR expression by targeting miRNAs might be an effective therapeutic strategy for colitis."
https://openalex.org/W1999324297,"Inhibition of apoptosis is critical for carcinogenesis. ARC (apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) is an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis that antagonizes both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Although normally expressed in striated myocytes and neurons, ARC is markedly induced in a variety of primary human epithelial cancers and renders cancer cells resistant to killing. The mechanisms that mediate the induction of ARC in cancer are unknown. Herein we demonstrate that increases in ARC abundance are stimulated by Ras through effects on transcription and protein stability. Overexpression of activated N-Ras or H-Ras in normal cells is sufficient to increase ARC mRNA and protein levels. Similarly, transgenic expression of activated H-Ras induces ARC in both the normal mammary epithelium and resulting tumors of intact mice. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous N-Ras in breast and colon cancer cells significantly reduces ARC mRNA and protein levels. The promoter of the Nol3 locus, encoding ARC, is activated by N-Ras and H-Ras in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner. Ras also stabilizes ARC protein by suppressing its polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition to the effects of Ras on ARC abundance, ARC mediates Ras-induced cell survival and cell cycle progression. Thus, Ras induces ARC in epithelial cancers, and ARC plays a role in the oncogenic actions of Ras. Inhibition of apoptosis is critical for carcinogenesis. ARC (apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) is an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis that antagonizes both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Although normally expressed in striated myocytes and neurons, ARC is markedly induced in a variety of primary human epithelial cancers and renders cancer cells resistant to killing. The mechanisms that mediate the induction of ARC in cancer are unknown. Herein we demonstrate that increases in ARC abundance are stimulated by Ras through effects on transcription and protein stability. Overexpression of activated N-Ras or H-Ras in normal cells is sufficient to increase ARC mRNA and protein levels. Similarly, transgenic expression of activated H-Ras induces ARC in both the normal mammary epithelium and resulting tumors of intact mice. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous N-Ras in breast and colon cancer cells significantly reduces ARC mRNA and protein levels. The promoter of the Nol3 locus, encoding ARC, is activated by N-Ras and H-Ras in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner. Ras also stabilizes ARC protein by suppressing its polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. In addition to the effects of Ras on ARC abundance, ARC mediates Ras-induced cell survival and cell cycle progression. Thus, Ras induces ARC in epithelial cancers, and ARC plays a role in the oncogenic actions of Ras. IntroductionApoptosis is a highly regulated cell suicide process that is critical for development, tissue homeostasis and remodeling, and removal of damaged and transformed cells (1Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death is mediated through two central pathways: the extrinsic pathway involving death receptors and the intrinsic pathway involving the mitochondria/endoplasmic reticulum (2Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3991) Google Scholar). Several endogenous inhibitory proteins antagonize one or the other of these two pathways. These include FLIP (Fas-associated death domain protein-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein), which regulates assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) 3The abbreviations used are: DISCdeath-inducing signaling complexARCapoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domainUTRuntranslated regionGSTglutathione S-transferaseANOVAanalysis of varianceERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHAhemagglutininMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.

Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar).In contrast to the above apoptosis inhibitors that act at discrete locations in the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways, ARC (apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) antagonizes both central apoptosis pathways. ARC suppresses the extrinsic pathway by directly binding to Fas, FADD, and procaspase-8, thereby blocking DISC assembly (6Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nuñez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 7Nam Y.J. Mani K. Ashton A.W. Peng C.F. Krishnamurthy B. Hayakawa Y. Lee P. Korsmeyer S.J. Kitsis R.N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). ARC inhibits the intrinsic pathway through at least two mechanisms. First, ARC interacts directly with Bax, thereby inhibiting Bax conformational activation and translocation to the mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli (7Nam Y.J. Mani K. Ashton A.W.

Second, ARC interacts with p53, disrupting p53 tetramerization (9Foo R.S. Nam Y.J. Ostreicher M.J. Metzl M.D. Whelan R.S. Peng C.F. Ashton A.W. Fu W. Mani K. Chin S.F. Provenzano E. Ellis I. Figg N.

This disables p53 function as a transcription factor and exposes a nuclear export signal that relocates p53 to the cytoplasm. The ability of ARC to interrupt extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways through multiple mechanisms makes it a potent cell death inhibitor.Defects in apoptosis are critical for carcinogenesis in that they allow cancer cells to survive adverse genetic and environmental cues during tumor growth and metastasis (10Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar, 11Harrington E.A. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Puisieux A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Moreover, evasion of apoptosis is important for resistance to cancer therapies. One mechanism by which cancer cells escape apoptosis is by overexpressing or activating endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis (14Letai A.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Whereas ARC is normally present in cardiac and skeletal myocytes and neurons (6Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nuñez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 15Geertman R. McMahon A. Sabban E.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1306: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), its protein levels are markedly increased in a variety of primary human epithelial cancers including breast, colon, ovary, and cervix compared with corresponding benign tissues (16Mercier I. Vuolo M. Jasmin J.F. Medina C.M. Williams M. Mariadason J.M. Qian H. Xue X. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Kitsis R.N.

Moreover, overexpression of ARC renders breast cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy and γ-radiation (17Mercier I. Vuolo M. Madan R. Xue X. Levalley A.J. Ashton A.W. Jasmin J.F. Czaja M.T. Lin E.Y.

Jiang C.C. Watts R. Thorne R.F. Kiejda K.A. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Despite the biological effects of ARC in cancer cells, the mechanisms responsible for its induction in cancer are unknown. In the heart, the abundance of ARC is regulated both at the level of transcription and protein stability. For example, p53 transcriptionally represses ARC expression in response to hypoxia (19Li Y.Z. Lu D.Y. Tan W.Q. Wang J.X. Li P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 564-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), while oxidative stress triggers ARC degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (20Nam Y.J. Mani K. Wu L. Peng C.F. Calvert J.W. Foo R.S. Krishnamurthy B. Miao W. Ashton A.W. Lefer D.J. Kitsis R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5522-5528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Herein, we investigate the mechanisms responsible for the marked increases in ARC protein in epithelial cancers. Our experiments reveal that Ras is a key inducer of ARC in both breast and colon cancer cell lines and mammary gland tumors in vivo. Ras modulates ARC levels through both transcriptional mechanisms and changes in protein stability. Moreover, ARC is a mediator of certain cellular effects of Ras.DISCUSSIONOur results show that Ras induces the abundance of ARC through activation of Nol3 transcription and inhibition of ARC protein degradation. These studies employed MCF-7 cells, a commonly utilized model of breast cancer, which contain high levels of N-Ras due to amplification (21Graham K.A. Richardson C.L. Minden M.D. Trent J.M. Buick R.N. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2201-2205PubMed Google Scholar) and exhibit enhanced Ras signaling (27Eckert L.B. Repasky G.A. Ulkü A.S. McFall A. Zhou H. Sartor C.I. Der C.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4585-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although Ras mutations are found in only ∼5% of human breast cancers (28Clark G.J. Der C.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 35: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), Ras signaling is augmented in 20–50% of cases due to upstream events such as overexpression or activating mutations in the EGF receptor or ErbB2/neu/HER-2 (29Lacroix H. Iglehart J.D. Skinner M.A. Kraus M.H. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 145-151PubMed Google Scholar, 30Iglehart J.D. Kraus M.H. Langton B.C. Huper G. Kerns B.J. Marks J.R.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5536-5539PubMed Google Scholar). Colon cancers, on the other hand, often contain gain of function mutations in K-Ras (32Bos J.L. Fearon E.R. Hamilton S.R. Verlaan-de Vries M. van Boom J.H. van der Eb A.J. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1987; 327: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) or in its downstream effector genes such as PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K (33Samuels Y. Wang Z. Bardelli A. Silliman N. Ptak J. Szabo S. Yan H. Gazdar A. Powell S.M. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Velculescu V.E. Science. 2004; 304: 554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar). Thus, regardless of mechanism, enhanced Ras signaling is part of the molecular signature of human breast and colon cancers as well as the various cell culture and mouse models of these malignancies.We exploited a correlation between cellular levels of Ras and ARC to reveal that Ras is a mediator of ARC abundance. Specifically, overexpression of either activated N-Ras or H-Ras is sufficient to induce ARC in both normal and cancer breast epithelial cells, suggesting the importance of common downstream pathways. Conversely, knockdown studies demonstrate that Ras is necessary for the high levels of ARC in breast and colon cancer cells. These observations extend to intact animals as transgenic expression of activated H-Ras induces ARC in the normal mammary epithelium, and to an even greater extent, in resulting hyperplastic regions and tumors. Taken together, these data indicate the necessity and sufficiency of Ras signaling to induce ARC in cancer cells.Ras-mediated induction of ARC is due, in part, to activation of Nol3 transcription. Consistent with this transcriptional regulation, knockdown of endogenous N-Ras in MCF-7 cells decreases ARC mRNA. In addition, overexpression of Ras activates the Nol3 promoter, and signaling through MEK/ERK (but not PI3K/Akt) is necessary and sufficient for this effect. While we have not delineated the specific transcription factors involved, ETS family members, AP1, SRF, and RREB1 (34Oikawa T. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 35Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 36Zhang L. Zhao J. Edenberg H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2947-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have been implicated in the activation of other genes in response to Ras/MEK/ERK signaling. In fact, the Nol3 promoter sequences we employed contain multiple binding sites for these transcription factors. Of note, multiple ETS proteins contribute to breast carcinogenesis (37Turner D.P. Findlay V.J. Moussa O. Watson D.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In addition to regulation at the level of transcription, pulse-chase studies show that Ras increases ARC abundance by stabilizing ARC protein. This results from suppression of ARC polyubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Our data suggest two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms by which Ras signaling may regulate ARC stability: (a) Ras-mediated decreases in the abundance and/or activity of E3-ubiquitin ligase(s) that act upon ARC; and (b) Ras-induced post-translational modifications in ARC that decrease its susceptibility to ubiquitination. The RING finger E3-ligase MDM2 (Mouse Double Minute 2) has been reported to be involved in ARC degradation (38Foo R.S. Chan L.K. Kitsis R.N. Bennett M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5529-5535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Knockdown of Ras in our studies, however, did not affect protein levels of MDM2 or MDM2 target proteins p21 or p53 (not shown). These results demonstrate that a combination of Ras-mediated stimulation of Nol3 transcription and inhibition of ARC protein degradation contribute to the high steady state levels of ARC protein in breast cancer cells.The induction of ARC by Ras raises questions as to the functional relationship between these proteins. ARC is best known as an apoptosis inhibitor, and previous studies have demonstrated that it regulates cell death induced by various stressors (17Mercier I. Vuolo M. Madan R. Xue X. Levalley A.J. Ashton A.W. Jasmin J.F. Czaja M.T. Lin E.Y. Armstrong R.C. Pollard J.W. Kitsis R.N. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Chen L.H. Jiang C.C. Watts R. Thorne R.F. Kiejda K.A. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Ras is also known to confer resistance to apoptotic stimuli (39Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8999-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we asked whether ARC plays a role in Ras-induced cell survival. To assess this, we tested whether exogenous ARC rescues the increase in doxorubicin-induced death resulting from Ras knockdown. In fact, this increased cytotoxicity is completely reversed by restoration of physiological levels of ARC. Thus, ARC is involved in Ras-induced cell survival. Ras has also been shown to accelerate the cell cycle by promoting the G1/S transition and G2/M exit (25Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Knauf J.A. Ouyang B. Knudsen E.S. Fukasawa K. Babcock G. Fagin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3800-3809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Knockdown of ARC in primary mammary epithelial cells from MMTV-H-Ras transgenic mice decreases the proportion in S-phase and increases the proportion in G2/M. These data implicate ARC in cell cycle progression in the context of Ras overexpression.In summary, ARC, an inhibitor of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways that is normally found in terminally differentiated cells, becomes highly induced in a spectrum of primary human epithelial cancers. Our results reveal a new connection between Ras signaling and ARC induction, and demonstrate that Ras regulates ARC levels at both the levels of transcription and protein stability. ARC, in turn, mediates some important oncogenic effects of Ras.

We searched for differentially expressed GPCRs in node positive gastric carcinomas.Differential expression of GPCRs in three node positive vs. three node negative intestinal type gastric carcinomas was analyzed by gene array technology. The candidate genes CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 were validated by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in an independent set of 37 gastric carcinomas. Translation was studied by immunohistochemistry in 347 gastric carcinomas using tissue microarrays as well as in 61 matching lymph node metastases. Protein expression was correlated with clinicopathological patient characteristics and survival. 52 GPCRs and GPCR-related genes were up- or down-regulated in node positive gastric cancer, including CXCL12. Differential expression of CXCL12 was confirmed by RT-PCR and correlated with local tumour growth. CXCL12 immunopositivity was negatively associated with distant metastases and tumour grade. Only 17% of gastric carcinomas showed CXCR4 immunopositive tumour cells, which was associated with higher local tumour extent. 29% of gastric carcinomas showed CXCR4 positive tumour microvessels. Vascular CXCR4 expression was significantly associated with higher local tumour extent as well as higher UICC-stages. When expressing both, CXCL12 in tumour cells and CXCR4 in tumour microvessels, these tumours also were highly significantly associated with higher T- and UICC-stages. Three lymph node metastases revealed vascular CXCR4 expression while tumour cells completely lacked CXCR4 in all cases. The expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4 had no impact on patient survival.Our results substantiate the significance of GPCRs on the biology of gastric carcinomas and provide evidence that the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway might be a novel promising antiangiogenic target for the treatment of gastric carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1982767347,"The Slo3 gene encodes a high conductance potassium channel, which is activated by both voltage and intracellular alkalinization. Slo3 is specifically expressed in mammalian sperm cells, where it gives rise to pH-dependent outwardly rectifying K+ currents. Sperm Slo3 is the main current responsible for the capacitation-induced hyperpolarization, which is required for the ensuing acrosome reaction, an exocytotic process essential for fertilization. Here we show that in intact spermatozoa and in a heterologous expression system, the activation of Slo3 currents is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Depletion of endogenous PIP2 in inside-out macropatches from Xenopus oocytes inhibited heterologously expressed Slo3 currents. Whole-cell recordings of sperm Slo3 currents or of Slo3 channels co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with epidermal growth factor receptor, demonstrated that stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) could inhibit channel activity in a PIP2-dependent manner. High concentrations of PIP2 in the patch pipette not only resulted in a strong increase in sperm Slo3 current density but also prevented the EGF-induced inhibition of this current. Mutation of positively charged residues involved in channel-PIP2 interactions enhanced the EGF-induced inhibition of Slo3 currents. Overall, our results suggest that PIP2 is an important regulator for Slo3 activation and that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 leads to inhibition of Slo3 currents both in native and heterologous expression systems.

Whole-cell recordings of sperm Slo3 currents or of Slo3 channels co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes with epidermal growth factor receptor, demonstrated that stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) could inhibit channel activity in a PIP2-dependent manner. High concentrations of PIP2 in the patch pipette not only resulted in a strong increase in sperm Slo3 current density but also prevented the EGF-induced inhibition of this current. Mutation of positively charged residues involved in channel-PIP2 interactions enhanced the EGF-induced inhibition of Slo3 currents. Overall, our results suggest that PIP2 is an important regulator for Slo3 activation and that receptor-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 leads to inhibition of Slo3 currents both in native and heterologous expression systems."

TF·FVIIa-dependent signaling primarily activates PAR2, which belongs to a family of four G-protein-coupled receptors activated by specific proteolytic cleavage of their N-terminal extracellular domain (1Camerer E. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5255-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Cleavage unmasks a new N terminus, which serves as a tethered ligand that induces transmembrane signaling (2Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). Activation of PAR2 by the TF·FVIIa binary complex involves cellular pools of TF with low affinity for FVIIa, whereas high affinity cell surface TF mediates coagulation activation and the associated cell signaling of the ternary complex of TF·FVIIa·FXa (3Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Kerver M. Chen V.M. Mueller B.M. Hogg P.J. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13932-13937Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In the latter complex, FXa is the primary activator for PAR2 (4Riewald M. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 7742-7747Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). PAR2 triggers typical G-protein-coupled as well as β-arrestin-dependent signaling and thereby induces cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor expression and regulates protein synthesis, cell motility, proliferation, and apoptosis (5Schaffner F. Ruf W. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2008; 34: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Although the TF pathway also induces thrombin-dependent PAR1 signaling and transcriptional responses are often similar following PAR1 and PAR2 activation (6Albrektsen T. Sørensen B.B. Hjortø G.M. Fleckner J. Rao L.V.M. Petersen L.C. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 1588-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), PAR2 supports biological responses that are distinct from PAR1. For example, TF-dependent angiogenesis in TF cytoplasmic domain-deleted mice requires PAR2, but not PAR1 (7Belting M. Dorrell M.I. Sandgren S. Aguilar E. Ahamed J. Dorfleutner A. Carmeliet P. Mueller B.M. Friedlander M. Ruf W. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 8Uusitalo-Jarvinen H. Kurokawa T. Mueller B.M. Andrade-Gordon P. Friedlander M. Ruf W.

Schaffner F. Kerver M. Ellies L.G. Andrade-Gordon P. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7219-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). TF·FVIIa binary complex activation of PAR2 can be specifically blocked with an antibody that minimally affects coagulation, and this antibody, but not a coagulation-blocking anti-TF antibody, prevented breast cancer growth and PAR2-dependent pregnancy complication in vivo (9Versteeg H.H.

J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3453-3461PubMed Google Scholar). The ternary TF·FVIIa·FXa complex or FXa also activate PAR2, so do proteases other than coagulation proteases (12Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 13Ruf W. Mueller B.M. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2006; 32: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The role of these signaling pathways in vivo remains unclear, and improved tools are required to define the specific roles of coagulation protease signaling via PAR2.Exosite-driven macromolecular substrate recognition is a common mechanism by which proteases of the coagulation system achieve their remarkable specificity (14Krishnaswamy S. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This also applies to the activation of macromolecular substrates by TF·FVIIa (15Baugh R.J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28826-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24171-24175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) where the initial encounter with FX is governed primarily by interactions involving exosites in FVIIa and TF (18Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1272Google Scholar, 19Norledge B.V. Petrovan R.J. Ruf W. Olson A.J. Proteins. 2003; 53: 640-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subsequent engagement of the FVIIa active site with residues of FX flanking the scissile bond then leads to proteolytic conversion of FX to FXa. Typically, cleavage of macromolecular substrates only requires a proper fit of the primary specificity residues with complementary sites in the catalytic cleft, and these interactions make only minor contributions to macromolecular substrate affinity. Exosite engagement is also a prominent feature in PAR recognition. Cleavage of PAR1 and PAR3 by thrombin is facilitated by charge interactions between exosite I in thrombin and a hirudin-like acidic element located C-terminally in the tethered PAR sequence (20Liu L.W. Vu T.K. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16977-16980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of this exosite by mutagenesis severely impairs thrombin binding and the rate of PAR1 activation (21Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). Although PAR4 does not carry a recognition sequence for thrombin's exosite I, extended interactions between thrombin and the coreceptor PAR3 support efficient thrombin-PAR4 signaling (23Bah A. Chen Z. Bush-Pec L.A. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11603-11608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Weiss E.J. Hamilton J.R. Lease K.E. Coughlin S.R. Blood. 2002; 100: 3240-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Unlike these PARs, PAR2 lacks distinct exosite recognition sequences, a feature that may be required for its role as a broadly responsive sensor for trypsin-like serine proteases.Here, we address the role of PAR2 in coagulation protease signaling and define the structural requirements for PAR2 activation by FVIIa. Mutational mapping of FVIIa demonstrates that the S2′ pocket plays a critical role in PAR2 cleavage. Point mutations in this region abolish receptor activation while maintaining essentially normal FIX and FX cleavage, indicating distinctly different modes of recognition of PAR2 and coagulation substrates by TF·FVIIa. Mutations of PAR2 confirm that efficiency of cleavage is primarily determined by complementary interactions of the catalytic cleft and that single point mutations are sufficient to generate PAR2 receptors that loose responsiveness to specific coagulation proteases. These data support novel approaches to further define the role of the promiscuous PAR2 receptor in coagulation signaling pathways.DISCUSSIONHere, we provide a mutational mapping of the protease domain of FVIIa to identify structural determinants for recognition and cleavage of its cognate substrates, FIX, FX, and PAR2. TF·FVIIa-catalyzed FIX and FX activation was largely unaffected by mutations in the catalytic cleft of FVIIa, consistent with the previously established concept that binding of the macromolecular substrate is highly dependent on exosite interactions that facilitate primary substrate recognition at the active site (15Baugh R.J. Dickinson C.D. Ruf W. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28826-28833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Shobe J. Dickinson C.D. Edgington T.S. Ruf W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24171-24175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, cleavage of PAR2 was highly sensitive to substitution of FVIIa residues in the active site cleft and its perimeter. Results with three independent signaling readouts for TF·FVIIa concordantly identified residues Gln-40, Asp-72, Gln-143, and Thr-151 as key determinants for PAR2 recognition, whereas Ala-39 and Ile-60b were found to play minor but significant roles. An unaffected FIX or FX activation is indicative of an intact structural arrangement of the active site, and the mutational effect on PAR2 activation can be interpreted as a specific effect on substrate recognition. Remarkably, the Q143N FVIIa variant did not activate PAR2, but had essentially normal pro-coagulant activity, demonstrating that these two activities can be completely dissected by protein engineering.PAR2 activation with FVIIa and PAR2 variants agrees well with the predictions made by the model in Fig. 1A, which describes the docking of the P5-P5′ fragment of PAR2 into the active cleft of FVIIa. The model identifies FVIIa residues Gln-40, Gln-143, and Thr-151 as essential elements of the S2′ pocket, which accommodates the side chain of PAR2 Leu-38 (P2′). Consistent with the model, recognition of PAR2 was shown to be sensitive both to modifications of FVIIa at the S2′ subsite and to complementary mutations of PAR2 at the P2′ subsite. PAR2 signaling was diminished by FVIIa mutations that eliminated direct hydrophobic contacts and even by subtle changes, such as the T151S mutation. We also showed a strict requirement for large bulky side chains Leu, Ile, or Phe in P2′ of PAR2 and that cleavage-resistant receptors were produced by mutations of P2′ Leu-38 to Ser, Thr, or Val. In addition, PAR2 activation was abolished by the D72N substitution in the 70–80 Ca2+-binding loop. Recent characterization of this variant and its inhibition by AT showed that it exhibited normal catalytic activity and inhibitor interaction. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the D72N FVIIa-AT complex showed that Asn-72 adopted a conformation very similar to that of Asp-72 in wt FVIIa (40Bjelke J.R. Olsen O.H. Fodje M. Svensson L.A. Bang S. Bolt G. Kragelund B.B. Persson E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25863-25870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). No significant perturbation of the Ca2+-binding loop or the catalytic cleft region was observed, which could suggest that Asp-72 interacts with P5′ Lys-41 in PAR2 as predicted by the model.Additional evidence for critical contributions to PAR2 recognition comes from the Q217E and T99Y FVIIa variants that exhibited >2-fold enhanced PAR2 binary complex signaling. Gln-217 is located adjacent to the S3/4 binding pocket, and Q217E replacement may stabilize the interaction with PAR2 P3 Lys-34. Thr-99 is located at the entrance to the S2 pocket, and substrate profiling (29Larsen K.S. Østergaard H. Bjelke J.R. Olsen O.H. Rasmussen H.B. Christensen L. Kragelund B.B. Stennicke H.R. Biochem.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) indicated that the small Thr-99 residue in wt FVIIa allows access of large side chains to the open S2 pocket and thereby creates a preference for β-branched and hydrophobic amino acids (Thr, Leu, and Phe). The bulkier Tyr-99 in FVIIa T99Y likely restricts such access and shifts the P2 specificity toward Gly (29Larsen K.S. Østergaard H. Bjelke J.R. Olsen O.H. Rasmussen H.B. Christensen L. Kragelund B.B. Stennicke H.R. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) explaining the increased rate of PAR2 cleavage and enhanced wt PAR2 signaling.The delineated critical complementary contacts of FVIIa and PAR2 allowed us to engineer the PAR2 cleavage by FXa and still maintain efficient activation by TF·FVIIa. Two such PAR2 mutants (P2 G35T and G35I) were remarkably resistant to activation by free and ternary-complexed FXa. Contrary to the exosite interaction-driven FIX and FX activation, TF·FVIIa binary complex signaling is highly dependent on direct interactions on the cell surface between the extracellular domain of PAR2 and the catalytic cleft of FVIIa. This also contrasts with the activation of PAR1 by thrombin, which is greatly facilitated by thrombin's exosite 1 interaction with a hirudin-like C-terminal element of PAR1 involving charge complementarities (21Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Disruption of this exosite interaction by mutagenesis in contrast to mutations in the primed subsite region of the active site (e.g. Arg-35 and Glu-39) severely reduced the rate of PAR1 activation (21Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PAR1 or PAR2 recognition by thrombin or TF·FVIIa thus depends on different mechanisms and structural regions of the respective proteases.In conclusion, the results presented herein provide new insight into the structural requirements for PAR2 activation by TF·FVIIa and offer clues to how specific protein-protein interactions contribute to TF·FVIIa-mediated PAR2 signaling that triggers a diversity of cellular responses in cancer, inflammation, and angiogenesis. By exploiting the predominantly active-site-driven interaction between PAR2 and its activating proteases, we demonstrate the feasibility of rationally optimizing the receptor recognition sequence to selectively reduce PAR2 activation by FXa to a minimum. The physiological relevance of TF·FVIIa·FXa or other FXa-mediated PAR2 signaling is currently incompletely understood. The FVIIa and PAR2 variants generated in this study provide important new tools to dissect the role of FVIIa-mediated PAR2 activation and to further characterize the relative importance of TF coagulation complex signaling pathways in vivo.

Unlike these PARs, PAR2 lacks distinct exosite recognition sequences, a feature that may be required for its role as a broadly responsive sensor for trypsin-like serine proteases.Here, we address the role of PAR2 in coagulation protease signaling and define the structural requirements for PAR2 activation by FVIIa. Mutational mapping of FVIIa demonstrates that the S2′ pocket plays a critical role in PAR2 cleavage. Point mutations in this region abolish receptor activation while maintaining essentially normal FIX and FX cleavage, indicating distinctly different modes of recognition of PAR2 and coagulation substrates by TF·FVIIa. Mutations of PAR2 confirm that efficiency of cleavage is primarily determined by complementary interactions of the catalytic cleft and that single point mutations are sufficient to generate PAR2 receptors that loose responsiveness to specific coagulation proteases. These data support novel approaches to further define the role of the promiscuous PAR2 receptor in coagulation signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2033652720,"The molecular structure of mouse Mucin 21 (Muc21)/epiglycanin is proposed to have 98 tandem repeats of 15 amino acids and three exceptional repeats with 12 or 13 amino acids each, followed by a stem domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. A cDNA of Muc21 having 84 tandem repeats of 15 amino acids was constructed and transfected using a Venus vector into HEK 293T cells. The fluorescent cells, which were considered to express Muc21, were nonadherent. This antiadhesion effect was lessened when constructs with smaller numbers of tandem repeats were used, suggesting that the tandem repeat domain plays a crucial role. Cells expressing Muc21 were significantly less adherent to each other and to extracellular matrix components than control cells. Antibody binding to the cell surface integrin subunits alpha5, alpha6, and beta1 was reduced in Muc21 transfectants in a tandem repeat-dependent manner, whereas equal amounts of proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Muc21 was expressed as a large glycoprotein that was highly glycosylated with O-glycans at the cell surface, as detected by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and lectin blotting. Although at least a portion of Muc21 was glycosylated with sialylated glycans, removal of sialic acid did not influence the prevention of adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1587183889,"Kinetoplastid RNA (k-RNA) editing is a complex process in the mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoa, including Trypanosoma brucei, that involves the guide RNA-directed insertion and deletion of uridines from precursor-mRNAs to produce mature, translatable mRNAs. k-RNA editing is performed by multiprotein complexes called editosomes. Additional non-editosome components termed k-RNA-editing accessory factors affect the extent of editing of specific RNAs or classes of RNAs. The T. brucei p22 protein was identified as one such accessory factor. Here we show that p22 contributes to cell growth in the procyclic form of T. brucei and functions as a cytochrome oxidase subunit II-specific k-RNA-editing accessory factor. To gain insight into its functions, we solved the crystal structure of the T. brucei p22 protein to 2.0-A resolution. The p22 structure consists of a six-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheet flanked by five alpha-helices. Three p22 subunits combine to form a tight trimer that is primarily stabilized by interactions between helical residues. One side of the trimer is strikingly acidic, while the opposite face is more neutral. Database searches show p22 is structurally similar to human p32, which has a number of functions, including regulation of RNA splicing. p32 interacts with a number of target proteins via its alpha1 N-terminal helix, which is among the most conserved regions between p22 and p32. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that p22 interacts with the editosome and the k-RNA accessory protein, TbRGG2, and alpha1 of p22 was shown to be important for the p22-TbRGG2 interaction. Thus, these combined studies suggest that p22 mediates its role in k-RNA editing by acting as an adaptor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1976001004,"We investigated the ability of type I collagen telopeptides to bind neighboring collagen molecules, which is thought to be the initial event in fibrillogenesis. Limited hydrolysis by actinidain protease produced monomeric collagen, which consisted almost entirely of α1 and α2 chains. As seen with ultrahigh resolution scanning electron microscopy, actinidain-hydrolyzed collagen exhibited unique self-assembly, as if at an intermediate stage, and formed a novel suprastructure characterized by poor fibrillogenesis. Then, the N- and C-terminal sequences of chicken type I collagen hydrolyzed by actinidain or pepsin were determined by Edman degradation and de novo sequence analysis with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry, respectively. In the C-telopeptide region of the α1 chain, pepsin cleaved between Asp1035 and Phe1036, and actinidain between Gly1032 and Gly1033. Thus, the actinidain-hydrolyzed α1 chain is shorter at the C terminus by three residues, Gly1033, Phe1034, and Asp1035. In the α2 chain, both proteases cleaved between Glu1030 and Val1031. We demonstrated that a synthetic nonapeptide mimicking the α1 C-terminal sequence including GFD weakly inhibited the self-assembly of pepsin-hydrolyzed collagen, whereas it remarkably accelerated that of actinidain-hydrolyzed collagen. We conclude that the specific GFD sequence of the C-telopeptide of the α1 chain plays a crucial role in stipulating collagen suprastructure and in subsequent fibril formation.

Our experimental approach to understand the mechanism of fibril formation was to investigate type I collagen that had been partially hydrolyzed by actinidain protease (EC 3.4.22.14). Actinidain is a cysteine protease found in kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) and is a member of the papain superfamily with a broad specificity toward a variety of substrates (27McDowall M.A. Eur. J.

We previously found that actinidain-hydrolyzed collagen (AHCol) of tuna retained its triple-helical structure at pH 4.0 and showed the same thermal stability as that of ASCol, as judged by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. AHCol, however, was found to be essentially monomeric with no cross-linkages, and therefore it provides a unique system for further characterization (30Morimoto K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Morimoto K. Kawabata K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Saito T. Tonomura B. J. Biochem. 2009; 145: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the exact amino acid sequence is vital for understanding the behavior of collagen, including fibril formation. Although the N-terminal amino acid sequence of collagen can be determined by Edman degradation, there has been no reliable method for determining the C-terminal sequence. Using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and known amino acid sequence information, we recently determined the amino acid sequences of novel proteins following trypsin digestion (32Yano M. Nagai K. Morimoto K. Miyamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Nagai K. Yotsukura N. Ikegami H. Kimura H. Morimoto K. Electrophoresis. 2008; 29: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We employed this method in the current work to identify the C-terminal amino acid sequence of collagen preparations. In this study, by comparing the properties of ASCol, PHCol, and AHCol derived from chicken skin, we identified an amino acid sequence that is required for the fibril formation of type I collagen. ASCol and PHCol were prepared from chicken skin according to the method of Morimoto et al. (30Morimoto K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Actinidain was isolated from kiwi fruit as described (29Morimoto K. Furuta E. Hashimoto H. Inouye K. J. Biochem. 2006; 139: 1065-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Crude ASCol in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0 (final concentration 2 mg/ml), was incubated with 0.15% actinidain (w/v) at 20 °C for 7 days. AHCol was salted out by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 2.5 m. The resulting PHCol and AHCol samples were dialyzed against ultrapure water to remove small molecule contaminants and then lyophilized. The purity of the ASCol, PHCol, and AHCol samples was assessed by 5% SDS-PAGE in the presence of 4 m urea (30Morimoto K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein molecular mass markers were obtained from APRO Life Science Institute Inc. (Naruto, Japan). After electrophoresis, proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and their relative amounts were estimated by ImageJ software (version 1.4.2; National Institutes of Health). The collagen concentration was estimated from the weight of the lyophilized preparation. The triple-helical structure of each of ASCol, PHCol, and AHCol (prepared as described above) was confirmed by CD spectra as reported (30Morimoto K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol.

Biochem. 2009; 145: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The far-UV CD spectrum of the collagen preparations was measured by scanning through the range of 200–250 nm with a CD spectropolarimeter J-820 (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). Measurement was carried out using a 1.0 mg/ml solution of ASCol, PHCol, or AHCol in 20 mm phosphoric acid (pH 2.2) in a quartz cell with a 0.1-cm optical path length at 20 °C. PHCol and AHCol (final concentration 3 mg/ml) were dissolved in 15 mm acetic acid for 20 h at 4 °C. Four glass disks (ϕ13 mm) were coated with the PHCol or AHCol solution and air-dried at 20 °C. Then, the glass disks were placed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C to start self-assembly. After an incubation period of 10, 30, 90, or 120 min, self-assembly was stopped by placing each glass disk in 2% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 1 h. Sample preparations for SEM observation were carried out according to the methods of Nakayama et al. (34Nakayama T. Shirane J. Hieshima K. Shibano M. Watanabe M. Jin Z. Nagakubo D. Saito T. Shimomura Y. Yoshie O. Virology. 2006; 350: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Collagen self-assembly was observed under an S-900 ultrahigh resolution SEM (Hitachi) with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The α1 and α2 chains of PHCol and AHCol were separated by 5% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane at 180 mV for 1 h. Each protein spot corresponding to the α1 or α2 chain was used to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence using a Procise 494 HT Protein Sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). To determine the C-terminal amino acid sequence of PHCol and AHCol using MS/MS analysis, samples were first hydrolyzed with collagenase to obtain shorter polypeptide chains according to the published methods (7Chung L.

MMP-1-mediated hydrolysis was performed by the addition of 160 μl of 0.5 unit/ml MMP-1 solution (derived from active human fibroblasts; EC 3.4.24.7; Life Laboratory Corporation, Yamagata, Japan) to 200 μl of a 1.0 mg/ml PHCol (or AHCol) solution and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 days. The resulting fragments of the α1 and α2 chains were separated by 11% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The larger 3/4 fragment and the smaller 1/4 fragment generated from PHCol or AHCol by MMP-1 were named TCA and TCB, respectively. Each polypeptide corresponding to the TCBα1 and TCBα2 chains was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed using a 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF MS (Applied Biosystems Inc.) according to our published methods (32Yano M.

Prediction of the amino acid sequence from MS/MS data was performed using DeNovo ExplorerTM (version 1.22; Applied Biosystems Inc.) with an MS/MS tolerance of 0.2 Da. The “cold start” procedure for fibril formation was used to observe collagen self-assembly (16Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol.

The self-assembly of collagen molecules was detected by monitoring turbidity as observed by an increase in optical density at 313 nm. At 20 °C, a 2.0 mg/ml collagen solution in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, was diluted 10-fold with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; the final collagen concentration in the neutralized solution was 0.20 mg/ml (0.67 μm). The neutralized solution was poured into a cuvette with a 1-cm path length at 20 °C, and then heated to 37 °C. The turbidity of the solution was measured at 1-min intervals using a UV-2200A spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Five synthetic nonapeptides mimicking the sequence around the C terminus of PHCol and AHCol were purchased from Toray Research Center Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Each individual nonapeptide (PGPPGPPSG, PGPPSGGFD, PSGGFDFSF, GFDFSFLPQ, and FSFLPQPPQ) was added singly to a neutralized solution of collagen at up to a 400-fold molar excess over collagen, the molecular weight of which was assumed to be 300,000. The turbidity change of the mixture was measured as above. The dose dependence of PSGGFDFSF at 10-, 50-, 100-, or 400-fold molar excess over PHCol or AHCol was examined. The following characterizing parameters were estimated manually from the turbidity progress curve (16Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol.

The components of ASCol, PHCol, and AHCol were analyzed by 5% SDS-PAGE (see supplemental Fig. 1). The molecular mass and relative amount of each component are shown in Table 1. These data indicate that the hydrolysis site for collagen must differ between pepsin and actinidain.TABLE 1Molecular mass and relative amount of each componentChainASColPHColAHColkDaContent (%)kDaContent (%)kDaContent (%)β1125927254172532β1224326241122408α1132251294312758α2116221132811232 Open table in a new tab The CD spectrum for ASCol was typical of a triple-helical structure, with a peak maximum at 221–222 nm. The spectra for AHCol and PHCol were identical to each other and similar to that of ASCol (see supplemental Fig. 2). These observations are consistent with our previous report on tuna collagen (30Morimoto K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The resulting SEM snapshots of self-assembly of PHCol and AHCol are shown in Fig. 1, illustrating the changes in collagen suprastructure at various incubation times. PHCol spontaneously formed typical fibrils, with fibrils increasing their diameter from 10 nm to 500 nm during the 120-min incubation. In addition, the fibrils showed a d-periodic banding pattern. On the other hand, AHCol showed a novel nanoscale meshwork suprastructure with a “spider-web” appearance. No fibril growth was observed during the incubation period. Two N-terminal sequences, H2N-YDEKS- and H2N-VAVPG-, were found in the α1 chain of PHCol, and two N-terminal sequences, H2N-VAVPG- and H2N-VPGPM-, were found in the α1 chain of AHCol. Two N-terminal sequences, H2N-ADFGP- and H2N-FGPGP-, were also found in the α2 chain of PHCol, and three sequences, H2N-DFGPG-, H2N-GPGPM-, and H2N-LMGPR-, were found in the α2 chain of AHCol. The N-terminal amino acid sequences therefore showed rather minor differences between PHCol and AHCol. Comparison of these sequences with the entire amino acid sequence of chicken type I collagen (Gallus gallus) deposited in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot data base (P02457, version 80; P02467, version 87) identified the cleavage sites of pepsin and actinidain in the N-telopeptide region (Fig. 2 and see “Discussion”). The SDS-PAGE result of AHCol after MMP-1 hydrolysis was similar to that of PHCol (see supplemental Fig. 3). Two fragments, TCAα1 (96 kDa) and TCBα1 (29 kDa), were obtained from each α1 chain. The α2 chain was also hydrolyzed into two fragments, TCAα2 (86 kDa) and TCBα2 (26 kDa). Only the TCB fragments were subjected to further analysis, however, because they were thought to have been derived from the C terminus of PHCol and AHCol, by analogy with previous reports (7Chung L.

The C-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by de novo sequence analysis using MALDI-TOF/TOF. Fig. 3, A and B, shows the MALDI-TOF MS spectra of the trypsin digests of TCBα1 chains of PHCol and AHCol, respectively. To identify the specific peak originating from the C-terminal peptide, the two spectra were compared, and peaks at m/z 2654.32 for PHCol and m/z 2335.11 for AHCol were identified as unique to each collagen preparation. The amino acid sequences of these peaks were further analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF and identified, by y- and b- series ions, to be GRTGEVGPVGPOGPOGPOGPOGPPSGGFD for the peak at m/z 2654.32 and GRTGEVGPVGPOGPOGPOGPOGPPSG for the peak at m/z 2335.11 (see supplemental Fig. 4), where O refers to hydroxyproline. In both cases, four hydroxyproline residues were identified at the same positions as those in the data base sequence. The tryptic digest of the TCBα2 chain showed the same peak profile in MALDI-TOF MS for both PHCol and AHCol (Fig. 4). We identified the C-terminal fragment as the peak at m/z 2598.16, because this was the only peak that did not contain a C-terminal K or R, as determined by a preliminary MS/MS analysis. This peak was applied to MS/MS de novo sequencing analysis, and the amino acid sequence was determined to be GSHGSQGPAGPOGPOGPOGPOGODGGGYE (see supplemental Fig. 5). Thus, the C-terminal amino acid sequences of both TCBα2 chains were similar using the same sequencing method, and five hydroxyproline residues were identified in the sequence. The putative pepsin and actinidain cleavage sites of the C-telopeptide region are shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, a clear difference between PHCol and AHCol was found in the GFD sequence at the C terminus of the α1 chain.FIGURE 5C-terminal amino acid sequences of α1 and α2 chains of chicken type I collagen.

Five synthetic nonapeptides (described under “Experimental Procedures”) were tested. Without the addition of the nonapeptides, PHCol, which formed typical fibrils as seen by SEM (Fig. 1), showed a high rate of increase in turbidity, with tlag of 32 min, tmax of 57 min, and (dA/dt)max of 12.3 × 10−3 OD·min−1. However, AHCol showed a longer lag time and a lower rate with a tlag of 100 min, tmax of 155 min, and (dA/dt) max of 5.0 × 10−3 OD·min−1 (Fig. 6A). The addition of four of the five nonapeptides did not affect the self-assembly of either PHCol or AHCol. Interestingly, however, one nonapeptide, PSGGFDFSF (400-fold molar concentration), weakly inhibited PHCol self-assembly but markedly accelerated AHCol self-assembly (Fig. 6A, c and c′). The turbidity parameters of PHCol in the presence of this nonapeptide changed to: tlag, 35 min; tmax, 67 min; and (dA/dt)max, 9.3 × 10−3 OD·min−1. On the other hand, those parameters for AHCol in the presence of this nonapeptide were: tlag, 50 min; tmax, 85 min; and (dA/dt)max, 8.7 × 10−3 OD·min−1. Moreover, the effect of the relative molar excess of PSGGFDFSF (10–400-fold) on the self-assembly of PHCol and AHCol was examined (Fig. 6, B and C). Substantial differences were observed in the values of the tlag and tmax for AHCol (see supplemental Table 1). This nonapeptide appeared to affect the initial step in AHCol self-assembly. Collagen fibril formation is a multistep process occurring in a sequential manner between adjacent molecules. The intrinsic propensity of collagen to undergo fibrillogenesis must be connected to the amino acid sequence of the N- and C-terminal domains because truncation of either or both of the N- and C-terminal telopeptide regions leads to impaired collagen fibrillogenesis (19Helseth Jr., D.L.

In this study, we compared the structural features of two types of protease-hydrolyzed collagen molecules, PHCol and AHCol, obtained from limited hydrolysis by pepsin and actinidain, respectively, from chicken skin-derived ASCol. These collagen preparations were chosen because PHCol and AHCol derived similarly from tuna skin show interesting structural differences (30Morimoto K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Morimoto K. Kawabata K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Saito T. Tonomura B. J. Biochem. 2009; 145: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Full sequence information of tuna skin collagen is not available. Therefore, we chose chicken skin as the source of collagen for this study because the chicken collagen sequence is known. From SDS-PAGE analysis (see supplemental Fig. 1), PHCol showed at least five bands, corresponding to α1, α2, β11, β12, and γ polypeptide chains, whereas AHCol exhibited mainly two bands, corresponding to chains α1 and α2. The relative content of α1 and α2 chains increased, and that of β11 and β12 chains decreased following the limited hydrolysis by pepsin or actinidain (Table 1). AHCol can be considered as an essentially monomeric collagen in which 58% of molecules are composed of two α1 chains and 32% of α2 chains, with few cross-linkages between α chains. These results are consistent with our previous data on tuna AHCol (30Morimoto K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Tonomura B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Morimoto K. Kawabata K. Kunii S. Hamano K. Saito T. Tonomura B. J. Biochem. 2009; 145: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, after a 10-min incubation, collagen molecules appeared to adhere to adjacent molecules at specific binding positions. No preferential lateral orientation was observed, indicating that the early stage of self-assembly was controlled by the binding between triple helices. After 30 min, the PHCol molecules assembled with each other and clearly formed filaments, and finally typical d-periodic banding pattern appeared in the fibril. In contrast, we observed a novel meshwork suprastructure for AHCol upon self-assembly after incubation times of 10–120 min, and the feature of self-assembly remained constant over the 120-min incubation. The SEM observations suggest that the meshwork suprastructure may be an intermediate in the early stage of filament reconstitution. Cabral et al. (24Cabral W.A. Fertala A. Green L.K. Körkkö J. Forlino A. Marini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Kuznetsova and Leikin (26Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36083-36088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) suggested that molecular recognition and fibril formation are controlled by the triple-helical domain. We demonstrated that the triple-helical structure of the AHCol molecule is identical to that of PHCol (see supplemental Fig. 2). AHCol, therefore, should have the same initial propensity for self-assembly as ASCol or PHCol. An understanding of the subsequent maturation phase of self-assembly requires an analysis of azimuthal and lateral growth. We observed that AHCol can grow in azimuthal orientations and that there was no specific packing arrangement (Fig. 1). Using molecular modeling, Malone et al. (25Malone J.P. Veis A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15358-15366Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Malone J.P. George A. Veis A. Proteins. 2004; 54: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) recently concluded that the N- and C-telopeptide structures and the ordered helical structures were strongly related to the molecular packing of collagen molecules. Such a difference in AHCol structure suggests that the N and C termini must differ significantly from those of PHCol. These results prompted us to determine the amino acid sequences of these termini. Pepsin cleaves the α1 chain at two sites, Gly5–Tyr6 and Gly12–Val13. Thus, the PHCol α1 chain has at least two components, one of which contains Lys9. Pepsin cleavage of the α2 chain at Ala7–Ala8 and Asp9–Phe10 removes Lys6 from both components. Therefore, the possibility to cross-link the α1 chain via Lys9 is partly retained in PHCol. Actinidain, on the other hand, cleaves the α1 chain at two sites (Gly12–Val13, Ala14–Val15) and the α2 chain at three sites (Ala8–Asp9, Phe10–Gly11, Gly16–Leu17). AHCol, therefore, has no remaining cross-linking residues because the α1 chain Lys9 and α2 chain Lys6 are in the leaving N-telopeptide fragments. These results are consistent with the observed lower content of β11 and β12 chain in AHCol (Table 1). The H2N-(YDEKSAG)(VA)V- sequence of the α1 chain and the H2N-(A)(D)(F)(GPGPMG)L- sequence of the α2 chain correspond to the differences in the N-terminal sequences of PHCol and AHCol (Fig. 2). Our results were in good agreement with the registered sequence data of the α1 chain of chicken type I collagen and revealed that pepsin and actinidain cleaved the α1 polypeptide chain at Asp1035–Phe1036 and Gly1032–Gly1033, respectively (Fig. 5). The difference in the molecular mass of the two peaks at m/z 2654.32 and m/z 2335.11 in Fig. 3 is m/z 319.21, which corresponds to the mass of the intervening tripeptide HN-GFD-CO (m/z 319.33). The results for the α2 chain C-telopeptide showed that both pepsin and actinidain cleaved the polypeptide at Glu1030–Val1031. In addition, we identified five hydroxyproline residues in a GPP repeat sequence, at positions 1013, 1016, 1019, 1022, and 1024. There are no annotation data related to hydroxyproline in the sequence of the chicken type I collagen α2 chain, according to the UniProt entry (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02467). We demonstrated here that both PHCol and AHCol have four GPO repeat sequences in each α1 and α2 chain (see supplemental Figs. 4 and 5). These are likely to be essential for the stability of chicken collagen. The result for PHCol (Fig. 6A) is in qualitative agreement with published data (16Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11741-11745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Williams B.R. Gelman R.A. Poppke D.C. Piez K.A. J. Biol.

The tlag of AHCol, however, was much longer than that of PHCol, and the fibril growth rate decreased to ∼41% of that of PHCol. Despite the fact that the amino acid sequence of AHCol is generally similar to that of PHCol, the kinetics of self-assembly differ markedly between these collagens. It has been suggested that the C-terminal sequence of collagen plays a substantive role in fibril formation (20Capaldi M.J. Chapman J.A. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 2291-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Prockop D.J. Fertala A. J. Biol.

We have demonstrated that the AHCol α1 chain has a unique C terminus (Fig. 5). It is therefore worthwhile to investigate AHCol self-assembly further. Interestingly, we found that only one nonapeptide, PSGGFDFSF, among five that mimic the C-telopeptide region of the α1 chain, influenced the turbidity kinetics. The N-terminal six residues of PSGGFDFSF overlap the C-terminal sequence of PHCol and thus may compete with PHCol for the binding site on adjacent collagen molecules (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, for AHCol, in which the sequence GFD is missing and only three residues at the C terminus overlap the N-terminal sequence of the nonapeptide, the nonapeptide seems to behave as if a piece of mending tape by filling the vacant space made by truncation (Fig. 6C). The seemingly opposite effects of this nonapeptide on self-assembly may provide an important clue to understanding the initial step of fibrillogenesis, although the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. This study has directly shown that the primary structure of the N and C termini of chicken type I collagen influences the mechanism of fibrillogenesis and the resulting suprastructure and that the GFD sequence of the α1 chain is required for lateral growth of fibrils. Interestingly, the GFD sequence in the C-telopeptide region of the α1(I) chain is universally conserved in human (P02452), dog (Q9XSJ7), chicken (P02457), African clawed frog (Q802B5), Japanese common newt (Q9YIB4), and zebrafish (B1WB89) collagen. Similarly, a GYD sequence is conserved in cow (P02453), rat (P02454), and mouse (P11087) collagen. In conclusion, several lines of evidence support our hypothesis that the presence of the α1 chain telopeptide region containing a GFD or GYD sequence is especially important for conferring orientation specificity. PHCol and AHCol from chicken type I collagen, for which the N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences have been determined, are excellent choices for the study of self-assembly and suprastructure formation.

This process, as measured by an increase in the density of high affinity ligand-binding sites, is associated with multiple physiological processes ranging from nicotine addiction to a therapeutic target for intervention in age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer or Parkinson disease where α4β2 nAChR expression becomes dysregulated (for recent discussion see Ref. 3Albuquerque E.X. Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. Rogers S.W. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 73-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) leading to receptor up-regulation are complex and may vary among different cell systems. For example, up-regulation has been attributed to enhanced receptor assembly, increased efficiency of receptor trafficking (possibly through the interaction with chaperones or ligands that stabilize subunit interactions), changes in degradation rates, altered subunit stoichiometry, or changes in conformational states (5Buisson B. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Vallejo Y.F. Buisson B. Bertrand D. Green W.N. J.

Another feature of up-regulation is that compounds that bind to the receptor ligand-binding site (both agonists and antagonists) are sufficient to promote this process even when receptors are expressed in heterologous systems such as Xenopus oocytes or transfected mammalian cultured cells (3Albuquerque E.X. Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. Rogers S.W. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 73-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 4Govind A.P. Vezina P. Green W.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Up-regulation to nicotine is the most common context in which this receptor property is examined. However, this process can also be responsive to certain pro-inflammatory cytokines (8Gahring L.C. Days E.L. Kaasch T. González de Mendoza M. Owen L. Persiyanov K. Rogers S.W. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 166: 88-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In particular, the simultaneous exposure of α4β2 to receptor ligands such as nicotine and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) strongly enhances up-regulation of α4β2 high affinity binding sites in an almost synergistic manner (9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, while up-regulation is a key feature of nAChR biology and clearly important to many of the alterations in physiological responses leading to addiction (3Albuquerque E.X. Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. Rogers S.W. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 73-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 4Govind A.P. Vezina P. Green W.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the normal physiological context of this receptor response and the identity of natural endogenous mediators that impart it are unknown. Choline is another endogenous agent of importance to nAChR function. Many examples exist where oral choline supplementation to a normal diet is correlated to increased brain acetylcholine concentrations and enhanced performance on memory tasks that in part are related to increased nAChR function (e.g. see Refs. 10Guseva M.V.

In addition to its obvious role as a metabolic precursor to the principal endogenous cholinergic neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, choline can also act to modify receptor activation. For example, choline is a full and potent agonist of α7 or α9 containing nAChRs, and it can modify the function of certain other nAChRs such as those composed of α3β4 subunits (13Mandelzys A. De Koninck P. Cooper E. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 1212-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Alkondon M. Pereira E.F. Cortes W.S. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. Eur. J.

The direct interaction of choline with the high affinity nicotine-binding site of α4β2 is at most weak and is probably unlikely to occur normally (14Alkondon M. Pereira E.F. Cortes W.S. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 16Xiao Y. Kellar K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Thus, despite the actions of choline on other nAChRs, it has not been examined in detail for its impact on the expression of high affinity α4β2 nAChRs nor within a pro-inflammatory context where the impact of choline is documented (e.g. Refs. 10Guseva M.V.

Neurobiol. 1998; 35: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we noted that choline alone can promote up-regulation of α4β2 nAChRs expressed by 293 cells stably expressing this receptor. Choline-mediated up-regulation, as measured by an increase in the density of the high affinity α4β2 ligand, [3H]epibatidine ([3H]EB), is dose-dependent and corresponds with increased expression of the β2 subunit. Approximately 60% of choline-mediated up-regulation was inhibited by the choline kinase inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (HC3) indicating that choline acts through a choline kinase-dependent and -independent pathway (21Burt A.M. J. Neurochem. 1977; 28: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Choline-mediated up-regulation was additive with weaker inducers of ligand-mediated up-regulation but not when stronger mediators of this process (such as nicotine) were co-applied. In the presence of TNFα and choline, up-regulation exhibits a more additive effect that is distinctly different from the dramatic impact this cytokine has on nicotine-mediated up-regulation (9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our findings extend the view that α4β2 up-regulation is responsive to endogenous mediators, including this important nutrient as well as pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNFα. These findings also suggest that up-regulation could serve as an important component of the normal role of α4β2 and the nAChR-inflammatory interaction, especially in the absence of potent exogenous agents such as nicotine.

Because choline is an essential nutrient, it is present in cultured cell media, and it is rapidly depleted by cells when added. Consequently, care must be exercised to control concentrations. For this study, HEK293 (293) cells were passed into 100-mm culture dishes containing 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and geneticin (1.0 g/liter) as described previously (9Gahring L.C.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h before treatment as indicated. Up-regulation of nAChRs was measured 18–24 h thereafter. The binding of [3H]EB (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to cell membrane preparations was done as described previously (9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol.

Briefly, 18–24 h after treatment, cells were gently washed with room temperature phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into ice-cold 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, pelleted, resuspended, gently homogenized, and centrifuged again at low speed (100 × g; 5 min) before removing the supernatant, which was again centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Binding assays, done in triplicate, used 5 μg of resuspended crude membranes that were incubated with 5 nm [3H]EB for 2–4 h at room temperature. Addition of 300 μm nicotine hydrogen tartrate (Sigma) for 30 min to parallel tubes before adding [3H]EB served to measure nonspecific binding. Samples were then vacuum filtrated through Whatman GF/C filters to collect bound ligand and then quantitated using standard scintillation counting. The specific binding was calculated by averaging the total binding minus the nonspecific (nicotine-blocked) binding. Data were analyzed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, version 4.03 (9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were harvested, and crude membranes were prepared before mixing a fixed amount (20 μg) in gel-loading buffer containing dithiothreitol and heated to 95 °C for 10–15 min. The samples were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE fractionation followed by semi-dry transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked with 5% dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and rocked overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody. Antibodies were rabbit polyclonal 5009 or 4964 (α4) and 4842 or 305 (β2) as described elsewhere (9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol.

Blots were washed, incubated at room temperature for 1 h in blocking solution containing peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, washed again, and the bands detected on film after developing with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gels were recorded on a computer scanner, and the images were assembled using either Photoshop version 5.5 or Image Pro-plus (version 4.5, Media Cybernetics) software. Detailed descriptions of sucrose gradient analysis were described previously (8Gahring L.C. Days E.L. Kaasch T. González de Mendoza M. Owen L. Persiyanov K. Rogers S.W. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 166: 88-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected 293 cells were solubilized (Triton X-100), and the cleared supernatant was layered onto a 5-ml sucrose gradient (continuous 5–20% (w/w); 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Gradients were centrifuged at 54,000 rpm for 2 h (SW55Ti rotor, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) at 4 °C. Fractions were collected at various volumes to ensure desired resolution with an Auto Densiflow and FC203B fraction collector (Labconco, Kansas City, MO; Gilson, Middleton, WI). Sucrose gradient markers were the 20 S proteosome subunit (20 S, from Dr. M. Rechsteiner, University of Utah, Salt Lake City), catalase (11.2 S, Sigma), β-amylase (8.9 S, Sigma), and bovine serum albumin (4.2 S, Pierce). A well known feature of nAChRs is that subunit composition determines their pharmacological and functional characteristics, including the magnitude of the up-regulation response (3Albuquerque E.X. Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. Rogers S.W. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 73-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 4Govind A.P. Vezina P. Green W.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The nAChR receptor consisting of α4 + β2 (α4β2) subunits is the receptor in the mammalian central nervous system that provides both the majority of high affinity nicotine binding and significant up-regulation (3–4-fold) in response to chronic agonist exposure (1Flores C.M. Rogers S.W. Pabreza L.A. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mao D. Perry D.C. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 446-456PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation response is recapitulated in cultured cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding α4 and β2 subunits (2Mao D. Perry D.C. Yasuda R.P. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 446-456PubMed Google Scholar, 4Govind A.P. Vezina P. Green W.N. Biochem.

As noted above, during the course of experiments designed to evaluate the impact of nicotine and pro-inflammatory cytokines on the process of up-regulation, we noted that certain conditions of culture impacted upon this process. One candidate for this effect was choline, an essential nutrient that is closely associated with multiple nAChR functions and is rapidly depleted from the media by cells undergoing cell growth. Because receptor subunit composition corresponds with the magnitude of up-regulation as measured by an increase in [3H]EB-binding site density, the impact of choline treatment on this process for four different nAChR receptor subtypes expressed stably by independent 293 cell lines was measured after exposure to 500 μm choline for 24 h (see “Experimental Procedures”). The nAChRs examined were of the α4β2, α4β4, α3β2, or α3β4 subunit subtypes, all of which exhibit characteristic levels of up-regulation following nicotine exposure (4Govind A.P. Vezina P. Green W.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol.

Lett. 2004; 14: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 1A. The most dramatic enhancement of ligand binding was for α4β2-expressing cells where 6-fold increases can occur. To a lesser extent, but still significant, choline induced up-regulation of both α3β2 (∼3-fold) and α4β4 (∼2-fold), although native α3β2 receptor density was very low and could be difficult to detect in nontreated cells (16Xiao Y. Kellar K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells expressing α3β4 exhibited no significant choline-mediated enhancement of [3H]EB-binding sites which is similar to the response by this receptor subtype to nicotine (9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 16Xiao Y. Kellar K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This result is essentially identical to the results for up-regulation to nicotine reported previously for these cell lines (9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Alkondon M. Pereira E.F. Cortes W.S. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2734-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Choline-mediated increased [3H]EB binding by α4β2 is dose-dependent (Fig. 1B). In these experiments, 250 μm choline produced effectively the maximal up-regulation. Because choline impacts many cellular processes, this concentration was selected for subsequent experiments. Of note is that maintaining choline in the media at the amounts indicated is difficult due to its cellular uptake and metabolism. Therefore, doses are defined in terms of the concentration of choline added to the media 2 days after plating. The process of up-regulation examined by us previously using this transfected 293 cell line also required protein synthesis (9Gahring L.C. Osborne-Hereford A.V. Vasquez-Opazo G.A. Rogers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 693-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This is also the case for choline-mediated up-regulation as shown in Fig. 1C. For this experiment, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) was added to cultures together with choline (250 μm). Although choline-mediated up-regulation in the absence of cycloheximide was ∼5-fold, inhibition of protein synthesis completely abolished all up-regulation relative to matched control cultures. How choline elicits up-regulation was examined. It was first determined if an interaction of choline with muscarinic receptors contributed to the up-regulation effect. As shown in Fig. 2A, the muscarinic antagonist, atropine at 10 μm, failed to inhibit choline-mediated up-regulation of α4β2 [3H]EB binding. Similar results were obtained for scopolamine (10 μm; data not shown). Thus, muscarinic receptors are not necessary for choline-mediated up-regulation. Choline is actively transported into the cell via three choline transporter activities (27Lockman P.R. Allen D.D. Drug. Dev. Ind. Pharm. 2002; 28: 749-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These include the sodium-dependent high affinity uptake transporter, which is predominantly expressed by adult neurons, the choline-like transporter, which is sodium-independent and low affinity and expressed by cells throughout the body, and the blood-brain barrier transporter. Once in the cell, a major fate of choline is phosphorylation by choline kinase activity (28Aoyama C. Liao H. Ishidate K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 266-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). An effective inhibitor of both the high affinity choline transporter and choline kinase activity is HC3 (21Burt A.M. J. Neurochem. 1977; 28: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Apparsundaram S. Ferguson S.M. George Jr., A.L. Blakely R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 30Ribeiro F.M. Alves-Silva J. Volknandt W. Martins-Silva C. Mahmud H. Wilhelm A. Gomez M.V. Rylett R.J. Ferguson S.S. Prado V.F. Prado M.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Campos J. Núñez M.C. Conejo-García A. Sánchez-Martín R.M. Hernández-Alcoceba R. Rodríguez-González A.

Med. 2006; 231: 490-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). When this compound is added to cells prior to choline, it partially inhibits choline-mediated up-regulation (Fig. 2A). To determine which HC3 target dominates this response, the expression of choline transporter transcripts was measured by real time-PCR using commercially available primers (ABI) specific to each transporter transcript. Transcripts for the choline-like transporter were detected in these 293 cells (27 cycle threshold compared with 17 for β-actin; data not shown), but no evidence for expression of the high affinity transporter and only a weak, if any, signal for the BBB transporter was found (not shown). Consistent with the absence of high affinity choline transporters in these 293 α4β2 cells, no specific high affinity [3H]HC3 binding to cell membrane preparations was detected (data not shown and see Ref. 29Apparsundaram S. Ferguson S.M. George Jr., A.L. Blakely R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, because the high affinity transporter was absent in these cells, the impact of HC3 in this system should be dominated by inhibition of the choline kinase activity. To determine the dose of HC3 that achieves optimal inhibition of up-regulation, HC3 at different concentrations ranging from 6.6 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−3m was added 15 min prior to adding 250 μm choline. Each dish was harvested; membranes were prepared, and [3H]EB was measured/μg of membrane protein. These values were then normalized to control cells receiving choline but no HC3. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 2B. The maximum inhibition of choline-mediated up-regulation achieved using HC3 was only 60%. At greater concentrations of HC3 (1 mm), indications of cell stress and possible toxicity were present. However, the dose-response curve in Fig. 2B suggests the effect of HC3 is saturating prior to reaching the maximum dose tested. The HC3 inhibition curve was best fit by a single regression (assuming saturation by HC3 at 500 μm) for a calculated Ki of ∼25 μm. This is in agreement with the IC50 values of 20–57 μm reported for human choline kinase (20Rodríguez-González A. Ramírez de Molina A. Benítez-Rajal J. Lacal J.C. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 191-201PubMed Google Scholar, 21Burt A.M. J. Neurochem. 1977; 28: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34Janardhan S. Srivani P. Sastry G.N. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 1169-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, the choline-like low affinity transporter is relatively poorly inhibited by HC3 (Ki of ∼ 200 μm) (32Michel V. Yuan Z. Ramsubir S. Bakovic M. Exp. Biol. Med. 2006; 231: 490-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) suggesting choline kinase as the likely target of HC3 in this system. The interpretation of HC3 inhibition is complicated by reports that choline acts on cells through both HC3-dependent and -independent mechanisms that are tissue-specific and developmentally regulated (33Abreu-Villaca Y. Filgueiras C.C. Manhaes A.C. Behav. Brain Res. 2010; PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the HC3-insensitive component of up-regulation reflects altered α4β2 ligand binding affinity under these measurement conditions (Triton-solubilized membranes), competition for [3H]EB binding by nicotine was measured on membranes prepared from cells treated with nicotine, choline, or choline + HC3. Regardless of whether nicotine, choline or choline in the presence of HC3 was used to promote α4β2 receptor up-regulation (Fig. 2C), the Ki for [3H]EB was ∼13 nm. Thus, HC3-sensitive and -insensitive pathways leading to up-regulation that function independently of the high affinity choline transporter are present in these 293 cells. Of note is that choline acting through both HC3-dependent and -independent mechanisms that are developmentally regulated and tissue-specific have been described previously for other cell systems (21Burt A.M. J. Neurochem. 1977; 28: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 33Abreu-Villaca Y. Filgueiras C.C. Manhaes A.C. Behav. Brain Res. 2010; PubMed Google Scholar). Because both α4 and β2 transcriptions in these stably transfected cells are from heterologous promoters (16Xiao Y. Kellar K.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Xiao Y. Baydyuk M. Wang H.P. Davis H.E. Kellar K.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and choline-mediated up-regulations are sensitive to protein synthesis, post-translational mechanisms of up-regulation were examined (22Walsh H. Govind A.P. Mastro R. Hoda J.C. Bertrand D. Vallejo Y. Green W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6022-6032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To begin, the relative expression of α4 or β2 protein was examined using Western blot analysis of cells subjected to increasing choline concentrations. A"
https://openalex.org/W2027379719,"Previous studies have suggested that the left and right hands have different specialties for motor control that can be represented as two agents in the brain. This study examined how coordinated movements are performed during bimanual reaching tasks to highlight differences in the characteristics of the hands. We examined motor movement accuracy, reaction time, and movement time in right-handed subjects performing a three-dimensional motor control task (visually guided reaching). In the no-visual-feedback condition, right-hand movement had lower accuracy and a shorter reaction time than did left-hand movement, whereas bimanual movement had the longest reaction time, but the best accuracy. This suggests that the two hands have different internal models and specialties: closed-loop control for the right hand and open-loop control for the left hand. Consequently, during bimanual movements, both models might be used, creating better control and planning (or prediction), but requiring more computation time compared to the use of one hand only."
