https://openalex.org/W1909923582,"The control of protein-protein interactions is a fundamental aspect of cell regulation. Here we describe a new approach to detect the interaction of two proteins in vivo. By this method, one binding partner is an integral membrane protein whereas the other is soluble but fused to a G-protein gamma-subunit. If the binding partners interact, G-protein signaling is disrupted. We demonstrate interaction between known binding partners, syntaxin 1a with neuronal Sec1 (nSec1), and the fibroblast-derived growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) with SNT-1. In addition, we describe a genetic screen to identify nSec1 mutants that are expressed normally, but are no longer able to bind to syntaxin 1a. This provides a convenient method to study interactions of integral membrane proteins, a class of molecules that has been difficult to study by existing biochemical or genetic methods."

IL270 billion (US$135 million) is to be dedicated to genomics through a project called IPERGEN, which will fund 6 leading centers and 70 individual research groups focusing on bioinformatics, gene expression analysis, animal models, genotyping and proteomics. The government is also setting aside IL37.5 billion to create five new biotech start-up companies."

But despite rumors that he would move to an academic lab on the west coast of the US, Anderson has accepted an offer only 50 miles away: Anderson's team will take up residence at Imperial College School of Medicine, London, by the end of the year."
