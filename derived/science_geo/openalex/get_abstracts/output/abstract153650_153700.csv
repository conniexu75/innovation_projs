https://openalex.org/W2039949492,"The immune system recognizes invaders as foreign because they express determinants that are absent on host cells or because they lack ""markers of self"" that are normally present. Here we show that CD47 (integrin-associated protein) functions as a marker of self on murine red blood cells. Red blood cells that lacked CD47 were rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by splenic red pulp macrophages. CD47 on normal red blood cells prevented this elimination by binding to the inhibitory receptor signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha). Thus, macrophages may use a number of nonspecific activating receptors and rely on the presence or absence of CD47 to distinguish self from foreign. CD47-SIRPalpha may represent a potential pathway for the control of hemolytic anemia."

The dye-labeled and surface-immobilized ribozymes used were shown to be functionally indistinguishable from the unmodified free ribozyme in solution. A reversible local folding step in which a duplex docks and undocks from the ribozyme core was observed directly in single-molecule time trajectories, allowing the determination of the rate constants and characterization of the transition state. A rarely populated docked state, not measurable by ensemble methods, was observed. In the overall folding process, intermediate folding states and multiple folding pathways were observed. In addition to observing previously established folding pathways, a pathway with an observed folding rate constant of 1 per second was discovered. These results establish single-molecule fluorescence as a powerful tool for examining RNA folding."

Electromotive forces of ∼900 millivolts were generated from the cell in a flowing mixture of ethane or propane and air, where the solid electrolyte functioned as a purely ionic conductor. The electrode-reaction resistance was negligibly small in the total internal resistances of the cell. The resulting peak power density reached 403 and 101 milliwatts per square centimeter at 773 and 623 kelvin, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2063940323,"Recent advances in observational and theoretical studies of El Nino have shed light on controversies concerning the possible effect of global warming on this phenomenon over the past few decades and in the future. El Nino is now understood to be one phase of a natural mode of oscillation-La Nina is the complementary phase-that results from unstable interactions between the tropical Pacific Ocean and the atmosphere. Random disturbances maintain this neutrally stable mode, whose properties depend on the background (time-averaged) climate state. Apparent changes in the properties of El Nino could reflect the importance of random disturbances, but they could also be a consequence of decadal variations of the background state. The possibility that global warming is affecting those variations cannot be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2089892261,"After quantum particles have interacted, they generally remain in an entangled state and are correlated at a distance by quantum-mechanical links that can be used to transmit and process information in nonclassical ways. This implies programmable sequences of operations to generate and analyze the entanglement of complex systems. We have demonstrated such a procedure for two atoms and a single-photon cavity mode, engineering and analyzing a three-particle entangled state by a succession of controlled steps that address the particles individually. This entangling procedure can, in principle, operate on larger numbers of particles, opening new perspectives for fundamental tests of quantum theory."
https://openalex.org/W2001488804,"Drosophila offers many advantages as an experimental organism. However, in comparison with yeast and mouse, two other widely used eukaryotic model systems, Drosophila suffers from an inability to perform homologous recombination between introduced DNA and the corresponding chromosomal loci. The ability to specifically modify the genomes of yeast and mouse provides a quick and easy way to generate or rescue mutations in genes for which a DNA clone or sequence is available. A method is described that enables analogous manipulations of the Drosophila genome. This technique may also be applicable to other organisms for which gene-targeting procedures do not yet exist."
https://openalex.org/W2031096207,"We have identified the PDZ domain protein AF-6 as an intracellular binding partner of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), an integral membrane protein located at cell contacts. Binding of AF-6 to JAM required the presence of the intact C terminus of JAM, which represents a classical type II PDZ domain-binding motif. Although JAM did not interact with the single PDZ domains of ZO-1 or of CASK, we found that a ZO-1 fragment containing PDZ domains 2 and 3 bound to JAM in vitro in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. AF-6 as well as ZO-1 could be coprecipitated with JAM from endothelial cell extracts, demonstrating the association of the endogenously expressed molecules in vivo. Targeting of JAM to sites of cell contacts could be affected by the loss of the PDZ domain-binding C terminus. Full-length mouse JAM co-distributed with endogenous AF-6 in human Caco-2 cells at sites of cell contact independent of whether adjacent cells expressed mouse JAM as an extracellular binding partner. In contrast, truncated JAM lacking the PDZ domain-binding C terminus did not co-distribute with endogenous AF-6, but was restricted to cell contacts between cells expressing mouse JAM. Our results suggest that JAM can be recruited to intercellular junctions by its interaction with the PDZ domain-containing proteins AF-6 and possibly ZO-1.

Tight junctions, also called zonula occludens, form a regulated barrier between cells, restricting the diffusion of small solutes across cellular sheets as well as the diffusion of proteins from the lateral to the apical membrane domain (1Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 2Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions have evolved as signaling centers regulating tissue organization and morphogenesis (3Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 4Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Both types of junctions are necessary to establish and maintain cellular polarity. Three integral membrane proteins or families of proteins have been identified in tight junctions. Occludin (5Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar) and claudins (6Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) are four-transmembrane domain proteins that are involved in the formation of tight junction strands (8Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)1 is a newly described Ig superfamily member of adhesion molecules that co-localizes with tight junction molecules in both epithelial and endothelial cells (9Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). The organization of tight junctions requires the association of transmembrane proteins with cytoplasmic proteins. Recently, proteins containing PDZ (PSD-95, discs large,ZO-1) domains have emerged as organizers of protein complexes at the plasma membrane (2Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 10Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are 80–90 amino acids (aa) long and bind to 5-amino acid residue motifs at the carboxyl terminus of their ligands (11Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chisti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). They are often found in multiple copies within a single protein; and therefore, PDZ domain-containing proteins are considered as scaffolding proteins that promote the clustering of protein complexes at specific subcellular sites (12Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). In tight junctions, four proteins containing one or several PDZ domains have been identified. These include ZO-1 (13Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), ZO-2 (14Gumbiner B. Lowenkopf T. Apatira D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3460-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), ZO-3 (15Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and AF-6 (ALL-1 fusion partner from chromosome6) (16Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Occludin directly binds to ZO-1 and ZO-3 (15Haskins J. Gu L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 17Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the proper targeting of occludin to the tight junctions requires ZO-1 and not vice versa. For example, the absence of occludin does not change the localization of ZO-1 (18Wong V. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), whereas the absence of ZO-1 prevents targeting of transfected occludin to cell-cell contacts in fibroblasts (19Van Itallie C.M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1113-1121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, connexin-32/occludin chimeras containing only the ZO-1-binding domain of occludin are properly targeted to tight junctional fibrils in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (20Mitic L.L. Schneeberger E.E. Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 683-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). And finally, in occludin-deficient epithelial cells, ZO-1 is properly targeted to tight junctions (21Saitou M. Fujimoto K. Doi Y. Itoh M. Fujimoto T. Furuse M. Takano H. Noda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cytoplasmic proteins such as ZO-1 recruit occludin and act as an organizational scaffold for occludin and possibly other integral membrane proteins of tight junctions. This is substantiated by the recent findings showing that claudins directly associate with ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (22Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Another junctional PDZ domain-containing protein is AF-6/afadin (23Prasad R. Gu Y. Alder H. Nakamura T. Canaani O. Saito H. Huebner K. Gale R.P. Nowell P.C. Kuriyama K. Miyazaki Y. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5624-5628PubMed Google Scholar), which was described as associated with tight junctions (16Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) as well as with adherens junctions (24Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). AF-6 binds to cytoplasmic proteins as well as to integral membrane proteins. AF-6 binding to its cytoplasmic binding partners, the small GTPase Ras, the tight junction protein ZO-1, and the vinculin-binding protein ponsin/SH3P12, does not involve the PDZ domain of AF-6 (16Yamamoto T. Harada N. Kano K. Taya S. Canaani E. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 25Kuriyama M. Harada N. Kuroda S.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two known integral membrane components that bind to AF-6, a subset of the EphB receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (28Buchert M. Schneider S. Meskenaite V. Adams M.T. Canaani E. Baechi T. Moelling K. Hovens C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29Hock B. Bohme B. Karn T. Yamamoto T. Kaibuchi K. Holtrich U. Holland S. Pawson T.

Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), bind to AF-6 in a PDZ domain-dependent manner. The interaction with Ras implies that small GTPases like Ras might regulate the organization and/or integrity of tight junctions. The importance of AF-6 for the generation and/or maintenance of cell-cell junctions is demonstrated by the phenotype of AF-6-deficient mice. The absence of AF-6 results in embryonic lethality at embryonic day 9.5 most likely due to a disorganization of cell-cell junctions and to defects in the polarity of the embryonic ectoderm (31Zhadanov A.B.

Nakanishi H. Miyoshi J. Mandai K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka M. Togawa A. Takahashi K. Nishioka H. Yoshida H. Mizoguchi A. Nishikawa S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1117-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To identify proteins associating with JAM, we performed yeast two-hybrid experiments. We have identified AF-6 as a binding partner for JAM. JAM binds to the PDZ domain of AF-6 in vitro and associates with AF-6 in vivo. Microinjection of JAM expression vectors into cells expressing AF-6 in cell-cell junctions results in co-distribution of injected JAM with endogenous AF-6. JAM lacking the PDZ domain target motif does not co-distribute with AF-6 and localizes exclusively at cell borders of two JAM-injected cells. We also found that JAM binds to ZO-1 in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that JAM is recruited to and maintained at the junctional complex by its interaction with the PDZ domain proteins AF-6 and ZO-1. The murine endothelial cell line bEnd.3 is derived from mouse brain capillaries (33Williams R.L. Risau W. Zerwes H.G. Drexler H. Aguzzi A. Wagner E.F.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany). CHO cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. CMT cells were kindly provided by Dr. R. Kemler (Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Caco-2 cells, kindly provided by Dr. Alexander Schmidt (Institute of Infectiology, ZMBE, University of Muenster), were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). To generate polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against JAM and murine AF-6, amino-terminal peptides derived from JAM (VQGKGSVYTAQSD, JAMN13) or from AF-6 (MSAGGRDEERRK, AF-6N12) were coupled via cysteine at the N-terminal residue to ovalbumin and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. The antisera were affinity-purified with the synthetic peptides covalently coupled via bovine serum albumin to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg). Monoclonal antibodies directed against AF-6, β-catenin, and human ZO-1 (Pharmingen/Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and mouse ZO-1 (Chemicon International, Hofheim, Germany) were obtained from commercial sources. A polyclonal antibody against ZO-1 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Berlin). The monoclonal antibodies directed against murine and human JAM, BV11 (9Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) and BV16, were generously provided by Dr. Elisabetta Dejana (Istituto Mario Negri, Milan, Italy). mAb H2O2-106-7-4 (34Malergue F. Galland F. Martin F. Mansuelle P. Aurrand-Lions M. Naquet P. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) against murine JAM was kindly provided by Drs. Michel Aurrand-Lions (Centre Médical Universitaire, Geneva) and Philippe Naquet (INSERM-CNRS, Marseilles, France). Secondary antibodies and fluorophore-conjugated reagents were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Expression vectors were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of the respective fragments from total RNA derived from the mouse endothelial cell line bEnd.3 using standard techniques (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast expression vectors were constructed in pBTM116 (bait plasmids) and pGAD10 (prey plasmids), thereby generating fusion proteins between LexA and JAM or between the GAL4 activation domain and the prey protein, respectively. JAM bait vectors were generated by subcloning the cytoplasmic tail (aa 261–300) of murine JAM (pBTM116-JAM/cyt) or mutants of the cytoplasmic tail lacking the C-terminal amino acids Val (aa 261–299, JAM/cytΔ1), FLV (aa 261–297, JAM/cytΔ3), or FKQTSSFLV (aa 261–291, JAM/cytΔ9). Vectors expressing only the C-terminal amino acids of JAM fused to LexA were generated by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides comprising aa 290–300 (JAM/cyt11), aa 295–300 (JAM/cyt6), or aa 297–300 (JAM/cyt4) and cloning into pBTM116. GST fusion proteins were generated in pGEX-4T-1 or pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For JAM, GST fusion protein expression vectors were generated in the same way as described above for LexA fusion protein expression vectors. For expression in eukaryotic cells, cDNA fragments were cloned into pcDNA3.1/mycHis (Invitrogen BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) or pKE081myc. pKE081myc contains a N-terminal Myc tag including a Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation and allows for expression of cDNA fragments representing endogenous protein sequences. The vector was constructed by cloning two sets of complementary oligonucleotides representing the Myc tag (5′-CCCGCCATGGAGCAGAAGCTGATCAGCGAGGAGGACCTGA-3′) and a short multiple cloning site (5′-ACTCGAGCGGCCGCCACTGATATCTGCGAATTCCCAGCGTCGACTAAGTAG-3′) intoPmeI-digested pcDNA3.1/mycHisA (Invitrogen BV). The following constructs were generated in pKE081myc: Myc-AF-6/PDZ (aa 946–1101 of mouse AF-6/afadin), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ1–3 (aa 1–575 of mouse ZO-1), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ2–3 (aa 146–575 of mouse ZO-1), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ1 (aa 1–151), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ2 (aa 146–304), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ3 (aa 407–575), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ1–2 (aa 1–304), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ2+ (aa 146–422), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ+3 (aa 280–575), Myc-ZO-1/PDZ1–2+ (aa 1–413), and Myc-CASK/PDZ (aa 470–583). To express JAM in eukaryotic cells, full-length JAM (aa 1–300, referred to as JAM) or C-terminal truncated JAM (aa 1–293, referred to as JAM/Δ9) was cloned into pKE081myc. The murine homologs of l-afadin and s-afadin were cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with cDNA derived from bEnd.3 endothelial cells and primers derived from the rat cDNA sequences of l- and s-afadin (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numbers U83230 and U83231) (24Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The 5′-half of the cDNA common to l- and s-afadin was generated using the two primers AFA.13S (5′-GACATCATTCACCACTGGAAC-3′) and AFA.3AS (5′-TTGTCCAGGTACCTGGAGAAC-3′) and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Heidelberg). The sequence corresponding to the first 14 aa was generated separately by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 322–367 and subsequent cloning in front of the common 5′-region of afadin into pEGFP-C1, thereby generating the complete 5′-half of l- and s-afadin comprising nucleotides 322–3272. The 3′-domains were generated separately for l- and s-afadin using the primer pairs AFA.2S (5′-ACACGTTCTCCAGGTACCTG-3′) and lAFA.1AS (5′-CTTGGTGTTGAGTTCATTCTC-3′) for l-afadin or the primer pairs AFA.2S and sAFA.1AS (5′-GAGGACCATAACCTTTTCTTC-3′) for s-afadin. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vectors containing the common 5′-domain of l- and s-afadin, thereby generating the full-length murine homologs of rat l- and s-afadin, called mlAF-6 (1816 aa) and msAF-6(a) (1643 aa), respectively. One additional splicing variant was isolated that contained a 36-base pair deletion and instead a 22-base pair insertion at position 5132 of the s-afadin cDNA, thereby generating a shorter isoform of msAF-6/afadin (msAF-6(b)) containing 1604 aa (see Fig. 1 B). Expression vectors encoding mlAF-6 and msAF-6(a) were generated by subcloning the full-length cDNAs into pcDNA3.1/mycHis. Two-hybrid screening experiments were performed essentially as described (36Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Briefly, theSaccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain L40 expressing a fusion protein between LexA and the cytoplasmic tail of JAM (aa 261–300) was transformed with 250 μg of DNA derived from a day 9.5/10.5 mouse embryo cDNA library (37Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) according to the method of Schiestl and Gietz (38Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). The transformants were grown for 16 h in liquid selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and uracil to maintain selection for the bait and the library plasmid. The transformants were then plated onto synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, histidine, uracil, leucine, and lysine in the presence of 1 mm 3-aminotriazole. After 3 days at 30 °C, large colonies were transferred to new plates, grown for an additional 3 days on the same selective medium, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay. His+LacZ+ colonies were grown in liquid selective medium, and DNA was isolated by lysing the cells in yeast lysis solution (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of acid-washed glass beads and subsequent phenol/CHCl3 extraction and EtoH precipitation. To segregate the bait plasmid from the library plasmid, yeast DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli HB101, and the transformants were grown on M9 minimal medium lacking leucine. Plasmid DNA was then isolated from E. coli HB101 and reintroduced into L40 in combination with either the original LexA/JAM bait or various irrelevant bait plasmids to confirm the specificity of the interaction. GST-JAM fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bacteria were grown at 30 °C in LB medium and 2% glucose to A 600 = 0.5. Expression of recombinant proteins was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 10 μg/ml RNase A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 unit/ml α2-macroglobulin), and lysed by passaging through a French pressure cell. GST fusion proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4). Protein solutions were adjusted to 50% (w/v) glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For GST pull-down experiments, the prey proteins were generatedin vitro using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine as described by the manufacturer. 10 μl of the translation reactions were incubated with 3 μg of GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Beads were washed five times with buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by fluorography. GST pull-down experiments with whole cellular lysates were done as follows. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 unit/ml α2-macroglobulin for 12 min on ice. The lysates were collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and 10,000 ×g and then precleared by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were added to the GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing five times with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes by semidry transfer (Bio-Rad, München, Germany). The nitrocellulose filters were blocked in Blotto (Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, and 5% dry milk powder) and incubated with anti-AF-6 mAbs. Bound antibodies were visualized with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG and poly-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ) by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Confluent monolayers of bEnd.3 cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 unit/ml α2-macroglobulin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Alternatively, cells were incubated in lysis buffer containing 0.02% SDS or in lysis buffer containing 0.02% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate. Solubilized material was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The precleared lysates were then incubated with 2 μg of rat anti-mouse JAM mAb H2O2-106-7-4 (34Malergue F. Galland F. Martin F. Mansuelle P. Aurrand-Lions M. Naquet P. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) overnight, followed by 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Sepharose beads were washed five times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were solubilized by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. To detect coprecipitated proteins, the eluted material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis with mAbs directed against AF-6 and ZO-1. Bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rat IgG + IgM (Dianova), respectively, by ECL. For microinjection experiments, expression vectors were dissolved at 25 ng/μl in water, clarified by centrifugation (15 min, 14,000 rpm), and then microinjected into the nuclei of cultured cells using a semi-automated microinjector (Eppendorf, Hamburg) and a micromanipulator (micromanipulation system LN SM1, Luigs & Neumann, Ratingen, Germany). After injection, cells were cultured for 24–48 h in a CO2-buffered atmosphere and then analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. For immunofluorescence, injected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Hanks' balanced saline solution, washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution, and incubated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies against AF-6, JAM, β-catenin, or ZO-1. The samples were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution and incubated either with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin or with DTAF-, Cy5-, or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. After washing with Hanks' balanced saline solution, the samples were mounted onto slides, embedded with fluorescence mounting medium (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA), and visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM R) or analyzed by confocal microscopy (TCS confocal imaging system, Leica, Heidelberg). To induce a polarized morphology, cells were grown, in some cases, on polycarbonate Transwell filters (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany) for 4 days prior to fixation and analysis by confocal microscopy. To identify molecules interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of JAM, a LexA-based two-hybrid screen was performed with a size-selected murine embryonic cDNA library (36Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 37Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In two independent screens, two overlapping clones of 471 and 352 base pairs were isolated. Sequencing revealed an open reading frame with 95% identity to the amino acid sequence of human AF-6 and with 97% identity to that of rat AF-6 (afadin), respectively (Fig.1 A). Both clones encompassed the PDZ domain of AF-6, suggesting a PDZ domain-dependent interaction between JAM and AF-6. To further analyze this interaction, we cloned full-length mouse AF-6 from bEnd.3 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers based on the rat sequence. Three isoforms of murine AF-6 were cloned corresponding to the splicing variants of rat and human AF-6 (Fig. 1 B) (24Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M.

However, the physics of plate tectonics is poorly understood; other planets do not exhibit it. Recent seismic evidence for convection and mixing throughout the mantle seems at odds with the chemical composition of erupted magmas requiring the presence of several chemically distinct reservoirs within the mantle. There has been rapid progress on these two problems, with the emergence of the first self-consistent models of plate tectonics and mantle convection, along with new geochemical models that may be consistent with seismic and dynamical constraints on mantle structure."
https://openalex.org/W2073367697,"Because ribosome biogenesis plays an essential role in cell proliferation, control mechanisms may have evolved to recognize lesions in this critical anabolic process. To test this possibility, we conditionally deleted the gene encoding 40S ribosomal protein S6 in the liver of adult mice. Unexpectedly, livers from fasted animals deficient in S6 grew in response to nutrients even though biogenesis of 40S ribosomes was abolished. However, liver cells failed to proliferate or induce cyclin E expression after partial hepatectomy, despite formation of active cyclin D-CDK4 complexes. These results imply that abrogation of 40S ribosome biogenesis may induce a checkpoint control that prevents cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2067351147,"Oxidative stress broadly impacts cells, initiating regulatory pathways as well as apoptosis and necrosis. A key molecular event is protein S-glutathionylation, and thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) is a specific and efficient catalyst of protein-SSG reduction. In this study 30-min exposure of H9 and Jurkat cells to cadmium inhibited intracellular protein-SSG reduction, and this correlated with inhibition of the thioltransferase system, consistent with thioltransferase being the primary intracellular catalyst of deglutathionylation. The thioredoxin system contributed very little to total deglutathionylase activity. Thioltransferase and GSSG reductase in situ displayed similar dose-response curves (50% inhibition near 10 micrometer cadmium in extracellular buffer). Acute cadmium exposure also initiated apoptosis, with H9 cells being more sensitive than Jurkat. Moreover, transfection with antisense thioltransferase cDNA was incompatible with cell survival. Collectively, these data suggest that thioltransferase has a vital role in sulfhydryl homeostasis and cell survival. In separate experiments, cadmium inhibited the isolated component enzymes of the thioltransferase and thioredoxin systems, consistent with the vicinal dithiol nature of their active sites: thioltransferase (IC(50) approximately 1 micrometer), GSSG reductase (IC(50) approximately 1 micrometer), thioredoxin (IC(50) approximately 8 micrometer), thioredoxin reductase (IC(50) approximately 0.2 micrometer). Disruption of the vicinal dithiol on thioltransferase (via oxidation to C22-SS-C25; or C25S mutation) protected against cadmium, consistent with a dithiol chelation mechanism of inactivation."

These findings reveal that TE consists of at least two distinct areas, one of which processes a specific object property."
https://openalex.org/W2148142792,"ATF6 is a member of the basic-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. It contains a transmembrane domain and is located in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. ATF6 has been implicated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway since it can activate expression of GRP78 and other genes induced by the ER stress response. ER stress appears to activate ATF6 by cleavage from the ER membrane and translocation to the nucleus. However, direct DNA binding by ATF6 had not been demonstrated. In this report, we have identified a consensus DNA binding sequence for ATF6. This site is related to but distinct from ATF1/CREB binding sites. The site was placed in a reporter gene and was specifically activated by ATF6 overexpression and was strongly induced by the ER stress response. A dominant negative form of ATF6 blocked ER stress induction of both ATF6 site and GRP78 reporter genes. We further found that GAL4-ATF6 could be activated by ER stress. These results demonstrate that ATF6 is a direct target of the ER stress response. A proximal sensor of the ER stress response, human IRE1 (hIRE1), was sufficient to activate the ATF6 reporter gene, while a dominant negative form of hIRE1 blocked ER stress activation, suggesting that hIRE1 is upstream of ATF6 in the ER stress signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2016234945,"We describe a small molecule chemokine receptor antagonist, UCB35625 (the trans-isomer J113863 published by Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., patent WO98/04554), which is a potent, selective inhibitor of CCR1 and CCR3. Nanomolar concentrations of UCB35625 were sufficient to inhibit eosinophil shape change responses to MIP-1alpha, MCP-4, and eotaxin, while greater concentrations could inhibit the chemokine-induced internalization of both CCR1 and CCR3. UCB35625 also inhibited the CCR3-mediated entry of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 primary isolate 89.6 into the glial cell line, NP-2 (IC(50) = 57 nm). Chemotaxis of transfected cells expressing either CCR1 or CCR3 was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the compound (IC(50) values of CCR1-MIP-1alpha = 9.6 nm, CCR3-eotaxin = 93.7 nm). However, competitive ligand binding assays on the same transfectants revealed that considerably larger concentrations of UCB35625 were needed for effective ligand displacement than were needed for the inhibition of receptor function. Thus, it appears that the compound may interact with a region present in both receptors that inhibits the conformational change necessary to initiate intracellular signaling. By virtue of its potency at the two major eosinophil chemokine receptors, UCB35625 is a prototypic therapy for the treatment of eosinophil-mediated inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and as an inhibitor of CCR3-mediated human immunodeficiency virus-1 entry."

Not only signals from membrane surface receptors but also such oxidative stimuli occurring in cytoplasm may be transmitted through cellular signal transduction pathways to the nucleus for the control of cell division and survival.

However, because the role of each signal cascade has not been critically determined, those results are considered to include diverse cellular events in various phases of apoptosis or survival processes. In this study, U937 human lymphoid cells exposed to different concentrations of H2O2 in combination with inhibitors were examined for activation of stress-responsive protein kinase cascades so that survival mechanism-related responses could be distinguished from apoptosis-related ones. This report shows the presence of a low level oxidative stress that selectively induces the p38 MAPK cascade without accompanying apoptosis. More significantly, results indicate that p38 MAPK activation in response to the low level oxidative stress leads to abnormal M phase transition in the cell cycle. Oxidative stress may be a biological cause of the p38 MAPK-mediated spindle check point arrest that has been demonstrated by microinjection of active p38 MAPK or by nocodazole treatment in Xenopus embryos and mouse cells (14Takenaka K. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Science. 1998; 280: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Detection of p38 MAPK-activated nuclear factors ATF-2 and CREB (ATF-1) evidenced that the moderate oxidative stimulus was transmitted as a signal to nucleus. U937 cells were maintained with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in an atmosphere with 5% CO2. Before the H2O2 treatment, cells (5 × 105) were equilibrated with fresh medium (5 ml) consisting of RPMI 1640 and 2% serum for 2 h. After adding H2O2 to make 0.02 mm or 0.2 mm, cells were harvested at time intervals and washed in a buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA). For the experiment with NAC or SB203580, the compounds were added to the cultures 1 h before the cells were exposed to H2O2. SB203580 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mm and diluted with the medium to 10 μm. Nocodazole stock solution (5 mm) in dimethyl sulfoxide was applied to the culture at a concentration of 5 nm. Washed cells (106) were lysed in the sample buffer (100 μl) for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immediately boiled for 2 min. DNA was sheared by sonication. A 10-μl aliquot was loaded in each slot. Biotinylated protein standards (Bio-Rad) were used as size markers. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electrophoresis. Membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 at pH 7.4) and incubated with an antibody at a concentration of 100–200 ng/ml IgG in the blocking buffer. For detection of the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK, MKK3/6, CREB/ATF1, ATF2, JNK, c-Jun, or MKK4, an antiserum reactive with the phosphorylated form of each protein (phosphospecific antibody) was purchased from Bio-Rad. Analyses of the IκB-α, NF-κB p65, and p38 MAPK protein composition were performed with antisera from Santa Cruz (IκB-α (C−21), NF-κB (A), and p38 MAPK (H-147)). The membrane was washed in TBST with brief sonication. By using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the CDP-star chemiluminescent system (Bio-Rad), protein bands were visualized. Cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde (1.25% in phosphate-buffered saline) for 16 h at 4 °C, and then the glutaraldehyde was washed away with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell suspension was combined with Hoechst 33342 solution (6 mm) at 5:1 and observed under fluorescence microscopy. Cells fixed in 70% ethanol were stained with propidium iodide (PI) (50 μg/ml) after RNA digestion. PI-stained 10,000 cells were analyzed for DNA content with a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. U937 cell lysates prepared after 0-, 10-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min incubation with 0.02 or 0.2 mmH2O2 were examined for activation of p38 MAPK, JNK, and IκB kinase signal transduction pathways by Western blotting. p38 MAPK activation was analyzed with an antiserum reactive with the protein doubly phosphorylated on Thr-180 and Tyr-182 (12Raingeaud J.

As early as 10 min after exposure to 0.02 or 0.2 mmH2O2, p38 MAPK phosphorylation was substantially enhanced (Fig.1 a, i) without alteration of the p38 MAPK protein amount (Fig. 1 b). The phosphorylation was retained at least for 120 min. NAC, an anti-oxidant activated in a cytoplasmic redox enzyme system (8Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3387) Google Scholar), completely blocked it (Fig. 1 c), indicating that an intracellular oxidative stimulus was generated to induce p38 MAPK phosphorylation by incubation with 0.02 mm H2O2. However, JNK-1 and -2 phosphorylated on the Thr-183 and Tyr-185 residues (15Dèrijard B. Hibi M. Wu I-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar) were undetectable even after 2-h incubation with 0.02 mmH2O2 (Fig. 1 d). This was in contrast to 0.2 mm H2O2-treated cells in which phosphorylation of the 46-kDa JNK-1 and 54-kDa JNK-2 (16Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Dèrijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) was apparent after 10 min of incubation (Fig. 1 j). The band intensity of IκB-α was unaltered in the 0.02 mmH2O2-treated cells (Fig. 1 e), indicating the absence of protein degradation. NF-κB p65 was not detectable in their nuclear extracts for the 2-h period (Fig.1 f). However, in the 0.2 mmH2O2-treated whole cell lysates, IκB-α protein diminished (Fig. 1 k) with the concomitant appearance of NF-κB p65 in the nuclear fractions (Fig. 1 l), indicating occurrence of NF-κB nuclear translocation through IκB degradation (17Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Thus, cells responded to the stress of 0.02 mmH2O2 by activation of p38 MAPK, without affecting either JNK or NF-κB cascade. In contrast, all of the three stress-responsive protein kinase cascades were activated by the 0.2 mm H2O2 treatment. Thr-223 phosphorylation of MKK4 (also termed SEK1), for which both p38 MAPK and JNK serve as the substrate (18Dèrijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davies R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), was not evident with 0.02 mm H2O2 (Fig. 1 g) but with 0.2 mm H2O2 (Fig.1 m). In contrast, immunoblot with an antiserum reactive with the activated forms of MKK3 (with phosphorylation on Ser-189 and Thr-193) and MKK6 (on Ser-207 and Thr-211) showed a positive sign of the 35–37-kDa band after the 0.02 mmH2O2 treatment (Fig. 1 h). At least one of the two p38 MAPK-specific activators, MKK3 (18Dèrijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davies R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar) and MKK6 (19Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Gotoh Y. Iwamatsu A. Irie K. Mori E. Kuroyanagi N. Hagiwara M. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26981-26988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), seemed to be functional under these conditions. More enhanced MKK3/6 phosphorylation was observed with 0.2 mm H2O2 (Fig. 1 n). Either MKK3 or MKK6, or both, may mediate the selective activation of p38 MAPK even when the oxidative stress is not strong enough to activate MKK4. After 10-min incubation with 0.02 mmH2O2, phosphorylation of CREB and ATF-1 on Ser-133 increased approximately 2-fold, and it decreased to the control level in 60 min (Fig. 2 a). The enhancement did not occur in the presence of NAC (Fig. 2 b). The effect of low level oxidative stress on these factors was found less predominant. In contrast, the level of ATF-2 Thr-71 phosphorylation was substantially raised after 10 min and was retained without a decline at least for 120 min (Fig. 2 c). This induction was blocked either by NAC (Fig. 2 d) or by 10 μm p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 (Fig.2 e), indicating that the oxidative signal was immediately relayed to nuclear factor ATF-2 by p38 MAPK activation. On the other hand, Ser-73 phosphorylation of c-Jun was undetectable at any time point in 0.02 mm H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 2 f) in agreement with the absence of JNK phosphorylation under the same conditions (cf. Fig.1 d). In 0.2 mmH2O2-treated cells, however, c-Jun phosphorylation appeared at 10 min (Fig. 2 g) and reached a maximum at 60 min, corresponding to the JNK activation time course observed in Fig. 1 j. Analyses of the phosphorylation status of CREB (ATF-1), ATF-2, and c-Jun confirmed that the oxidative stimulus caused by 0.02 mm H2O2 was transmitted to the nucleus by the selective activation of p38 MAPK. The moderate, temporary phosphorylation of CREB (ATF-1) may reflect the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2, a cytoplasmic substrate of p38 MAPK (20Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The strong induction and retention of ATF-2 phosphorylation implicate that the p38 MAPK cascade functions in activation of ATF-2-regulated gene expression under the low level oxidative stress. The p38 MAPK activation continued for 24 h in 0.02 mm H2O2-treated cells (Fig. 3 a). DNA staining with Hoechst 33342 dye of the cells fixed at 24 h revealed the presence of deformed, polyploid nuclei in 38.5 ± 7.8% (n = 200) cells. Flow cytometric analysis with PI staining showed an increased cell count in the fractions of >4n DNA content (M5 plus M6, 10.9%) in comparison with the control culture (Fig. 3 f), which had a 2.3% population in the M5/M6 fractions. The ratio of cells with ≥4 n DNA to cells with 2 n DNA increased more than 2-fold (0.87) comparing with that in the control culture (0.39). Thus, U937 cells treated with 0.02 mm H2O2 underwent an abnormal cell cycle progression in which S phase entry occurred without completion of the M phase events, the phenomenon referred to as “S/M uncoupling” (21Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). When cultured with 5 ng/ml nocodazole, a compound that blocks tubulin assembly, the level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation gradually rose (Fig.3 b) as reported (14Takenaka K. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Science. 1998; 280: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Hoechst 33342 staining revealed an abundance of enlarged nuclei in the nocodazole-treated culture at 24 h. On the basis of the flow cytometric analysis, 10.5% cells had >4 n DNA, and the ≥4 n/2 nratio was 0.85. In this cell line, the inhibitor did not induce typical M phase arrest but caused S/M uncoupling. Neither JNK phosphorylation (data not shown) nor apoptosis induction was obvious with nocodazole at the concentration above. As demonstrated by an enzymological analysis (22Frantz B. Klatt T. Pang M. Parsons J. Rolando A. Williams H. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neil E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13846-13853Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), SB203580 blocked not only ATF-2 phosphorylation (cf. Fig. 2 e) but also the p38 MAPK phosphorylation itself under the stress of 0.02 mm H2O2 (Fig. 3 c). The p38 kinase inhibition continued for 24 h and abolished polyploid cell formation as found by flow cytometry. Moreover, nuclear fragmentation was observed in 8.73% of cells after the 24-h culture with the inhibitor and 0.02 mmH2O2. The blockage of p38 MAPK cascade might have interfered with an anti-oxidative cellular defense mechanism, which led to the onset of apoptosis in the small fraction of the culture. NAC completely canceled both p38 MAPK cascade activation and polyploid cell formation (Fig. 3 d) without inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, in the experiment where 0.02 mmH2O2 was washed away from the culture after the first 2-h incubation period, the level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation fell to the basal level by 3 h from the H2O2removal. Those cells, examined at the end of the total incubation period of 24 h, were indistinguishable from the control cells either by flow cytometry or Hoechst staining (Fig. 3, e and f). Thus, the kinase activation was found to be a reversible response, and its prolonged activation was required for polyploid cell formation. Under the high level oxidative stress conditions caused by 0.2 mm H2O2, occurrence of nuclear fragmentation was detectable as early as at 5 h. Approximately 95% of cells displayed features of apoptosis including nuclear fragmentation and membrane blebbing (Fig. 3 g). Although other various signal pathways have been left unexamined, it is evident that p38 MAPK is activated selectively among the stress-responsive signal cascades under the low level oxidative stress conditions with 0.02 mm H2O2. Furthermore, the result with p38-specific inhibitor SB203850 suggests that p38 MAPK bears an important function for cell survival. Oxidative stresses at different levels seem to join different streams of the cellular signal transduction system reaching to specific nuclear factors (23Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), although the mechanism remains to be determined. MKK3/6 may at least in part contribute to the selective p38 activation under the low level oxidative stress. MKK4 (SEK1)-JNK activation coincides with IκB degradation in response to 0.2 mmH2O2, suggesting that mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (24Lee F.S. Perters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 25Yan M. Dal T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) is possibly involved in transmission of the high level, apoptosis-inducible oxidative stimulus to the IκB kinase and JNK pathways. Given that the normal function of mitochondria inevitably produces ROS, the results in this study permit a speculation that p38 MAPK serves as a signal transducer of the cytoplasmic low level ROS for balancing the redox status. Activated ATF-2 and CREB may enhance transcription of genes harboring their binding sites in the promoter region, such as the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (26Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L588-L602PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides a biological interpretation for the mechanistically demonstrated M phase arrest dependent on p38 MAPK activation in Xenopus embryos and NIH3T3 cells (14Takenaka K. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Science. 1998; 280: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). When a low level oxidative stress occurs in cytoplasm, it could induce the cellular reactions. Unlike those cells, however, U937 cells lack functional p53 (27Dou Q.P. An B. Will P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9019-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which controls the spindle assembly checkpoint (28Shawn M.C. Sanchez C.A. Morgan C.A. Schimke M.K. Ramel S. Idzerda R.L. Raskind W.H. Reid B.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) as well as the G1/S transition. It may explain why S/M uncoupling rather than M phase cell cycle arrest was observed in U937 cells. The p38 kinase activation was found reversible, suggesting that it could function as a sensitive, flexible mediator of oxidative signals. Cells possibly gain time by cell cycle retardation to escape from the oxidative conditions before the stress grows to cause a serious damage in chromosome or cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W2049725266,"We describe a distinct type of spontaneous hierarchical self-assembly of cytoskeletal filamentous actin (F-actin), a highly charged polyelectrolyte, and cationic lipid membranes. On the mesoscopic length scale, confocal microscopy reveals ribbonlike tubule structures that connect to form a network of tubules on the macroscopic scale (more than 100 micrometers). Within the tubules, on the 0.5- to 50-nanometer length scale, x-ray diffraction reveals an unusual structure consisting of osmotically swollen stacks of composite membranes with no direct analog in simple amphiphilic systems. The composite membrane is composed of three layers, a lipid bilayer sandwiched between two layers of actin, and is reminiscent of multilayered bacterial cell walls that exist far from equilibrium. Electron microscopy reveals that the actin layer consists of laterally locked F-actin filaments forming an anisotropic two-dimensional tethered crystal that appears to be the origin of the tubule formation."

The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β),1 is one molecule that may play a pivotal role in integrating neuronal immune responses with those of the endocrine system because it exerts significant effects in all systems, for example in response to stressors such as infection. Gram-negative bacterial infections are associated with multiple pathophysiological changes; it is widely accepted that these changes are stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of most Gram-negative bacteria. These changes, which include fever, changes in sleep pattern, and anorexia (1Linthorst A.C.E. Reul J.M.H.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 840: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), are mimicked by, and therefore thought to be mediated through production of, IL-1β. Thus LPS, injected centrally or peripherally, increases IL-1β concentrations (2Quan N. Sundar S.K. Weiss J.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 49: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 3Van Dam A.M. Poole S. Schultzberg M. Zavala F. Tilders F.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Bull. 1998; 45: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in rat brain. Although it appears that in certain circumstances IL-1β may be neuroprotective, the consensus is that prolonged exposure, or exposure of tissue to high concentrations of IL-1β, results in degenerative changes (5Rothwell N.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 514: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore it is significant that increased IL-1 concentrations in different brain areas have been correlated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Down syndrome, Alzheimer's disease (6Griffin W.S.T. Stanley L.C. Ling C. White L. MacLeod V. Perrot L.J. White III, C.L. Araoz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 1999; 18: 4914-4928Crossref Google Scholar). It might be predicted therefore that any trigger such as LPS, which induces an increase in IL-1β, will do so by increasing activity of caspase-1. Our objective was to investigate the cellular consequences of an increase in IL-1β concentration in hippocampus in an effort to establish the mechanism by which IL-1β inhibits LTP in dentate gyrus. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS stimulated caspase-1 activity and induced an increase in IL-1β concentration, and these changes were paralleled by an increase in activity of the stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), a decrease in glutamate release, and inhibition of LTP in perforant path granule cell synapses. These changes, and the degenerative changes in neurones of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, were reversed by caspase-1 inhibition. Six groups of six male Wistar rats (250–350 g), obtained from the BioResources Unit, Trinity College Dublin, were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of urethane (1.5 g/kg). All rats groups received 1 ml of saline or 1 ml of LPS (200 μg/kg) intraperitoneally; four groups were pretreated either with an intracerebroventricular injection of 5 μl of saline or 5 μl of the caspase-1 inhibitor (10 pmol of Ac-YVAD-CMK, 2.5 mm posterior to Bregma, 0.2 mm lateral to midline, 3.5-mm depth) prior to the intraperitoneal injection and monitored for 3 h. A bipolar stimulating electrode and a unipolar recording electrode were placed in the perforant path (4.4 mm lateral to Lambda) and in the dorsal cell body region of the dentate gyrus (2.5 mm lateral and 3.9 mm posterior to Bregma), respectively, and 0.033-Hz test shocks were given for 10 min before, and 40 min after, tetanic stimulation (three trains of stimuli delivered at 30-s intervals, 250 Hz for 200 ms (26McGahon B. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). Rats were killed by cervical dislocation; cross-chopped slices (350 × 350 μm) were prepared from ipsilateral and contralateral dentate gyri, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus and used to prepare dissociated cells (see below) or frozen separately in Krebs solution containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (27Haan E.A. Bowen D.M. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. For analysis, slices were thawed rapidly and rinsed in fresh oxygenated Krebs solution before preparation of homogenate or the crude synaptosomal pellet P2 (26McGahon B. Lynch M.A. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Formation of reactive oxygen species was assessed by measuring 2′7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), the oxidized, fluorescent product of 2′7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA (28Lebel C.P. Bondy S.C. Neurochem. Int. 1990; 17: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)). Synaptosomes prepared from hippocampal slices were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 10 μl of 5 μm DCFH-DA (from a stock of 500 μm) in methanol and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 8 min at 4 °C to yield pellets that were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold 40 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and monitored for fluorescence at 37 °C (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 525 nm). Cleavage of the caspase-1 substrate (YVAD peptide, Alexis Corporation) to its fluorescent product was used as a measure of caspase-1 activity. Slices of tissue were washed, homogenized in 400 μl of lysis buffer (25 mmHEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4), subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. 90-μl samples of supernatant were added to 10 μl of 500 μm YVAD peptide and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. 900 μl of incubation buffer (100 mm HEPES containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) was added, and fluorescence was assessed (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 505 nm). IL-1β concentration in homogenate prepared from hippocampus of entorhinal cortex was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (14; Genzyme Diagnostics). Antibody-coated (2.0 μg/ml final concentration, diluted in 0.1m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5; monoclonal hamster anti-mouse IL-1β antibody) 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20, blocked for 2 h at 37 °C with 250 μl of blocking buffer (0.1 m PBS, pH 7.3, with 4% bovine serum albumin), and incubated with 50-μl IL-1β standards (0–1,000 pg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were incubated with 100 μl of secondary antibody (final concentration 0.8 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin; biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IL-1β antibody) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and incubated in 100 μl of detection agent (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin; 1:1,000 dilution in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 37 °C. 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) was added, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and absorbance read at 450 nm within 30 min. JNK phosphorylation was analyzed in samples prepared from hippocampal tissue; cytochromec translocation and PARP cleavage were analyzed in samples prepared from entorhinal cortex. In the case of JNK and PARP, tissue homogenates were diluted to equalize for protein concentration (29Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), and 10-μl aliquots (1 mg/ml) were added to 10 μl of sample buffer (0.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, w/v), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto gels (10% SDS for PARP and 12% for JNK). In the case of cytochrome c, the cytosolic fraction was prepared by homogenizing slices of entorhinal cortex in lysis buffer (composition in mm: 20 HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 1 EDTA, 1 dithiothreitol, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotonin), incubating for 20 min on ice, and centrifuging (15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant (i.e.cytosolic fraction) was suspended in sample buffer (150 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol v/v, 4% SDS w/v, 5% β-mercaptoethanol v/v, 0.002% bromphenol blue w/v) to a final concentration of 300 μg/ml, boiled for 3 min, and loaded (6 μg/lane) onto 12% gels. In all cases proteins were separated by application of a 30-mA constant current for 25–30 min, transferred onto nitrocellulose strips (225 mA for 75 min), and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. To assess JNK activity, proteins were immunoblotted with an antibody that specifically targets phosphorylated JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 1:2,000 in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 2% non-fat dried milk) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To assess cleavage of PARP, we immunoblotted with an antibody (1:2,000) raised against the epitope corresponding to amino acids 764–1014 of PARP of human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence. To assess cytochrome c, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1–104 of cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was used. Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence. Synaptosomal tissue prepared from untetanized and tetanized dentate gyrus was resuspended in ice-cold Krebs solution containing 2 mm CaCl2, aliquotted onto 0.45-μm Millipore filters, and rinsed under vacuum. Tissue was incubated in 250 μl of oxygenated Krebs solution ± 40 mm KCl at 37 °C for 3 min, and the filtrate was collected and stored. To analyze glutamate concentration, triplicate 50-μl samples or 50-μl glutamate standards (50 nm to 10 μm in 100 mm Na2HPO4buffer, pH 8.0) were added to 320-μl glutaraldehyde (0.5% in 100 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 4.5)-coated 96-well plates and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C (30Ordronneau P. Abdullah L. Petruse P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 142: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 250 μl of ethanolamine (0.1 m in 100 mmNa2HPO4 buffer) and 200 μl of donkey serum (3% in PBS-T) were used to bind unreacted aldehydes and to block nonspecific binding, respectively. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 100 μl of anti-glutamate antibody (raised in rabbit, 1:5,000 in PBS-T, Sigma), washed with PBS-T, and then incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 100 μl of anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:10,000 in PBS-T, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 100 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate was added, incubation continued for exactly 60 min, 30 μl of 4 m H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction, and optical densities were determined at 450 nm. 350-μm slices prepared from entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were equilibrated in oxygenated Krebs solution for 30 min at 30 °C and then incubated in Krebs solution containing 1 mg/ml protease X, 1 mg/ml protease XIV, and 1,600 Kunitz Dnase for 30 min at 30 °C. Washed slices were resuspended in 1 ml of prewarmed Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 1,600 Kunitz Dnase, triturated with a glass Pasteur pipette, and passed through a nylon mesh filter to remove tissue clumps. 30-μl aliquots were plated out on poly-l-lysine-coated 11-mm round glass coverslips, placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1 h, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (30 min at room temperature). Coverslips were stored at 4 °C in PBS until use (31Mody I. Slater M.W. MacDonald J.F. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 96: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were stained using the Rapi-diff II staining procedure (DiaCheM International Ltd., Lancastershire, U. K,) and viewed under × 100 magnification. Cells displaying degenerative features (e.g. shrinkage and membrane blebbing) were counted and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells examined (80–100/coverslip in the case of entorhinal cortex and 100–200 in the case of the hippocampus). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between conditions. When this analysis indicated significance (at the 0.05 level), post hoc Student Newmann-Keuls test analysis was used to determine which conditions were significantly different from each other. Student's t test was used to establish statistical significance in some cases; for example, when analysis was performed on tissue prepared from untetanized and tetanized tissue obtained from the same rat. Tetanic stimulation delivered to the perforant path 3 h after intraperitoneal injection of LPS resulted in an increase in the mean slope of the population epsp; the mean percentage increase in the 2 min immediately following tetanic stimulation (± S.E., compared with the 5 min immediately before tetanic stimulation) was 133.58 (± 3.48), but this was not maintained so that the mean percentage increase in population epsp slope in the last 5 min of the experiment was 100.81 ± 2.26. The corresponding values in the saline-treated control rats were 164.83 ± 4.23 and 119.1 ± 2.17, respectively (Fig.1; n = 6 in both groups). The stimulus strength required to induce a spike was 7.87V (± 0.98) in LPS-treated rats compared with 4.02V ± 1.2 in saline-injected rats. The LPS-induced attenuated LTP was associated with a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production, caspase-1 activity, IL-1β concentration, and JNK activity (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, Student's t test for independent means, Fig. 2, a–d;n = 6 in all cases) in hippocampus. The stimulatory effect of LPS on JNK activity was mimicked by the addition of IL-1β to hippocampal tissue in vitro (p < 0.01, Student's t test for paired means, Fig. 2 e). Fig. 2 f indicates that endogenous glutamate release was increased significantly by the addition of 40 mm KCl to synaptosomes prepared from untetanized dentate gyrus of saline-pretreated rats (*p < 0.05, Student'st test for paired means), but this effect was enhanced in synaptosomes prepared from tetanized dentate gyrus (**p< 0.01, Student's t test for paired means). In contrast, KCl failed to stimulate glutamate release in synaptosomes prepared from untetanized dentate gyrus of LPS-pretreated rats, although release was increase in tetanized tissue (*p < 0.05, Student'st test for paired means) albeit to an attenuated degree. These data suggested that the LPS-induced effect on LTP may be a consequence of its ability to increase activity of caspase-1 and thence IL-1β concentration and to determine whether this was the case, rats were injected intracerebroventricularly with 5 μl of a caspase-1 inhibitor peptide (Ac-YVAD-CMK) or with 5 μl of saline prior to LPS or saline treatment. Fig. 3 a indicates that although LTP was inhibited by LPS, this effect was blocked by the caspase-1 inhibitor. Thus the mean percentage change in population epsp slope (± S.E.) in the 2 min immediately after tetanic stimulation was 177.77 ± 15.34 in the control group (treated with saline intracerebroventricularly and intraperitoneally) compared with 118.92 ± 3.35 in the group treated with saline intracerebroventricularly and LPS intraperitoneally. In the last 5 min of the experiment the values were 123.86 ± 2.14 and 96.21 ± 1.14, respectively. Injection of the caspase-1 inhibitor partially reversed the inhibitory effect of LPS on the early changes induced by the tetani and completely blocked the LPS-induced inhibition of the later phase of LTP; the mean percentage changes were 147.32 ± 9.23 and 123.54 ± 6.33 in the first 2 min after tetanic stimulation and in the last 5 min of the experiment, respectively. However, LTP was similar in the control rats and the group of rats injected the caspase-1 inhibitor intracerebroventricularly and saline intraperitoneally; in the latter group, the mean percentage changes in population epsp slope were 174.57 ± 16.24 and 142.07 ± 7.42 in the 2 min after tetanic stimulation and the last 5 min of the experiment, respectively (Fig. 3 a, n = 6 in all groups). Fig. 3 b shows that intraperitoneal injection of LPS (in rats treated with saline intracerebroventricularly) significantly increased IL-1β concentration in hippocampus (* p < 0.05, Student's t test for independent means, n = 6) and that this effect was inhibited by pretreatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor. Similarly, JNK activity was enhanced significantly in hippocampal tissue prepared from LPS-treated rats (p< 0.05, Student's t test for independent means), but this effect was also inhibited by the caspase-1 inhibitor (Fig.3 c). Acutely dissociated cells were prepared from hippocampal tissue obtained from rats in each of the four treatment groups. LPS treatment significantly increased the number of degenerating cells, with evidence of an increased number of cells displaying degenerative features such as shrinkage and blebbing of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 b). This contrasts with cells prepared from saline-treated rats (panel a) and rats treated only with caspase-1 inhibitor (panel c). Treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor (panel d) partially reversed the effects of LPS with fewer cells displaying degenerative changes. Fig. 4 e shows that the percentage of cells which showed degenerative changes was enhanced significantly in the LPS-treated group compared with any of the other groups (p < 0.05, Student's t test for independent means) and indicates that the caspase-1 inhibitor reversed the degenerative effect of LPS. In an effort to account for the compromise in transmitter release observed in dentate gyrus synaptosomes prepared from LPS-treated rats, we analyzed caspase-1 activity and IL-1β concentrations in tissue prepared from entorhinal cortex and found that both measures were increased significantly after LPS treatment (*p < 0.05, Student's t test for independent means), but these effects were both attenuated by the caspase-1 inhibitor (Fig.5, a and b,n = 6). In parallel with the observations in hippocampus, we observed that there was an LPS-induced increase in the number of degenerating cells changes (** p < 0.01, Student's t test for independent means, Fig.6 a), with evidence of cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing. Pretreatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor blocked these LPS-associated changes (Fig. 6, aand b). Consistent with the evidence of cell degeneration in hippocampus, we observed that cytochrome c translocation was increased markedly in tissue prepared from entorhinal cortex of LPS-treated rats (p < 0.01, Student's ttest for independent means), whereas there was a decrease in expression of the 116-kDa fragment of (PARP, * p < 0.05, Student's t test for independent means); both of these LPS-associated changes were attenuated by pretreatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor (Fig. 6, c and d;n = 6).Figure 6The LPS-induced changes in cytochromec, PARP cleavage, and degenerative changes in entorhinal cortex are blocked by the caspase-1 inhibitor. LPS treatment (see panel b, ii) increased the percentage of degenerating cells, exhibiting evidence of degeneration such as shrinkage and blebbing of the plasma membrane (seearrows) compared with saline-treated rats (panel b, i) or rats treated only with caspase-1 inhibitor (panel b, iii); these effects were blocked in rats pretreated with the caspase-1 inhibitor (panel b,iv). The mean data were obtained by counting 80–100 cells on each coverslip (*p < 0.05, Student's ttest for independent means, n = 6). Expression of the 116-kDa subunit of PARP (panel c) was decreased significantly and cytochrome c translocation (panel d) was increased significantly in tissue prepared from entorhinal cortex of LPS-treated rats (*p < 0.05, Student'st test for independent means, n = 6). These effects were blocked in rats pretreated with the caspase-1 inhibitor. Sample immunoblots demonstrate these effects of LPS (lanes 2and 4) compared with control (lanes 1 and3) in saline-pretreated (lanes 1 and2) and Ac-YVAD-CMK-pretreated (lanes 3 and4) rats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We set out to investigate the effect of an intraperitoneal injection of LPS on synaptic function in hippocampus because LPS is considered to contribute significantly to the neuropathological effects associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections probably by increasing IL-1β concentration in brain. The evidence presented indicates that the LPS-induced increase in IL-1β concentration, consequent on increased caspase-1 activity, leads to activation of JNK which may underlie the observed decrease in transmitter release in dentate gyrus, degenerative changes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and inhibition of LTP. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS inhibited LTP in perforant path granule cell synapses; to our knowledge this effect of LPS has not been shown previously. The current data present at least two possible mechanisms that might underlie the effects. First, we observed that LPS induced an increase in reactive oxygen species production in hippocampus, and the attenuated LTP may arise, directly or indirectly, from this. Such an effect of oxygen radicals has been reported in CA1in vitro (32Pellmar T.C. Hollinden G.E. Sarvey J.M. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and we have recently observed that LTP in dentate gyrus in vivo was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide. 2A. Lynch, P. M., Queenan, and M. A. Lynch, unpublished observation. A second possibility is that the impairment in LTP is a consequence of the LPS-induced increase in IL-1β concentration in hippocampus. We have observed that intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1β inhibits LTP in perforant path-granule cell synapses in vivo (14Murray C. Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2974-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Murray C. Lynch M.A. J. Biol.

Lynch M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2974-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of IL-1β on LTP in vitro has also been documented; thus IL-1β-induced attenuation of LTP in CA1 (11Bellinger F.P. Madamba S. Siggins G.R.

Details of how this occurs are now emerging from numerical simulations that achieve a self-sustaining magnetic field. Early results predict a dominant dipole field outside the core, and some models even reproduce magnetic reversals. The simulations also show how different patterns of flow can produce similar external fields. Efforts to distinguish between the various possibilities appeal to observations of the time-dependent behavior of the field. Important constraints will come from geological records of the magnetic field in the past."

Sequestration of La antigen by the RNA SELEX in HeLa translation lysates blocked the HCV and poliovirus IRES-mediated translation in vitro. The functional requirement of La protein for the HCV IRES activity was further established in a liver-derived cell line and in an add-back experiment in which the inhibited IRES was rescued by recombinant human La.

In this scheme, the translation is initiated through binding of initiation factor-4F (eIF-4F) to the cap structure via its eIF-4E subunit. This event is followed by joining of 43 S ribosomal complex that consists of 40 S subunit, eIF-3, Met-tRNAi and GTP-bound eIF-2. In contrast, a few cellular and viral mRNAs are translated by a distinct mechanism (4Gan W. Celle M.L. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol.

Almost the entire 5′-NCR (341 nt) of the HCV RNA except 40 nt at the extreme 5′ end has been shown to function as an IRES element (14Rijnbrand R. Brenbeek P. van der Straaten T. Whetter L.

The HCV IRES also extends to a short stretch (nt 12–30) downstream of the initiator AUG codon (18Lu H.-H. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6010-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A pseudoknot structure (Fig. 1) preceding the translation start-site is another unique feature of the HCV IRES that is highly conserved among HCV genotypes and pestiviruses (17Wang C. Siddiqui A. Sarnow P. Cap-independent Translation. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1995: 99-115Google Scholar, 20Wang C. Le S.-Y. Ali N. Siddiqui A. RNA. 1995; 1: 526-537PubMed Google Scholar). The HCV IRES, like other viral and cellular IRES elements, serves as a substrate for binding of multiple cellular factors. Among cellular proteins that participate during cap-independent translation initiation, two non-canonical translation initiation factors, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and La antigen (p52 or SS-B) are recognized for their ability to bind several viral 5′-NCRs (see Refs. 2Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar and 6Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar for reviews).

The human La antigen contains three putative RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a basic region followed by a stretch of acidic region at the C terminus (26Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The C terminus also contains a homodimerization domain that is required for the function of La in enhancing translation of poliovirus RNA (27Craig A.W.B. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although a fraction of La antigen is found in the cytoplasm, majority of the protein is localized in the nucleus. However, cellular stress such as that resulting from a viral infection causes redistribution of the nuclear La to the cytoplasm (28Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K.L. Agol V.I. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the nucleus, La antigen transiently associates with the 3′ oligo(U) terminus of the RNA polymerase III transcripts and facilitates transcription termination and recycling of transcription complexes for reinitiation process (29Maraia R.J. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2147-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-366 residue of La antigen by casein kinase II modulates its role in transcription but does not affect its RNA binding ability (30Fan H. Sakulich A.L. Goodier J.L. Zhang X. Qin J. Maraia R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 707-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, La antigen is associated with a subset of small ribosomal subunit, possibly by direct association with 18 S rRNA (31Peek G. Pruijn G.J.M. Venrooij W.J.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). La protein has been shown to interact with the 5′-NCR or 5′ stem-loop structures of poliovirus (28Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V.

Virol. 1984; 50: 773-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the most part, these La interactions with viral RNA elements do not appear to be mediated by the 3′ terminal oligouridylate sequences that are characteristics of La protein's prototypical interactions with pre-processed polIII transcripts. RNA selection experiments with La protein have revealed a novel CACAA motif that may account for some non-protypical RNA interactions (38Kenan D.J. RNA Recognition by the Human La Protein and Its Role in Transcription, Translation, and Viral Infectivity. Ph.D. thesis. Duke University, Raleigh, NC1995Google Scholar). 2D. J. Kenan and J. D.

RNA Recognition by the Human La Protein and Its Role in Transcription, Translation, and Viral Infectivity. Ph.D. thesis. Duke University, Raleigh, NC1995Google Scholar). The C5 RNA contains both 3′ oligouridylates as well as the CACAA motif. The presence of a double binding motif likely accounts for the increased affinity of C5 RNA relative to other polIII transcripts. Many of the viral RNAs that interact with La protein also contain close or exact matches to the CACAA motif within their 5′-NCR sequences, suggesting that this element may play a role in translational regulation by La protein. The aberrant translation initiation of poliovirus IRES-mediated RNA is corrected in the presence of La antigen that is also accompanied by a modest stimulation of translation (28Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K.L. Agol V.I. Keene J.D. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Svitkin Y.V. Meerovitch K. Lee H.S. Dholakia J.N. Kenan D.J. Agol V.I. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). La binding to the human immunodeficiency virus TAR structure alleviates the translational repression exerted by TAR on the downstream reporter gene (41Svitkin Y.V. Pause A. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7001-7008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that La antigen interacts with the HCV IRES, which leads to significant level of stimulation of the HCV IRES-dependent translation (42Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). One of the interesting and novel aspects of this interaction is that it occurred in the context of the initiator AUG. Here, we have further characterized cis- and trans-elements involved in the La-5′-NCR interactions. The functional importance of these interactions during trans-activation of the HCV IRES is investigated using mutants derived from the HCV 5′-NCR as well as those in the La protein. An RNA systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) ligand that specifically interacts with La protein inhibited the HCV IRES-mediated translation in a liver derived cell line and HeLa lysates supporting the in vivo functional relevance of that interaction. The data presented here further reinforces our previous observations that initiator AUG codon of the HCV RNA is an essential recognition motif of La binding. This interaction appears to be responsible for the La-dependent translation initiation of the HCV RNA. The construction of recombinant plasmids were carried out by standard protocols. The plasmid pNCR-C(AUG) contains full-length HCV 5′-NCR (HCV-1) followed by 15 nt of the core region (42Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The plasmid NCR-C(ΔAUG) is similar to the NCR-C(AUG), except that it lacks initiator AUG at nt 342. The AUG deletion in this plasmid was carried out by QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Using similar strategy, the plasmids pNCR-C(ΔACC), pNCR-C(ΔC2), pNCR-C(ΔC3), and pNCR-C(ΔC4) were constructed, which contain deletions of ACC (nt 339–341) and codons 2, 3, and 4 of the core, respectively. pNCR-C(Δ1–83) was derived from the wild type plasmid pNCR-C(AUG) in which nt 1–83 at the extreme 5′ end of the HCV 5′-NCR was enzymatically deleted using SalI and NcoI. Polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was employed to construct plasmids pNCR-C(Δ1–120) and NCR-C(Δ1–135). Both the plasmids represent HCV 5′-NCR sequence of NCR-C(AUG), except that they lack 120 and 135 nt from the 5′ end of the NCR, respectively. The plasmid NCR-C(AUG) was mutated at nt positions 126–129 (CUCC to AGAA) and 327–329 (CGU to GCA) of the HCV 5′-NCR to construct pNCR-C(SI Mut) and pNCR-C(SII Mut), respectively. The plasmid NCR-C(Py-III Mut) was constructed by substitution of UUUCU to AAAGA at nt 194–198 in the pNCR-C(AUG). The nt sequence in these plasmids were confirmed by dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing method. The construction of His-tagged La encoding cDNA is described in detail by Goodieret al. (26Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Selection of high affinity C5 RNA ligand against La antigen by SELEX method and construction of plasmid pC5-SP64 that expresses C5 RNA is described previously (38Kenan D.J. RNA Recognition by the Human La Protein and Its Role in Transcription, Translation, and Viral Infectivity. Ph.D. thesis. Duke University, Raleigh, NC1995Google Scholar). RNA transcripts were synthesizedin vitro from linearized plasmid DNA that was purified by elution of the desired fragments from the agarose gels after digestion with an appropriate restriction endonuclease. The pNCR-C(AUG) and all its derivatives were linearized with EcoRI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase using standard protocols. The plasmids pT7C1–341 (16Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and pPB305 were linearized by HpaI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase to produce HCV and Thieler's murine encephalitis virus (TMEV) 5′-NCR containing monocistronic luciferase RNA, respectively. The plasmid T7P5NCLuc was linearized withNheI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate monocistronic RNA containing poliovirus 5′-NCR followed by luciferase sequence. These monocistronic RNAs will thus contain respective IRES elements fused with the luciferase open reading frame followed by poly(A) tail. Plasmid pC5-SP64 and pGEM-4 were linearized withDraI and EcoRI, respectively, for the transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. For the preparation of a mutant C5 SELEX, pC5-SP64 was digested with Bsp1286I and transcribed similarly. The capped RNAs were synthesized in the presence of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap analogue using Ampliscribe T7 transcription kit (Epicenter Technologies). The plasmid pRL-HCV1b, which encodes upstream Renilla luciferase followed by the HCV IRES (nt 1–357 of the HCV genotype 1b) linked to the second reporter firefly luciferase gene (56Collier A.J. Tang S. Elliott R.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was linearized withHindIII and transcribed in the presence of cap analogue as described above. The capped T7DC1–341 RNA (16Wang C. Sarnow P. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared similarly. The quality, integrity, and quantity of RNA preparations were ensured by spectrophotometrically as well as agarose gel electrophoresis. The radioactive RNA probes were synthesized under similar reaction conditions with 4-thio-UTP and [α-32P]CTP. A cDNA encoding the human La antigen without a tag in the pET-8c vector was used for the expression of recombinant La antigen. The expression of La antigen was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside inEscherichia coli (BL21(DE3)) cells and purified by a two-step chromatography to homogeneity as described previously (42Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The expression of full-length human La (La 1–408) and its truncated versions that contain 6-His tag at the C terminus is described by Goodier et al. (26Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The purification of these proteins were carried out with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose under nondenaturing conditions and eluted with imidazole according to manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The La preparations were dialyzed against buffer D (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 25 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin) and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) and GST-PTB fusion protein were expressed in bacteria using plasmids GEX-KT and GST-2TK/PTB, respectively, and purified as described previously (43Ali N. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6367-6375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4-Thio-UDP (Sigma) was phosphorylated with nucleoside 5′-diphosphate kinase to prepare 4-thio-UTP (44Stade K. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9889-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). RNA probes synthesized in the presence of 4-thio-UTP and [α-32P]CTP were incubated with the purified proteins or lysates at 30 °C for 30 min in RNA binding buffer (buffer D plus 2 mm MgCl2) as described previously (42Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). For all the competition assays, competitor RNAs were added along with the components of the reaction mixture prior to UV cross-linking. The UV cross-linking was carried out in Stratalinker (Stratagene) for 30 min at 4 °C. The ribonucleoprotein complexes were treated with RNase A (10–20 units) (United States Biochemical Corp.) and analyzed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by autoradiography. The intensity of the bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager. HeLa S10 cytoplasmic fractions from suspension cultures of HeLa S3 were prepared essentially as described by Barton et al. (45Barton D.J. Morasco B.J. Flanegan J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These lysates were active for the HCV IRES-mediated translation of reporter RNAs. Huh7 cells were cultured on Petri dishes, and the S10 lysates were prepared using the same method. S10 fraction (50 μg of protein) maintained in RNA binding buffer was mixed with full-length NCR-C(AUG) RNA probe in a total volume of 50 μl. After UV cross-linking and ribonuclease treatment, the samples were diluted to 500 μl with NETS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40), mixed with affinity purified human anti-La autoantibodies (V3), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were immobilized on Protein A-Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The unbound materials were washed six times with the same buffer. The bound protein(s) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. A parallel reaction mixture was performed with normal human IgG purified by Protein A-Sepharose chromatography and served as a control. HeLa S10 lysates and initiation factor lysates (45Barton D.J. Morasco B.J. Flanegan J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were used during translation-inhibition assay. Twenty five μl of the translation mixture that included 5 μl of the S10 lysates, 3 μl of initiation factor, 3 μl of 10× CPK (300 mm creatine phosphate, 4 mg/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 600 mmKCH3CO2, and 155 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4), 1 μl of [35S]methionine, and 20 units of RNasin, were programmed with IRES containing luciferase RNA (each 100 ng) in the absence or presence of varying amounts of C5 SELEX RNA. The reaction was carried out for 1 h at 30 °C , and luciferase activity was assayed from a 2-μl aliquot as described by de Wet (46de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). Inhibition of translation by C5 RNA was plotted against the ligand concentrations. Rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL, Promega) were used for translation-stimulation studies in the presence of His-La () or its truncated versions as described previously (42Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Translation of the capped T7DC1–341 was carried out using 10 μl of RRL, 2 μl of HeLa S100, 1 μl of [35S]methionine, 1 μl of amino acid mixture without methionine, and 20 units of RNasin in a total volume of 25 μl for 1 h at 30 °C. Two μl of translation reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%) electrophoresis. The gels were treated with Fluoro-Hance (RPI Corp.), dried, and used for PhosphorImage analysis (Bio-Rad). A liver-derived cell line (Huh7) was used for the co-transfection assay. The cells were transfected with in vitro transcribed uncapped T7C1–341 or capped dicistronic dual luciferase RNA using Lipofectin transfection protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). To demonstrate the inhibitory activity of C5 SELEX or its mutant on the HCV IRES-controlled translation, the cells were directly co-transfected with the reporter RNAs along with C5 SELEX. An RNA derived from pGEM-4 multiple cloning site served as a control during a similar co-transfection experiment. Each transfection was carried out in triplicate. The luciferase activity was assayed as described above. La antigen contains three putative RRMs. RRM1 and RRM2 are located at the N-terminal half of La protein, and RRM3 is located at the beginning of the C-terminal portion (Fig.2 A). Each of these RRMs plays an important role during direct recognition of the RNA motifs and increases the affinity of La during RNA binding by the other RRM (26Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The C terminus contains an adjacent basic and acidic region, phosphorylation sites, and a homodimerization domain that regulate its nuclear and cytoplasmic functions (26Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Craig A.W.B. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 88: 707-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Using various La antigen mutants shown in Fig. 2 A, we investigated if these structural elements play a significant role during recognition of the HCV 5′-NCR. The bacterially expressed His-tagged La and those containing deletion mutations were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resins (26Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A silver-stained SDS-PAGE pattern of the purified proteins is presented in Fig. 2 B. The affinity-purified proteins were UV cross-linked with the wild type 32P-labeled HCV 5′-NCR probe and subjected to SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 2 C. La 1–408, which represents full-length wild type La antigen, binds 5′-NCR efficiently. RRM1 represented by La 1–103 alone did not interact with the 5′-NCR. However, when part of the RRM2 was included to the RRM1 in La 1–160, binding with the 5′-NCR probe was observed but with lesser extent compared with the wild type (La 1–408). Although La 1–235 contains both the RRMs, it exhibited poor binding. Two additional mutants, La 188–408 and La 229–408, in which amino acids 187 and 228 were deleted from the N terminus respectively, efficiently cross-linked with the 5′-NCR. These binding data suggest that affinity of La for the 5′-NCR interaction is directed more toward the RRM3 than the other two RRMs that are located at the N-terminal half of La. Contrary to these observations, the binding of C-terminal half of La protein to hY4 RNA was not detected in a mobility shift analysis (26Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using different preparations of La mutants, we further confirmed the unusual binding ability of La 188–408 and La 229–408 mutants. Because of the fact that the RNA targets of La antigen significantly differ from each another in their sequence and structural organization, the requirement of cis-elements within La antigen that regulate its RNA binding ability may also differ. It is also possible that these diverse group of RNAs present distinct structural elements for La binding. This promiscuous bindi"
https://openalex.org/W2062618220,"Stress activation of heat shock factor (HSF1) involves the conversion of repressed monomers to DNA-binding homotrimers with increased transcriptional capacity and results in transcriptional up-regulation of the heat shock protein (hsp) gene family. Cells tightly control the activity of HSF1 through interactions with hsp90 chaperone complexes and through integration into a number of different signaling cascades. A number of studies have shown that HSF1 transcriptional activity is negatively regulated by constitutive phosphorylation in the regulatory domain by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) isoforms α/β. However, previous studies have not examined the ability of GSK3 to regulate the DNA-binding activity of native HSF1 <i>in vivo</i> under heat shock conditions. Here we show that GSK3β inhibits both DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of HSF1 in heat-shocked cells. Specific inhibition of GSK3 increased the levels of DNA binding and transcription after heat shock and delayed the attenuation of HSF1 during recovery. In contrast, the overexpression of GSK3β resulted in significant reduction in heat-induced HSF1 activities. These results confirm the role of GSK3β as a negative regulator of HSF1 transcription in cells during heat shock and demonstrate for the first time that GSK3β functions to repress DNA binding."

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4732-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AMH belongs to the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family. Other members of this family, which includes the Activins, the Nodals, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), signal through two related but distinct receptors serine/threonine kinases, denoted type I and type II. The ligand binding induces the assembly of a receptor complex in which a specific type II receptor phosphorylates and activates a type I receptor (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). Once the type I receptor is activated, it interacts transiently with specific receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), phosphorylating these proteins on two serine residues at the carboxyl terminus (7Macias-Silva M.

R-Smads 1, 5, and 8 participate in BMPs pathways (8Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J.

A novel member of the type II receptor family was recently identified as the AMH type II receptor (AMHR-II). AMHR-II is selectively expressed in the natural cell targets of AMH (9di Clemente N.

Inherited mutations in AMH or in AMHR-II in humans have a similar phenotype of Müllerian duct retention leading to pseudohermaphroditism (11Josso N. Picard J.Y. Imbeaud S. di Clemente N. Rey R. Clin. Endocrinol. 1997; 47: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the type I receptor for AMH has remained unknown. The goal of our work was to determine whether AMH interacts with the identified signaling pathways of other TGF-β family members, by sharing downstream effectors. Some members of the TGF-β family may share type I receptors. For example the Activin type I receptor ActR-IB, also known as ALK4, may also be engaged by Nodal (12Schier A.F. Shen M.M.

Here we provide evidence that AMH induces the specific association of AMHR-II and the BMP type I receptor BMPR-IB (also known as ALK6) and activates the Smad1 pathway and Smad1-dependent transcription. CHO-3W cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium-α without nucleosides (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 300 nm methotrexate (Sigma).

Plasmin-cleaved AMH was used instead of the full-length molecule for incubation times shorter than 2 h. In this case, AMH was digested by plasmin (Sigma) 6 h at 23 °C, followed by elimination of the plasmin through a Protrap column (Takara, Berkeley, CA). Western blot performed with 5–10 μg of AMH and 0.25 μg of BMP2 using a 15% gel and an antibody against BMP2/4 (1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) showed absence of contamination with BMP2 or -4 (results not shown). TGF-β was purchased from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK). BMP2 was a generous gift from Genetics Institute (Boston). When incubation times were shorter than 2 h, ligands were added at a concentration 5–10-fold higher than that used for testing their biological activity. Antibodies against Smad1 and the phosphorylated forms of Smad1 and Smad2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); the antibody against Smad4 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the anti-HA antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. According to the manufacturer, the antibody against Smad1, but not against its phosphorylated form, cross-reacts with Smad5 and Smad8. The antibody against phospho-Smad2 does not detect phospho-Smad3. TβR-II/His and all HA-tagged type I receptors were cloned in pCMV5, AMHR-II/His in pCDNA3, and AMHR-II/HA in pCDM8.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), and BMPR-IB(K231R) was generated by PCR mutagenesis. 2J. Doody and J. Massagué, unpublished observations. The extracellular domain of the human AMHR-II was cloned in pQE-30 vector (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) to add a His6 tag at the amino terminus. AnEscherichia coli strain was transformed with this construct, and the fusion protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) under native conditions. A rabbit was immunized with the protein preparation, and after 3 months the resulting immune serum was purified by affinity with the fusion protein as indicated in the O'Quick Pure System kit (Sterogene, Isnes, Belgium). Depending upon the experiments, cells were metabolically labeled or not with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine for 2 h at 37 °C and treated 45 min with either AMH (357 nm), BMP2 (10 nm), or TGF-β (1 nm). After lysis, immunoprecipitation was carried out for 2 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies (1–5 μg/ml) followed by adsorption for 2 h at 4 °C to protein A-Sepharose for monoclonal antibodies or to a mix of protein A- and G-Sepharoses (v/v) for polyclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times and eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer, 10 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography or Western blotting after electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After 24 h of culture, cells were stripped of serum and incubated 45 min in the presence of either AMH (357 nm), TGF-β (1 nm), or BMP2 (10 nm). After a wash with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF) for 20 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, 5,000 ×g. After determination of the supernatant protein concentration using the BCA assay (Pierce), 20 μg of cell extracts or the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting (16Faure E. Gouédard L. Imbeaud S. Cate R.L. Picard J.Y. Josso N. di Clemente N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30571-30575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using the indicated antibodies (1 μg/ml). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were plated in 4-dish permanox Labtec chambers. The following day, cells were treated 1 h with either AMH (357 nm), BMP2 (10 nm), or TGF-β (1 nm) and fixed 2 min with acetone/methanol (1:1). Incubation with the indicated antibodies (5 μg/ml) was performed overnight in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, 3% bovine serum albumin. After washes, cells were incubated with a rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody. To measure the activity of theXVent2-luciferase and 3TP-luciferase reporter genes in P19 cells, cells were co-transfected with one of these constructs and either AMHR-II, BMPR-IB(KR), or TβR-I(KR). The next day, cells were incubated with AMH (71.4 nm), BMP2 (1 nm), or TGF-β (100 pm). Activation of the3TP-luciferase reporter gene in SMAT-1 cells was studied as above except that these cells were transfected with the reporter gene construct alone. Luciferase activity was then normalized for protein concentration. Reverse transcription followed by PCR was used to study BMPR-IB and AMHR-II expression profiles. 2.5 μg of total RNA extracted with the cesium chloride method were reverse-transcribed as described (9di Clemente N. Wilson C.A. Faure E. Boussin L. Carmillo P. Tizard R. Picard J.Y. Vigier B. Josso N. Cate R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1006-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A 5-μl aliquot of this reaction product was amplified as described (9di Clemente N. Wilson C.A. Faure E. Boussin L. Carmillo P. Tizard R. Picard J.Y. Vigier B. Josso N. Cate R.L. Mol.

Genet. 1995; 11: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) using different primers to visualize the extracellular domain of (a) rabbit AMHR-II (5′ ACAGGAGGACCTGTGTGTTCT 3′ and 5′ GTCATCCGGGAAGGAGGTCA 3′), (b) mouse AMHR-II (5′ TCCAGCTGGCATCCTTTTGC 3′ and 5′ GTAATCCAGGAAGGAGGTCA 3′), and (c) BMPR-IB in both species (5′ AATTAAATGTGGGCACCAAG 3′ and 5′ CCCATCAACAAAATCTCTGT 3′). Identification of the interaction of type I receptors with type II receptors is facilitated by the availability of an antibody directed against the type II receptor. A polyclonal antibody was raised against the bacterially expressed extracellular domain of human AMHR-II purified under non-denaturing conditions. The antibody, Ab-AMHR-II, specifically recognizes AMHR-II by immunofluorescence, Western immunoblotting, as well as immunoprecipitation assays in the CHO-3W cell line, which expresses a stably transfected AMHR-II (14Imbeaud S. Faure E. Lamarre I. Mattei M.G. di Clemente N. Tizard R. Carré-Eusèbe D. Belville C. Tragethon L. Tonkin C. Nelson J. McAuliffe M. Bidart J.M. Lababidi A. Josso N. Cate R.L. Picard J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), but not in parental CHO cells (Fig.1). By using the CHO-3W cell line, we first investigated the capacity of various type I receptors to interact with AMHR-II in a ligand-dependent fashion. The CHO-3W cell line was transiently transfected with vectors encoding either TSR1/ALK1, ActR-I/ALK2, BMPR-IA/ALK3, ActR-IB/ALK4, TβR-I/ALK5, or BMPR-IB/ALK6. All type I receptor constructs were tagged with the HA epitope of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA). Immunoprecipitation was performed with Ab-AMHR-II, and the precipitate was subjected to Western immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. This technique ensures that type I receptors are visible only if they co-precipitate with AMHR-II. Fig.2 A shows that only TβR-I and BMPR-IB interact with AMHR-II. The TβR-I interaction was ligand-independent. This may reflect the known propensity of the cytoplasmic domain of TβR-I to interact with that of heterologous type II receptors such as BMPR-II, as observed in yeast (17Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) or with chimeric receptor constructs (18Muramatsu M. Yan J. Eto K. Tomoda T. Yamada R. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In contrast, the interaction of AMHR-II and BMPR-IB was increased by AMH. AMH did not induce an interaction of AMHR-II with any other type I receptor tested in our experiments (Fig. 2 A). Surprisingly, the same interaction was also promoted by treatment with BMP2 but not TGF-β (Fig. 2 B). There was no interaction, ligand-dependent or otherwise, with ALK2, which has been considered a candidate AMH type I receptor (19Gu Z.Y. Reynolds E.M. Song J.H. Lei H. Feijen A., Yu, L.A. He W.W. MacLaughlin D.T. van den Eijnden-van Raaij J. Donahoe P.K. Li E. Development. 1999; 126: 2551-2561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm this AMH-induced receptor interaction, we co-transfected the R1B/L17, a TβR-I-defective mutant cell line derived from Mv1Lu mink lung cell line, with histidine-tagged AMHR-II and with type I receptors tagged with HA. To measure complex formation between transiently expressed type II and type I receptors, proteins were isolated under non-denaturing conditions from lysates of metabolically labeled cells, through a two-step procedure, using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose that binds polyhistidine sequences, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody and protein A-Sepharose (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). With this technique, interacting type I and type II receptors are visible. Fig. 2 C confirms the results obtained in CHO-3W cells as follows: TβR-I and BMPR-IB interacted with AMHR-II, and the interaction was AMH-dependent only in the case of BMPR-IB. Under these conditions AMH did not induce an interaction of AMHR-II with any of the other type I receptors tested (data not shown). We then investigated the effect of AMH upon R-Smad phosphorylation, interaction with Smad4, and nuclear accumulation in SMAT-1 and MA-10 testicular cell lines. SMAT-1 is derived from immature Sertoli cells by targeted oncogenesis (20Dutertre M. Rey R. Porteu A. Josso N. Picard J.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and MA-10 from a mouse Leydig cell tumor (21Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Both cell lines express AMHR-II (5Teixeira J. Fynn-Thompson E. Payne A. Donahoe P.K. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4732-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dutertre M. Rey R. Porteu A. Josso N. Picard J.Y. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By using antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated form of Smad1 or Smad2, we determined by Western blotting that AMH induced the specific phosphorylation of Smad1 in both cell lines (Fig. 3 A). As expected, BMP2, but not TGF-β, had a similar effect. Conversely, TGF-β, but not AMH, phosphorylated Smad2 in SMAT-1 cells (Fig.3 A). To determine whether AMH promotes Smad1/Smad4 interaction, we immunoprecipitated Smad1 using a specific antibody and subjected the precipitate to Western immunoblotting using an antibody directed against Smad4. Results are shown in Fig. 3 B; in both SMAT-1 and MA-10 cell lines, AMH and BMP2 induced the co-precipitation of Smad1 and Smad4, whereas TGF-β had no effect. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assays performed with anti-Smad1 antibody in SMAT-1 cells showed that AMH treatment leads to nuclear accumulation of Smad1 (Fig. 3 C). These results demonstrate that AMH activates Smad1 but not Smad2 signal transduction. Since Smads 2 and 3 are activated by TβR-I, the present results also show that the observed ligand-independent interaction between AMHR-II and TβR-I does not result in Smad activation and so, it may reflect a non-productive interaction between these two overexpressed proteins. Activation of specific reporter genes by members of the TGF-β family discriminates between BMP-like and TGF-β/activin-like signaling. To determine whether AMH activates BMP-specific target genes, we used XVent2.Luc, a reporter construct derived from the BMP-responsive geneXVent2 (22Candia A.F. Watabe T. Hawley S.H.B. Onichtchouk D. Zhang Y. Derynck R. Niehrs C. Cho K.W.Y. Development. 1997; 124: 4467-4480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chen Y.G. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3672-3677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). P19 murine embryonal cells, which respond to BMP2, were transfected with an AMHR-II vector alone or together with vectors encoding kinase-deficient, dominant negative versions of BMPR-IB or TβR-I. These mutant constructs contain a lysine to arginine mutation in the catalytic site that abrogates the kinase activity of the receptor. XVent2.Luc was included in all transfections. Two days after transfection, cells were treated with AMH, BMP2, or no addition. The results (Fig.4 A) show that AMH activates XVent2.Luc in an AMHR-II-dependent manner. The maximal activation of this construct by AMH under our conditions, approximately 2.5-fold over basal levels, is only about half of the maximal activation achieved by BMP2. Co-transfection of the kinase-inactive BMP receptor mutant BMPR-IB(KR), which significantly decreases the effect of BMP, abrogated the effect of AMH. In contrast, co-transfection of a kinase-inactive TGF-β receptor mutant TβR-I(KR) caused only a partial decrease in the effect of AMH on XVent2 reporter activity. These results show that the BMP- and Smad1-responsive reporter gene XVent2.luc is activated by AMH through AMHR-II. Furthermore, this effect is likely to involve endogenous BMPR-IB present in P19 cells because it can be blocked by a dominant negative BMPR-IB construct. The less extensive activation of theXVent2 reporter gene observed with AMH compared with BMP2 under these conditions could be due either to an intrinsically lower ability of the AMH·AMHR-II complex to engage the BMP type I receptor or to the possibility that our assay conditions are not optimal for AMH activity on P19 cells. We next tested the ability of AMH to activate a TGF-β/activin reporter gene, 3TP-Lux (24Cárcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in P19 cells. After co-transfection of an AMHR-II vector alone or together with vectors encoding dominant negative versions of BMPRI-B or TβR-I, cells were treated either with TGF-β, BMP2, or AMH. The results (Fig. 4 B) show that 3TP-Lux was activated only by TGF-β, an effect abrogated by the co-transfection of the kinase-deficient TGF-β receptor mutant Tβ R-I(KR). AMH, like BMP2, had little activity, indicating that it does not use TGF-β or activin pathways for signaling. Finally, XVent2.Luc and 3TP-Lux were transfected in SMAT-1 cells that host endogenous AMHR-II and were treated with TGF-β, BMP2, or AMH. Neither BMP2 nor AMH were able to activate XVent2.Luc in these cells (results not shown). Fig. 4 C shows that 3TP-Lux was activated only by TGF-β, confirming the results shown on Fig.4 B. RT-PCR assays were performed in order to compare AMHR-II and BMPRI-B expression in AMH target cells and tissues in the rabbit and mouse (Fig. 5). The expression of AMHR-II in Müllerian ducts and in gonadal tissues at different stages of development, including its expression in the adult testis of rodent but not in the rabbit, is in keeping with previously published data (3Racine C.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A PCR product of 360 base pairs corresponding to the extracellular part of BMPR-IB was detected at 30 cycles of PCR in all tissues tested, except in the adult mouse testis and derived cell lines where 35 cycles of PCR were required for good visualization. Our results strongly suggest that the BMP receptor BMPR-IB can be engaged by ligand-bound AMHR-II as a type I receptor for AMH. BMPR-IB interacts with AMHR-II in an AMH-dependent manner. Furthermore, AMH, like BMP2, induces Smad1 phosphorylation, interaction with Smad4, and nuclear accumulation of the complex. AMH, in an AMHR-II-dependent manner, activates the XVent2.Luc promoter, which contains the promoter of a homeobox gene controlled by BMP signaling in Xenopus and has been shown to be activated by binding of a specific Smad1 transcriptional complex (26Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massagué J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Thus, BMPR-IB meets many of the conditions expected of a type I AMH receptor. It is the only type I receptor of the TGF-β family shown to bind to the AMH type II receptor in a ligand-dependent fashion. It is co-expressed with AMHR-II in most AMH target tissues (Fig. 5); our RT-PCR results are consistent with those obtained byin situ hybridization (27Dewulf N. Verschueren K. Lonnoy O. Moren A. Grimsby S. Vandespiegle K. Miyazono K. Huylebroeck D. ten Dijke P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2652-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pattern of expression of AMHR-II is limited to AMH target organs, whereas BMPR-IB is expressed in many other organs, probably because it is required to relay signals from BMPs and related factors (13Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kimura M. Matsumoto T. Makishima F. Yamaguchi A. Yamashita H. Enomoto S. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21345-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 28Baur S.T. Mai J.J. Dymecki S.M. Development. 2000; 127: 605-619PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yi S.E. Daluiski A. Pederson R. Rosen V. Lyons K.M. Development. 2000; 127: 621-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our data support a model in which a ligand, AMH, with a restricted expression pattern gains access to a shared type I receptor (BMPR-IB) and Smad system through a highly restricted type II receptor (AMHR-II). According to this model, the combination of a highly restricted ligand and type II receptor holds the key to access to the common trunk of the Smad signaling pathway. If AMH activates BMPR-IB, it should also activate Smad1, -5, or -8, the BMPR-IB-specific R-Smads (8Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Interactions between type I receptors and their R-Smads are ruled by specific structures. A 9-amino acid sequence in the kinase domain of type I receptors, the L45 loop, is a critical determinant in specifying Smad isoform (23Chen Y.G. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3672-3677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 30Feng X.H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3912-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Chen Y.G. Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2144-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The L3 loop, a discrete surface structure in Smad proteins, is necessary for interaction with the type I receptor and is sufficient to dictate its specificity (32Lo R.S. Chen Y.G. Shi Y.G. Pavletich N.P. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The fact that AMH activates the Smad1 pathway is consistent with the involvement of BMPR-IB upstream in the transduction pathway. We cannot exclude that AMH also phosphorylates Smads 5 and 8, due to the lack of appropriate antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). Through different sets of Smad proteins, TGF-β/activin and BMPs interact with the promoter of different sets of target genes. The homeobox Xenopus gene, XVent2 (33Onichtchouk D. Gawantka V. Dosch R. Delius H. Hirschfeld K. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Development. 1996; 122: 3045-3053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a downstream target of BMP and Smad1 signaling. To obtain additional proof of the capacity of AMH to activate BMP-like downstream signaling, we studied the effect of AMH upon an XVent2.Luc reporter construct. We show that AMH induces XVent2.Luc in P19 cells, an effect requiring the presence of AMHR-II and blocked by transfection of a dominant negative BMPR-IB construct. BMPs bind to the type II receptor BMPR-II (17Liu F. Ventura F. Doody J. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3479-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 34Rosenzweig B.L. Imamura T.

A. 1995; 92: 7632-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), which is phylogenetically close to AMHR-II. BMPs also bind to activin receptors ActR-IIA and ActR-IIB (35Yamashita H. ten Dijke P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). BMPs can bind to their type I receptors without assistance, but binding affinity is much increased by the presence of the type II receptor (reviewed in Ref.39Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3983) Google Scholar). BMPR-IB binds BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, and GDF5 and forms heteromeric complexes with the type II receptors BMPR-II, ActR-II, and ActR-IIB (reviewed in Ref. 38Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). ActR-I/ALK2 has been observed to bind activin in concert with ActR-II and ActR-IIB when overexpressed in COS cells but is unable to activate the ALK2-specific Smad1 in P19 cells, indicating that ALK2 is not a physiological receptor for activin (38Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The relevance of an observed receptor interaction in this system can be assessed by the ability of the ligand-induced receptor complex in question to activate a Smad pathway. Our results suggest that BMPR-IB engagement by AMH is physiologically relevant because AMH, acting via AMHR-II in concert with BMPR-IB, is able to activate the Smad1 pathway. P19 cells contain endogenous BMPR-II (38Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar); however, AMH activation of the BMP-responsive reporter gene XVent2.Luc requires the presence of AMHR-II. Therefore, AMH must use its own type II receptor to engage BMPR-IB and Smad1. The significance of the observed interaction of AMHR-II and BMPR-IB induced by BMP2 (Fig. 2 B) is less clear. Conceivably, BMP2 could bind to AMHR-II; however, the latter is considered a very specific AMH receptor because loss of function of AMHR-II or AMH have exactly the same phenotype in mice (40Mishina Y. Rey R. Finegold M.J. Matzuk M.M. Josso N. Cate R.L. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2577-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) or humans (14Imbeaud S. Faure E. Lamarre I. Mattei M.G. di Clemente N. Tizard R. Carré-Eusèbe D. Belville C. Tragethon L. Tonkin C. Nelson J. McAuliffe M. Bidart J.M. Lababidi A. Josso N. Cate R.L. Picard J.Y. Nat.

It is possible that BMP2 is a ligand for this receptor combination under some conditions, but the genetic evidence argues against BMP2 being a physiological AMHR-II ligand in the induction of Müllerian duct regression. We did not observe any interaction between AMH and the related type I receptor BMPR-IA. BMPR-IB and -IA are not physiologically equivalent. BMPR-IA is essential for the formation of mesoderm during gastrulation, leading to early embryonic death in homozygous mutants (42Mishina Y. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Behringer R.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3027-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). BMPR-IB mutant mice are viable but, despite the general expression throughout the developing skeleton and elsewhere, exhibit defects that are largely restricted to the appendicular skeleton (28Baur S.T. Mai J.J. Dymecki S.M. Development. 2000; 127: 605-619PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yi S.E. Daluiski A. Pederson R. Rosen V. Lyons K.M. Development. 2000; 127: 621-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Investigation of the reproductive status of these transgenic animals would be interesting. The high expression of BMPR-IB in fetal Müllerian ducts (see Ref.27Dewulf N. Verschueren K. Lonnoy O.

AMH also regulates testicular development and steroidogenesis (3Racine C. Rey R. Forest M.G. Louis F. Ferré A. Huhtaniemi I. Josso N. di Clemente N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We show that AMH activates the Smad1 pathway in testicular cell lines (Fig. 3); however, the low expression of BMPR-IB in the adult testis and in cell lines derived therefrom support the hypothesis that other, as yet unidentified member(s) of the type I receptor serine/threonine kinase family, also activating Smad1, mediate the effect of AMH on Leydig cell differentiation and function. In contrast, the high expression of BMPR-IB in the ovary suggests that it could play an important role in mediating the inhibitory effects of AMH on ovarian development and steroidogenesis (2di Clemente N.

In conclusion, our present biochemical and functional evidence prove that AMH, using its own type II receptor, gains access to the common trunk of Smad1-signaling pathway and that BMPR-IB is the only cloned type I receptor that could link AMH and its type II receptor to the Smad1 transduction cascade.

https://openalex.org/W2061745332,"The chemistry of disulfide exchange in biological systems is well studied. However, very little information is available concerning the actual origin of disulfide bonds. Here we show that DsbB, a protein required for disulfide bond formation in vivo, uses the oxidizing power of quinones to generate disulfides de novo. This is a novel catalytic activity, which to our knowledge has not yet been described. This catalytic activity is apparently the major source of disulfides in vivo. We developed a new assay to characterize further this previously undescribed enzymatic activity, and we show that quinones get reduced during the course of the reaction. DsbB contains a single high affinity quinone-binding site. We reconstitute oxidative folding in vitro in the presence of the following components that are necessary in vivo: DsbA, DsbB, and quinone. We show that the oxidative refolding of ribonuclease A is catalyzed by this system in a quinone-dependent manner. The disulfide isomerase DsbC is required to regain ribonuclease activity suggesting that the DsbA-DsbB system introduces at least some non-native disulfide bonds. We show that the oxidative and isomerase systems are kinetically isolated in vitro. This helps explain how the cell avoids oxidative inactivation of the disulfide isomerization pathway."

These data, in combination with genetic and biochemical experiments, have defined models by which these proteins function and interact (for reviews, see Refs. 12Mellman I. Warren G.

NSF, with the aid of SNAPs, primes SNAREs for interaction with one another, and formation of the four-helix bundle-complexes of SNARE proteins may then drive membrane fusion. Rab GTPases and their effectors appear to control membrane tethering, the size and stability of the active zone of vesicle docking/fusion, and perhaps the timing of fusion. Nevertheless, vesicle transport cannot yet be reconstituted efficiently in vitro using only known components of the docking and fusion machinery, suggesting that our understanding of this complex process is not yet complete.A protein named GATE-16 (Golgi-associatedATPase enhancer of 16 kDa) was recently isolated in a search for previously unidentified factors that aid in intra-Golgi transport (14Legesse-Miller A. Sagiv Y. Porat A. Elazar Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3105-3109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GATE-16 is expressed constitutively in all secretory organs tested, particularly in the brain (15Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and has been localized to the Golgi apparatus (15Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). GATE-16 first stimulates the ATPase activity of NSF, and NSF in turn stimulates association of GATE-16 with the SNARE protein GOS-28 (15Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Independently of the discovery of mammalian GATE-16, a yeast ortholog, Aut7p (16Lang T. Schaeffleler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (also known as Apg8p (17Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) and Cvt5p (18Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar)), was found to be necessary for autophagocytosis. During autophagocytosis, sections of the cell cytoplasm are engulfed by double-membrane structures and transported to vacuoles (for review see Ref. 19Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The outer vesicle membrane fuses with the vacuolar membrane, and the inner compartment is thereby delivered to the vacuolar lumen for digestion. Autophagocytosis occurs on a large scale upon starvation of the cell to break down cytoplasmic proteins for emergency re-use. Similar processes occur during normal cell growth to recycle cellular constituents and during cell differentiation to remodel a cell's internal structure.Aut7p is the only protein known to date to be up-regulated during autophagocytosis (20Huang W.-P.

Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that Aut7p functions structurally rather than catalytically and that it may be involved in biogenesis of autophagosomes (20Huang W.-P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5845-5851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 21Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J.

Mutants lacking Aut7p display an extreme sensitivity to nutrient deprivation, and diploid Δaut7 strains are unable to sporulate (17Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The importance of GATE-16 in mammalian cellular processes related to autophagocytosis remains to be determined.GATE-16 is closely related in amino acid sequence (39 and 57% identity, respectively) to the light chain-3 subunit of the neuronal microtubule-associated protein complex (22Mann S.S. Hammarback J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11492-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to the GABA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), which is thought to promote clustering of neurotransmitter receptors by mediating interaction with the cytoskeleton (23Wang H. Bedford F.K. Brandon N.J. Moss S.J. Olsen R.W. Nature. 1999; 397: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Aut7p does not contact tubulin directly (16Lang T. Schaeffleler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), suggesting that members of this protein family are not united simply by a microtubule-binding function but rather may have more widespread adapter activities.We have determined the crystal structure of GATE-16 to 1.8 Å resolution. We demonstrate that the last 90 amino acids of GATE-16 adopt a ubiquitin fold. The first 27 amino acids compose two additional helices, which may be characteristic of a distinct and novel GATE-16 subgroup within the ubiquitin fold superfamily. Proteins that are structurally most similar to GATE-16 align over the ubiquitin fold region and include the Ras-binding domains of various Ras effectors such as RalGDS (24Huang L. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), c-Raf1 (25Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and phosphoinositol 3-kinase (26Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The most highly conserved region of the GATE-16 surface, a likely site for protein-protein interactions, corresponds to the face that Ras effectors present to Ras.RESULTSGATE-16 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified over a cation exchange column. Crystals belonging to the space group P21, and containing two molecules (chain A and chain B) per asymmetric unit, were grown by the hanging drop method. Phases were obtained by MAD using selenomethionine-substituted protein, and the structure was refined to 1.8 Å resolution against data from a native crystal. The final working R factor was 22.9% and the free R factor 25.6%. A stereo representation of the Cα trace of the GATE-16 structure is presented in Fig.1.Comparison of the GATE-16 structure with the protein fold data base (36Holm L.L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) revealed strong similarity to the ubiquitin domain superfold (37Orengo C.A. Jones D.T. Thornton J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Residues 28–33, 46–69, 74–95, 103–110, and 111–114 of GATE-16 superpose with residues 1–6, 13–36, 40–61, 64–71, and 73–76 of ubiquitin (PDB I.D. code 1ubi) with a root mean square deviation for α-carbons of 2.2 Å and a Z-score of 6.0. In addition, Z-scores of 6.9, 6.5, and 5.4 were obtained for structural alignments with other members of the superfold family ElonginB (PDB I.D. code 1vcb), RalGDS (PDB I.D. code 1lfd), and the Ras-binding domain from phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PDB I.D. code 1qmm), respectively. A superposition of GATE-16 with the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS in complex with Ras is shown in Fig. 2,left.Figure 2Intermolecular interactions of structurally related proteins. Left , the GATE-16 structure was superposed on RalGDS, shown in complex with Ras as determined crystallographically (24Huang L. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.-H. Nat. Struct.

The position of the GATE-16 N-terminal helices α1 and α2 could accommodate a comparable interaction between GATE-16 and Ras-related proteins. This figure was generated with Dino.Right , schematic diagram of the GATE-16 fold illustrating the mode of intermolecular interaction for structurally related proteins. Helices are shown as cylinders and β-strands as arrows. The bi-directional arrow outlined in gray illustrates that the ubiquitin fold can form pseudo-continuous sheets with its binding partners and that both anti-parallel and parallel associations have been observed crystallographically (see “Discussion”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Like ubiquitin, the GATE-16 structure has a four-stranded central β-sheet with the middle two strands parallel to one another and the outer two strands antiparallel to the inner strands (Fig. 2,right). The sheet is backed by helices α3 and α4 on one side. Helices α1 and α2, not found in the other ubiquitin fold superfamily members, pack against the opposite side of the sheet (Figs.1 and 2). Glu-34, which forms hydrogen bonds to the backbone NH groups at the N terminus of helix α1, and Glu-12, the N-cap residue of the α2 helix, are universally conserved (Fig.3), indicating that the α1 and α2 helices are likely to be present in all GATE-16 homologs. Furthermore, two salt bridges between residues in helix α2 and the ubiquitin fold (Arg-14 to Asp-102 and Glu-17 to Lys-48) also appear to be maintained in all homologs (Fig. 3).Figure 3Sequence alignment of GATE-16 homologs.Sequences were aligned by ClustalW (42Thompson J.D.

Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 745-756PubMed Google Scholar). Darker shading indicates stronger conservation, and lighter shading indicates weaker conservation. Conserved N-cap residues of helices α1, α2, and α3 are indicated by asterisks. Secondary structural elements derived from the GATE-16 structure are shown either above orbelow the sequences.

SC, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; LB, Laccaria bicolor; CE,Caenorhabditis elegans. The bovine light chain-3 (LC3) sequence is shown. At least seven related sequences are found in Arabidopsis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The two independent copies of GATE-16 in the crystals superpose with a root mean square deviation for backbone atoms of 0.47 Å between residues 1 and 110 and a maximum displacement of 3 Å. The last seven residues then diverge (Fig. 1), with a maximum displacement in the backbone of 18 Å. This flexible C-terminal region contains a phenylalanine (Phe-115) that is conserved in all known homologs, excepting the Caenorhabditis elegans GATE-16 ortholog and GABARAP, both of which contain a tyrosine at this position (Fig. 3). The next residue, Gly-116, is invariant. In chain A, residues 112–116 extend out from the globular region of the protein, and Phe-115 packs against chain B. Residues 112–117 of chain B are oriented such that Phe-115 packs against its own chain, and only Phe-117 extends into the neighboring molecule. Strong sequence conservation at positions that do not contribute structurally to the fold of a protein implies functional constraints on residues Phe-115 and Gly-116. The nature of these constraints remains to be determined.Within the GATE-16 crystals, neighboring molecules are packed such that the Cys-15 side chains are within appropriate disulfide-bonding distance. Furthermore, we observed that dissolved crystals contained a higher fraction of disulfide-bonded dimeric protein as determined by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than did the original crystallization stock solution (data not shown). The GATE-16 cysteine residue is not conserved in other family members, and we do not ascribe any functional significance to the disulfide bond seen in the crystals. However, the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds indicates that the cysteine residue is solvent-exposed in the GATE-16 protomer.An examination of the charge distribution at the GATE-16 surface reveals a ring of basic residues near the edge of strand β2 surrounding a region of partially exposed hydrophobic residues (Fig.4 A). The amino acids contributing to this face of GATE-16 are more highly conserved between yeast and mammals than those on the opposite side of the protein (Fig.4 B). The basic/hydrophobic face can accommodate the packing of hydrophobic residues from other molecules, as Phe-115 from chain A docks into a pocket formed by Ile-21, Pro-30, Leu-50, the aliphatic portion of Lys-48, and Phe-104 from chain B. In turn, Phe-117 from chain B packs into the same pocket of a neighboring chain A. The same face of GATE-16 contains a second patch of partially exposed hydrophobic residues composed of Tyr-49, Val-51, Pro-52, Ile-55, Trp-62, and Ile-63. This region of chain B accommodates the exposed hydrophobic residues Val-36, Phe-77, Phe-79, and Val-84 from chain A. In contrast, the C-terminal tail of chain B shields Val-36, Phe-77, Phe-79, and Val-84 within the same protomer, so that these residues do not form a surface-exposed hydrophobic patch and are not involved in intermolecular contacts.Figure 4Surface contours, charge distribution, and conservation of sequence in GATE-16. The orientation of thetop panels is identical to Fig. 1, whereas the bottom panels are rotated 180° around the y axis. Chain A is shown in all cases.

Regions of basic potential (>18.7kBT/e, where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature) are shown in blue; acidic regions (<13.9kBT/e) are in red. Conserved basic positions and partially exposed hydrophobic residues are labeled.B , sequence conservation projected onto the GATE-16 surface. The sequence of GATE-16 was compared with S. cerevisiae Aut7p. Positions that are not identical or similar between the two sequences are shown in green. The following residue pairs were considered similar: Lys and Arg, Asp and Glu, Asp and Asn, Glu and Gln, Ser and Thr, Ile and Leu, Ile and Val, Leu and Val, and Tyr and Trp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The particular crystal packing interactions described above illustrate the character of the GATE-16 surface and highlight regions of the protein available for contact. It should be noted that GATE-16 behaves as a monomer under physiological conditions in solution as determined by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation (data not shown). Its binding activity in vivo is therefore likely to be hetero-oligomeric rather than homo-oligomeric.DISCUSSIONWe have presented our findings that GATE-16, a protein involved in membrane-trafficking events, consists of a ubiquitin fold with two additional N-terminal helices. Like other factors with key roles in intracellular membrane fusion, GATE-16 is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. Interestingly, mammalian GATE-16 was identified by an approach distinct from the method used to assign function to its yeast ortholog, Aut7p. Whereas Aut7p was characterized as an autophagocytosis mutant (16Lang T. Schaeffleler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), GATE-16 was first described as a membrane transport modulator in the constitutive secretory pathway (14Legesse-Miller A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Aut7p is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm under normal growth conditions but shifts dramatically to intermediate structures in autophagosome formation under starvation conditions (21Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), whereas GATE-16 localizes to the Golgi apparatus in growing cells (15Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the functions of the proteins from mammals and yeast may be closely related, because Aut7p can partially substitute for GATE-16 in the cell-free intra-Golgi transport assay and can interact specifically with SNAREs (38Legesse-Miller A, Sagiv Y, Gluzman R, and Elazar, Z. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar).Aut7p has been ascribed a role in formation of autophagocytic vesicles (21Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of autophagosomes is likely to employ complexes similar to those used in other intracellular processes requiring membrane fusion, and general components of the membrane-fusion machinery may be recruited for autophagosome formation during starvation. Whereas GATE-16 lacks a transmembrane region and appears to be a soluble protein, it is associated with membrane-bound organellesin vivo (15Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It also associates with the soluble hexameric ATPase NSF (15Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, GATE-16 may act as an adapter protein that helps target NSF to the appropriate membranes, be they vesicle or Golgi membranes in constitutive secretion or precursors of autophagosomes during starvation. A study of GATE-16 localization under conditions that favor autophagosome formation should indicate whether mammalian GATE-16 has a comparable function to Aut7p during starvation.Analysis of the GATE-16 structure suggests possible surfaces by which this protein can interact with its partners. Both RalGDS and ElonginB, the proteins to which GATE-16 shows the strongest structural similarity, have been studied crystallographically in complex with other factors (24Huang L. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 39Stebbins C.E. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). RalGDS is an effector of Ras and binds to Ras by forming a pseudo-continuous β-sheet using the strand corresponding to β2 in GATE-16 (24Huang L. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). ElonginB forms a complex with ElonginC and VHL, a tumor-suppressor protein defective in von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and in the majority of kidney cancers. ElonginB interacts with ElonginC also by forming a pseudo-continuous β-sheet through the structural analog of GATE-16 strand β2 (38Legesse-Miller A, Sagiv Y, Gluzman R, and Elazar, Z. (2000) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). In the ElonginB/C complex, the intermolecular strand-strand interaction is parallel, and between Ras and RalGDS it is antiparallel (Fig. 2,right). The structure of phosphoinositol 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) has been determined alone and not in complex with Ras (26Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the edge of strand β2 from the Ras-binding domain of PI3Kγ is exposed, whereas a large portion of the rest of the domain is buried. It has indeed been predicted that the PI3Kγ Ras-binding domain shares the same binding mode as its structural analogs (26Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).Although it has not been demonstrated that GATE-16 contacts other proteins in a manner structurally similar to Ras effectors, it is important to note that a distinctly basic face with exposed hydrophobic patches is found on the face of GATE-16 corresponding to the Ras-binding face of Ras effectors. The top panels of Fig. 4illustrate the character of the GATE-16 surface, viewing strand β2 edge-on, from the perspective of the binding partners of RalGDS, c-Raf1, and ElonginB. The region containing basic residues and hydrophobic pockets is also the largest conserved patch of surface between GATE-16 and yeast Aut7p. We therefore predict that this surface is functionally important in protein-protein interactions involving GATE-16 and Aut7p.The bottom panels of Fig. 4 show a region on the opposite side of GATE-16 that is smaller than the basic patch but contains the largely exposed, hydrophobic residues Phe-77, Phe-79, and Val-84. These hydrophobic residues, conserved in both GABARAP and in yeast Aut7p, may represent another binding site on GATE-16, which may extend into the C-terminal tail. It is intriguing that the C-terminal tail of GATE-16 adopts two widely differing conformations in the two independent molecules in the GATE-16 crystals. In one of these conformations (chain B), the tail shields Phe-79, and partially shields Phe-77 and Val-84, from solvent. In the other conformation (chain A), the tail leaves this hydrophobic patch entirely exposed. The putative second binding site on GATE-16 could therefore be modulated by regulating the conformation of this C-terminal tail.A large protein complex active in membrane docking and fusion has recently been detected (40McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This complex contains Rab GTPases, Rab effector proteins, NSF, and SNAREs. The activities assigned to the Rab effectors parallel certain observations regarding GATE-16 function. For example, release of Rab effectors from the complex upon ATP hydrolysis by NSF has been proposed to trigger an interaction of these effectors with SNAREs (40McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). GATE-16 would be comparable with the Rab effectors in this model because it stimulates NSF activity and may then be transferred to SNAREs (15Sagiv Y. Legesse-Miller A. Porat A. Elazar Z. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this light, the structural similarity we observed between GATE-16 and effectors of the Rab-related protein Ras led us to speculate that Rabs may interact with GATE-16. Over the past decade, great progress has been made in describing the structural foundation of membrane docking and fusion in vesicle trafficking. The structures of several factors that play regulatory or mechanical roles in vesicle fusion have been determined, includingN-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF)1 domains (1Lenzen C.U.

Magnya is at 3. 15 astronomical units (AU) from the sun and has no known dynamical link to any family, to any nearby large asteroid, or to asteroid 4 Vesta at 2.36 AU, which is the only other known large basaltic asteroid. We show that the region of the belt around Magnya is densely filled by mean-motion resonances, generating slow orbital diffusion processes and providing a potential mechanism for removing other basaltic fragments that may have been created on the same parent body as Magnya. Magnya may represent a rare surviving fragment from a larger, differentiated planetesimal that was disrupted long ago."

Herein, we describe the cloning of a UDP-galactose: β-d-galactosyl-1,4-glucosylceramide α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (iGb3 synthase) from a rat placental cDNA expression library. iGb3 synthase acts on lactosylceramide, LacCer (Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer) to form iGb3 (Galα1,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer) initiating the synthesis of the isoglobo-series of glycosphingolipids.

The common precursor to these GSL is LacCer (Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer). Recently, the vital importance of GSL has been demonstrated through the null mutation of glucosylceramide synthase (2Yamashita T. Wada R. Sasaki T. Deng C. Bierfreund U. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9142-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), the first step in the synthesis of the majority of GSL. The significance of individual glycan structures within the major GSL series arising from LacCer remains to be established. To date, animals deficient in glycosyltransferases involved in the terminal modifications have not yielded the prominent or lethal phenotypes associated with the loss of the ability to synthesize core regions of glycans. Targeting null mutations in glycosyltransferases acting at key branch points in GSL biosynthesis will help reveal the contributions of the different series of GSL.As a first step to this approach we have cloned Gb3synthase and iGb3 synthase, two transferases that act on LacCer and initiate the synthesis of the globo- and isoglobo-series of GSL. Following the synthesis of Gb3(Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer) or iGb3(Galα1,3Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer) (boldface is used to show the linkage of saccharide transferred by Gb3 synthase and/or iGb3synthase), sequential addition of GalNAc residues by Gb4 synthase and Gb5 synthase leads to the production of both Gb4 and Gb5 or iGb4 and iGb5, respectively. Using a mAb SMLDN1.1 that detects GalNAc on these downstream products, we have cloned Gb3 and iGb3 synthases from a rat placental cDNA expression library. In this paper we described the cloning of iGb3 synthase, an α1,3-galactosyltransferase, that shares high homology with other glycosyltransferases in the histo-blood group ABO gene family but differs in its substrate specificity.DISCUSSIONWe have described the cloning of a new member of the ABO gene family, iGb3 synthase, an α1,3-galactosyltransferase that initiates the synthesis of isoglobo-GSL. LacCer (Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer) is the preferred acceptor substrate for iGb3 synthase, however, alternative substrates include Galβ1Cer and, surprisingly, Gb3(Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer). This suggests that iGb3synthase is able to utilize multiple substrates containing a terminal Gal residue, irrespective of its anomeric configuration (Fig.8). Hence, iGb3 synthase may be regarded as an exception to the one-linkage–one-enzyme rule. The ability to add α1,3-linked Gal to these other structures may result in the appearance of novel structures in tissues depending on the available substrates. Even though iGb3 synthase acts principally on GSL, treatment of cells expressing iGb3 synthase with PPPP did not completely abolish the expression of Galα1,3Gal seen using the lectin, G. simplicifolia lectin I-B4 (data not shown). It remains to be determined if this PPPP-resistant expression of the Galα1,3Gal epitope is occurring on GalCer or glycoprotein acceptor substrates.Previously cloned α1,3-glycosyltransferases (α1,3GalT and Forssman or i/Gb5 synthase) are members of the ABO gene family. They have been described in numerous mammals but are nonfunctional in Old World primates, including humans (21Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. Jabs E.W. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6991-6998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Xu H. Storch T., Yu, M. Elliott S.P. Haslam D.B. J. Biol.

These enzymes differ in their substrate specificity and may therefore have different functional significance. GSL containing the iGb3 structure have been described in fish, rat, dog, pig, and horse (23Ostrander G.K. Levery S.B. Eaton H.L. Salyan M.E. Hakomori S. Holmes E.H. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1999; 125: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At present it is not known if homologues of the rat iGb3 synthase exist in other species. The phenotypic cloning procedure used to clone iGb3 synthase has revealed that iGb3 may be efficiently capped with GalNAc residues to form iGb4 and iGb5. The presence of structures arising from iGb3 may not be apparent in other species, because iGb4 and iGb5 react with many of the same immunological reagents as Gb4 and Gb5, respectively. The fixative procedures used in the detection of Galα1,3Gal epitopes on glycoproteins may eliminate or reduce the levels of iGb3.Humans do not normally express the Galα1,3Gal epitope and as a result have high circulatory levels of the natural anti-Galα1,3Gal antibody (28Galili U. Anaraki F. Thall A. Hill-Black C. Radic M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2485-2493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies mediate acute rejection of xenotransplants from species that express the Galα1,3Gal epitope. The anomalous expression of Galα1,3Gal epitope in humans has been described in human cancer cells and in the thyroid from patients with the autoimmune disorder, Graves' disease (29LaTemple D.C. Abrams J.T. Zhang S.Y. Galili U. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3417-3423PubMed Google Scholar, 30Winand R.J. Devigne J.W. Meurisse M. Galili U. J. Immunol. 1994; 53: 1386-1395Google Scholar). Furthermore, small amounts of Galα1,3Gal have been reported on red cells (31Galili U. Kobrin E. Macher B.A. Shohet S.B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 319: 225-241PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of Galα1,3Gal expression in humans may reflect the activity of an alternative α1,3-galactosyltransferase, possibly iGb3 synthase. The accumulation of GSL containing iGb3 structures has been noted in rat hepatomas, mammary adenocarcinomas, and tumors of colorectal origin (32Ariga T. Kasai N. Miyoshi I. Yamawaki M.

Furthermore, the presence of multiple α1,3-galactosyltransferases may have an important clinical consequence in animals currently being assessed for xenotransplantation. Should they express the Galα1,3Gal epitope on both glycoproteins and glycolipids, it may be essential to eliminate these epitopes from both proteins and lipids to prevent xenotransplant rejection.In summary, we have cloned iGb3 synthase, an α1,3-galactosyltransferase, that initiates the synthesis of the isoglobo-series GSL. This enzyme also has the ability to act on two further substrates found in different GSL series, the globo-series and the galactosylceramides. With the recent cloning of the Gb3synthase (35Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

The phenotypic cloning procedure used to clone iGb3 synthase has revealed that iGb3 may be efficiently capped with GalNAc residues to form iGb4 and iGb5. The presence of structures arising from iGb3 may not be apparent in other species, because iGb4 and iGb5 react with many of the same immunological reagents as Gb4 and Gb5, respectively. The fixative procedures used in the detection of Galα1,3Gal epitopes on glycoproteins may eliminate or reduce the levels of iGb3.Humans do not normally express the Galα1,3Gal epitope and as a result have high circulatory levels of the natural anti-Galα1,3Gal antibody (28Galili U. Anaraki F. Thall A. Hill-Black C. Radic M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2485-2493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies mediate acute rejection of xenotransplants from species that express the Galα1,3Gal epitope. The anomalous expression of Galα1,3Gal epitope in humans has been described in human cancer cells and in the thyroid from patients with the autoimmune disorder, Graves' disease (29LaTemple D.C. Abrams J.T. Zhang S.Y. Galili U. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3417-3423PubMed Google Scholar, 30Winand R.J. Devigne J.W. Meurisse M. Galili U. J. Immunol. 1994; 53: 1386-1395Google Scholar). Furthermore, small amounts of Galα1,3Gal have been reported on red cells (31Galili U. Kobrin E. Macher B.A. Shohet S.B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 319: 225-241PubMed Google Scholar). Low levels of Galα1,3Gal expression in humans may reflect the activity of an alternative α1,3-galactosyltransferase, possibly iGb3 synthase. The accumulation of GSL containing iGb3 structures has been noted in rat hepatomas, mammary adenocarcinomas, and tumors of colorectal origin (32Ariga T. Kasai N. Miyoshi I. Yamawaki M.

Furthermore, the presence of multiple α1,3-galactosyltransferases may have an important clinical consequence in animals currently being assessed for xenotransplantation. Should they express the Galα1,3Gal epitope on both glycoproteins and glycolipids, it may be essential to eliminate these epitopes from both proteins and lipids to prevent xenotransplant rejection.In summary, we have cloned iGb3 synthase, an α1,3-galactosyltransferase, that initiates the synthesis of the isoglobo-series GSL. This enzyme also has the ability to act on two further substrates found in different GSL series, the globo-series and the galactosylceramides. With the recent cloning of the Gb3synthase (35Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 33: 25315-25321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar), gene ablation studies will be possible to determine the functional significance of different GSL series. We have described the cloning of a new member of the ABO gene family, iGb3 synthase, an α1,3-galactosyltransferase that initiates the synthesis of isoglobo-GSL. LacCer (Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer) is the preferred acceptor substrate for iGb3 synthase, however, alternative substrates include Galβ1Cer and, surprisingly, Gb3(Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer). This suggests that iGb3synthase is able to utilize multiple substrates containing a terminal Gal residue, irrespective of its anomeric configuration (Fig.8). Hence, iGb3 synthase may be regarded as an exception to the one-linkage–one-enzyme rule. The ability to add α1,3-linked Gal to these other structures may result in the appearance of novel structures in tissues depending on the available substrates. Even though iGb3 synthase acts principally on GSL, treatment of cells expressing iGb3 synthase with PPPP did not completely abolish the expression of Galα1,3Gal seen using the lectin, G. simplicifolia lectin I-B4 (data not shown). It remains to be determined if this PPPP-resistant expression of the Galα1,3Gal epitope is occurring on GalCer or glycoprotein acceptor substrates.

Variations in the solar wind can lead to disruptions of space- and ground-based systems caused by enhanced currents flowing into the ionosphere and increased radiation in the near-Earth environment. The coupling between the solar wind and the magnetosphere is mediated and controlled by the magnetic field in the solar wind through the process of magnetic reconnection.

https://openalex.org/W1970096328,"We have cloned Gb3synthase, the key α1,4-galactosyltransferase in globo-series glycosphingolipid (GSL) synthesis, via a phenotypic screen, which previously yielded iGb3 synthase, the α1,3-galactosyltransferase required in isoglobo-series GSL (Keusch, J. J., Manzella, S. M., Nyame, K. A., Cummings, R. D., and Baenziger, J. U. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.33). Both transferases act on lactosylceramide, Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer (LacCer), to produce Gb3(Galα1,4LacCer) or iGb3 (Galα1,3LacCer), respectively. GalNAc can be added sequentially to either Gb3 or iGb3 yielding globoside and Forssman from Gb3, and isogloboside and isoForssman from iGb3. Gb3synthase is not homologous to iGb3 synthase but shows 43% identity to a human α1,4GlcNAc transferase that transfers a UDP-sugar in an α1,4-linkage to a β-linked Gal found in mucin. Extensive homology (35% identity) is also present between Gb3synthase and genes in Drosophila melanogaster andArabidopsis thaliana, supporting conserved expression of an α1,4-glycosyltransferase, possibly Gb3 synthase, throughout evolution. The isolated Gb3 synthase cDNA encodes a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase of 360 amino acids. The highest tissue expression of Gb3 synthase RNA is found in the kidney, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, and brain. Gb3 glycolipid, also called Pk antigen or CD77, is a known receptor for verotoxins.

They consist of a hydrophilic carbohydrate moiety linked to a hydrophobic ceramide tail embedded within the lipid bilayer of the membrane. Lactosylceramide, Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer (LacCer), is the common synthetic precursor to the majority of GSL found in vertebrates. Hundreds of different glycans are synthesized on LacCer with the major structures grouped into six series (1Stults C.L. Sweeley C.C. Macher B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 167-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). One such series, globo-GSL, is initiated by the action of Gb3synthase on LacCer to produce Gb3(Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer). Gb3 is the Pk blood group antigen and has since acquired the designation CD77 (2Marcus D.M. Kundu S.K. Suzuki A. Semin. Hematol. 1981; 18: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar, 3). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against Gb3 are used as a marker for Burkitt's B-cell lymphoma and are able to initiate apoptosis (4Nudelman E. Kannagi R. Hakomori S. Parsons M. Lipinski M. Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Science. 1983; 220: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Mangeney M. Lingwood C.A. Taga S. Caillou B. Tursz T. Wiels J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5314-5319PubMed Google Scholar). Gb3 has also been localized to a subset of tonsillar B-cells in the germinal center, platelets, and uroepithelial cells (2Marcus D.M. Kundu S.K. Suzuki A. Semin. Hematol. 1981; 18: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cooling L.L. Walker K.E. Gille T. Koerner T.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4355-4366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lingwood C.A. Nephron. 1994; 66: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The B-subunit of Shiga toxins interacts specifically with Gb3 on the cell surface, thus Gb3 plays a direct role in toxin entry into the cell (8Lindberg A.A. Brown J.E. Stromberg N. Westling-Ryd M. Schultz J.E. Karlsson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of Gb3 in the endothelial cells of the kidney of pediatric patients accounts for the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome during bacterial infection withShigella that produce verotoxin (7Lingwood C.A. Nephron. 1994; 66: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, Gb3 has been implicated in the entry of HIV-1 into cells (9Puri A. Hug P. Jernigan K. Barchi J. Kim H.Y. Hamilton J.

J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5244-5248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we describe the cloning of Gb3synthase, an α1,4-galactosyltransferase, and identify significant homology with an α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that also transfers to a β-linked Gal (11Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, Gb3 synthase is a member of an emerging family of α1,4-glycosyltransferases that utilizes UDP donors and transfers to a β-linked acceptor. Additional potential members of this family can be identified in plant, insect, and mammalian sequences submitted to GenBank™ indicate that this is a highly conserved family of α1,4-glycosyltransferases. We have described the phenotypic cloning procedure in detail elsewhere (see Keusch et al., companion paper (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 33: 25308-25314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Briefly, a rat placental cDNA library, RPL18, in pCDM8 was cotransfected with large T-antigen cDNA (plasmid pPSVE1 PyE, a kind gift from Dr. Minoru Fukuda, The Burnham Institute) into CHO host recipient cells and surface expression of downstream products, Gb4 and Gb5, were detected using the mAb SMLDN1.1 via flow cytometry (FACS). CHO cells express relatively simple glycosphingolipids, mostly GlcCer, LacCer, and GM3. Moreover, CHO cells do not express Gb3 synthase but do express endogenous Gb4 synthase and Gb5synthase. We have previously used this phenotypic screen to clone the iGb3 synthase (GenBank™ accession number AF248543, see Keusch et al., companion paper (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) yet negative for iGb3 synthase cDNA revealed a clone capable of synthesizing Gb3. We refer to this latest clone as Gb3 synthase (accession number AF248544). Gb3 synthase cDNA insert was fully sequenced in both directions using T7, a pCDM8 reverse primer and gene-specific primers, in a reaction mix containing ABI Big-Dye terminators with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (PE Applied Biosystems). GenBank™ data bases were searched for homologous sequences using the BLAST (NCBI) program. Membrane topology of Gb3 synthase was modeled using the transmembrane prediction program TMHMM (13). The199DTD201 sequence in the Gb3cDNA clone was mutated to 199ATA201 by inverse PCR using high fidelity KlenTaq LA-polymerase mix (Sigma), and completely overlapping primers containing the point mutations (underlined), in the forward direction are: 5′-GGTGGCATCTACTTGGCCACAGCCTTCATCGTCCTCAAG-3′ and reverse direction: 5′-CTTGAGGACGATGAAGGCTGTGGCCAAGTAGATGCCACC-3′ were used. Following thermocycling and digestion of parental DNA template with DpnI, MC1061/P3 cells were transformed and mini-preps sequenced to verify the desired mutations. Transfected CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ± 2 μm 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol, HCl) (dl-threo-PPPP, Calbiochem), an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (14Abe A.

Cells were harvested 60 h post-transfection using 0.02% EDTA and stained as described (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

Rat mAb M1/22.21 (kindly provided by Dr. Haslam, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) was specific for the Forssman (Gb5) glycolipid (GalNAcα1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer). Cell extracts from transfected CHO cells were prepared and assayed as described previously for the iGb3 synthase (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

Radiolabeled reaction products were isolated on Sep-Pak C18 columns, then separated via thin layer chromatography (TLC) and exposed to film as described (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A.

The day after transfection, CHO cells were labeled with either 35 μCi/ml [3H]Gal or [3H]GlcNAc (NEN Life Science Products), which can also incorporate into GalNAc and sialic acid, for a further 24–48 h. Cells were scraped off the culture plate, and glycolipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol as described (15Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Glycolipid extracts from transfected CHO cells (approximately 1–10 μg or 30,000 cpm) were digested overnight at 37 °C with exoglycosidases in the presence of 0.05% sodium taurodeoxycholate in a final volume of 10 μl as described (39Keusch J.J.

TLC plates were dried by evaporation and either sprayed with orcinol for total glycolipid detection or processed for immunostaining. TLC plates were blocked overnight in PBS/1% BSA. The B-subunit of Shiga toxin (B-Stx-1) was purified to homogeneity, biotinylated, dialyzed, and generously provided by Dr. Haslam, Washington University. The biotinylated B-Stx-1 was diluted 1:1000 in PBS/1% BSA and added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, 3 × 10 min, streptavidin-peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:20,000 in PBS/1% BSA was added for 30 min at room temperature. Blots were washed 6 × 10 min in PBS and developed using chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell sensitivity to verotoxin was measured using an inhibition of protein synthesis assay via Tran35S labeling. CHO cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmid pPSVE1 PyE and either Gb3 or iGb3synthase cDNA or empty pCDM8 vector. Transfectants were harvested 48 h post-transfection using 0.02% EDTA, washed in culture media, and plated out in duplicate at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates in the presence of various concentrations of Shiga toxin-1 (Stx-1, kindly provided by Dr. Haslam) for 4 h at 37 °C. The Stx-1 was prepared from a filtered periplasmic extract of cultured bacteria cells containing pNAS13, which carries the Stx-1 operon. Verotoxin and media were washed out and cells incubated in cysteine-, methionine-, SO4-free minimal essential medium (Earle's) labeling media for 5 min. Fresh labeling media containing 20 μCi/ml Tran35S (ICN) label was added for 30 min. Cells were washed several times in PBS and lysed in PBS/1% SDS/2 mm EDTA and precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, final concentration 10%. Following centrifugation, the trichloroacetic acid pellets were solubilized using Protosol (NEN Life Science Products), transferred to scintillation vials containing 3a70B scintillation mixture (Research Products International Corp.), mixed, and counted. The levels of Gb3 synthase were determined as described (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 33: 25308-25314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using a phenotypic screen based on recognition of terminal GalNAc by the mAb SMLDN1.1, we identified two independent and nonhomologous α-galactosyltransferases that act on LacCer. Initially, iGb3 synthase was cloned, an α1,3-galactosyltransferase that converts LacCer to Galα1,3LacCer (iGb3) (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 33: 25308-25314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of additional positive pools of clones revealed Gb3 synthase, an α1,4-galactosyltransferase, that adds galactose onto LacCer to produce Galα1,4LacCer. The de novo synthesized products, iGb3 and Gb3, serve as acceptor substrates for endogenous Gb4 and Gb5 synthases that are present in the CHO recipient host cell line, thus accounting for the reactivity with the mAb SMLDN1.1 following transfection. DNA sequencing of the Gb3 synthase clone reveals a 1494-base pair insert with a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 360 amino acids (Fig.1). The TMHMM program (13) predicts an N-terminal transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids with a type II transmembrane topology that is characteristic of Golgi glycosyltransferases (16Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The putative catalytic domain of Gb3 synthase is orientated toward the Golgi, where it is able to interact with its substrate LacCer (17Lannert H. Gorgas K. Meissner I. Wieland F.T. Jeckel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2939-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This domain also contains two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and a199DXD201 motif common to a number of glycosyltransferases (18Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A BLAST analysis of the Gb3 synthase clone with sequences held in the GenBank™ data base, reveals a number of genes from a diverse number of species with extensive homology. The highest identity (80%) found is to a human expressed sequence tag clone found on chromosome 22 (accession number HSB33B7). We predict that this is the human homologue of the rat Gb3 synthase. Furthermore, the Gb3 synthase is 43% identical to a previously cloned human α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Fig.2), found on chromosome 3p14.3, that forms GlcNAcα1,4Galβ1,4-R, a glycan found in class III mucin (11Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Long stretches of identity are apparent in the putative catalytic domain, including five conserved cysteines (positions 103, 240, 269, 280, and 349 in rat Gb3 synthase). Both transferases use a UDP-sugar donor to catalyze the transfer of the sugar in an α1,4-linkage to a β-linked Gal. Only limited sequence homology has been found between different families of glycosyltransferases, whereas within families there may be extensive homology. For example, the ABO blood group transferases, which now include both Forssman synthase (15Haslam D.B. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10697-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the iGb3 synthase (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 33: 25308-25314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar), are highly homologous and all produce an α1,3-linkage to a β-linked Gal or GalNAc utilizing a UDP-nucleotide sugar donor. The extensive homology between Gb3 synthase and a number of genes from diverse species, including insects, plants, and mammals is, therefore, notable (Fig. 2). Potential homologues from both Drosophila melanogaster andArabidopsis thaliana show 35% identity (54% similarity) to Gb3 synthase, including the location of four cysteine residues in D. melanogaster (equivalent to positions 240, 269, 280, and 349 in rat Gb3 synthase). Another homologous gene in D. melanogaster (31%, AE003753) is also found that has these four conserved cysteines. Five additional genes with similar degrees of identity to the α1,4-glycosyltransferases are identified in A. thaliana. Two of these genes are clustered on chromosome 2, whereas the others are separated on each of the four remaining chromosomes in the genome. The DXD motif, which may play a role in coordinating the nucleotide sugar donor (38Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), is maintained in each of the genes homologous to Gb3synthase. This suggests that Gb3 synthase is a member of a family of α1,4-UDP-sugar transferases that is highly conserved during evolution. The expression of GSL bearing terminal GalNAc at the surface of CHO cells was not expected as these cells have not been reported to synthesize Gb3, Gb4, or Gb5. FACS analysis shows strong GalNAc staining on the surface of CHO cells transfected with the Gb3 synthase cDNA compared with mock-transfectants using SMLDN1.1 and anti-Forssman mAb (Fig.3). Culture of transfected cells in the presence of PPPP, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (14Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 611-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prevented the appearance of surface material reactive with any of these reagents indicating the products were confined to GSL. A major proportion of the surface GalNAc is due to Forssman glycolipid (Gb5) expression, suggesting that conversion of Gb3 to Gb5 is an efficient process (Fig. 3). Note that CHO cells transfected with Forssman (Gb5) synthase cDNA are unable to synthesize Gb5 and do not express any terminal GalNAc (Fig. 3). Thus, the conversion of LacCer to Gb3 is essential for the subsequent production of Gb4 and Gb5 by Gb4 and Gb5 synthases that are endogenous to the CHO cells. The conversion of Gb3 to Gb4 and Gb5 is not complete, because surface expression of Gb3 is detectable using anti-Gb3 (CD77) mAb (Fig. 3). Parent CHO cells synthesize GlcCer, LacCer, and GM3 but no GSL containing terminal GalNAc (37Rosales Fritz V.M. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The GSL expressed by CHO cells transfected with Gb3 synthase cDNA were characterized by metabolically labeling with [3H]Gal or [3H]GlcNAc. The glycolipid extracts were treated with exoglycosidases, isolated via Sep-Pak C18, and analyzed by autoradiography after TLC. [3H]GalNAc-labeled doublets that migrate at the positions of Gb4 and Gb5 are seen in the CHO transfectants (Fig. 4, lane 1). In addition to the doublets migrating at the position of Gb4 and Gb5, doublets migrating at the positions of Gb3, LacCer, and GalCer are seen when the GSL are metabolically labeled with [3H]Gal (Fig. 4,lane 3). Based on the relative intensities of the GSL labeled with [3H]Gal, the majority of the Gb3is converted to Gb4 and Gb5, consistent with the pattern of staining seen during FACS analysis (Fig. 3). Digestion of labeled GSL with α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase increased the amount of [3H]Gal label migrating at the position of Gb4 at the expense of the material migrating as Gb5 (Fig. 4, lane 4). In contrast, digestion with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase increases the material migrating as Gb3 at the expense of the material migrating as Gb4 (Fig. 4, lane 5). Digestion with a combination of α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and α-galactosidase converts all the labeled material to LacCer (Fig. 4, lane 6). The pattern of digestion is typical of that obtained with authentic Gb5, GalNAcα1,3GalNAcβ1,3Galα1,4Galβ1,4Glcβ1Cer (19Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The material remaining near the position of Gb5(indicated with an asterisk in Fig. 4) is attributable to GM3, which is seen when CHO cells are transfected with the199ATA201 mutant of Gb3 synthase (Fig. 4, lane 2), and in nontransfected parent CHO cells (not shown). An interesting feature seen in the Gb3synthase sequence is the presence of a DXD motif, previously identified as catalytically important in a number of different glycosyltransferases (18Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Conversion of the199DTD201 of Gb3 synthase to199ATA201 by site-directed mutagenesis results in a loss of Gb3 activity manifested by a lack of globo-series glycolipid expression following transfection into CHO cells (Fig. 4, lane 2). Assuming that both the wild-type and199ATA201 mutant Gb3 synthase are expressed at similar levels, the mutant expresses a similar set of GSL as found in parent CHO cells. The results confirm that functional Gb3 synthase is required in CHO cells for the complete production of globo-series GSL. Triton X-100 extracts of CHO cells transfected with Gb3 synthase cDNA transfer galactose from UDP-[3H]galactose to exogenously added LacCer, whereas parent CHO cells do not (Fig.5, lane 3, lower arrow). Following the enzyme reaction, radiolabeled glycolipid products were isolated via Sep-Pak C18 and separated by TLC. Low, but detectable, levels of galactose are transferred to GalCer (Fig. 5, lane 2, upper arrow). No transfer to other GSL tested was detected (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and4). Bands present near the origin of the TLC plate are found in assays using extracts from both the parent and Gb3synthase transfected CHO cells and are therefore nonspecific. The B-subunit of the verotoxin, Shiga toxin (B-Stx-1), which specifically recognizes Gb3, reacts with material migrating at the position of Gb3 when crude extracts from CHO cells transfected with Gb3 synthase but not iGb3 synthase were examined (Fig. 6). Gb3 has been identified as the receptor for Shiga toxin, and is required for the transport of the toxin into the cell leading to cell death (8Lindberg A.A. Brown J.E. Stromberg N. Westling-Ryd M. Schultz J.E. Karlsson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfection with Gb3 synthase cDNA, CHO cells become sensitive to killing by verotoxin. Approximately 65% of Gb3 synthase cDNA transfectants are killed compared with <15% of control transfectants (Fig.7). Considering that a transfection efficiency of 65–70% is routinely achieved with CHO cells, the verotoxin is highly toxic to the transfected cells.Figure 7CHO cells transfected with Gb3synthase cDNA are susceptible to killing by verotoxin. CHO cells were transfected with empty vector, pCDM8 (open boxes), iGb3 synthase cDNA (open circles), or Gb3 synthase cDNA (filled circles). 48 h post-transfection, cells were plated out in duplicate and incubated with several dilutions of verotoxin for 4 h, washed, and labeled with Tran35S. A decrease in the percentage of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts indicates inhibition of protein synthesis and is shown as percentage cell viability.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The tissue distribution of Gb3 synthase RNA was examined by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers. The expected product size of 500 base pairs is found in most tissues, however, the apparent levels of expression varies significantly (Fig. 8). Tissues with the highest expression include the brain, kidney, mesenteric lymph node, and spleen. Intermediate levels of Gb3 synthase RNA expression are seen in the adrenal gland, uterus, pituitary, and thymus. All other tissues tested show low/undetectable expression. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA is uniform in these samples. We have cloned Gb3 synthase, an α1,4-galactosyltransferase that acts on LacCer to form Gb3 GSL, also known as CD77 or blood group Pkantigen (2Marcus D.M. Kundu S.K. Suzuki A. Semin. Hematol. 1981; 18: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nudelman E. Kannagi R. Hakomori S. Parsons M. Lipinski M. Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Science. 1983; 220: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Gb3 synthase initiates the synthesis of the globo-series GSL that includes Gb4 and Gb5, the two products that are detected in the expression cloning procedure. Thus, Gb3 (Pk antigen) is the precursor to Gb4, the P antigen, which can then be converted to Gb5 (Forssman, GalNAcα1,3Gb4). Gb3 synthase activity toward LacCer is substantially higher than to another β-linked Gal substrate, GalCer, indicating that the correct underlying carbohydrate structure is necessary for efficient enzymatic activity. The Gb3 synthase sequence should prove useful in the understanding of the genetic defects in the very rare blood group p phenotype, where there is a lack of Gb3/Pk galactosyltransferase activity and consequently an absence of Pk, P, and P1antigens (20Wiels J. Taga S. Tetaud C. Cedergren B. Nilsson B. Clausen H. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 21Bailly P. Piller F. Gillard B. Veyrieres A. Marcus D. Cartron J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 228: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). iGb3 synthase, an α1,3-galactosyltransferase (39Keusch J.J. Manzella S.M. Nyame K.A. Cummings R.D. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 33: 25308-25314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and Gb3 synthase were cloned using the same phenotypic screen, which shows that globoside and Forssman products may be synthesized on either iGb3 or Gb3 core structures, to yield iGb4 and iGb5 or Gb4 and Gb5, respectively. The presence of isoglobo- and globo-GSL, which differ only in a positional linkage (α1,3 or α1,4) of the internal α-linked Gal, raises questions as to their possible significance. Are globoside and Forssman found in the isoglobo series functionally different from their globo series counterparts? Because products based on globoside, including Forssman, have been identified as stage-specific embryonic antigens (22Kannagi R. Cochran N.A. Ishigami F. Hakomori S. Andrews P.W. Knowles B.B. Solter D. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2355-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), it raises important questions about the role of the underlying core structure (iGb3/Gb3). To address these questions we need to examine, in greater detail, the expression of each GSL pathway in different tissues and ultimately different cell types. A comparison of the Gb3 synthase and iGb3 synthase expression in rat tissues revealed a broad distribution with varying levels. Six out of the 13 tissues examined show a preferential expression of one of the enzymes, almost to exclusivity, perhaps arguing for distinct functional roles, not only for Gb3 and iGb3 but also for their downstream products. In contrast, the spleen and, to a lesser extent, the thymus show high expression of both α-galactosyltransferases. GSL structures containing iGb3and Gb3 have been isolated from the spleen (23Stoffyn P. Stoffyn A. Hauser G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 306: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Makita A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1962; 51: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is notable that the CHO cells transfected with iGb3 synthase cDNA produced a greater amount of product compared with CHO cells transfected with Gb3 synthase cDNA in in vitro assays and by FACS analysis. At present, it is unclear what the molecular basis is for this difference, although it raises the possibility that these two enzymes differ in their catalytic efficiency. The expression of Gb3 varies with Gb3 synthase activity in development and cellular differentiation (25Mobassaleh M. Koul O. Mishra K. McCluer R.H. Keusch G.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G618-G624PubMed Google Scholar, 26Taga S. Tetaud C. Mangeney M. Tursz T. Wiels J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear what signals these changes, Gb3 expression has been linked to various pathological events, including hemolytic uremic syndrome, HIV-1 cell fusion, lymphomas, and Fabry's disease (4Nudelman E.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Children, in contrast to adults, express high levels of Gb3 in their kidney and as such are at risk to infection by the Shiga toxins (7Lingwood C.A. Nephron. 1994; 66: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Obrig T.G. Louise C.B. Lingwood C.A. Boyd B. Barley-Maloney L. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15484-15488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that CHO cells become susceptible to verotoxin following expression of Gb3 on their cell surface. Hence, de novo synthesized Gb3, in contrast to exogenously added Gb3 (31Jacewicz M.S. Mobassaleh M. Gross S.K. Balasubramanian K.A. Daniel P.F. Raghavan S. McCluer R.H. Keusch G.T. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), is functional in CHO cells. Shiga toxin binds specifically to Gb3 and not to the related iGb3 GSL. The ability of iGb3 synthase to out-compete any Gb3synthase activity in the same cell may afford the animal protection against infection by bacterial toxins, adhesins, and viruses that interact with Gb3. Some bacterial pathogens recognize internal Galα1,4Gal structures (iso-receptors) via their P-fimbriae as well as terminal epitopes (32Karlsson K.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 622-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 33Roberts J.A. Marklund B.I. Ilver D. Haslam D. Kaack M.B. Baskin G. Louis M. Mollby R. Winberg J. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11889-11893Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), so an alternative core (iGb3 over Gb3) rather than simply capping terminal Galα1,4Gal by Gb4 and/or Gb5synthases would be required for resistance. It is interesting to note that, although Gb3 synthase and iGb3 synthase catalyze very similar reactions using the same acceptor substrate (LacCer), they are not homologous. iGb3 synthase is found to have very high sequence identity to the existing ABO blood group glycosyltransferases, which all catalyze the transfer of a UDP-sugar in an α1,3-linkage to either a β-linked Gal or GalNAc (39Keusch J.J.

In contrast, Gb3 appears to be a member of a distinct family of glycosyltransferases. These transferases utilize UDP-sugars as the donor to add the sugar in α1,4-linkage to a β-linked sugar acceptor, most commonly a β-linked Gal. Other structures with this linkage have been described, such as the GSL P1 blood group antigen (Galα1,4Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1-R) (34Yang Z. Bergstrom J. Karlsson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14620-14624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GlcNAcα1,4Galβ1-R found in type III mucin in humans (11Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc.

The homologues in mammals and insects may thus represent the transferases responsible for the synthesis of these structures. All the homologues to Gb3 synthase contained the catalytically important DXD motif. Genes encoding sequences with 30–35% identity with Gb3 synthase can also be identified on the five chromosomes of the plant Arabidopsis, supporting the possibility that the transferases producing structures with α 1,4-linked sugars have been highly conserved during evolution and are therefore of biological importance.

https://openalex.org/W1972302423,Mutations introduced into human growth hormone (hGH) (Thr175 --> Gly-hGH) and the extracellular domain of the hGH receptor (Trp104 --> Gly-hGHbp) created a cavity at the protein-protein interface that resulted in binding affinity being reduced by a factor of 10(6). A small library of indole analogs was screened for small molecules that bind the cavity created by the mutations and restore binding affinity. The ligand 5-chloro-2-trichloromethylimidazole was found to increase the affinity of the mutant hormone for its receptor more than 1000-fold. Cell proliferation and JAK2 phosphorylation assays showed that the mutant hGH activates growth hormone signaling in the presence of added ligand. This approach may allow other protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions to be switched on or off by the addition or depletion of exogenous small molecules.
https://openalex.org/W1565698096,"In human and rodent macrophages, activation of the P2X7 nucleotide receptor stimulates interleukin-1beta processing and release, apoptosis, and killing of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Signaling pathways downstream of this ionotropic ATP receptor are poorly understood. Here we describe the rapid activation of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK pathway in BAC1 murine macrophages stimulated by extracellular ATP. Brief exposure of the cells to ATP (10-30 min) was sufficient to trigger a rapid accumulation of activated SAPK that was then sustained for >120 min. Several observations indicated that the P2X7 receptor mediated this effect. 1) ATP and 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl-ATP were the only agonistic nucleotides. 2) The effect was inhibited by oxidized ATP and the isoquinoline KN-62, two known P2X7 receptor antagonists. 3) ATP-induced SAPK activation could be recapitulated in P2X7 receptor-transfected HEK293 cells, but not in wild-type HEK293 cells. Because P2X7 receptor stimulation can rapidly activate caspase family proteases that have been implicated in the induction of the SAPK pathway, we investigated whether ATP-dependent SAPK activation involved such proteases. Brief exposure of BAC1 macrophages to extracellular ATP induced DNA fragmentation, alpha-fodrin breakdown, and elevated levels of caspase-3-type activity. Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-cho, a caspase-3 inhibitor, inhibited ATP-induced DNA fragmentation and alpha-fodrin proteolysis, but had no effect on ATP-induced SAPK activation. Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethyl ketone, a caspase-1 inhibitor, prevented ATP-induced release of processed interleukin-1beta, but not ATP-dependent SAPK activity. We conclude that activation of ionotropic P2X7 nucleotide receptors triggers a strong activation of SAPK via a pathway independent of caspase-1- or caspase-3-like proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2086756861,"Negative Poisson's ratios are predicted for body-centered-cubic phases that likely exist in white dwarf cores and neutron star outer crusts, as well as those found for vacuumlike ion crystals, plasma dust crystals, and colloidal crystals (including certain virus crystals). The existence of this counterintuitive property, which means that a material laterally expands when stretched, is experimentally demonstrated for very low density crystals of trapped ions. At very high densities, the large predicted negative and positive Poisson's ratios might be important for understanding the asteroseismology of neutron stars and white dwarfs and the effect of stellar stresses on nuclear reaction rates. Giant Poisson's ratios are both predicted and observed for highly strained coulombic photonic crystals, suggesting possible applications of large, tunable Poisson's ratios for photonic crystal devices."

For example, Rab5 directs the transport and fusion of endocytic vesicles to and with early endosomes, whereas Rab4 is thought to control protein trafficking from early endosomes back to the plasma membrane. In the present study, we investigated the role of Rab5 and Rab4 GTPases in regulating the endocytosis, intracellular sorting, and the plasma membrane recycling of the β2AR. In cells expressing the dominant-negative Rab5-S34N mutant, β2AR internalization was impaired, and β2AR-bearing endocytic vesicles remained in either close juxtaposition or physically attached to the plasma membrane. In contrast, a constitutively active Rab5-Q79L mutant redirected internalized β2AR to enlarged endosomes but did not prevent β2AR dephosphorylation and recycling. The expression of either wild-type Rab4 or a Rab4-N121I mutant did not prevent β2AR dephosphorylation. However, the dominant-negative Rab4-N121I mutant blocked β2AR resensitization by blocking receptor recycling from endosomes back to the cell surface. Our data indicate that, in addition to regulating the intracellular trafficking and fusion of β2AR-bearing endocytic vesicles, Rab5 also contributes to the formation and/or budding of clathrin-coated vesicles. Furthermore, β2AR dephosphorylation occurs as the receptor transits between Rab5- and Rab4-positive compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1978744867,"Expression of brain fatty acid-binding protein (B-FABP) is spatially and temporally correlated with neuronal differentiation during brain development. Isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrates that recombinant human B-FABP clearly exhibits high affinity for the polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and for monounsaturated n-9 oleic acid (K(d) from 28 to 53 nm) over polyunsaturated n-6 fatty acids, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid (K(d) from 115 to 206 nm). B-FABP has low binding affinity for saturated long chain fatty acids. The three-dimensional structure of recombinant human B-FABP in complex with oleic acid shows that the oleic acid hydrocarbon tail assumes a U-shaped conformation, whereas in the complex with docosahexaenoic acid the hydrocarbon tail adopts a helical conformation. A comparison of the three-dimensional structures and binding properties of human B-FABP with other homologous FABPs, indicates that the binding specificity is in part the result of nonconserved amino acid Phe(104), which interacts with double bonds present in the lipid hydrocarbon tail. In this context, analysis of the primary and tertiary structures of human B-FABP provides a rationale for its high affinity and specificity for polyunsaturated fatty acids. The expression of B-FABP in glial cells and its high affinity for docosahexaenoic acid, which is known to be an important component of neuronal membranes, points toward a role for B-FABP in supplying brain abundant fatty acids to the developing neuron."
https://openalex.org/W1991136359,"The human asparagine synthetase(AS) gene is transcriptionally regulated by amino acid deprivation (amino acid response, AAR) and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR), also known as the unfolded protein response pathway. The results reported here document the novel observation that induction of the AS gene by the AAR and ERSR pathways occurs via the same set of genomic elements. Data supporting this conclusion include transient transfection of AS promoter/reporter gene constructs that illustrate that the transcriptional control elements used by both pathways are contained with nucleotides −111 to −34 of the AS promoter. In vivofootprinting analysis of this region identified six specific protein-binding sites. Within two of these sites, altered footprinting was observed following amino acid or glucose deprivation, but the patterns were identical for both the AAR and the ERSR pathway. Site-directed mutation of individual nucleotides within these two binding sites confirmed their importance for regulated transcription, and none of the mutations resulted in loss of response of only one pathway. Neither of these two sites corresponds to a recently identified ERSR cis-element, nor do they contain consensus sequences for known transcription factors. Collectively, the data document that there are at least two independent transcriptional mechanisms for gene activation by the ERSR pathway, one of which terminates at the same genomic elements used by the AAR pathway."

Based on its unique physical and functional interactions at both the Inr element and upstream regulatory sites, TFII-I is postulated to be a novel transcriptional cofactor that integrates signals from the regulatory components to the basal machinery (1Cheriyath V.

Equally interesting is the observation that a variety of extracellular signals mediating through cell surface receptors, including growth factor receptors, lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and increased transcriptional activity of TFII-I (3Kim D.-W.

TFII-I is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Bruton's tyrosine kinase in vitro (13Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and upon immunoglobulin receptor cross-linking in B cells it is released from Bruton's tyrosine kinase to enter the nucleus (7Novina C.D.

These observations suggest that TFII-I is downstream of several signal transduction pathways and may be a mediator linking signal-responsive activator complexes to the general transcription machinery, perhaps in a cell type-specific fashion.Recent genetic data suggest that TFII-I belongs to a family of proteins, each having the I-repeat first identified in the founding member TFII-I (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G.

Genomics. 1999; 57: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both TFII-I and the related protein WBSC11 (18Osborne L.R. Campbell T. Daradich A. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.-C. Genomics. 1999; 57: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have been mapped to the breakpoint regions of the 7q11.23 Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K.

Genomics. 1999; 57: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic analysis by Francke and co-workers suggest the presence of several alternatively spliced isoforms of TFII-I both in humans and in mice (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Based on these predicted protein sequences (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we cloned TFII-I isoforms by using a PCR based strategy (see “Experimental Procedures”) and ectopically expressed and biochemically analyzed them. Here we show that in addition to the 957-amino acid form of TFII-I (Δ), three other alternatively spliced isoforms exist in human, henceforth referred to as α (977 amino acids), β (978 amino acids), and γ (998 amino acids). Compared with the Δ-isoform, the α-isoform contains an additional 20 amino acids (encoded by exon A), the β-isoform contains an additional 21 amino acids (encoded by exon B), and the γ-isoform, which arises by the presence of both exons A and B, contains 41 additional amino acids (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All four isoforms, when ectopically and individually expressed in COS cells, exhibit similar subcellular distribution. Use of isoform specific antibodies allowed us to demonstrate stable complex formation between the various isoforms either when co-expressed ectopically or present endogenously in eukaryotic cells. The endogenous complex was preferentially located in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm, and the co-expression of wild type isoform with a nuclear localization-deficient mutant resulted in the localization of the complex to the nucleus. All four isoforms, when expressed in recombinant forms, exhibit similar DNA binding characteristics and bind to both the Inr element of the Vβ promoter and the upstream regulatory site overlapping the serum response element (SRE)1 of the c-fos promoter (2Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, although the isoforms possess similar homomeric transactivation potentials, heteromeric complex formation leads to differential activation of reporter genes. Taken together, these data suggest that the complex formation is a means by which the nuclear localization and the transcriptional activity of TFII-I are regulated.DISCUSSIONThe signals generated outside a cell are transduced to the nucleus through a series of complicated biochemical steps, ultimately resulting in spatial and/or temporal activation of specific sets of genes. Thus, there must exist specific proteins to direct signal transduction pathways to cell type-specific genes and, thereby, provide a molecular link between signal transduction and developmental/differentiation programs in a given cell. Transcription factors play a critical role in development and differentiation in general and often serve as links between signal transduction (origin) and cell type-specific gene activation (end point). Included in this group of transcription factors are the Rel family of factors (22Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 23Ghosh S. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of factors (24Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar), and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of factors (25Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Recent data from our laboratory and others suggest that TFII-I is functionally included in this group of factors that link signal transduction events to transcription (2Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Why are there four isoforms of TFII-I apparently with similar DNA binding and transcriptional activities? Do they indeed have redundant functions, or might it be that they have cell type-specific expression and function? Of the four isoforms, the γ-isoform is perhaps expressed predominantly, if not exclusively, in neuronal cells (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In our analysis of lymphoid and other non-neuronal cells, we have not observed the expression of the γ-isoform clearly by Western blot analysis. However, in our preliminary Western blot analysis of PC12 cells, a protein of approximately 150 kDa (corresponding to apparent molecular mass of the γ-isoform) cross-reacts with the anti-TFII-I antibody (data not shown). It remains to be proven whether this band indeed corresponds to the γ-isoform. Our preliminary data also indicate the presence of at least two other cell type-specific isoforms. 2V. Cheriyath and A. L. Roy, unpublished information. We have consistently seen in Western blot analysis of several cell lines and primary cells a doublet corresponding to 120 and 128 kDa (4Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12076-12081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Denis M.C. Roy A.L. Methods. 1997; 12: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 7Novina C.D. Kumar S. Bajpai U. Cheriyath V. Zang K. Pillai S. Wortis H.H. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5014-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In retrospect, given the reactivity of the antibody and the nearly identical molecular weights and the migration patterns of the α- and β-isoforms, it was impossible to determine whether the 128-kDa isoform represented only one of the isoforms or a combination of both. Now with the generation of the isoform-specific antibodies, we are in a position to distinguish between the expression patterns of α- versus the β-isoforms in various cell types.We show that the different isoforms of TFII-I interact with each other when co-expressed ectopically or when present endogenously. Interestingly, interactions between different isoforms are also seen with Ikaros protein (26Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, in our case, we do not yet know the precise stoichiometry of these interactions, i.e. whether they form dimers or higher oligomers. Thus, we have maintained the term homomer for interactions between identical isoforms and heteromer for interactions between different isoforms. Regardless of the exact stoichiometry, heteromeric complexes are preferentially found inside the nucleus relative to the cytoplasm. This may be due to the fact that either complex formation facilitates nuclear entry or the heteromeric complex is more stable in the nucleus. However, we do not yet know whether both homo- and heteromeric complexes translocate to the nucleus to the same rate and extent. Moreover, although the “uncomplexed” forms appear to be more in the cytoplasm, from our current data we cannot conclude that homomerization is facilitated in this compartment since the uncomplexed form may not be in a homomeric state and may be in a heteromeric complex with another cytoplasmic component (Fig.7). In addition, the stability and/or the extent of homomerization of different isoforms may also be different.Apart from nuclear translocation, which both homomeric and heteromeric complexes can potentially undergo, we surmised that perhaps heteromeric complexes can mediate differential gene regulation. Consistent with our expectations, we observed that different combinations of isoforms activate different reporter genes to varying extents. Thus, although the Δ+α heteromeric combination activates the Vβ basal promoter 2-fold better than either of the individual isoforms, the same combination was 20% less effective than the Δ- and marginally more effective than the α-isoform in mediating signal-induced activation of the c-fos promoter. Because TFII-I is downstream of a variety of extracellular signals (7Novina C.D. Kumar S. Bajpai U. Cheriyath V. Zang K. Pillai S. Wortis H.H. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5014-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), an obvious possibility raised by our result is that the different complexes or subcomplexes mediate different signals and, consequently, activate different sets of genes (Fig. 6). It is also likely that complex formation may modulate the amplitude or duration of the signals via differential phosphorylation of the isoforms, although we have not yet assessed the phosphorylation status of the isoforms in the complex in response to distinct signals. Such a mechanism to regulate nuclear import and subsequent function has been described for a variety of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 27Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Might there be different subcomplexes in different cell types or species? We believe so. The α-isoform is not predicted to be expressed in mouse cells (28Wang Y.K. Perez-Juardo L.A. Francke U. Genomics. 1998; 48: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and by Western blot analysis we do not see the existence of the α-isoform in mouse cell lines (data not shown). Thus, in addition to differential regulation of genes in a given cell type, complex formation by TFII-I isoforms might also mediate cell type or species-specific gene regulation. Further analysis is under way to resolve these issues. TFII-I is an intriguing transcription factor, with broad biochemical and biological activities and may be involved in several genetic disorders (1Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Based on its unique physical and functional interactions at both the Inr element and upstream regulatory sites, TFII-I is postulated to be a novel transcriptional cofactor that integrates signals from the regulatory components to the basal machinery (1Cheriyath V. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4444-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that TFII-I is phosphorylated at both serine and tyrosine residues and that tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I is critical for its transcriptional properties (5Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33443-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Equally interesting is the observation that a variety of extracellular signals mediating through cell surface receptors, including growth factor receptors, lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and increased transcriptional activity of TFII-I (3Kim D.-W.

In the B cell cytoplasm a significant fraction of TFII-I is associated constitutively with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (7Novina C.D. Kumar S. Bajpai U. Cheriyath V. Zang K. Pillai S. Wortis H.H.

TFII-I is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Bruton's tyrosine kinase in vitro (13Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and upon immunoglobulin receptor cross-linking in B cells it is released from Bruton's tyrosine kinase to enter the nucleus (7Novina C.D.

These observations suggest that TFII-I is downstream of several signal transduction pathways and may be a mediator linking signal-responsive activator complexes to the general transcription machinery, perhaps in a cell type-specific fashion. Recent genetic data suggest that TFII-I belongs to a family of proteins, each having the I-repeat first identified in the founding member TFII-I (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G.

Genomics. 1999; 57: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both TFII-I and the related protein WBSC11 (18Osborne L.R. Campbell T. Daradich A. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.-C. Genomics. 1999; 57: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have been mapped to the breakpoint regions of the 7q11.23 Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Osborne L.R. Campbell T. Daradich A. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.-C. Genomics. 1999; 57: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic analysis by Francke and co-workers suggest the presence of several alternatively spliced isoforms of TFII-I both in humans and in mice (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Based on these predicted protein sequences (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we cloned TFII-I isoforms by using a PCR based strategy (see “Experimental Procedures”) and ectopically expressed and biochemically analyzed them. Here we show that in addition to the 957-amino acid form of TFII-I (Δ), three other alternatively spliced isoforms exist in human, henceforth referred to as α (977 amino acids), β (978 amino acids), and γ (998 amino acids). Compared with the Δ-isoform, the α-isoform contains an additional 20 amino acids (encoded by exon A), the β-isoform contains an additional 21 amino acids (encoded by exon B), and the γ-isoform, which arises by the presence of both exons A and B, contains 41 additional amino acids (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All four isoforms, when ectopically and individually expressed in COS cells, exhibit similar subcellular distribution. Use of isoform specific antibodies allowed us to demonstrate stable complex formation between the various isoforms either when co-expressed ectopically or present endogenously in eukaryotic cells. The endogenous complex was preferentially located in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm, and the co-expression of wild type isoform with a nuclear localization-deficient mutant resulted in the localization of the complex to the nucleus. All four isoforms, when expressed in recombinant forms, exhibit similar DNA binding characteristics and bind to both the Inr element of the Vβ promoter and the upstream regulatory site overlapping the serum response element (SRE)1 of the c-fos promoter (2Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, although the isoforms possess similar homomeric transactivation potentials, heteromeric complex formation leads to differential activation of reporter genes. Taken together, these data suggest that the complex formation is a means by which the nuclear localization and the transcriptional activity of TFII-I are regulated. DISCUSSIONThe signals generated outside a cell are transduced to the nucleus through a series of complicated biochemical steps, ultimately resulting in spatial and/or temporal activation of specific sets of genes. Thus, there must exist specific proteins to direct signal transduction pathways to cell type-specific genes and, thereby, provide a molecular link between signal transduction and developmental/differentiation programs in a given cell. Transcription factors play a critical role in development and differentiation in general and often serve as links between signal transduction (origin) and cell type-specific gene activation (end point). Included in this group of transcription factors are the Rel family of factors (22Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 23Ghosh S. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of factors (24Darnell J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar), and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of factors (25Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). Recent data from our laboratory and others suggest that TFII-I is functionally included in this group of factors that link signal transduction events to transcription (2Grueneberg D.A. Henry R.W. Brauer A. Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Gilman M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2482-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Kim D.-W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell.

A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Why are there four isoforms of TFII-I apparently with similar DNA binding and transcriptional activities? Do they indeed have redundant functions, or might it be that they have cell type-specific expression and function? Of the four isoforms, the γ-isoform is perhaps expressed predominantly, if not exclusively, in neuronal cells (8Perez Juardo L.A. Wang Y.-K. Peoples R. Coloma A. Cruces J. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In our analysis of lymphoid and other non-neuronal cells, we have not observed the expression of the γ-isoform clearly by Western blot analysis. However, in our preliminary Western blot analysis of PC12 cells, a protein of approximately 150 kDa (corresponding to apparent molecular mass of the γ-isoform) cross-reacts with the anti-TFII-I antibody (data not shown). It remains to be proven whether this band indeed corresponds to the γ-isoform. Our preliminary data also indicate the presence of at least two other cell type-specific isoforms. 2V. Cheriyath and A. L. Roy, unpublished information. We have consistently seen in Western blot analysis of several cell lines and primary cells a doublet corresponding to 120 and 128 kDa (4Manzano-Winkler B. Novina C.D. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12076-12081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Novina C.D. Cheriyath V. Denis M.C. Roy A.L.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5014-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In retrospect, given the reactivity of the antibody and the nearly identical molecular weights and the migration patterns of the α- and β-isoforms, it was impossible to determine whether the 128-kDa isoform represented only one of the isoforms or a combination of both. Now with the generation of the isoform-specific antibodies, we are in a position to distinguish between the expression patterns of α- versus the β-isoforms in various cell types.We show that the different isoforms of TFII-I interact with each other when co-expressed ectopically or when present endogenously. Interestingly, interactions between different isoforms are also seen with Ikaros protein (26Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, in our case, we do not yet know the precise stoichiometry of these interactions, i.e. whether they form dimers or higher oligomers. Thus, we have maintained the term homomer for interactions between identical isoforms and heteromer for interactions between different isoforms. Regardless of the exact stoichiometry, heteromeric complexes are preferentially found inside the nucleus relative to the cytoplasm. This may be due to the fact that either complex formation facilitates nuclear entry or the heteromeric complex is more stable in the nucleus. However, we do not yet know whether both homo- and heteromeric complexes translocate to the nucleus to the same rate and extent. Moreover, although the “uncomplexed” forms appear to be more in the cytoplasm, from our current data we cannot conclude that homomerization is facilitated in this compartment since the uncomplexed form may not be in a homomeric state and may be in a heteromeric complex with another cytoplasmic component (Fig.7). In addition, the stability and/or the extent of homomerization of different isoforms may also be different.Apart from nuclear translocation, which both homomeric and heteromeric complexes can potentially undergo, we surmised that perhaps heteromeric complexes can mediate differential gene regulation. Consistent with our expectations, we observed that different combinations of isoforms activate different reporter genes to varying extents. Thus, although the Δ+α heteromeric combination activates the Vβ basal promoter 2-fold better than either of the individual isoforms, the same combination was 20% less effective than the Δ- and marginally more effective than the α-isoform in mediating signal-induced activation of the c-fos promoter. Because TFII-I is downstream of a variety of extracellular signals (7Novina C.D. Kumar S. Bajpai U. Cheriyath V. Zang K. Pillai S. Wortis H.H. Roy A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5014-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), an obvious possibility raised by our result is that the different complexes or subcomplexes mediate different signals and, consequently, activate different sets of genes (Fig. 6). It is also likely that complex formation may modulate the amplitude or duration of the signals via differential phosphorylation of the isoforms, although we have not yet assessed the phosphorylation status of the isoforms in the complex in response to distinct signals. Such a mechanism to regulate nuclear import and subsequent function has been described for a variety of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 27Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Might there be different subcomplexes in different cell types or species? We believe so. The α-isoform is not predicted to be expressed in mouse cells (28Wang Y.K. Perez-Juardo L.A. Francke U. Genomics. 1998; 48: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and by Western blot analysis we do not see the existence of the α-isoform in mouse cell lines (data not shown). Thus, in addition to differential regulation of genes in a given cell type, complex formation by TFII-I isoforms might also mediate cell type or species-specific gene regulation. Further analysis is under way to resolve these issues. The signals generated outside a cell are transduced to the nucleus through a series of complicated biochemical steps, ultimately resulting in spatial and/or temporal activation of specific sets of genes.

https://openalex.org/W2133486542,"The Dbl family guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho GTPases share the structural array of a Dbl homology (DH) domain in tandem with a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. For oncogenic Dbl, the DH domain is responsible for the GEF activity, and the DH-PH module constitutes the minimum structural unit required for cellular transformation. To understand the structure-function relationship of the DH domain, we have investigated the role of specific residues of the DH domain of Dbl in interaction with Rho GTPases and in Dbl-induced transformation. Alanine substitution mutagenesis identified a panel of DH mutants made in the α1, α6, and α9 regions and the PH junction site that suffer complete or partial loss of GEF activity toward Cdc42 and RhoA. Kinetic and binding analysis of these mutants revealed that although most displayed decreased <i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub> values in the GEF reaction, the substrate binding activities of T506A and R634A were significantly reduced. E502A, Q633A, and N673A/D674A, on the other hand, retained the binding capability to the Rho GTPases but lost the GEF catalytic activity. In general, the <i>in vitro</i> GEF activity of the DH mutants correlated with the <i>in vivo</i> Cdc42- and RhoA-activating potential, and the GEF catalytic efficiency mirrored the transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, the N673A/D674A mutant exhibited a potent dominant-negative effect on serum-induced cell growth and caused retraction of actin structures. These studies identify important sites of the DH domain involved in binding or catalysis of Rho proteins and demonstrate that maintaining a threshold of GEF catalytic activity, in addition to the Rho GTPase binding activity, is essential for efficient transformation by oncogenic Dbl."

Here we identify sites within the striated muscle glycogen-binding subunit (GM) that mediate direct binding to glycogen synthase. Both PP1C and glycogen synthase were coimmunoprecipitated with a full-length FLAG-tagged GM transiently expressed in COS7 cells or C2C12 myotubes. Deletion and mutational analysis of a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion of the N-terminal domain of GM (residues 1–240) identified two putative sites for binding to glycogen synthase, one of which is the WXNXGXNYX(I/L) motif that is conserved among the family of PP1 glycogen-binding subunits. Either deletion of this motif or Ala substitution of Asn-228 in this motif disrupted the binding of glycogen synthase. Expression of full-length FLAG-GM in cells increased the activity of endogenous glycogen synthase, but protein disabled in either PP1 binding or glycogen synthase binding did not produce synthase activation. The results show that efficient activation of glycogen synthase requires a scaffold function of GM that involves simultaneous binding of both PP1C and glycogen synthase. Isoproterenol and forskolin treatment of cells decreased glycogen synthase binding to FLAG-GM, thereby limiting synthase activation by PP1. This response was insensitive to inhibition by H-89, therefore probably not involving cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but did require inclusion of microcystin-LR during cell lysis, implying that phosphorylation was modulating binding of glycogen synthase. Phosphorylation control of binding to a scaffold site on the GM subunit of PP1 offers a new mechanism for regulation of muscle glycogen synthase in response to β-adrenergic signals.

Currently, it is thought that the individual functions are achieved by interaction of the PP1 catalytic subunit with various targeting/regulatory subunits. These subunits determine the subcellular location of subpopulations of the catalytic subunit of PP1. The first PP1 targeting subunit identified was the muscle glycogen-binding subunit, called GM or RGl, which tethers PP1 to glycogen particles and the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal and cardiac muscle (3Hubbard M.J.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Recent studies identified separate domains in GM for interaction with PP1 and glycogen (5Wu J. Liu J. Thompson I. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser-67 in the PP1 binding motif (RVSF) has been shown to prevent PP1 binding to GM (6Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), providing a mechanism by which the phosphatase would respond to β-adrenergic hormones such as adrenaline. Since the discovery of GM, several additional members of this protein family have been identified and cloned. Among these are the yeast homologue, GAC1 (8François J.M. Thompson-Jaeger S. Skroch J. Zellenka U. Spevak W. Tatchell K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and a liver protein, GL (9Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which show significant sequence identity with the N-terminal region of GM. A search of the expressed sequence-tagged cDNA data base identified PPP1R5 (10Doherty M.J. Young P.R. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and PPP1R6 (11Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid screen of cDNA libraries using PP1C as the bait identified another two glycogen-binding proteins, U5 (12Hirano K. Hirano M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and PTG (13Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). PTG is nearly identical to PPP1R5 and is expressed abundantly in insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and differentiated adipocytes (13Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition to associating with PP1 and glycogen, PTG functions as a scaffold that binds glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (13Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the substrates for PP1 in the glycogen particles. This raises the possibility that other members of the PP1 glycogen-binding subunit family also fulfill a scaffolding role by directly interacting with PP1 substrates. Sequence comparison of six eucaryotic glycogen-binding subunits of PP1 and two yeast glycogen synthase-binding proteins, Pig1p and Pig2p (14Cheng C. Huang D. Roach P.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), revealed two regions of conserved sequence. One is a VXNXXFEKXV motif that we found directly involved in glycogen binding (5Wu J. Liu J. Thompson I. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The other is a region of 15 residues with conserved residues Trp, Asn, Gly, Asn, Tyr, and Leu/Ile that we designate as the WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif. However, no experimental evidence for a function for this motif is available. In this study, we examined the binding of glycogen synthase with deletion and point mutants of GM and identified specific regions in GM that interact with glycogen synthase. Ala substitution of residues in the WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif showed that substitution of Asn-228 impaired glycogen synthase binding but did not alter PP1 binding. Expression of GM mutants deficient in either glycogen synthase binding or PP1 binding failed to activate glycogen synthase in cells, compared with wild type GM, suggesting that GM interaction with both PP1 and glycogen synthase is required for activation of glycogen synthase. Furthermore, stimulation of cells with forskolin and isoproterenol decreased the binding of glycogen synthase to wild type GM but in a PKA-independent manner. Results obtained with various mutated forms of GM suggest that the effects are mediated through change in phosphorylation of glycogen synthase, exposing a new mechanism for regulation by β-adrenergic signals in muscle. Tissue culture reagents and the kit for reverse-transcription (Preamplification System for first strand cDNA synthesis) were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). pGEX vectors and glutathione-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ).

GM antisera were generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant GST-GM-(1–240) 2The numbers in parenthesis indicate the residues of rabbit GM that were fused to GST. fusion protein. Restriction enzymes were from Promega Life Science (Madison, WI). All the oligonucleotides were synthesized by ITD (Coralville, IA). Rabbit cDNA encoding GM-(1–240) was cloned and inserted into pGEX4T2 vector to produce recombinant GST-GM-(1–240) fusion protein as described before (15Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GM-(1–240) fragment was then subcloned into pCDNA3/F2 mammalian expression vector byBamHI/EcoRI double digestion to produce FLAG-tagged GM-(1–240) protein. The entire coding sequence of rabbit GM was cloned into pGEX-4T2 and pCDNA3/F2 vectors by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and subcloning methods as described previously (16Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of GM and point mutations in GM-(1–240) were made using the polymerase chain reaction method described elsewhere (15Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,16Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Point mutations in full-length GM were made by using a Quick-Change Mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% new born calf serum. C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum until confluent, at which point differentiation was initiated by conversion to DMEM with 4% horse serum. Cell fusion was apparent after 48 h. COS7 cells were routinely deprived of serum for 15 h prior to treatment with pharmaceutical compounds using serum-free DMEM. C2C12 myotubes were serum-starved for 4 h in Krebs-Ringer buffer with 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.5 mm glucose. COS7 cells and C2C12 myoblasts in 60-mm dishes were grown to 50–60% confluency and transfected by FuGene reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Plasmid DNA was usually transiently transfected for 24 h in the complete medium. Although COS7 cells were then used for experiments, the confluent C2C12 myoblasts were induced to form myotubes by switching to DMEM with 4% horse serum for 48 h. This assay used 3 μg of GST-GM-(1–240) protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads to pull down glycogen synthase and PP1C from COS7 cell lysates prepared as described previously (15Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the pull down of purified glycogen synthase, 3 μg of GST-GM-(1–240) protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with glycogen synthase for 1 h at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The binding of glycogen synthase and PP1 was analyzed by anti-glycogen synthase and anti-PP1 immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE. Cell lysates were prepared by detergent solubilization in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 μmmicrocystin-LR, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer used for cells in 60-mm dishes. The resultant cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating 0.5 ml of cell lysate with 7 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the same lysis buffer and then subjected to 9% SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, proteins on the gel were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% non-fat milk. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate antibodies and washed as described previously (15Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Glycogen synthase activity was measured as described previously (17Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 35: 20801-20807Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar) with some modifications. After two washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, confluent COS7 cells (60-mm dishes) were scraped into 100 μl of lysis/glycogen synthase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors as above). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Then 50 μl of the cell lysate was added to an equal volume of glycogen synthase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 1 μm microcystin-LR) containing 10 mm UDP-[14C]glucose (0.15 μCi/μmol) and 15 mg/ml glycogen, in the presence or absence of 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, assay tubes were chilled on ice for 15 min. The entire contents of the tubes were spotted on a Whatman filter paper (GF/A; 2.4 cm), which was immediately immersed in 25 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol, mixed 1 h, then washed one more time with 25 ml of 70% ethanol for 30 min. Filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was counted with 5 ml of scintillation mixture. We linked glutathioneS-transferase (GST) to various regions of the N-terminal domain of GM (Fig.1 A), expressed the fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and purified them on glutathione-Sepharose. A “pull-down” assay was used to test for binding of glycogen synthase and PP1C from lysates of COS7 cells. The glycogen synthase and PP1C that bound to fusion proteins were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B). Both GST-GM-(1–240) and GST-GM-(51–240) interacted with glycogen synthase and PP1C, whereas GST alone bound neither enzyme and served as a negative control (not shown). The fusion protein GST-GM-(1–218), truncated at the C terminus of the 1–240 domain, bound PP1C but not glycogen synthase, indicating that the region 219–240 was required for glycogen synthase binding. On the other hand, a fusion protein without the RVSF motif, GST-GM-(77–240), failed to bind PP1C as expected but bound glycogen synthase the same as GST-GM-(1–240). Further truncation to GST-GM-(97–240) gave a protein that bound glycogen synthase to a much lesser extent, and with GST-GM-(118–240) there was no detectable glycogen synthase binding. Coomassie Blue staining showed that an equal amount of the GST fusion proteins was added (Fig. 1 B, lower panel), and the same amount of COS7 cell lysate protein was used in each assay. These observations suggested that binding of glycogen synthase involved two sites of interaction, at residues 219–240 and at 77–117 within the N-terminal domain of GM. In the 219–240 region of GM there is a WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif comprised of several residues conserved among the family of glycogen-binding subunits. This motif also appeared in PIG1 and PIG2, two yeast proteins discovered in a two-hybrid screen using glycogen synthase as bait (14Cheng C. Huang D. Roach P.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We substituted alanine for the conserved residues with the smallest side chains to produce three mutant forms of GST-GM-(1–240): N224A, G226A, and N228A. In the pull-down assay, wild type GST-GM-(1–240), GST-GM-(1–240)-N224A, and GST-GM-(1–240)-G226A all bound equal amounts of glycogen synthase, but binding was essentially lost with GST-GM-(1–240)-N228A (Fig.2 A, upper panel). The same amount of purified fusion protein was used in each assay, shown by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A,lower panel). None of the Ala substitutions reduced PP1C binding in this assay (Fig. 2 A, middle panel), suggesting that the overall conformation of the various fusion proteins was not perturbed. As further evidence of similar tertiary structure, the wild type GST-GM-(1–240) and the mutant GST-GM-(1–240)-N228A yielded the same fragments during partial digestion with trypsin with the same kinetics of production (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the loss of glycogen synthase binding by Aln-228 → Ala substitution could not simply be attributed to misfolding of the mutant protein. Moreover, no significant difference in glycogen synthase binding was detected (Fig. 2 A,upper panel) between wild type GST-GM-(1–240) and GST-GM-(1–240)-V150A/F155A, a double mutant that was shown previously to have reduced glycogen binding in a co-sedimentation assay (5Wu J. Liu J. Thompson I. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We concluded that glycogen synthase binding did not depend on glycogen binding to GM. Taken together, these results indicated that Asn-228 in the WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif played a critical role in glycogen synthase binding. Furthermore, different sites were used by GM to interact with glycogen, with PP1C, and with glycogen synthase. Besides using cell lysates as a source of glycogen synthase, we tested binding of purified skeletal muscle glycogen synthase to GST-GM-(1–240) to demonstrate a direct interaction between the proteins. Glycogen synthase was incubated with GST alone, GST-GM-(1–240), or GST-GM-(1–240)-N228A in the pull-down assay. Glycogen synthase bound GST-GM-(1–240) but did not bind to GST alone or GST-GM-(1–240)-N228A (Fig.3 A, upper panel). This result reinforced data with COS7 lysates as the source of glycogen synthase. Identical amounts of GST proteins were present in the samples, as seen in Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). Next, this pull-down assay was used to measure relative binding affinities by incubating different concentrations of glycogen synthase with GST alone, GST-GM-(1–240), or GST-GM-(1–240)-N228A. The relative amount of glycogen synthase bound was quantified by laser densitometry after immunoblotting. The amount of glycogen synthase specifically bound to GST-GM-(1–240) was corrected for background by subtracting the amount bound to GST alone and in densitometry by using exposures within the linear response range of the film. Although glycogen synthase bound GST-GM-(1–240) with aK 0.5 of 10–12 nm, GST-GM-(1–240)-N228A bound glycogen synthase in this assay with a K 0.5 of >40 nm (Fig.3 B). We concluded that the single substitution Asn-228 → Ala in GST-GM-(1–240) caused a 4-fold decrease in the apparent affinity for glycogen synthase. We expressed the FLAG-tagged GMN-terminal domain in COS7 cells and examined glycogen synthase coimmunoprecipitation, using the anti-FLAG antibodies and anti-glycogen synthase immunoblotting. Cells were transfected either with empty vector or with a vector encoding wild type FLAG-GM-(1–240), FLAG-GM-(1–218), or mutant FLAG-GM-(1–240)-N228A. All three forms of GMwere expressed at about the same levels, with similar recoveries by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (Fig.4 A, upper panel). Endogenous glycogen synthase was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-GM-(1–240) but not with FLAG-GM-(1–218) or FLAG-GM-(1–240)-N228A (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). All these fusion proteins bound PP1C, attesting to their conformational integrity (Fig. 4 A,lower panel). The results showed that the GM-(1–240) domain interacted with glycogen synthase in living cells and that the Asn-228 in the WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif was required. Transfected cells were lysed, and the glycogen synthase ± glucose 6-phosphate activity ratio was measured in the cell lysate. Cells not expressing the GM-(1–240) domain had a low basal activity ratio of glycogen synthase (0.031 ± 0.003), and this increased 2.6-fold by expression of FLAG-GM-(1–240) (Fig. 4 B). However, expression of either FLAG-GM-(1–218) or FLAG-GM-(1–240)-N228A had no significant effect on glycogen synthase activity (Fig. 4 B). The results showed that only forms of FLAG-GM-(1–240) that bound to glycogen synthase caused its activation. We also produced full-length (1109 residues) wild type FLAG-tagged GM(FLAG-GM-(1109)) and proteins mutated in either the PP1C-binding motif or the glycogen synthase-binding motif. FLAG-GM-(1109) and FLAG-GM-(1109)-S67T bound both glycogen synthase and PP1C, as detected by immunoblotting after anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (Fig.5 A, middle andlower panels). The mutant FLAG-GM-(1109)-N228A interacted with PP1C but not glycogen synthase, whereas FLAG-GM-(77–1109) and FLAG-GM-(1109)-S67A bound glycogen synthase but not PP1C (Fig. 5 A,middle and lower panels). Therefore, in intact cells interaction of FLAG-GM-(1109) with glycogen synthase was independent of PP1C binding. Glycogen synthase activity was measured in cells expressing various forms of FLAG-GM-(1109). Expression of the FLAG-GM-(1109) induced higher levels of glycogen synthase activity (± glucose 6-phosphate) than did the FLAG-GM-(1–240) (compare Fig. 4 B with 5B). This is the first hint of a functional effect of the large C-terminal region of GM (residues 241–1109) that is not conserved in other glycogen-binding subunits of PP1. Glycogen synthase activity was increased 5- to 6-fold in cells expressing either FLAG-GM-(1109) or FLAG-GM-(1109)-S67T (Fig.5 B). Expression of mutant proteins disabled in PP1C binding, such as FLAG-GM-(77–1109) and FLAG-GM-(1109)-S67A, or in glycogen synthase binding, such as FLAG-GM-(1109)-N228A had weak activating effects on glycogen synthase (Fig. 5 B). We concluded that FLAG-GM-(1109) acted as a molecular scaffold, interacting specifically with both glycogen synthase and PP1C to mediate the activation of glycogen synthase by dephosphorylation. We previously demonstrated that in living cells dissociation of PP1C from FLAG-GM-(1109) can be induced by forskolin (16Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a compound that promotes an increase in intracellular [cAMP], and consequently activates PKA. We stimulated COS7 cells transiently expressing FLAG-GM-(1109) with increasing concentrations of forskolin. There was near complete loss of PP1C binding at 1.5 and 15 μm doses of forskolin (Fig.6 A). By comparison, there was only a slight reduction in the amount of glycogen synthase bound to FLAG-GM-(1109) at 1.5 μm forskolin, and at 15 μm forskolin about was an approximate 50% decrease in the amount of glycogen synthase recovered by coimmunoprecipitation. In COS7 cells treated with isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist, binding of PP1C and glycogen synthase to FLAG-GM-(1109) was decreased by over 60% (Fig. 6 B). Similar results also were obtained with C2C12 myotubes, a skeletal muscle model cell line (Fig.6 C). However, the effect of isoproterenol on glycogen synthase binding and PP1C binding to FLAG-GM-(1109) was not evident unless the protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin-LR was added to the cell lysis buffer (Fig. 6 B). Our interpretation was that phosphorylation regulated glycogen synthase binding to FLAG-GM-(1109), and this phosphorylation could be readily reversed by the action of endogenous phosphatases present in the cell lysate. We wondered whether an increase in PKA activity was sufficient to reduce binding of glycogen synthase to FLAG-GM-(1109) in living cells. Treatment of COS7 cells with H-89, a specific and cell permeable PKA inhibitor, blocked the effects of forskolin on PP1C binding (Fig. 7 A). Presumably, the H-89 blocked PKA phosphorylation of Ser-67 in FLAG-GM-(1109). However, addition of H-89 to cells did not prevent reduction of glycogen synthase binding by forskolin. This implied that phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by PKA alone was not sufficient to disrupt association. Indeed, binding of purified glycogen synthase to GST-GM-(1–240) was unaffected by prior PKA phosphorylation of either of the proteins (data not shown). Similarly, addition of H-89 to cells failed to block isoproterenol reduction of glycogen synthase binding to FLAG-GM-(1109) (Fig.7 B). Treatment of cells with isoproterenol in the presence of propranolol, an β-adrenergic antagonist, partially restored both PP1C and glycogen synthase binding to FLAG-GM-(1109) (Fig.7 B). This showed that dissociation of glycogen synthase from FLAG-GM-(1109) involved signaling events downstream of β-adrenergic receptors, besides the activation of PKA. As shown in Fig. 8, FLAG-GM-(1109) and FLAG-GM-(1109)-S67T bound PP1C in COS7 cells. As expected (16Liu J. Wu J. Oliver C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. Biochem.

In contrast, no PP1C binding was seen with the FLAG-GM-(1109)-S67A and FLAG-GM-(77–1109). These four forms of FLAG-GM-(1109) all bound glycogen synthase the same in the absence of forskolin, regardless of the co-association of PP1C. Treatment of cells with forskolin resulted in a pronounced decrease in glycogen synthase binding to all of these FLAG-GM proteins. The FLAG-GM-(77–1109) lacks all of the known sites of GM phosphorylation, therefore, forskolin probably reduced binding by phosphorylation of the glycogen synthase.Figure 8Forskolin effects on glycogen synthase association with wild type and mutated FLAG-GM-(1109).COS7 cells were transfected with different forms of FLAG-GMas indicated. Cells were serum-starved and treated with or without 15 μm forskolin for 30 min. Cell lysates were prepared, and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed.

Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 24Strålfors P. Hiraga A. Cohen P. Eur. J.

The GM:PP1C heterodimer is reported to be many times more active than monomeric PP1C toward three of the key enzymes of glycogen metabolism; glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (25Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The enhanced phosphatase activity was attributed to a lowerK m , due to the association of both GMand substrates with glycogen (3Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). However, studies in yeast with Gac1p and Pig1p suggested that besides association with glycogen, there were direct interactions of these PP1 targeting subunits with substrates such as Gsy2, a major form of glycogen synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14Cheng C. Huang D. Roach P.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTG was discovered as another mammalian glycogen-binding subunit of PP1 and was shown to directly bind the PP1 substrates, glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (13Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Based on these reports we predicted that other members of the family of mammalian PP1 glycogen-binding subunits, specifically GM, would directly bind enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism to promote reaction with PP1C. Here we present evidence that GM does simultaneously associate with PP1C and glycogen synthase, even in the absence of glycogen. The glycogen interaction motif (VXNXXFEKXV) in GM does not appear to be involved in the association with glycogen synthase, because the double mutant (V150A/F155A) that did not bind glycogen (5Wu J. Liu J. Thompson I. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) nonetheless did bind glycogen synthase to the same extent as the wild type protein. The other family members PTG and GL bind glycogen phosphorylase (13Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 26Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, in pull-down assays with 32P-labeled phosphorylasea and GST-GM-(1–240) we did not observe a specific interaction (not shown). Sequence comparison shows that the phosphorylase a-binding domain in GL is not conserved in GM (9Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Armstrong C.G. Doherty M.J. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Direct binding of phosphorylasea may be an important difference between GM and family members such as GL and PTG/R5. We propose that high affinity binding of glycogen synthase to GM is generated by the interaction of glycogen synthase with two sites (residues 77–118 and 219–240). Truncation of either site caused a loss of glycogen synthase binding in a GST pull-down assay. Our study demonstrated that the 219–240 region of GM, containing the WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif, was required for glycogen synthase binding. Interestingly, a single Ala substitution of Asn-228 in this motif also was sufficient to prevent binding of glycogen synthase to GM. This leads us to suggest that the WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif is the primary or dominant site for interaction. Sequence alignment showed that the WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif was highly conserved among the glycogen-targeting subunits and the yeast glycogen synthase binding proteins, PIG1 and PIG2 (14Cheng C. Huang D. Roach P.J. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, this motif alone does not seem sufficient for glycogen synthase binding, because a protein with the 219–240 sequence fused to GST did not bind glycogen synthase (results not shown). Recently, a structural model for the N-terminal domain of GM has been proposed, based on homology to the microbial enzyme xylose isomerase, which has an (α/β)8 barrel structure (27Souchet M. Legave M.-N. Jullian N. Bertrand H.-O. Bril A. Berrebi-bertrand I. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The model has an extended loop with RVSF for binding PP1C and a surface helix with the VFV residues exposed for binding to glycogen. Our proposed sites for interaction with glycogen synthase would lie in the spacer between putative helices β6 and α6 (the WXNXGXNYX(L/I) motif) and a segment between helices α2 and α3 that includes beta sheet β3 (residues 77–118). It appears that these two sites are on one side of the structure, opposite from the site for interaction with glycogen and separate from the loop for binding to PP1C. Our data show that PP1C and glycogen synthase both must bind to GM in order for GM to mediate activation of glycogen synthase. Thus, GM enhances PP1 activity toward glycogen synthase by recruiting PP1C and glycogen synthase into the same protein complex via direct binding. This may also involve conformational changes in the catalytic subunit and/or the substrate to induce or favor dephosphorylation. In this instance the scaffold subunit (GM) would function as an allosteric activator. We pose the hypothesis that direct binding of substrates to targeting subunits may be a common mechanism to enhance substrate specificity of the PP1 catalytic subunit in vivo. Another example is the smooth muscle myosin phosphatase targeting subunit that interacts with myosin directly, and two different regions in the myosin-targeting subunit were reported to be responsible for myosin binding (28Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara K. Ichikawa S. Okuob T. Konishi M. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Johnson D.F. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These interactions enhance specificity of PP1C for myosin light chain as substrate. Many new PP1 targeting/regulatory subunits have been identified, but the physiological substrates for these PP1 holoenzymes are not yet defined. It will be important to define whether specific cellular phosphoproteins associate with each of these subunits. If so, then identifying and mapping the substrate binding sites on the PP1 subunits like we have done here will advance our understanding of how the specificity and activity of PP1 is regulated in cells. We imagine that, because we observed loss of function with a single residue substitution (N228A), pharmacological compounds could specifically target and disrupt the interactions between a substrate and a regulatory subunit (e.g. glycogen synthase and GM). This would provide a way of selectively altering the state of phosphorylation, and hence the activity, of particular PP1 substrates. Our results also expose a novel mechanism for glycogen synthase inactivation by β-adrenergic signals. We provide evidence that β-adrenergic signaling or elevation of [cAMP] by forskolin diminished glycogen synthase binding to GM. Microcystin was required in the lysates, implying that a phosphorylation accounted for the change and there was a rapid dephosphorylation by phosphatases of the PP1/PP2A family. Glycogen synthase dissociation from GMseemed to be induced by phosphorylation of glycogen synthase that was cAMP-dependent, but resistant to inhibitors of PKA. Previous studies suggested that phosphorylation and inactivation of muscle glycogen synthase by β-adrenergic hormones involved PKA (30Dietz M.R. Chiasson J.L. Soderling T.R. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2301-2307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Picton C. Woodgett J. Hemmings B. Cohen P.

Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, another report showed that Ser-10 of muscle glycogen synthase, not a PKA site, increased from 0.12 mol/mol to 0.54 mol/molin vivo in response to adrenaline (38Nakielny S. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation of Ser-7 by phosphorylase kinase, phosphorylation of Ser-10 by casein kinase I further inhibited glycogen synthase activity by over 2.5-fold (38Nakielny S. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the activity of casein kinase 1 was unaffected by adrenaline in vivo or by incubation with PKA and MgATP in vitro. Nonetheless, one possibility is that glycogen synthase affinity for GM is modulated by phosphorylation of Ser-10 by kinase(s) other than PKA. Although cAMP exerts many or most of its effects through PKA, cAMP also has some PKA-independent actions, including binding directly to cardiac pacemaker and other ion channels and to Rap1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (34de Rooij J.

It has been reported recently that mitogenic signals initiated by cAMP regulate PKB and membrane ruffling in a PKA-independent manner (37Cass L.A. Summers S.A. Prendergast G.V. Backer J.M. Birnbaum M.J. Meinkoth J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5882-5891Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Determining the site of phosphorylation in glycogen synthase that regulates affinity for GM and the kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation are important goals for future efforts. We propose that β-adrenergic signaling via cAMP, but not PKA, reduces glycogen synthase association with its targeting sites in GM that enhance PP1-mediated dephosphorylation. Reduced binding to GM would be a means to prolong the phosphorylation and low activity state of glycogen synthase. This mechanism adds another piece to the regulatory mosaic for glycogen synthase, in addition to the traditional multisite phosphorylation and allosteric binding of metabolite effectors. We thank Dr. John C. Lawrence, Jr. for the gift of purified glycogen synthase, antibodies to glycogen synthase, and for his valuable advice and suggestions.

Tissue specificity may be achieved by a combination of these various transcription factors together with a specialized chromatin structure. Chromatin is intimately related to the expression of eukaryotic genesin vitro and in vivo (8Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Nucleosome assembly over a promoter is implicated in establishing the repression of many inducible genes (9Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Hörz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 10Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 11Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although nucleosomes were often reported to globally repress transcription, the precise position of a nucleosome on a promoter can also improve transcriptional activation (12Lu Q. Wallrath L.L. Granok H. Elgin S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2802-2814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jackson J.R. Benyajati C.

Such a nucleosome, positioned in vitro on the promoter of the vitellogenin B1 gene in a region devoid of transcription factor-binding sites (between −300 and −140 relative to the start site of transcription), potentiates estrogen receptor-dependent transcriptional activation. We have suggested that the wrapping of DNA around the histone octamer allows a better interaction between the distal estrogen receptor and proximal trans-activators (such as HNF3 and CTF/NF1) and/or the basal transcription machinery (14Schild C. Claret F.X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HNF3 and NF1 are both able to modulate the position of a nucleosome (16McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S.

Since HNF3 and NF1 bind to the vitellogenin B1 promoter, they may have important roles in the assembly of this regulatory DNA into organized chromatin structure in vivo. In this study we have analyzed the interplay between the estrogen receptor and HNF3 on the vitellogenin B1 promoter within chromatin following microinjection into oocytes. We show that HNF3 induces DNase I hypersensitivity within the proximal regulatory elements concomitant to the activation of transcription. In addition, when expressed before chromatin assembly, HNF3 and the estrogen receptor activate transcription synergistically suggesting either that HNF3 establishes a chromatin structure favorable for subsequent association of the estrogen receptor binding or that they interact directly or through a common target. We have determined the positions of three nucleosomes over the vitellogenin B1 promoter in vitro. These nucleosomes do not interfere with ER and HNF3 recruitment and are not displaced. The pBS(−596/+8)VgB1 plasmid was obtained by subcloning the BamHI/RsaI fragment of pB1(−596/+8)CAT8+ (5Seiler-Tuyns A. Walker P. Martinez E. Mérillat A.-M. Givel F. Wahli W.

Biol. 1989; 9: 5548-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) into pBluescript KS−BamHI/EcoRV sites. The subcloned fragment contains the vitellogenin B1 (−598/+8) promoter sequence and about 0.1 kilobase of the CAT reporter gene. The mutated promoters were prepared as follows. The pB1noERE plasmid was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the pBS(−596/+8)VgB1 leading to the introduction of point mutations in all 3 EREs. The oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis are shown hereafter with the underlined mutated residues: (−338/−297) 5′-CTCCAGACACTGTGAACCAACCCAAGATATCATAACCTCTTA-3′; (−560/−539) 5′-TGGAGGGACACAGGGAACATGC-3′. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Additional EREs were also subcloned upstream of the TATA box to generate the construct pB1(6ERE). Briefly, 2 ERU oligos designed from the wild type promoter (position −337 to −300), which contains two imperfect EREs, were flanked byAvaI sites (top strand: 5′-TCGGGTCCAGTCACTGTGACCCAACCCAAGTTATCGTGACCTC-3′; bottom strand: 5′-CCCGAGAGGTCATGATAACTTGGGTTGGGTCACAGTGACTGG A-3′). The annealed oligonucleotides were multimerized and then introduced into theBglII site (position −41) of pBS(−596/+8)VgB1. This generated one construct with 1 ERU and 1 ERE. Since the wild type promoter already contains 3 EREs, the mutated promoter was named pB1(6ERE). The single stranded DNAs were prepared from phagemids induced with the VCS M13 helper phage (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmids used for in vitro mRNA transcription were prepared as follows. The xERα coding sequence was amplified from pKCR2xERα (22Weiler I.J. Lew D. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides generating XbaI and PstI sites. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was then introduced into the same sites of the plasmid pSP64(poly(A)) (Promega) to generate the xERpSP64(poly(A)) construct. rHNF3αpMS(II) plasmid was obtained after introduction of the SacI/HindIII fragment (from pRB-HNF3α, gift from K. S. Zaret) into the same sites of pMS(II) which is a modified version of pSP64(poly(A)) containing additional unique restriction sites after the poly(A) segment. 2M. Stolow, unpublished data. Constructs for in vitro mRNA synthesis were linearized either with EcoRI (xERpSP64(poly(A))) or with AvrII (rHNF3αpMS(II)). The mRNA in vitro synthesis was carried out with the SP6 mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion) according to the recommended procedure. The isolation procedure of Xenopus laevis oocytes was performed as described previously (23Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Stage VI oocytes were microinjected (13.8 nl) (Drummond nanoject) with the indicated amount of in vitro transcribed mRNA. After an overnight incubation in MBSH buffer (23Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) at 18 °C, the oocytes nuclei (GV) were microinjected with the pBS(−596/+8)VgB1 as ssDNA (1 ng). The oocytes were processed as described below generally after 6 h incubation at 18 °C. A group of 15 to 20 oocytes was collected per sample and homogenized in 10 μl/oocyte of 0.25 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. The equivalent of 10 oocytes was used for RNA purification and transcription analysis and the remaining 5 oocytes equivalent was used for DNA recovery. Total RNA was prepared from the homogenate using the RNazol™ method (Tel-Test Inc.). The RNazol™ reagent (500 μl) together with chloroform (50 μl) was added to the homogenate (100 μl) which was then incubated on ice for 15 min before centrifugation. The clear supernatant was then transferred to a fresh tube and precipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The washed RNA pellet (70% EtoH) was resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer and precipitated once again for at least 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of 10 m LiCl. The RNA pellet was then washed with 70% EtoH and dissolved in 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Half of the RNA sample (5 oocytes) was analyzed by primer extension. The RNA (10 μl) was supplemented with 10 μl of a first strand synthesis buffer (×2, provided by Life Technologies, Inc.), 5 mm dithiothreitol and end-labeled CAT-(5′-GGTGGTATATCCAGTGATTTTTTTCTCCAT-3′) and H4-(5′-GGCTTGGTGATGCCCTGGATGTTATCC-3′) primers (0.2 pmol each). The H4 primer is used as an internal control and detects the endogenous histone H4 mRNA. Annealing occurred for 10 min at 65 °C, 30 min at 55 °C, 20 min at 37 °C, and 5 min at room temperature. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42 °C upon addition of 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs and 100 units of the Superscript™ II RT (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was stopped after 1 h by ethanol precipitation. The extension products were resolved on a 8% sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography. DNA was recovered from the remaining 5 oocytes equivalents of the homogenate (see above). DNA recovery after injection is a control monitoring the microinjection efficiency. This DNA was also used for the supercoiling assay (see below). One volume of 1% SDS and 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, was added to the sample which was then treated for 2–3 h with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) at 55 °C. DNA was then extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and precipitated at room temperature with isopropyl alcohol. The washed DNA pellet (70% EtoH) was then dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer, treated with RNase A (100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and finally isopropyl alcohol precipitated. The recovered DNA was quantitatively analyzed by Southern blot as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots were then probed with random-primed labeled ssDNA from the vitellogenin B1 promoter. After injection, groups of 20 to 25 oocytes were collected and homogenized in 300 μl of digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). The homogenate was divided into three 100-μl fractions and digested for 1 min (room temperature) with, respectively, 160, 120, and 80 units of DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reactions were stopped with 2 volumes of 1% SDS and 20 mm EDTA and treated for 1 h at 37 °C with RNase A (100 μg/ml). The samples were then incubated with Proteinase K (200 μg/ml) for at least 3 h. DNA was finally purified as described above (see “Transcription Assay and DNA Recovery”). The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 1 × BamHI buffer and digested with 10 units of BamHI for 2 h (Life Technologies, Inc.). The samples were then once again extracted with phenol/chloroform and isopropyl alcohol precipitated. The DNA fragments were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel, blotted to a Zeta-probeTM GT membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with a random-primed labeled promoter fragment (−596/−445). As a control, free dsDNA (2 ng/oocyte) was mixed with non injected oocytes and treated immediately with DNase I under the same conditions as described above. The injected oocytes (20 per sample) were homogenized in 200 μl of MNase digestion buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 8% glycerol) and split into four tubes (50-μl aliquots). Increasing amounts of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) were added into the different aliquots (0.04, 0.2, 1, and 5 units) and digestion was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 volume of 1% SDS and 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. DNA was then purified according to the method described above (see “Transcription Assay and DNA Recovery”). The fragments following digestion were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel in 1 × TBE and blotted into a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as indicated (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membrane was then probed with a random-primed labeled probe corresponding to the vitellogenin B1 promoter (region −596/+139). The supercoiling assay was performed according to a method described earlier (24Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3419-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Generally, the equivalent of DNA recovered from one injected oocyte was loaded onto a 1.1% agarose gel in 1 × TPE buffer (40 mm Tris, 30 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm EDTA). Chloroquine (90 μg/ml) was included in the gel and in the running buffer. Under these conditions the different topoisomers will be positively supercoiled, reflecting the differences in negative supercoiling depending on the original variations in nucleosomes density on the minichromosomes. Electrophoresis was performed overnight in the dark at 3.5 V/cm. DNA was subsequently blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membrane was then probed with random-primed labeled ssDNA from the vitellogenin B1 promoter. Nucleosomes were reconstituted on radiolabeled DNA fragments by salt/urea dialysis as described earlier (25Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). After reconstitution, the oligonucleosome cores were loaded on 10–30% sucrose gradients and centrifuged for 24 h at 38,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Fractions were collected and analyzed in 0.5 × TBE nucleoprotein-agarose (0.7%) gels. Fractions containing trinucleosomes and above were pooled together, concentrated through a Microcon-30 (Amicon), dialized overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm β2-mercaptoethanol, and then concentrated to 20 μg/ml. Samples were stored at 4 °C until use. Chicken erythrocyte oligonucleosomes were prepared after removal of linker histone (26Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) and used as control for isolation of the native trinucleosome complexes. Reconstituted chromatin (100 ng of DNA) was digested with 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 units of MNase (Worthington) for 5 min at 22 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm CaCl2. Digestions were started by concomitant addition of MNase and CaCl2 and stopped by addition of 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K. After phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation, the recovered DNA was 5′ end-labeled with [γ−32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. End-labeled fragments were separated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. DNA fragments of nucleosome core and chromatosome products were recovered and digested with restriction enzymes to determine microccoccal nuclease cleavage sites. The digestions were analyzed on 8% denaturing gel. Recombinant HNF3α was purified by affinity chromatography from SF9 cells infected with an HNF3 recombinant baculovirus generated by the BaculoGold kit (Pharmingen). Purified hER was purchased at Panvera. Binding reactions were performed in a 15-μl final volume of 1 × binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) with 100 fmol of labeled DNA and 300 fmol of HNF3α or hER. Protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 0.25 × TBE nondenaturing agarose gel. Binding reactions were performed as described above, except that poly(dI-dC) was omitted in the binding buffer. DNase I digestions were carried out at a final MgCl2 concentration of 2.5 mm. Naked DNA was treated with 1 unit/ml DNase I for 20 s and reconstituted DNA with 10 units/ml for 40 s. Reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 10 mm and phenol/chloroform extraction. Footprints were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. For these experiments,Escherichia coli expressed and purified HNF3 was kindly provided by Dr. K. Zaret. The estrogen receptor is only one of several transcription factors that regulate vitellogenin B1 gene expression. The basal promoter element (BPE, region −119/−32) encompasses multiple binding sites for liver-enriched factors like HNF3 and C/EBP and for the ubiquitous CTF/NF1 (Fig.1 A) (7Cardinaux J.-R. Chapel S. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32947-32956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of these proteins has been already analyzed in vitro or by transient transfection (20Corthésy B. Cardinaux J.-R. Claret F.-X. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5548-5562Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Chang T. Shapiro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8176-8182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these assays provide limited insights on how these transcription factors might function within chromatin. We have therefore decided to take advantage of theXenopus oocyte microinjection system to examine this issue. Microinjection of DNA into the nucleus of Xenopus leads to chromatin assembly (23Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) which has been shown to influence the transcriptional regulation of the Xenopus HSP70 and TRβ promoters (11Wong J. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 28Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Oocytes also provide an efficient translational machinery which allows the study of the regulation of a given promoter by expressing specific transcription factors (29Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3158-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 30Wong J. Patterton D., A., I. Gushin D. Shi Y.-B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 520-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) by injecting mRNA encoding these components either before or after chromatin assembly. The capacity of the intact ERα to activate transcription was tested after injection of a CAT reporter template fused to the vitellogenin B1 promoter (−596/+8), which contains three EREs (Fig.1 A). Since chromatin assembly occurs with more rapid kinetics on microinjected ssDNA during second strand synthesis in comparison to the injection of dsDNA (23Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we made use a of ssDNA template. The ssDNA was injected after the expression of ERα, meaning that the receptor was present during chromatin assembly. In contrast to an ealier report (31Watson C.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 38: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) we find that the exogenous ERα activates transcription in injected oocytes (Fig. 1 B, comparelane 1 to lanes 3 and 4). In this particular experiment the addition of 17-β-estradiol (E2) did not stimulate transcription further (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). This is not surprising since mature oocytes already contain enough endogenous estradiol to ensure receptor activity (32Fortune J.E. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33McKenzie E.A. Cridland N.A. Knowland J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ligand-independent activation may be obtained through the receptor AF-1 activation domain (34Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) or through the interaction with other proteins such as cyclin D1 (35Neuman E. Ladha M.H. Lin N. Upton T.M. Miller S.J. DiRenzo J. Pestell R.G. Hinds P.W. Dowdy S.F. Brown M. Ewen M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5338-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 36Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In few other experiments, a modest additional 2-fold stimulation by exogenous estrogen was observed reflecting probable variations among oocytes batches. The liver-enriched transcription factor HNF3 has multiple binding sites on the proximal region of vitellogenin B1 promoter (Fig. 1 A) (7Cardinaux J.-R. Chapel S. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32947-32956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One site lies just downstream of the nucleosome positioning sequence (14Schild C. Claret F.X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). HNF3 (37Lai E. Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) significantly stimulates transcription when synthesized before chromatin assembly (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and6). Co-injection of both HNF3 and ERα before chromatin assembly resulted in the strongest activity observed indicating that they might cooperate to facilitate transcription (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7 and 8). This demonstrates that the assembly of the promoter into chromatin does not prevent its capacity to regulate transcription. Several lines of evidence from previous studies have suggested that NF1 somehow influences the activity of a chromatin template when the transcription factor is present during chromatin assembly. Depletion of an NF1-like activity reduces transcription by 5-fold from the vitellogenin B1 promoter during the assembly of chromatin inXenopus oocyte extract (38Corthésy B. Léonnard P. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3926-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, the CTF/NF1 proline-rich activation domain was shown to interact with the core histone H3 in yeast and mammalian cells in response to transforming growth factor β (18Alevizopoulos A. Dusserre Y. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. von der Weid T. Wahli W. Mermod N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3051-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one NF1 DNA binding element is located downstream of the positioned nucleosome in the vitellogenin B1 promoter (Fig. 1 A). NF1 cannot interact in vitrowith nucleosomal DNA over the murine mammary tumor virus promoter regardless of its binding site orientation and position (39Blomquist P. Li Q. Wrange O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was therefore important to test NF1 ability to affect transcription when expressed either before or after chromatin assembly. In our microinjection assay, however, expression of NF1 had no effect on transcription in the oocyte nucleus (data not shown). In summary, these results indicate that HNF3 and ERα are both competent to activate transcription from a chromatin template when present during or after chromatin assembly (Fig. 1 Band data not shown). The crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of HNF3 has striking similarities with the structured globular domain of the linker histone H5 (40Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 41Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Interestingly HNF3 can direct the assembly of a nucleosome on the serum albumin enhancer where it is able to replace the linker histone H1 in vivo (16McPherson C.E. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D.S. Zaret K.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Shim E.Y. Woodcock C. Zaret K.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Cirillo L.A. McPherson C.E. Bossard P. Stevens K. Cherian S. Shim E.Y. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Zaret K.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Its presence during chromatin assembly process might therefore modify the nucleosomal organization on the vitellogenin B1 promoter. This suggests either that the vitellogenin B1 promoter chromatin organization is already preset for activation or that HNF3 may participate in nucleosomes remodeling, directly or indirectly. We next tested the role of HNF3 in the organization of chromatin structure directly. DNase I-hypersensitive sites generally reflect the stable association of transcription factors with nucleosomal DNA. This increased accessibility also correlates with the activation of transcription. We have investigated DNase I accessibility to the vitellogenin B1 promoter upon expression of ERα and HNF3 during chromatin assembly (Fig.2). The vitellogenin B1 promoter is relatively resistant to DNase I digestion after injection as ssDNA into the Xenopus oocyte nuclei (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1–3 to free dsDNA which was mixed with non injected oocytes shortly before DNase I treatment,lanes 13–15). The expression of ERα leads to no major transition in DNase I cleavage. There is a very weak cleavage by DNase I upstream of the −300 region potentially reflecting a low efficiency of ERα association with the ERU (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6 and10–12). The strongest hypersensitive site is observed upon HNF3 expression and extends from the start site of transcription to the downstream boundary of the in vitro positioned nucleosome around −140 (Fig. 2,lanes 7–9) (14Schild C. Claret F.X. Wahli W. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We speculate that the presence of HNF3 leads to chromatin modification and facilitates the interaction of ERα with the ERU. Gene activation is often associated with an alteration or transition in chromatin structure. Such potential chromatin alterations on the vitellogenin B1 promoter were tested by monitoring DNA topology and micrococcal nuclease"
https://openalex.org/W2154166490,"Sorsby's fundus dystrophy (SFD) is a dominantly inherited degenerative disease of the retina that leads to loss of vision in middle age. It has been shown to be caused by mutations in the gene for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3). Five different mutations have previously been identified, all introducing an extra cysteine residue into exon 5 (which forms part of the C-terminal domain) of the TIMP-3 molecule; however, the significance of these mutations to the disease phenotype was unknown. In this report, we describe the expression of several of these mutated genes, together with a previously unreported novel TIMP-3 mutation from a family with SFD that results in truncation of most of the C-terminal domain of the molecule. Despite these differences, all of these molecules are expressed and exhibit characteristics of the normal protein, including inhibition of metalloproteinases and binding to the extracellular matrix. However, unlike wild-type TIMP-3, they all form dimers. These observations, together with the recent finding that expression of TIMP-3 is increased, rather than decreased, in eyes from patients with SFD, provides compelling evidence that dimerized TIMP-3 plays an active role in the disease process by accumulating in the eye. Increased expression of TIMP-3 is also observed in other degenerative retinal diseases, including the more severe forms of age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in the elderly in developed countries. We hypothesize that overexpression of TIMP-3 may prove to be a critical step in the progression of a variety of degenerative retinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2000760541,"Abstract Four L1210 murine leukemia cell lines resistant to 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate (DDATHF) and other folate analogs, but sensitive to continuous exposure to methotrexate, were developed by chemical mutagenesis followed by DDATHF selective pressure. Endogenous folate pools were modestly reduced but polyglutamate derivatives of DDATHF and ALIMTA (LY231514, MTA) were markedly decreased in these mutant cell lines. Membrane transport was not a factor in drug resistance; rather, folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity was decreased by >98%. In each cell line, FPGS mRNA expression was unchanged but both alleles of the FPGS gene bore a point mutation in highly conserved domains of the coding region. Four mutations were in the predicted ATP-, folate-, and/or glutamate-binding sites of FPGS, and two others were clustered in a peptide predicted to be β sheet 5, based on the crystal structure of theLactobacillus casei enzyme. Transfection of cDNAs for three mutant enzymes into FPGS-null Chinese hamster ovary cells restored a reduced level of clonal growth, whereas a T339I mutant supported growth at a level comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme. The two mutations predicted to be in β sheet 5, and one in the loop between NH2- and COOH-terminal domains did not support cell growth. When sets of mutated cDNAs were co-transfected into FPGS-null cells to mimic the genotype of drug-selected resistant cells, clonal growth was restored. These results demonstrate for the first time that single amino acid substitutions in several critical regions of FPGS can cause marked resistance to tetrahydrofolate antimetabolites, while still allowing cell survival."

Evidence is presented that release of the polysaccharide chains fromS. pneumoniae membranes is time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent and saturable with respect to specific catalytic metabolites. In these studies, the membrane-bound synthase was shown to catalyze a rapid release of enzyme-bound polysaccharide when either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA alone was present in the reaction. Only a slow release of polysaccharide occurred when both UDP sugars were present or when both UDP sugars were absent. Chain size was not a specific determinant in polymer release. The release reaction was saturable with increasing concentrations of UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA, with respective apparent K m values of 880 and 0.004 μm. The apparent V max was 48-fold greater with UDP-Glc compared with UDP-GlcUA. The UDP-Glc-actuated reaction was inhibited by UDP-GlcUA with an approximateK i of 2 μm, and UDP-GlcUA-actuated release was inhibited by UDP-Glc with an approximate K i of 5 μm. In conjunction with kinetic data regarding the polymerization reaction, these data indicate that UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA bind to the same synthase sites in both the biosynthetic reaction and the chain release reaction and that polymer release is catalyzed when one binding site is filled and the concentration of the conjugate UDP-precursor is insufficient to fill the other binding site.

Goebel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 139: 511-517Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and the antiphagocytic property of this polymer is essential in the virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The glucan backbone of type 3 polysaccharide is identical to that for hyaluronic acid; however, the overall structure differs in having the carboxyl groups on the 1–4-linked rather than the 1–3-linked glucosyl units, and there are no acetamido constituents. In vitro studies have shown that the biosynthesis of type 3 polysaccharide occurs by the alternate addition of Glc and GlcUA1from UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA (2Smith E.E.B. Mills G.T. Bernheimer H.P. Austrian R. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1876-1880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and work in our laboratory has recently demonstrated that growth of the polymer occurs at the nonreducing end (3Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has established that a single open reading frame (cps3S) encodes the protein that catalyzes the formation of the glycosidic linkages in the type 3 polysaccharide and that the predicted Cps3S protein has significant homology to a number of polysaccharide synthases which form polymers composed of β (1–4)linked repeating disaccharide units (4Dillard J.P.

Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Cps3S has been included as a member of a family of closely related, processive, β-glycosyltransferases (6Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C.

Tammi M. J. Biol.

Because no export system has been found to exist for type 3 polysaccharide or for most of the other polysaccharide members synthesized by this family of enzymes, it has been suggested that these enzymes catalyze the vectorial extrusion of the growing polysaccharide chain, possibly through a pore or channel (6Keenleyside W.J.

Models of polysaccharide biosynthesis that can explain the mechanism of chain termination and release have not been extensively investigated.

In the synthesis of hyaluronic acid in S. pyogenes, Sugahara et al.(13Sugahara K. Schwartz N.B. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6252-6261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that a trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was a precursor to a soluble fraction. The selective inhibition byp-chloromercuribenzoate of the soluble fraction prompted the suggestion that its release might be an enzymic process. However, there was no detectable difference in the molecular size of these two fractions. Prehm (14Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) noted that the omission of one obligatory assay component, such as MgCl2, UDP-GlcNAc, or UDP-GlcUA, resulted in a low but distinct shedding of pulse-labeled, mammalian hyaluronate chains. We previously showed that the release of type 3 polysaccharide chains from the membrane-enzyme complex was markedly stimulated when an excess of one UDP substrate was added at the point of depletion of the corresponding UDP sugar (3Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the catalytic nature of this polysaccharide release reaction. UDP-[14C]Glc (257 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Andotek, and UDP-[14C]GlcUA (338 mCi/mmol) was from ICN. Econo-Safe scintillation mixture was from Research Products International, Corp. Mutanolysin, Sephacryl S-500-HR, UDP-Glc, and UDP-GlcUA were purchased from Sigma, Nonidet P-40 was from Calbiochem, and Todd Hewitt Broth and yeast extract were from Difco. Protein was determined with the micro protein determination kit from Sigma. Paper chromatography was carried out on Whatman 3MM paper, and sugar standards were visualized on paper using p-anisidine-phthalate (15Zweig G. Whitaker J.R. Paper Chromatography and Electrophoresis. Academic Press, New York1967Google Scholar). Membranes containing type 3 synthase were isolated from the encapsulated WU2S. pneumoniae strain (16Briles D.E. Claflin J.L. Schroer K. Davie J. Baker P. Kearney J. Barletta R. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 153: 694-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) as described previously (3Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Membranes were stored at −80 °C in a solution containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and 10 mmsodium thioglycolate, at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. Type 3 synthase activity was determined as described previously (3Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MnCl2, 100 μm UDP-GlcUA, and 100 μm UDP-[14C]Glc (0.02 μCi) were incubated for 10 min at 35 °C with membranes containing 15 μg of protein. The products were separated by paper chromatography with a solvent containing ethanol (95%)/1 m ammonium acetate (pH 5.5), 65:35 (v/v), and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Membranes (1.2 mg of protein) were labeled with [14C]Glc in a reaction mixture consisting of 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MnCl2, 25 μm UDP-[14C]Glc (0.8 μCi), and 25 μm UDP-GlcUA in a total volume of 0.8 ml. The mixture was incubated for 5 min at 35 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 6.0 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 100 mmHepes (pH 7.5) and 10% glycerol. The membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were gently suspended with a loosely fitting teflon pestle in 1.0 ml of wash buffer for 2–3 s on a vortex mixer. The suspension was diluted to 6 ml with wash buffer, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The wash step was repeated a total of five times. Prior to the final centrifugation, the membranes were suspended in 1.0 ml of wash buffer, frozen, thawed, and then diluted to 6.0 ml with wash buffer. The final pellet was suspended in 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 10% glycerol at a protein concentration of 3.0 mg/ml. The extensive washing was required to remove all of the UDP-GlcUA, which apparently binds with high affinity to the membranes. After washing the membrane pellet five times, the recoveries of synthase activity and enzyme-bound labeled polysaccharide were 85–90% of the yields obtained prior to these washes. In addition, the chain length distribution of polysaccharides was not changed by the washing procedure. The labeled polysaccharide-synthase complex could be maintained in an active state for up to 2 months by storage at −80 °C. Polysaccharide substrate of different size chains was synthesized by controlling the nucleotide sugar concentration and the time of incorporation of [14C]Glc or [14C]GlcUA in the biosynthetic reaction. A lower molecular weight polysaccharide substrate complex was prepared as described above, except the reaction mixture contained 1.0 μm UDP-[14C]GlcUA and 25 μm UDP-Glc, and the time of incubation was 3 min. A higher molecular weight polysaccharide substrate complex was prepared as above except the reaction mixture contained 250 μmUDP-[14C]GlcUA and 250 μm UDP-Glc and the time of incubation was 25 min. [14C]Polysaccharide-synthase complex (20,000 cpm) was incubated at 35 °C in a 100-μl reaction mixture consisting of 100 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mmMnCl2, and either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA as indicated. The reaction was terminated by placing the reaction tubes on ice and adding 2 volumes of ice-cold buffer containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 10% glycerol. The membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were saved, and the pellets were solubilized in 300 μl of a solution containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The radioactivity in both the supernatant and pellet fractions was determined by scintillation counting, and the activity was expressed as the percentage of the total radioactivity found in the supernatant. Depolymerase was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation from the culture medium of Bacillus circulans (American Type Culture Collection 14175), as described previously (17Torriani A. Pappenheimer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ammonium sulfate precipitate was dissolved in 0.033 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) at a protein concentration of 1.9 mg/ml. Labeled polysaccharide (10,000 cpm) was digested for 1 h at 34 °C with depolymerase (2 μg of protein) in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Mes (pH 6.0) and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The digest was then heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The products were analyzed by chromatography on Sephacryl S-500 as described below and by paper chromatography in solvents of butanol/pyridine/H2O (44:16:40 v/v/v), and ethanol (95%)/1m ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) (7:3 v/v). The radioactivity present in 1-cm strips was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Both unlabeled and 14C-labeled polysaccharide membranes (600 μg) were suspended in 200 μl of 0.1 mHepes (pH 6.0) and incubated with 2 μg of depolymerase at 34 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 3.4 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.5) and 10% glycerol, and the membranes were collected by sedimentation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The membranes were washed two more times in the same manner. The labeled membranes were suspended in 100 μl of the wash buffer and stored at −80 °C. The unlabeled membranes were suspended in a standard reaction mixture, and the polysaccharides were then labeled as described under “Preparation of [14C]Polysaccharide-Synthase Complex.” Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a 1.4 × 37-cm column of Sephacryl S-500 eluted with a solution consisting of 5 mmTris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% sodium azide at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. Prior to application to the column, polysaccharide samples were solubilized with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, heated to 100 °C for 3 min, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Column fractions of 1.0 ml were collected, and 0.33-ml aliquots were mixed with 3.0 ml of scintillation fluid for determination of radioactivity. To explore the mechanism of chain termination and release, we first prepared a membrane fraction containing labeled polysaccharide-synthase complex by incorporating [14C]Glc from UDP-[14C]Glc in the presence of UDP-GlcUA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.1, the labeled membranes were free of contaminating radioactive nucleotide, and the product was degraded by digestion with type 3 polysaccharide-specific depolymerase fromB. circulans, thus confirming the identity of the polysaccharide (17Torriani A. Pappenheimer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the labeled polysaccharide-synthase membranes in a biosynthetic reaction mixture containing 250 μm UDP-Glc and 250 μm UDP-GlcUA chased the radioactivity into a higher molecular weight product that eluted near the void volume of a Sephacryl S-500 column (Fig. 1). Elongation of the polysaccharide demonstrated that the 14C-labeled chain was still engaged with the active site of the enzyme and that the synthase was still active and able to extend the polymer. Incubation of the [14C]polysaccharide-synthase membranes in the presence of either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA alone resulted in rapid release of the polysaccharide from the membranes into the supernatant (Fig.2). The rate of release was more rapid in the presence of UDP-Glc alone and was linear for 5 min. Release actuated by UDP-GlcUA was linear for up to 10 min. Only a very slow release occurred in the absence of both nucleotide sugars. A slow rate of polymer release was also observed when both nucleotide sugars were present, a condition that supports rapid synthesis of the polysaccharide (3Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Release of polysaccharide in the presence of UDP-Glc was dependent on MnCl2 or MgCl2, whereas release by UDP-GlcUA was not (shown in Table I for MnCl2). In the absence of divalent cation, similar levels of release were observed when both UDP sugars were present or with UDP-GlcUA alone, again indicating a metal ion requirement for UDP-Glc (Table I). UDP-xylose also actuated polysaccharide release in the presence of divalent cation. UDP-xylose did not, however, support synthase activity in combination with UDP-GlcUA, and it inhibited the biosynthetic reaction when both UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA were present (data not shown). The presence of UDP did not result in significant release, and the addition of 50 μm UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Gal, or ADP-Glc resulted in no more release than with UDP (data not shown).Table INucleotide specificity and metal ion requirement of polysaccharide releaseAdditionPolysaccharide releasedNo MnCl2+ MnCl2cpm%cpm%None101656234UDP-Glc921510,10753UDP-GlcUA616530524025UDP-Glc + UDP-GlcUA43672315948UDP1197614488UDP-Xyl952510,56055Labeled polysaccharide-synthase complex (20,000 cpm) was incubated for 10 min at 35 °C in a reaction mixture containing a 50 μm concentration of the indicated nucleotide, 0.1m Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 10 mmMnCl2, as indicated. The polysaccharide released from the membranes was separated by centrifugation and quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Labeled polysaccharide-synthase complex (20,000 cpm) was incubated for 10 min at 35 °C in a reaction mixture containing a 50 μm concentration of the indicated nucleotide, 0.1m Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 10 mmMnCl2, as indicated. The polysaccharide released from the membranes was separated by centrifugation and quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of pH on the release reaction is shown in Fig.3. Polysaccharide release actuated by UDP-Glc was optimal at pH 7.0 in Hepes buffer. UDP-GlcUA-actuated release was inhibited in Hepes buffer when the pH was less than 8.0, and the optimal pH for this reaction was 7.5 in imidazole buffer as shown. The pH profile for the UDP-GlcUA reaction in Tricine buffer was similar to that for imidazole (data not shown). Both imidazole and Tricine buffers inhibited the UDP-Glc-actuated reaction when the pH was above 6.0. A number of different buffers were tested, and none provided optimum conditions for both reactions at their optimal pH. The determinations of all catalytic constants for a direct comparison of both the release reaction and the polymerization reaction were therefore carried out at pH 8.0 in Hepes buffer. To assess the effect of chain size on polysaccharide release, synthase complex consisting of either high or low molecular weight polysaccharide was synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The size of the chains was analyzed by chromatography on Sephacryl S-500, following solubilization of the synthase complex with detergent. The low molecular weight chains were included in the column bed and gave a broad profile (Fig.4 A), whereas the high molecular weight sample eluted near the excluded column volume (Fig.4 B). The gel filtration profiles of the polymer released by UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA were similar to the initial polysaccharide profiles, indicating that the release reaction shows no specificity for polysaccharide size. Although both low and high molecular weight chains were readily released, the initial release of the smaller size polymer was more rapid (Fig. 5). To further assess the significance of the chain size in the release reaction, the activation energies of release were determined with low and high molecular weight polysaccharide chains. The Arrhenius plots of the release activity with UDP-GlcUA were linear between 15 and 35 °C for the low and between 20 and 40 °C for the high molecular weight chains. The essentially identical approximate activation energies of 29 and 28 kcal/l mol, respectively, indicate that the synthase is nonspecific with regard to polysaccharide chain size. However, at any given temperature, the rate of release was more rapid with smaller polymer, demonstrating that the more rapid release with the smaller chains was a thermal property of the reaction.Figure 5Effect of chain size on the rate of polysaccharide release. Low (●) and high (○) molecular weight polysaccharide-synthase preparations were incubated with either UDP-Glc (A) or UDP-GlcUA (B), as described in the legend to Fig. 4. At the indicated times, the reactions were terminated, and the amount of released polysaccharide was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the above experiments, complete release of the polysaccharide was not observed, even at higher concentrations of nucleotide sugar (data not shown). Therefore, a possible additive release by the sequential addition of UDP sugars was investigated. Polysaccharide-enzyme complex was first incubated with either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA for 20 min as in Fig. 2, resulting in 54 and 40% release, respectively, of the polysaccharide into the supernatant. After washing to remove the first nucleotide sugar, incubation of the membranes with the same or the alternative UDP sugar resulted in no more than 8% additional release over that observed with the control membranes (data not shown). Depolymerase digestion of the synthase complex was employed to explore the possibility that some of the polysaccharide chains might be entangled at their reducing ends or anchored to the membranes, thereby preventing their free release. Labeled polysaccharide membranes were prepared by: (a) the standard protocol; (b) the standard protocol followed by depolymerase digestion; or (c) depolymerase digestion followed by the standard labeling protocol. The depolymerase digestion removed 67% of the radioactivity from the labeled polysaccharide chains. Longer digestions did not significantly reduce the amount of membrane-bound radioactivity, indicating that all the accessible length of the chains had been cleaved. Incubation of the membrane preparations for 20 min with 100 μm UDP-Glc resulted in 34, 56, and 34% release, respectively, for preparationsa, b, and c. Thus, depolymerase treatment still did not allow complete release of the polysaccharide. The effect of the concentration of UDP-Glc on the initial rate of polysaccharide release is shown in Fig. 6 A. The plot exhibited typical hyperbolic kinetics, the double reciprocal plot was linear, and the apparent K m value was 880 μm. Release of polysaccharide as a function of the concentration of UDP-GlcUA also exhibited hyperbolic kinetics (Fig. 6 B), and the apparent K m value was 0.004 μm. The apparent V max value for UDP-Glc release was 48-fold greater than that for UDP-GlcUA, indicating that the release mechanism is much more readily facilitated by saturating levels of UDP-Glc. Polysaccharide release was inhibited by increasing the concentration of one UDP sugar in the presence of a fixed level of the conjugate UDP sugar (Fig. 7). UDP-Glc inhibited release actuated by UDP-GlcUA, with an approximate K i of 5 μm. UDP-GlcUA inhibited release actuated by UDP-Glc, with an approximate K i of 2 μm. It is noteworthy that these values are very similar to the respective apparentK m values of 12 and 9 μm that we previously reported for UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA in the biosynthesis of type 3 polysaccharide (3Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The polysaccharide release reaction was markedly temperaturedependent. Below 15 °C there was no significant activity, but above this temperature the activity increased rapidly up to 40 °C. Arrhenius plots of the release activity were linear between 20 and 40 °C and approximate activation energies of 32 and 28 kcal/mol were calculated for the release reactions actuated by UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA, respectively (Fig.8). The Arrhenius plot for the biosynthetic reaction was linear from 15 to 40 °C, and the approximate activation energy was 17 kcal/mol. Release of low molecular weight polysaccharide chains by either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA (Fig. 5), suggested that release of endogenous, nascent polysaccharide chains might also be possible. Incubation of the membranes containing type 3 synthase with either 50 μm UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA prior to initiating chain elongation, resulted in a rapid time-dependent inhibition of the synthase activity (Fig.9). When both UDP sugars were added or when neither was added, the time-dependent inhibition was much slower. The maximum reduction in synthase activity was 66% when the membranes were incubated with UDP-Glc and 63% with UDP-GlcUA, consistent with the comparable maximum release of polysaccharide observed in Fig. 5 and in other similar reactions. These data suggested that endogenous nascent polysaccharide chains are released by the same mechanism. Further, release of nascent polysaccharide chains was concentration-dependent, and plots of the inhibition of the polymerization reaction as a function of the concentration of UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA were hyperbolic, and the double reciprocal plots were linear (data not shown), yielding respective apparentK m values of 230 μm for UDP-Glc and 0.015 μm for UDP-GlcUA (TableII). Nascent chain release, as determined by synthase inhibition, also demonstrated the same specificity for other UDP nucleotides as reported above for polysaccharide release (data not shown). These results further confirm the similarity of the release reaction for polysaccharide product and nascent polysaccharide chains.Table IIReaction constantsReactionNucleotide sugarK mK iΔEμmμmkcal/molPolysaccharide releaseUDP-Glc880532Polysaccharide releaseUDP-GlcUA0.004228Nascent chain releaseUDP-Glc230Nascent chain releaseUDP-GlcUA0.015PolymerizationUDP-Glc +122-aReported in Ref. 3.17UDP-GlcUA92-aReported in Ref. 3.The apparent K m values for polysaccharide release were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 6.

There has been considerable progress in the understanding of the biosynthesis of a variety of carbohydrate polymers; however, most investigations have provided relatively little information with regard to possible mechanisms of termination and release of completed polysaccharide chains. The results obtained here indicate that chain release can occur by an enzymatic mechanism that may provide insight into the translocation process of the polymerization reaction. Indeed, the release reaction appears to be a futile attempt to translocate the growing polysaccharide chain when only a single substrate binding site is occupied. Inhibition of the release reaction occurred at K i values similar to the biosynthetic K m values, consistent with the hypothesis that both polymerization and release are catalyzed by interaction of the UDP sugars with the same set of binding sites on the synthase. These results indicate that polysaccharide release occurs when one UDP sugar is present at a concentration sufficient to bind to its active site, and the concentration of the conjugate UDP-precursor is insufficient to bind to the other substrate binding site. As the concentration of the conjugate UDP-nucleotide is increased above its K i , the rate of polysaccharide release is rapidly reduced, apparently as the normal polymerization cycle is re-established. Because the type 3 synthase has not been purified, it is conceivable either that the release reaction involves an additional protein interacting with the synthase or that the synthase contains additional UDP-precursor binding sites. However, all of the data are readily explained by a single peptide with a single set of binding sites for UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA, whereby binding of either UDP sugar would trigger release of the polysaccharide chain by: (a) constrainment of the enzyme upon binding of the nucleotide sugar, (b) hydrolysis of the nucleotide sugar, or (c) transfer of the sugar to the polysaccharide. The mechanism of polymerization for type 3 polysaccharide is not known in any detail, but a polymer translocation step, as has been postulated in the formation of other β-glycans (5Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevere M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Koyama M. Helbert W. Imai T. Sugiyama J. Henrissat B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), is a likely candidate as the common mechanistic step that would incrementally move the polymer between disaccharide additions during the biosynthetic reaction or, alternatively, eject the polymer in the release reaction. If detachment of the polymer from the carbohydrate binding site were to occur following the binding of a single UDP-precursor or alternatively as a consequence of the addition of a single monosaccharide, the chain may be unable to reattach if it either now lacked the appropriate recognition sequence or had been shifted too far out of alignment with the enzyme binding site. It has been suggested that the driving force for polymer translocation could be generated by the hydrolysis of the pyrophosphoryl linkage of the nucleotide sugar. However, no evidence has been presented for this hypothesis, and it is possible that the energy could be derived from constrainment of the enzyme upon binding of the nucleotide sugar. The experimental activation energy for the polymerization reaction was about half that observed for the release reaction, suggesting that the rate-limiting process is greatly facilitated when two nucleotide sugars, rather than one, are bound to the synthase. These data are then consistent with the binding of each of the nucleotide sugars contributing approximately equally to the activation energy postulated to drive the translocation step in the polymerization sequence. We have so far been unable to demonstrate that the abortive translocation of polysaccharide chains is accompanied by the addition of either Glc or GlcUA. 2W. T. Forsee, R. T. Cartee, and J. Yother, unpublished data. However, considering the low level of isotope that would be incorporated by the addition of a single monosaccharide and the increased background incorporation that occurs when the level of protein is necessarily scaled up, we cannot exclude the possibility that a low level of transfer to the released chain does take place. Nevertheless, release of the polysaccharide accompanied by the transfer of a single sugar seems unlikely for two reasons. First, the triggering of translocation due to the formation of either a single glucosidic or a single glucuronidic linkage, although not inconceivable, does not readily fit the current model of growth of β-glycans by repetitive disaccharide addition (5Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevere M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Koyama M. Helbert W. Imai T. Sugiyama J. Henrissat B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9091-9095Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Second, the observed release of polysaccharide by UDP-xylose does not support this mechanism, because xylose is not incorporated during polymer formation. In contrast to the K i values, the respective apparent K m values for UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA were dramatically different in the abortive translocation reaction and the polymerization reaction. It would appear to be significant that theK m value for UDP-Glc is 2 orders of magnitude higher and that for UDP-GlcUA is 3 orders of magnitude lower. To the extent that the apparent K m values reflect binding affinities, these data suggest that the binding of UDP-Glc greatly decreases the affinity of the synthase for UDP-GlcUA and that the binding of the latter greatly enhances the affinity of the former. Although the chemistry of the release reaction is still undefined, the translocation step would presumably be slow in comparison with the association and dissociation of the nucleotide sugars. Hence, theK m values would be predicted to be similar to the dissociation constants and should reflect the affinities of the synthase for the nucleotide sugars. Previous investigations of S. pyogenes hyaluronate biosynthesis have noted a sigmoidal response to increasing concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc (19Stoolmiller A. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 236-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4246-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the latter have interpreted these results as evidence of cooperativity and “cross-talk.” The possibility of a cooperative interaction of the two UDP sugar precursors has also been suggested in view of the enhanced photoaffinity labeling of S. pyogenes hyaluronate synthase with [32P]5-azido-UDP-GlcNAc in the presence of UDP-GlcUA (21Sunthankar P. Pastuszak I. Rooke A. Elbein A.D. van de Rijn I. Canfield W.M. Drake R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have also observed sigmoidal kinetics in our system when the concentration of one UDP-precursor is varied in the presence of the conjugate UDP sugar. However, under some conditions this effect could readily be the consequence of a decrease in abortive translocation as the concentration of the nucleotide sugar is increased. This added complication precludes any simple interpretation of those data. Nascent polysaccharide chains, which are present in our membrane preparations and which serve as primer in the polysaccharide elongation assay, were also released under the identical conditions and by the same apparent mechanism as the elongated [14C]polymer. We have no evidence to indicate that S. pneumoniae membrane preparations are able to self-prime under the conditions of our assay, and following the release of some of the chains, all of the remaining polymerization activity appeared to occur by the elongation of pre-existing chains, without any evidence of the initiation of new low molecular weight chains. Taken together, the similarity of the conditions that actuate release of the nascent polysaccharide and also of the elongated [14C]polymer strengthen the hypothesis that both polymerization and release are catalyzed by the interaction of the UDP sugars with the same set of binding sites on the synthase. The failure to achieve complete release of polysaccharide from the membranes, even after depolymerase treatment to free potentially tethered chains, is at present an unexplained observation. It is perhaps significant that clinical type 3 isolates produce both cell-bound and released forms of the polysaccharide and the fraction of each varies with the strain under study (22Hardy G.G. Caimano M.J. Yother J. J.

V. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 2762–2769). We have identified potential aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-binding sites in the mdm2 promoter. However, we show that induction of mdm2 mRNA by BaP is entirely dependent upon aryl-hydrocarbon-induced genotoxicity and does not involve direct aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-mediated transcriptional activation of the mdm2gene. Heterologous mdm2 promoter-reporter constructs containing p53-response elements were not responsive to BaP treatment. Therefore the p53-response elements in the mdm2 promoter are insufficient to confer DNA damage-dependent expression of mdm2. Furthermore, mdm2 transcripts were induced by BaP in p53 null cells from transgenic mice (although both basal and BaP-induced mdm2 expression levels were reduced in these cells relative to p53+/+ cultures). These data show that p53-mediated mechanisms cannot account for BaP/DNA damage-induced mdm2 expression.Mdm2 promoter-reporter gene assays and nuclear run-off analyses of nascent mdm2 transcripts showed that transcriptional induction was unable to account for the large changes in mdm2 transcript levels following BaP treatment. However, mdm2 mRNA half-life measurements showed stabilization of the mdm2 transcript (from ∼1 h to >4 h) in response to BaP. To our knowledge, this is the first report of control of mdm2 at the post-transcriptional level and in a p53-independent manner. Transient ectopic expression of mdm2 strongly augmented aryl-hydrocarbon-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that mdm2 levels can have a profound effect on the cellular response to DNA damage. Overall, our results suggest a potentially important link between DNA damage signaling and RNA stability that may be relevant to cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, and environmental carcinogenesis.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 79-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Epidemiological data have also suggested an association between PAH exposure and increased incidence of certain cancers in humans (2Baum E.J. Gelboin H.V. Polycyclic Hydrocarbons and Cancer, Environment Chemistry and Metabolism. Academic Press, New York1978: 45-70Google Scholar, 3Mastrangelo G. Fadda E. Marzia V. Env. Health Persp. 1994; 104: 1166-1170Crossref Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Many PAHs, including BaP, bind to and activate a ligand-dependent transcription factor termed the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor or AhR (4Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). Ligand-bound AhR translocates to the nucleus and associates with an AhR-related protein termed AhR nuclear transporter (ARNT). Ligand-activated AhR·ARNT complexes can interact with specific promoter elements (termed dioxin-response elements or xenobiotic-response elements), which are present in the 5′-region of a subset of cellular genes including those encoding cytochromes P450 CYP 1A1 and CYP1A2 (4Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar,5Denison M.J. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18175-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by these CYP genes are termed “substrate inducible,” because many of the PAHs that induce their expression (via AhR) are also substrates for the metabolic oxidation reactions carried out by these enzymes. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of PAHs such as BaP generates electrophilic species (such asbenzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiolepoxide, or BPDE) that react with cellular macromolecules, including DNA, to generate covalently linked adduct moieties (6Conney A.H.

Metabolically activated species (typified by BPDE) are considered to be the “ultimate carcinogens” resulting from PAH metabolism, because these mediate the mutagenic and carcinogenic actions of the parent aryl-hydrocarbons (6Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1982; 42 (4197): 4875PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dipple A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 8Hemminki K. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Potentially, misreplication of aryl-hydrocarbon-adducted genes during S-phase may result in the “fixation” of mutations. Any such mutations that activate cellular proto-oncogenes or mutations that inactivate tumor suppressor genes might contribute to initiation or progression of malignancy. Indeed, both proto-oncogenes (such as c-ras) and tumor suppressor genes (such as p53) are known to be susceptible to oncogenic mutations in DNA damage “hot spots” targeted by PAHs (8Hemminki K. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2007-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).Because cells are subject to DNA damage from both intrinsic and extrinsic genotoxic agents, they have evolved mechanisms to prevent the mutagenic effects of DNA damage. Cell cycle “checkpoints” are mechanisms that exert negative controls over cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage (9Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 10Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). Checkpoints are hypothesized to allow cells to repair damaged DNA prior to resuming cell cycle progression (9Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar, 10Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar).In mammalian cells, the product of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is considered to play an important role in DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint responses (11Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar, 12Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). The p53 gene encodes a transcriptional activator that is stabilized and activated (via post-translational mechanisms) in cells containing damaged DNA (11Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar,12Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). When activated, p53 is believed to regulate the expression of a battery of DNA damage-responsive genes. The p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was initially identified as a p53 inducible transcript and the p21 gene was shown to contain p53-response elements (13El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.M. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7889) Google Scholar). p21 encodes a protein that binds to and inhibits the activities of cylin·cyclin-dependent kinase complexes that normally mediate cell cycle progression. Therefore, when expressed in response to DNA damage, p21 can elicit cell cycle arrest, thereby mediating the p53-regulated checkpoint (13El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.M. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7889) Google Scholar,14Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). The importance of p53-dependent checkpoints in tumor suppression is highlighted by the existence of cancer-prone individuals with congenital defects in p53 (e.g. Li-Fraumeni patients with inactivating germline mutations in the p53 gene).We previously identified a cell cycle checkpoint elicited by BaP-induced DNA damage (15Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2762-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1715-1722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BaP-induced cell cycle arrest occurred in p53-deficient cells as well as in p53-proficient cell lines. We hypothesize that the BaP-induced DNA damage checkpoint(s) represent potentially important mechanisms that protect against acquisition of mutations and neoplasia. In previous experiments in which we tested the expression of known p53-responsive genes in BaP-treated cells, we detected strong induction of the mdm2 transcript.The mdm-2 oncogene was first identified as an amplified DNA present on double minute particles in a spontaneously transformed murine 3T3 cell line (17Fakharzadeh S.S. Trusko S.P. George D.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). MDM2 has since been shown to be overexpressed in several human malignancies such as osteogenic sarcomas (40–60%) and soft tissue sarcomas (30%) (18Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). The oncogenic properties of the MDM2 protein result in large part from negative regulation of the p53 protein. MDM2 has been shown to bind the transactivation domain of p53, thereby inhibiting p53-mediated gene regulation (19Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olsen D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). Additionally, MDM2 targets p53 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (20Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). Thus mdm2 is an important negative regulator of p53-mediated biological effects. Indeed, homozygous deletion of mdm2 results in embryonic lethality because of increased (p53-mediated) apoptosis (21Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). However, the phenotype of mdm2−/− mice can be rescued by simultaneous deletion of p53, thereby demonstrating the importance of the p53-mdm2 regulatory loop (21Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Themdm2 gene contains two p53-response elements, suggesting a reciprocal role for p53 in mdm2 regulation (22Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, exogenous expression of p53 has been shown to inducemdm2 promoter-driven reporter genes (22Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 null cells express reduced levels of mdm2 transcripts relative to cells from p53-proficient lines (23Price B.D. Park S.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 896-899PubMed Google Scholar). Thus p53 and MDM2 participate in an intricate autoregulatory loop in which the balance of MDM2 and p53 protein levels/activities can have profound effects on cell cycle regulation.In addition to regulating p53 activity and protein levels, MDM2 has been shown to interact physically and functionally with another important tumor suppressor protein, namely pRB (24Xiao Z-X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The interaction between Rb and MDM2 results in derepression of the E2F transcription factor by Rb, thereby generating a proliferative signal. Moreover, MDM2 makes physical contact with E2F1·DP1 complexes, further stimulating transcription of E2F-dependent genes (25Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar).Perturbation of Rb and p53 signaling are frequently causative events in human cancers (11Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Clearly Mdm2 is an important regulator of these tumor-suppressive pathways. Our previous data showed a novel stimulatory effect of PAHs upon mdm2 expression that may be relevant to aryl-hydrocarbon-induced tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this report we have investigated the mechanism of mdm2 induction by PAHs. Surprisingly, we show that induction of mdm2 transcripts by genotoxic aryl-hydrocarbons is largely p53-independent and involves post-transcriptional mechanisms. Furthermore, we show that levels of mdm2 expression can dramatically influence the cellular response to aryl-hydrocarbon-induced DNA damage. Our data suggest a potentially important link between DNA damage surveillance and RNA stability that is likely to be important for normal cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have characterized the mechanism of mdm2 induction by aryl-hydrocarbons. Although we have identified potential binding sites for ligand-activated AhR·ARNT in the 5′-region of themdm2 gene, our data show that aryl-hydrocarbon-induced genotoxicity is necessary for mdm2 induction. Other genotoxic agents have been shown to elicit increases in mdm2 expression (23Price B.D. Park S.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 896-899PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vaziri C. Schneider A. Sherr D.H. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25921-25927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), yet this has always been attributed to direct transcriptional activation of the mdm2 gene by activated p53. This reasonable assumption has been supported by the ability of ectopically overexpressed p53 to increase mdm2 promoter-driven reporter activity in transient co-transfection experiments (22Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar) and by the demonstration of increased abundance of mdm2 transcripts originating at the p53-specific internal promoter in response to UV radiation (27Saucedo L.J. Carstens B.P. Seavey S.E. Albee L.D. Perry M.E. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, however, these results do not preclude an additional post-transcriptional mechanism for mdm2 induction in genotoxin-treated cells. Our data show that p53 is not required for the BaP-induced elevation of mdm2 expression (although consistent with work from other laboratories, we find that p53 plays an important role in maintaining basal and induced levels of mdm2 mRNA). Our reporter gene assays and nuclear run-off analyses show that p53-mediated (or other) transcriptional mechanisms are unlikely to account for BaP-induced mdm2 expression. Instead, our measurements of RNA half-life in control and BaP-treated cells demonstrate that aryl-hydrocarbon induction of mdm2 mRNA results from increased RNA stability.Although the mdm2 promoter contains several consensus sites for AhR·ARNT, our data show that activation of AhR (by the potent nongenotoxic AhR ligand TCDD) does not confer increases in mdm2 expression. It is formally possible that AhR may contribute to mdm2 regulation in cell lineages other than the mesenchymal cultures used in our experiments. Alternatively it is possible that additional transcriptional activators are required for (putative) AhR-mediated regulation of mdm2 transcription. In this regard, themdm2 5′-promoter contains potential sites for a number of other transcription factors (including E2F, estrogen receptor) that might cooperate with AhR to regulate gene expression. In unpublished transient transfection experiments we have found that high level overexpression of AhR (in the absence of ligand) can increase mdm2 promoter-driven CAT expression. Interestingly, we have previously shown that AhR expression is up-regulated by mitogenic stimuli (28Vaziri C. Schneider A. Sherr D.H. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25921-25927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Potentially, mitogen-induced increases in AhR levels could activate themdm2 gene (or other AhR target genes). Further experiments are underway to determine whether AhR plays any physiological role inmdm2 regulation. Nevertheless, our data indicate that AhR is necessary for the metabolic activation of BaP, but plays no direct role in transcriptional activation of the mdm2 gene in cultured rodent fibroblasts.The p53 protein is a transcriptional activator, which is itself activated and stabilized in response to DNA damage. p53 is generally believed to mediate transcriptional induction of DNA damage-responsive genes such as mdm2 and p21, which contain p53-response elements. However, BaP also induced expression of mdm2 mRNA in p53 null cells (although both basal and induced levels of mdm2 mRNA were reduced in p53 null cells relative to control p53+/+ cultures). Furthermore, we were unable to detect increased transcription of mdm2 using either reporter gene assays (with mdm2 promoter-CAT constructs) or nuclear run-off analyses. Collectively, these data show that the BaP-induced expression of mdm2 mRNA does not result from p53-mediated transcriptional activation. Instead, our measurements of mdm2 transcript half-life show stabilization of this mRNA in BaP-treated cells. To our knowledge, there is no precedent for control of mdm2 mRNA (by DNA damaging agents or other stimuli) by transcript stabilization.Interestingly, p21, which was originally identified by Vogelstein and colleagues (13El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.M. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7889) Google Scholar) as a p53-induced transcript, has also recently been shown to be induced via p53-independent pathways. For example p53 null cell lines show induction of p21 in response to DNA damage, although both basal and DNA damage-induced p21 levels are lower in p53 null cells than in p53-proficient lines (29Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar). Our data show that expression of mdm2 displays a similar p53-independent pattern of induction by BaP-induced DNA damage. Recent reports by Holbrook, Gorospe, and colleagues (30Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) have shown that p21 induction by UVC (presumably resulting from DNA damage) does indeed occur as a result of increased p21 message stability. These workers have identified sequences in the 3′-UTR of the p21 transcript that conferred mRNA stabilization in response to UVC. Interestingly, in the latter study the Elav-type RNA-binding protein HuR bound to these sequences in vitro, and lowering of HuR levels in intact cells (by antisense methods) destabilized p21 mRNA. It is highly likely that similar (or analagous) mechanisms exist to regulate p21 and mdm2 RNA stability in response to BaP-induced DNA damage.It is not intuitively clear why aryl-hydrocarbons should induce mdm2 expression. Nevertheless we and many other groups have shown that mdm2 is induced in response to a variety of DNA-damaging agents. It has been suggested that mdm2 serves to attenuate p53 activity thereby preventing excess p53 signaling. The lethality of the mdm2−/− mice and the rescue of this phenotype by p53 eficiency (in mdm2−/−p53−/− “double knockout” mice) demonstrates that excess p53 activity is indeed detrimental. Although these transgenic studies are compelling and indeed suggest a role for mdm2 in normal cell cycle and development, they do not necessarily address the role of mdm2 in the response to DNA damage. An interesting possibility suggested by our mdm2 overexpression experiments is that mdm2 actually contributes to the cell cycle/apoptotic response to DNA damage. It is known that BPDE-treated cells undergo apoptosis (32Wu J. Gu L. Wang H. Gecintov N.E. Li G.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8292-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our results show that mdm2 expression can strongly augment the apoptotic response to BPDE. We have not yet elucidated the mechanism whereby mdm2 contributes to apoptosis. However, mdm2 is known to bind Rb and derepress the E2F family transcription factors (24Xiao Z-X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). In unpublished experiments 2C. Vaziri, unpublished results. E2F1 overexpression resulted in acceleration of mitogen-induced cell cycle progression and augmentation of BPDE-induced apoptosis in a manner similar to that observed with mdm2 (in Fig. 8 of “Results” section). Hence we speculate that the effects of mdm2 on cell cycle progression and apoptosis are E2F-mediated. Nevertheless, regardless of the precise mechanism of the mdm2-induced cell cycle and apoptotic effects, our data show that changes in mdm2 expression levels can dramatically impact the cellular responses to DNA damage. Therefore, aryl-hydrocarbon-induced changes in Mdm2 are likely to be of biological importance. Indeed, elimination of cells containing BPDE-adducted DNA through increased apoptosis is likely to represent an effective tumor-suppressive mechanism.It is becoming increasingly clear that DNA damage can influence gene expression by altering mRNA stability as well as via regulating changes in gene transcription (e.g. via p53-mediated pathways). Although much progress has been made in understanding the signaling pathways that couple DNA damage to p53 and transcriptional activation, little is known regarding the mechanisms that mediate DNA damage-induced changes in mRNA stability. Mdm2 and p21 play key roles in cell cycle regulation and checkpoint control. The putative signaling mechanisms that regulate the stability of these (and probably other) important transcripts are likely to be relevant to our understanding of normal cell growth as well as checkpoint responses. Experiments are currently underway to elucidate the mechanisms whereby BaP-induced DNA damage controls stability of the mdm2 transcript. Polycyclic aryl-hydrocarbons (PAHs,1 typified by the ubiquitous pollutant benzo[a]pyrene or BaP) are potent mutagens that elicit tumors in experimental animals and transform normal cells to malignancy in vitro (1Heidelberger C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 79-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1574544508,"Abstract Deficiencies in cytochrome oxidase, the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, are most often caused by an inability to complete assembly of the enzyme. Pathogenic mutations in SCO2, which encodes a cytochrome oxidase assembly factor, were recently described in several cases of fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy. To determine the molecular etiology of these disorders, we describe the generation and characterization of the parallel mutations in the homologous yeast SCO1 gene. We show that the E155K yeast sco1 mutant is respiration-competent, whereas the S240F mutant is not. Interestingly, the S240F mutation allows partial but incorrect assembly of cytochrome oxidase, as judged by an altered cytochrome aa 3peak. Immunoblot analysis reveals a specific absence of subunit 2 from the cytochrome oxidase in this mutant. Taken together, our data suggest that Sco1p provides copper to the CuA site on subunit 2 at a step occurring late in the assembly pathway. This is the first instance of a yeast cytochrome oxidase assembly mutant that is partially assembled. The S240F mutant also represents a powerful new tool with which to elucidate further steps in the cytochrome oxidase assembly pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1998701978,"Heterotrimeric human single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), is a central player in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. The C terminus of the largest subunit, RPA70, contains a putative zinc-binding motif and is implicated in complex formation with two smaller subunits, RPA14 and RPA32. The C-terminal domain of RPA70 (RPA70-CTD) was characterized using proteolysis and x-ray fluorescence emission spectroscopy. The proteolytic core of this domain comprised amino acids 432-616. X-ray fluorescence spectra revealed that RPA70-CTD possesses a coordinated Zn(II). The trimeric complex of RPA70-CTD, the ssDNA-binding domain of RPA32 (amino acids 43-171), and RPA14 had strong DNA binding activity. When properly coordinated with zinc, the trimer's affinity to ssDNA was only 3-10-fold less than that of the ssDNA-binding domain in the middle of RPA70. However, the DNA-binding activity of the trimer was dramatically reduced in the presence of chelating agents. Our data indicate that (i) Zn(II) is essential to stabilize the tertiary structure of RPA70-CTD; (ii) RPA70-CTD possesses DNA-binding activity, which is modulated by Zn(II); and (iii) ssDNA binding by the trimer is a synergistic effect generated by the RPA70-CTD and RPA32."

The family is homologous both in primary and tertiary structures so they are thought to share a common ancestor in evolution. Generally, members of the aspartic proteinase family are composed of two homologous domains, each containing a catalytic aspartyl residue in a consensus sequence of Asp-(Thr/Ser)-Gly, in close proximity to enable catalytic function (6Tang J. Barrett A. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 802-814Google Scholar). The proteinases are often characterized by susceptibility to specific inhibitors such as pepstatin A (7Aoyagi T. Kunimoto S. Morishima H. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot.

In addition to the aspartic proteinases, there exist some distinct families of aspartic or acid proteinases that are not homologous, having neither apparent internal sequence homology nor the consensus Asp-(Thr/Ser)-Gly sequence present in the pepsin-type aspartic proteinases. These are called non-pepsin type acid proteinases and include aspergillopepsin II (EC 3.4.23.19, previously known as acid proteinase A or proctase A) from Aspergillus niger var.macrosporus (10Koaze Y.

Aspergillopepsin II is unique in the primary structure of known proteins with the exception of scytalidopepsin B (20Maita S. Nagata S. Matsuda G. Maruta S. Oda K. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the EapB and EapC proteins from C. parasitica (14Jara P. Gilbert S. Delmas P. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar). Aspergillopepsin II consists of two polypeptide chains, a 39-residue light chain and a 173-residue heavy chain (11Takahashi K. Inoue H. Sakai K. Kohama T. Kitahara S. Takishima K. Tanji M. Athauda S.B.P. Takahashi T. Akanuma H. Mamiya G. Yamasaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19480-19483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are derived from a precursor polypeptide of 282 residues (21Inoue H. Kimura T. Makabe O. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19484-19489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this two-chain structure is different from the one-chain structures of scytalidopepsin B and the EapB and EapC proteins, a 44–65% identity in amino acid sequence indicates that these proteins have been derived in evolution from the same ancestral protein and presumably share common catalytic residues and mechanisms. Recently Barrett et al. (22Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. (eds) (1998) Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes, Academic Press, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar) have classified aspergillopepsin II and its homologs as members of the aspartic proteinases of family A4. The catalytic mechanisms of these pepstatin-insensitive acid proteinases are not well understood. Recently, Oyama et al.(23Oyama H. Abe S. Ushiyama S. Takahashi S. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27815-27822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) identified two aspartic acids as the catalytic residues of pseudomonapepsin and xanthomonapepsin that belong to the aspartic proteinases of family A7 (22Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. (eds) (1998) Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes, Academic Press, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar). In the proteinases of family A4, aspartic and glutamic acid were previously proposed as the catalytic residues of scytalidopepsin B (24Tsuru D. Shimada S. Maruta S. Yoshimoto T. Oda K. Murao S. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 99: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Tsuru D. Kobayashi R. Nakazawa N. Yoshimoto T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 1305-1312Google Scholar). However, it was later determined that neither residue was conserved among the enzymes of family A4 and that the putative glutamic acid residue is actually encoded as a glutamine in the cDNA of scytalidopepsin B, similar to other enzymes of family A4 (26Kakimori T. Yoshimoto T. Oyama H. Oda N. Gotoh Y. Oda K. Murao S. Tsuru D. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1210-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic residues of the proteinases of family A4 still remain to be identified. Aspergillopepsin II has an optimum pH of 2.6 for milk casein (10Koaze Y. Goi H. Ezawa K. Yamada Y. Hara T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1964; 28: 216-223Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and of less than 2 for hemoglobin, 1M. Kojima and K. Takahashi, unpublished data. implicating acidic residues in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Therefore, acidic residues conserved within the proteinases of family A4 may be candidates for these catalytic residues. Because neither the tertiary structure nor the specific inhibitor of aspergillopepsin II is known, analysis of the conserved residues by site-directed mutagenesis is the most practical approach for identifying the catalytic residues. In this study, all the conserved acidic residues were individually replaced with other amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant pro-enzymes were prepared by heterologous expression followed byin vitro refolding and analysis. The results have led us to conclude that Glu-219 (Glu-110 in the heavy chain) and Asp-123 2The residue numbering of the prepro-form of aspergillopepsin II is used throughout the paper unless otherwise specified. (Asp-14 in the heavy chain) are the most probable catalytic residues of the enzyme. Restriction endonucleases, DNA amplification reagents, and Taq DNA polymerases were purchased from Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan), and a T4 DNA ligation kit was purchased from Takara (Otsu, Japan). The reagents for DNA sequencing were from Perkin-Elmer. All other reagents used were of analytical grade and obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). The expression vector pAR2113 andEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) were obtained from Dr. F. W. Studier at Brookhaven National Laboratory, NY. The expression plasmid pAR-ANA was constructed in the same manner as that for aspergillopepsinogen I (27Inoue H. Hayashi T. Huang X.-P. Lu J.-F. Athauda S.B.P. Kong K.-H. Yamagata H. Udaka S. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The region coding for a putative pro-enzyme of aspergillopepsin II (residues 19–282 of the prepro-enzyme) (21Inoue H. Kimura T. Makabe O. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19484-19489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA for a template and a set of primers as follows: sense, 5′-AGGATCATATGGCTCCTCTCACTGAGAAGCGC-3′; and antisense, 5′-TATATGGATCCTATTAGACGTAGGTGACAGTGAC-3′. The sense and antisense primers contain a NdeI and BamHI site, respectively. The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI andBamHI and was inserted into theNdeI/BamHI site of pAR2113. Expression was carried out according to the method of Studier et al. (28Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). For preculture, 0.1 ml of a glycerol stock of transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) with pAR-ANA was seeded into 10 ml of M9ZB broth (28Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) containing 0.2 mg/ml ampicillin. After shaking at 37 °C for a few hours, the culture became slightly turbid. It was then seeded into 1 liter of M9ZB broth containing 0.05 mg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6–1.0, the expression of aspergillopepsinogen II was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 1 mm). The culture was further incubated at 37 °C for 150 min with shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 50 ml of a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and then thawed. To this was added lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the mixture was kept on ice for 30 min. The resulting solution was subjected to sonication (100 watts for 20 s, repeated four times) and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was dissolved in 50 ml of a denaturation buffer (8 m urea, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.2). After standing at room temperature for 1 h, the solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a DE52 (Whatman) column (1.5 × 6 cm) and was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.35 m NaCl. The fractions containing denatured aspergillopepsinogen II were pooled. The solution of denatured aspergillopepsinogen II was diluted with 10 volumes of a refolding buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.25) and left to stand overnight at 4 °C. Then the solution was dialyzed against the refolding buffer at 4 °C for 24 h. The wild-type and potentially active mutant pro-enzymes were processed to various extents during dialysis. For full conversion into the mature form, each solution after the refolding step was dialyzed against a processing buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.5) overnight at 4 °C. Then the solution was dialyzed against 20 mmsodium citrate, pH 4.5, and applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl (TOSOH) column (2 ml). Elution was performed with a linear gradient in 20 mm sodium citrate from pH 4.5 to 2.5. Proteolytic activity was determined essentially by the method of Anson (29Anson M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1939; 22: 77-89Google Scholar). An aliquot of enzyme or pro-enzyme (0.2 ml) was mixed with 0.4 ml of 2% acid-denatured hemoglobin in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.0, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To this was added 0.8 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and the mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min and then centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 10 min. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme or pro-enzyme that gives an increase of 1.0 absorbance unit/min at 280 nm. In this assay, the activity of the pro-enzyme actually indicates the potential enzyme activity because the pro-enzyme is rapidly autoactivated under the assay conditions at pH 2. The amino acid sequences of the N-terminal region of the pro-enzyme and its activation products were determined with an automated protein sequencer model 477A, equipped with an on-line HPLC (PE Biosystems). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel (30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The CD spectra were measured at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in buffer with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter at room temperature using the water-jacketed quartz cell with a light path of 1 mm. The sample solutions were prepared by appropriately diluting the solutions of the refolded pro-enzyme and the activated mature enzyme with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.25 or 3.5, respectively, just before measurement. For all measurements, a 1.0-nm bandwidth and a 1.0-s time constant were used, and 32 scans were repeated from 200 to 250 nm at the speed of 50 nm/min with 0.1 nm/point resolution. Spectra were converted to mean residue molecular ellipticity prior to analysis. To identify the catalytic residues by site-directed mutagenesis, aspergillopepsinogen II was expressed in E. coli. The region of the cDNA coding for the putative pro-enzyme (the residues 19–282 of the prepro-enzyme) (21Inoue H. Kimura T. Makabe O. Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19484-19489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was placed downstream of the T7 promoter in an expression vector pAR2113. The encoded polypeptide contained the putative pro-segment (residues 19–59), light chain (residues 60–98), intervening sequence (residues 99–109), and heavy chain (residues 110–282) (Fig. 1). Using this expression plasmid, the pro-enzyme was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Proteolytic activity toward acid-denatured hemoglobin was detected in the cytosol fraction by activity staining after non-denaturing PAGE.3Western blot analysis using an anti-aspergillopepsin II antiserum, however, showed that the major part of the expressed protein formed inclusion bodies (data not shown). Because most of the expressed protein formed inclusion bodies, extraction took place under denaturing conditions, and then protein was refolded in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pro-enzyme was eluted as a single protein peak from the DE52 column (data not shown) and showed a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A,lane 1). The behavior on SDS-PAGE of recombinant aspergillopepsinogen II as well as native aspergillopepsin II was anomalous. The molecular masses of recombinant aspergillopepsinogen II and the heavy chain of native aspergillopepsin II as estimated by SDS-PAGE were 42 (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) and 38 kDa (Fig. 2 B), respectively. This is approximately twice as large as the theoretical molecular masses of 28 and 18 kDa, respectively. The reason for this is not certain at present but may be at least partly because of the abundance of acidic residues. The N-terminal sequence of the expressed protein was determined to be Ala-Pro-Leu-Thr-Glu, which is consistent with that of the recombinant sequence except for the lack of the initial methionyl residue. Because the protein extracted from the inclusion bodies was completely denatured, refolding in vitro was required to obtain a potentially active pro-enzyme. The fraction containing the denatured pro-enzyme was diluted with the refolding buffer, pH 6.0, without urea and 2-mercaptoethanol to allow refolding. Then, the refolding mixture was dialyzed against the same buffer to completely remove the reagents. The resulting solution showed proteolytic activity toward acid-denatured hemoglobin at pH 2.0. The efficiency of refolding was examined by assaying proteolytic activity toward hemoglobin at pH 2 after refolding of the proteinase at several different pH values between 3.25 and 8.5 followed by dialysis against 20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5. The pH of the refolding buffer used for dilution of the denatured pro-enzyme solution had a marked effect on the refolding efficiency (Fig.3). The optimum pH was around 5.3. When the pH was shifted by as little as 1 pH unit in either direction, the refolding efficiency was greatly decreased. At pH 6–8.5, a low but significant extent of refolding was found to occur. At pH 5.25, the refolding efficiency was estimated to be 38%. The pH of the buffer used for dialysis after dilution had no effect on the refolding efficiency when it was performed in the range of pH 3–7. During the refolding under favorable conditions (for example at pH 5.3), the pro-enzyme was gradually converted to the processed form (Fig. 2 A,lane 3), whereas the polypeptide that was allowed to refold at pH 3.7 or 7.3 retained a molecular size identical to that of the pro-enzyme (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 4). The pH dependence of the processing was investigated with a sample refolded at pH 6 where the majority of the protein remained as the pro-enzyme. When this sample was acidified and incubated at 37 °C, the pro-enzyme was converted to a form indistinguishable in size from the native enzyme. The analysis of the time course of the processing by SDS-PAGE showed that the optimum pH for the processing was in the range of pH 3–4 (data not shown). At above pH 6, the processing was very slow, and no processing was observed at this pH within 4 h as examined by SDS-PAGE. Denatured aspergillopepsinogen II was purified in the presence of 8 murea to give a single strong band on SDS-PAGE. However, autolysis occurring in the subsequent refolding and purification processes was a major problem affecting the purification of the refolded pro-enzyme. We have not been successful in completely separating the pro-enzyme from truncated forms. Thus, after refolding, the refolded sample was dialyzed at pH 3.5 to allow simultaneous processing to the mature enzyme. After the processing, active aspergillopepsin II was purified by column chromatography on DEAE-Toyopearl using a pH gradient of 4.5–3.0. The purified enzyme gave two bands on SDS-PAGE corresponding to the heavy (H) and light (L) chains (Fig. 2 B), and its specific activity toward hemoglobin was essentially the same as that of the native enzyme. The yield of activity at this purification step was about 80%. The N-terminal sequences of the light and heavy chains of the recombinant aspergillopepsin II were determined to be Glu-Glu-Tyr-Ser-Ser and Lys-Arg-Gln-Ser-Glu-Glu-Tyr, respectively. The N terminus of the light chain was Glu-60, which was identical to that of the native enzyme. On the other hand, the N terminus of the heavy chain was Lys-108, which was different from the native heavy chain pyroglutamyl residue that corresponds to Gln-110 (Fig. 1). Despite the difference in the N-terminal structure of the heavy chain and some heterogeneity in the C terminus of the light chain, no difference was observed in enzymatic properties between the recombinant and the native enzymes. The dependence on pH and temperature of their activity toward hemoglobin was indistinguishable, and both enzymes showed maximal activity at 55–60 °C and a large decrease in activity at 60–65 °C. The CD spectrum of aspergillopepsinogen II at pH 5.25 after refolding at the same pH (Fig.4 A, curve a) was different from that of native aspergillopepsin II at pH 3.5 (Fig.4 B). The spectrum of the recombinant pro-enzyme was changed by acidification (Fig. 4 A, curve b). After incubation at pH 3.5, the spectrum was indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme (Fig. 4 B). This change in spectrum was irreversible; the readjustment of pH to 5.25 did not change the spectrum (Fig. 4 A, curve c). To investigate the importance of the acidic residues to catalysis, all the conserved Asp and Glu residues, i.e. Asp-123, -125, -137, -148, -160, -170, and -220, and Glu-152, -189, -215, -219, and -222 (Fig. 1), were individually replaced using site-directed mutagenesis with Asn and Gln, respectively. In the exploratory experiments, the mutant pro-enzymes were prepared in a small scale. Without purification of the denatured pro-enzyme extracted from the inclusion bodies, they were allowed to refold at pH 5.25, and the activity in the crude sample solution was assayed (Fig. 5 A). After refolding, the mutants D125N, D137N, D148N, E152Q, D160N, D170N, E189Q, D220N, and E222Q were found to be markedly active toward acid-denatured hemoglobin. In contrast, the activities of the D123N and E219Q mutants were weak. The activity of E215Q was significant but also very weak. To further examine the importance of Asp-123, Glu-215, and Glu-219, the residues were individually replaced with Ala. The resulting mutant E215A was active whereas the activity of the mutants D123A and E219A was almost at background levels. In addition, additional mutants for the unconserved Asp and Glu residues D208N, D225N, D254N, E128Q, E141Q, E177Q, E206Q, and E211Q were expressed and were all active (data not shown). To investigate whether Asp-123 and Glu-219 are essential for catalytic activity, the mutant pro-enzymes D123N, D123E, D123A, E219Q, E219D, E219A, and D123E/E219D (double mutant) were prepared in a large scale, purified under denaturing conditions, allowed to refold at various pH values and activated at pH 3.5. However, the refolded mutants at each of the tested pH values had little activity (see Fig. 3for some of the mutants). The activities of the mutants refolded at pH 5.25 are shown in Fig. 5 B. The activities of the D123E, D123A, E219D, E219A, and D123E/E219D mutants were not detectable (<0.2%), and the activity of E219Q was very low (0.3%) whereas the activity of the D123N mutant was low but significant (5.2%). The activity of the D123N mutant was not significantly changed by incubation at pH 2.0 at 37 °C for 2 h before assay. After refolding of the purified mutant pro-enzymes D123N, D123A, E219Q, and E219A, they were incubated under acidic conditions and then analyzed on SDS-PAGE. In the case of the D123A, E219A, and E219Q mutants, no processing was observed (Fig. 6, lanes 2,9, and 12) whereas D123N was processed to a form with a reduced molecular size (Fig. 6, lane 6) whose N terminus was identified as Ala-31 with protein sequencing. When D123A, D123N, E219A, and E219Q were incubated with a small amount (one-thirtieth by weight) of native aspergillopepsin II, the fully processed inactive enzyme was produced (Fig. 6, lanes 3,7, 10, and 13). This mature inactive enzyme was resistant to further proteolysis. To confirm the correct folding of the recombinant mutant pro-enzymes, the CD spectra were measured. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the spectra of the mutant pro-enzymes D123A and E219A were indistinguishable from that of the recombinant pro-enzyme. After incubation at pH 3.5, the spectrum of the recombinant pro-enzyme was changed into essentially the same spectrum as that of the native enzyme (Fig. 4 B) whereas the spectra of the mutant pro-enzymes were not changed with incubation at pH 3.5 (Fig. 7 B). However, after incubation with a small amount (one-thirtieth by weight) of native aspergillopepsin II at pH 3.5, the CD spectra were transformed similar to that of the mature enzyme (Fig. 7 C). Aspergillopepsin II is known to be unfolded above neutral pH mainly because of the electrostatic repulsion inside the molecule (31Kojima M. Tanokura M. Maeda M. Kimura K. Amemiya Y. Kihara H. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1364-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pro-peptide of aspergillopepsinogen II is rich in basic residues whereas the mature enzyme moiety is abundant in acidic residues. Therefore, as in the cases of ordinary aspartic proteinase zymogens such as pepsinogen (32James M.N.G. Sielecki A.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and aspergillopepsinogen I (27Inoue H. Hayashi T. Huang X.-P. Lu J.-F. Athauda S.B.P. Kong K.-H. Yamagata H. Udaka S. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the propeptide may interact electrostatically with the enzyme moiety. Such an interaction is thought to be responsible for correct folding of the polypeptide chain and control of the activation of the pro-enzyme. The optimum pH for refolding of aspergillopepsinogen II was around 5.3, and the refolding efficiency decreased at both higher and lower pH values (Fig. 3). The decrease in refolding efficiency at pH below 5.3 may be in part attributed to the weakening of the interaction between the propeptide and the enzyme moiety, which presumably decreases the refolding efficiency of the denatured pro-enzyme. Although the refolding efficiency was also decreased at higher pH, a low but significant proteolytic activity was observed after refolding at pH 6–8.5. Thus, the pH profile of the refolding efficiency above pH 5.3 appears to be biphasic, and the reason for this is not clear at present. Although the CD spectrum of the recombinant pro-enzyme at pH 5.25 after refolding at the same pH was different from that of the native enzyme at pH 3.5, acidification of the solution of the recombinant pro-enzyme to pH 3.5 resulted in an irreversible change in spectrum into one that was indistinguishable from that of the native enzyme (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the recombinant enzyme has the same folded structure as the native enzyme and that the change in spectrum can be attributed to activation and processing of the pro-enzyme. The recombinant pro-enzyme was converted to the two-chain structure enzyme similar to the native enzyme under acidic conditions. Because the pro-enzyme, refolded at pH 3.7 or 7.3 (Fig. 2 A), as well as some mutant pro-enzymes showed no processing (Fig. 6), it is implausible that another proteinase from E. colicaused the processing of the wild-type pro-enzyme, indicating that the pro-enzyme itself has the proteolytic activity responsible for this processing. The processing generated two new N termini, Glu-60 and Lys-108, on the light and heavy chains, respectively. The processing site between the pro-segment and the light chain, i.e.Asn-59↓Glu-60, is compatible with the cleavage specificity of aspergillopepsin II, which is known to cleave among others Asn–X bonds fairly preferentially (12Takahashi K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,33Takahashi K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the major processing site between the intervening sequence and the heavy chain of the recombinant pro-enzyme was Asn-107↓Lys-108. This site is two residues ahead of the major processing site, Arg-109↓Gln-110, in the native pro-enzyme. Such a discrepancy in the processing site between the native and recombinant pro-enzymes was observed also in the activation of recombinant aspergillopepsinogen I (27Inoue H. Hayashi T. Huang X.-P. Lu J.-F. Athauda S.B.P. Kong K.-H. Yamagata H. Udaka S. Takahashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cleavage site Asn-107↓Lys-108 is compatible with the cleavage specificity of aspergillopepsin II, but the cleavage at Arg-109↓Gln-110 is not. So far as examined with various protein and peptide substrates, no cleavage by the enzyme has been observed at Arg–X bonds. Therefore, the complete maturation to the native enzyme might require another peptidase, such as an aminopeptidase, to remove Lys-108 and Arg-109 from the N terminus of the heavy chain or a Kex2-like endopeptidase that is known to occur in A. niger (34Broekhuijsen M.P. Mattern I.E. Contreras R. Kinghorn J.R. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 31: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to cleave the Arg-109↓Gln-110 bond. Despite the difference in the N terminus of the heavy chain between the recombinant and native enzymes, the enzymatic properties appeared to be essentially identical with each other. Therefore, the present expression and refolding system of aspergillopepsinogen II is thought to be generally useful to study the structure/function relationships of the enzyme. Based on the assumption that certain acidic residues should contribute to catalysis and that the catalytic residues should be conserved among the proteinases of family A4, we replaced each conserved acidic residue with the other amino acids. The enzymatic activity was assayed by examining the digestion of acid-denatured hemoglobin and the autoprocessing capability. Whether the mutants have the correctly folded structure was analyzed by comparing CD spectra and by examining resistance to proteolysis by native aspergillopepsin II. There are seven Asp and five Glu residues completely conserved among the proteinases of family A4 listed in Fig. 1. In preliminary experiments, the mutant pro-enzymes were prepared in a small scale, and their activities were assayed (Fig. 5 A). The relative specific activity reflects not only the catalytic activity of the refolded protein but also the efficiency of refolding. Ten of the 12 conserved acidic residues were mutated without much loss of activity and therefore were ruled out as candidates for the catalytic residues. Glu-219 was shown to be the most likely candidate for the catalytic residue. In addition, Asp-123 was also suggested to be an important residue although the D123N mutant showed small activity. Further analyses were therefore carried out with Asp-123 and Glu-219 mutants. The refolded D123A, E219A, and E219Q mutant pro-enzymes showed no processing at pH 3.5 (Fig. 6). When the refolded mutants were incubated with a small amount of native aspergillopepsin II at pH 3.5, all mutants were processed similar to the wild-type pro-enzyme, and the resulting mature mutant enzymes were resistant to further proteolysis. These results suggest that the mutants were correctly folded although they had no autoprocessing ability. In addition, the CD spectra indicated that the mutant pro-enzymes had the same secondary structure as the wild-type pro-enzyme (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the D123N mutant was converted at pH 3.5 to a slightly smaller molecule with Ala-31 at the N terminus. This truncated form was also produced during the processing of the wild-type pro-enzyme as an intermediate, 4X.-P. Huang, H. Inoue, and K. Takahashi, unpublished data. but further processing of this intermediate from the D123N mutant was very slow. Thus, the D123A mutant was inactive whereas D123N showed a weak proteolytic activity. In this connection, it is interesting to note that the mutants D123E, E219D, and D123E/E219D had no activity, indicating that these two acidic residues cannot be mutually substituted for the enzyme to be active. Taken together, Glu-219 is concluded to be the catalytic residue of the enzyme. If aspergillopepsin II has a catalytic mechanism similar to that of the pepsin-type aspartic proteinases, it would also have two acidic catalytic residues. In that case, Asp-123 would be the second catalytic residue. It seems to be noteworthy that the regions containing Asp-123 and Glu-219 are among the most conserved regions in the enzyme (Fig. 1). Because Cys-127 and Cys-210, which are proximal to Asp-123 and Glu-219, respectively, are linked by a disulfide bond (11Takahashi K. Inoue H. Sakai K. Kohama T. Kitahara S. Takishima K. Tanji M. Athauda S.B.P. Takahashi T. Akanuma H. Mamiya G. Yamasaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19480-19483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that Asp-123 and Glu-219 are closely located in space to each other to function cooperatively in catalysis. The corresponding two cysteine residues are also conserved in scytalidopepsin and the EapC protein and are the most conserved cysteine residues among the four homologous enzymes (Fig. 1). It is probable that, as in the present enzyme, the cysteines form a disulfide bond in homologous enzymes. In the pepsin-type aspartic proteinases, the two catalytic aspartyl residues are proposed to work in concert, one (with a lower pK a ) as a deprotonated form and the other (with a higher pK a ) as a protonated form. In the case of porcine pepsin, which is most active at around pH 2 similar to the present enzyme, the pK a values of the two catalytic residues, Asp-32 and Asp-215, were estimated to be 1.50 and 3.95, respectively (35Lin X.L. Fusek M. Chen Z. Koelsch G. Han H.P. Hartsuck J.A. Tang J. Dunn B.N. Structure and Function of the Aspartic Proteinases. Plenum Press, New York1991: 1-8Google Scholar). Although the catalytic mechanism of the present enzyme is not known, it may be assumed by analogy with pepsin (36Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) that one of the catalytic residues (most likely Glu-219, with a similar lower pK a value caused by the specific microenvironment) deprotonates the nucleophilic water attacking the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond and that the other catalytic residue (most likely Asp-123, with a similar higher pK a value) protonates the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond. The D123N mutant exhibited weak but not negligible activity, and the pro-enzyme was partially processed under acidic conditions. The Asn residue at position 123 may function in part in the catalytic mechanism to substitute for Asp. The possibility cannot be completely excluded that a small amount of the wild-type enzyme might have been regenerated from the D123N mutant by unexpected hydrolysis of the amide group of Asn-123 during preparation of the mutant and/or during the assay at pH 2.0 toward hemoglobin. However, this possibility seems to be rather implausible for the following reason. As described in the preceding section, when the D123N mutant pro-enzyme was incubated with a small amount of native aspergillopepsin II, the fully processed inactive enzyme was formed (Fig. 6, lane 7). Therefore, if the Asn-123 residue of the D123N mutant pro-enzyme was partially deamidated, the resulting wild-type pro-enzyme should be autoprocessed to give a small amount of the wild-type enzyme, which would then convert the remaining mutant pro-enzyme to the fully processed inactive enzyme. This was actually not the case for the D123N mutant pro-enzyme; it was cleaved at the Glu-30↓Ala-31 bond, but further processing was very slow (Fig. 6, lane 6). Furthermore, when the D123N mutant was incubated at pH 2.0 and 37 °C for 2 h before assay, no significant increase in activity was observed, indicating that Asn-123 was not hydrolyzed to Asp under such conditions. In this connection, it is interesting to refer to our recent finding that the mutants of aspergillopepsinogen I in which one of the catalytic Asp residues was replaced with an Asn had practically no activity. 5Y. Noguchi, H. Inoue, and K. Takahashi, unpublished results. Among the various families of proteinases, the zinc metalloendopeptidase family is known to possess a catalytic glutamic acid residue (37Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, the catalytic glutamic acid residue has not been reported for other families of proteinases except for tetravirus endopeptidase. This enzyme, classified as an endopeptidase of family A21 by Barrett et al. (22Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. (eds) (1998) Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes, Academic Press, San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar), was reported to have a catalytic glutamic acid residue, which, however, is thought to function without turnover only once to intramolecularly cleave a specific Asn–X bond in the enzyme for autoactivation (38Johnson J.E. Schneemann A. Barrett A. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 963-967Google Scholar). Therefore, aspergillopepsin II appears to be rather unique as a more general endopeptidase with a catalytic glutamic acid residue because it is known to hydrolyze various peptide bonds in peptides and proteins (12Takahashi K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Takahashi K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This may be called a glutamic proteinase or a glutamic-aspartic proteinase although it may be included in a wider sense in the family of aspartic proteinases because Asp-123 appears to be one of the catalytic residues. To obtain a more definitive conclusion on the catalytic residues and mechanism of aspergillopepsin II, further studies are necessary including precise kinetics using suitable peptide substrates and x-ray crystallographic analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1529142120,"Abstract Presenilin (PS1 and PS2) holoproteins are transiently incorporated into low molecular weight (MW) complexes. During subsequent incorporation into a higher MW complex, they undergo endoproteolysis to generate stable N- and C-terminal fragments. Mutation of either of two conserved aspartate residues in transmembrane domains inhibits both presenilin-endoproteolysis and the proteolytic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein and Notch. We show that although PS1/PS2 endoproteolysis is not required for inclusion into the higher MW N- and C-terminal fragment-containing complex, aspartate mutant holoprotein presenilins are not incorporated into the high MW complexes. Aspartate mutant presenilin holoproteins also preclude entry of endogenous wild type PS1/PS2 into the high MW complexes but do not affect the incorporation of wild type holoproteins into lower MW holoprotein complexes. These data suggest that the loss of function effects of the aspartate mutants result in altered PS complex maturation and argue that the functional presenilin moieties are contained in the high molecular weight complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2035233668,"To identify control motifs involved in human type II collagen gene transcription in both differentiated and dedifferentiated rabbit articular chondrocytes, transient transfection experiments were performed. A 715-base pair (bp) region of the first intron (+2127/+2842), including a 153-bp sequence so far uncharacterized (+2689/+2842), was found to mediate enhancer activity. In dedifferentiated chondrocytes, this enhancer activity was shown to be less effective than in primary cultures but still present. We then demonstrated that a zinc finger protein, C-Krox, activates COL2A1 gene transcription in differentiated chondrocytes through the enhancer region, whereas in subcultured cells, it inhibited the gene activity via a 266-bp promoter. Multicopies of the C-Krox binding site were found to mediate transactivation in both primary cultures and passaged cells, whereas C-Krox overexpression inhibited transcription in dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Additionally, we showed that C-Krox binds to several cis sequences that mediate its transcriptional effects. During chondrocyte dedifferentiation, the protein levels and binding activity of C-Krox were reduced, whereas those of NF-κB were increased. This was not associated with variations of mRNA levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms could be involved in C-Krox expression. These results suggest that C-Krox plays a major role in type II collagen expression and the chondrocyte phenotype modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1979864915,"Abstract The rat major histocompatibility complex class Ia allelomorph RT1-A1c is a potent ligand for the recently identified inhibitory rLy-49 receptor, STOK-2. With the ultimate objective of studying the interactions of these molecules using structural and functional methods, we undertook a detailed study of its peptide specificity. The study revealed that designing an “ideal peptide” by choosing the most abundant residues in the “binding motif” obtained by pool sequencing does not necessarily yield an optimal binding peptide. For RT1-A1c, as many as four positions, P2, P4, P5, and P9, were detected as putative anchors. Since this molecule displays a preference for highly hydrophobic peptides, we tested binding of peptides derived from the known leader peptide sequences of other rat histocompatibility complex class I molecules. One such peptide, found to bind well, requiring 1.6 μm peptide to achieve 50% stabilization, was searched for in vivo. Natural RT1-A1c binding peptides were purified from rat splenocytes and characterized by mass spectrometry using a combined matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight and quadrupole time-of-flight approach. Results showed that the signal sequence-derived peptide was not detectable in the purified peptide pool, which was composed of a complex spectrum of peptides. Seven of these self-peptides were successfully sequenced."
https://openalex.org/W2025920162,"Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) and the parathyroid hormone-2 (PTH2) receptor form part of an extended family of related signaling molecules that includes the PTH1 receptor, which responds to PTH and PTH-related protein. TIP39 does not appreciably activate the PTH1 receptor, but in this study it is shown to bind the receptor with moderate affinity (59 nm). In this study, we investigated the molecular determinants of both ligand and receptor for the PTH2 receptor selectivity of TIP39 and quantitatively evaluated the role of molecular elements in the binding of TIP39 to the PTH2 and PTH1 receptors. A chimeric receptor composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the PTH1 receptor and the remainder (juxtamembrane domain) of the PTH2 receptor (P2-NP1) was fully activated by TIP39 (E(max) = 98% of the rPTH-(1-34), E(max), EC(50) = 2.0 nm). This receptor chimera bound TIP39 with an equivalent affinity to the wild-type PTH2 receptor (2. 3 and 2.0 nm, respectively). The reciprocal chimeric receptor (P1-NP2) was not activated by TIP39 and bound the ligand with an affinity equivalent to that of the PTH1 receptor. Thus, the juxtamembrane receptor domain specifies the signaling and binding selectivity of TIP39 for the PTH2 receptor over the PTH1 receptor. Removing six N-terminal residues of TIP39 eliminated activation of the PTH2 receptor and reduced binding affinity 70-fold. In contrast, this truncation increased affinity for the PTH1 receptor 10-fold, reversing the PTH2/PTH1 receptor binding selectivity and resulting in a high affinity interaction of TIP-(7-39) with the PTH1 receptor (6 nm). These findings can be explained by a strong interaction between the N-terminal region of TIP39 and the juxtamembrane domain of the PTH2 receptor, with the corresponding domain of the PTH1 receptor acting as a selectivity barrier against high affinity binding of TIP39. As a result, TIP-(7-39) is a highly potent, selective antagonist for the PTH1 receptor."
