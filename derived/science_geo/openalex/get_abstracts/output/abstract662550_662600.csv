https://openalex.org/W3095330730,"New Zealand’s early response to the novel coronavirus pandemic included a strict lockdown which eliminated community transmission of COVID-19. However, this success was not without cost, both economic and social. In our study, we examined the psychological wellbeing of New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown when restrictions reduced social contact, limited recreation opportunities, and resulted in job losses and financial insecurity. We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders in April 2020. The survey contained three standardised measures–the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the GAD-7, and the Well-Being Index (WHO-5)–as well as questions designed specifically to measure family violence, suicidal ideation, and alcohol consumption. It also included items assessing positive aspects of the lockdown. Thirty percent of respondents reported moderate to severe psychological distress (K10), 16% moderate to high levels of anxiety, and 39% low wellbeing; well above baseline measures. Poorer outcomes were seen among young people and those who had lost jobs or had less work, those with poor health status, and who had past diagnoses of mental illness. Suicidal ideation was reported by 6%, with 2% reporting making plans for suicide and 2% reporting suicide attempts. Suicidality was highest in those aged 18–34. Just under 10% of participants had directly experienced some form of family harm over the lockdown period. However, not all consequences of the lockdown were negative, with 62% reporting ‘silver linings’, which included enjoying working from home, spending more time with family, and a quieter, less polluted environment. New Zealand’s lockdown successfully eliminated COVID-19 from the community, but our results show this achievement brought a significant psychological toll. Although much of the debate about lockdown measures has focused on their economic effects, our findings emphasise the need to pay equal attention to their effects on psychological wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3096053481,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) harboring EGFR mutations prevails in Asian population. However, the inter-patient and intra-tumor heterogeneity has not been addressed at single-cell resolution. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of total 125,674 cells from seven stage-I/II LUAD samples harboring EGFR mutations and five tumor-adjacent lung tissues. We identified diverse cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME) in which myeloid cells and T cells were the most abundant stromal cell types in tumors and adjacent lung tissues. Within tumors, accompanied by an increase in CD1C+ dendritic cells, the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) showed pro-tumoral functions without signature gene expression of defined M1 or M2 polarization. Tumor-infiltrating T cells mainly displayed exhausted and regulatory T-cell features. The adenocarcinoma cells can be categorized into different subtypes based on their gene expression signatures in distinct pathways such as hypoxia, glycolysis, cell metabolism, translation initiation, cell cycle, and antigen presentation. By performing pseudotime trajectory, we found that ELF3 was among the most upregulated genes in more advanced tumor cells. In response to secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1B) from immune infiltrates, ELF3 in tumor cells was upregulated to trigger the activation of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway and elevated expression of proliferation and anti-apoptosis genes such as BCL2L1 and CCND1. Taken together, our study revealed substantial heterogeneity within early-stage LUAD harboring EGFR mutations, implicating complex interactions among tumor cells, stromal cells and immune infiltrates in the TME."
https://openalex.org/W3094803005,"Objectives To investigate whether people who think they have had COVID-19 are less likely to report engaging with lockdown measures compared with those who think they have not had COVID-19. Design On-line cross-sectional survey. Setting Data were collected between 20th and 22nd April 2020. Participants 6149 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Main outcome measures Perceived immunity to COVID-19, self-reported adherence to social distancing measures (going out for essential shopping, nonessential shopping, and meeting up with friends/family; total out-of-home activity), worry about COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 to oneself and people in the UK. Knowledge that cough and high temperature / fever are the main symptoms of COVID-19. We used logistic regression analyses and one-way ANOVAs to investigate associations between believing you had had COVID-19 and binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Results In this sample, 1493 people (24.3%) thought they had had COVID-19 but only 245 (4.0%) reported having received a positive test result. Reported test results were often incongruent with participants’ belief that they had had COVID-19. People who believed that they had had COVID-19 were: more likely to agree that they had some immunity to COVID-19; less likely to report adhering to lockdown measures; less worried about COVID-19; and less likely to know that cough and high temperature / fever are two of the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusions At the time of data collection, the percentage of people in the UK who thought they had already had COVID-19 was about twice the estimated infection rate. Those who believed they had had COVID-19 were more likely to report leaving home. This may contribute to transmission of the virus. Clear communications to this growing group are needed to explain why protective measures continue to be important and to encourage sustained adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3097056616,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health threat, both in scope and response. With no vaccine available, the public is advised to practice non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) including social distancing, mask-wearing, and washing hands. However, little is known about public perceptions of the effectiveness of these measures, and high perceived effectiveness is likely to be critical in order to achieve widespread adoption of NPI. Methods In May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among U.S. adults (N = 3,474). The primary outcome was a six-item measure assessing perceived effectiveness of recommended behaviors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection from 1 (not at all effective) to 5 (extremely effective). The sample was divided into “higher” and “lower” perceived effectiveness groups. Covariates included demographics, healthcare characteristics, and health beliefs. Variables that were significant at p<0.01 in bivariate analyses were entered into a multivariable logistic regression and a best-fit model was created using a cutoff of p<0.01 to stay in the model. Results Mean age was 45.5 years and most participants were non-Hispanic White (63%) and female (52.4%). The high perceived effectiveness group was slightly larger than the low perceived effectiveness group (52.7% vs. 47.3%). Almost all health belief variables were significant in the best-fit regression model. COVID-19-related worry (aOR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.64–2.02), and perceived threat to physical health (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.20–1.45) were positively associated with perceived effectiveness while perceived severity of COVID-19 (0.84; 95% CI = 0.73–0.96) and perceived likelihood of infection (0.85; 95% CI = 0.77–0.94) switched directions in the adjusted model and were negatively associated with perceived effectiveness. Conclusions This research indicates people generally believe NPI are effective, but there was variability based on health beliefs and there are mixed rates of engagement in these behaviors. Public health efforts should focus on increasing perceived severity and threat of SARS-CoV-2-related disease, while promoting NPI as effective in reducing threat."
https://openalex.org/W3097927951,"In the current COVID19 crisis many national healthcare systems are confronted with an acute shortage of tests for confirming SARS-CoV-2 infections. For low overall infection levels in the population the pooling of samples can drastically amplify the testing capacity. Here we present a formula to estimate the optimal group-size for pooling, the efficiency gain (tested persons per test), and the expected upper bound of missed infections in pooled testing, all as a function of the population-wide infection levels and the false negative/positive rates of the currently used PCR tests. Assuming an infection level of 0.1% and a false negative rate of 2%, the optimal pool-size is about 34, and an efficiency gain of about 15 tested persons per test is possible. For an infection level of 1% the optimal pool-size is 11, the efficiency gain is 5.1 tested persons per test. For an infection level of 10% the optimal pool-size reduces to about 4, the efficiency gain is about 1.7 tested persons per test. For infection levels of 30% and higher there is no more benefit from pooling. To see to what extent replicates of the pooled tests improve the estimate of the maximal number of missed infections, we present results for 1 to 5 replicates."
https://openalex.org/W3037915194,"The general public is subject to triage policies that allocate scarce lifesaving resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the worst public health emergencies in the past 100 years. However, public attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies used during this pandemic are not well understood. Three experiments (preregistered; online samples; N = 1,868; U.S. residents) assessed attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies. The experiments evaluated assessments of utilitarian, egalitarian, prioritizing the worst-off, and social usefulness principles in conditions arising during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving resource scarcity, resource reallocation, and bias in resource allocation toward at-risk groups, such as the elderly or people of color. We found that participants agreed with allocation motivated by utilitarian principles and prioritizing the worst-off during initial distribution of resources and disagreed with allocation motivated by egalitarian and social usefulness principles. At reallocation, participants agreed with giving priority to those patients who received the resources first. Lastly, support for utilitarian allocation varied when saving the greatest number of lives resulted in disadvantage for at-risk or historically marginalized groups. Specifically, participants expressed higher levels of agreement with policies that shifted away from maximizing benefits to one that assigned the same priority to members of different groups if this mitigated disadvantage for people of color. Understanding these attitudes can contribute to developing triage policies, increase trust in health systems, and assist physicians in achieving their goals of patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3094761737,"Minimal research has examined psychological processes underpinning ultra-marathon runners' performance. This study examined the relationships between mental toughness and self-efficacy with performance in an elite sample of ultra-marathon runners competing in the 2019 Hawaiian Ultra Running Team's Trail 100-mile endurance run (HURT100). The Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ) and the Endurance Sport Self-Efficacy Scale (ESSES) were completed by 56 elite ultra-marathon runners in the HURT100 (38 males, 18 females; Mage = 38.86 years, SDage = 9.23). Findings revealed mental toughness and self-efficacy are highly related constructs (r(54) = 0.72, p < 0.001). Mental toughness and self-efficacy did not significantly relate to ultra-marathon performance (mental toughness and self-efficacy with Ultra-Trail World Tour (UTWT) rank F(2, 53) = 0.738, p = 0.483; mental toughness and self-efficacy with likelihood would finish the HURT100 χ2 = 0.56, p = 0.756; mental toughness and self-efficacy with HURT100 placing and time F(2, 53) = 1.738, p = 0.186 and F(2, 30) = 2.046, p = 0.147, respectively). However, participants had significantly and meaningfully higher mental toughness (M = 45.42, SD = 4.26, medium and large effect sizes) than athletes from other sports previously published. Our interpretation is that these results taken in conjunction, suggest a threshold of mental toughness that performers require to be of the standard needed to be able to prepare for and compete in elite ultra-marathon events such as the HURT100; once this mental toughness threshold is met, other factors are likely to be more influential in determining elite level ultra-marathon performance."
https://openalex.org/W3096123102,"Background Social determinants of health (SDoHs) and social risks (SRs) have been associated with adverse health and healthcare utilization and racial/ethnic disparities. However, there is limited information about the prevalence of SRs in non-safety net adult populations and how SRs differ by race/ethnicity, age, education, and income. Methods We analyzed weighted survey data for 16,247 White, 1861 Black, 2895 Latino, 1554 Filipino, and 1289 Chinese adults aged 35 to 79 who responded to the 2011 or 2014/2015 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Member Health Survey. We compared age-standardized prevalence estimates of SDoHs (education, household income, marital status) and SRs (financial worry, cost-related reduced medication use and fruit/vegetable consumption, chronic stress, harassment/discrimination, health-related beliefs) across racial/ethnic groups for ages 35 to 64 and 65 to 79. Results SDoHs and SRs differed by race/ethnicity and age group, and SRs differed by levels of education and income. In both age groups, Blacks, Latinos, and Filipinos were more likely than Whites to be in the lower income category and be worried about their financial situation. Compared to Whites, cost-related reduced medication use was higher among Blacks, and cost-related reduced fruit/vegetable consumption was higher among Blacks and Latinos. Younger adults were more likely than older adults to experience chronic stress and financial worry. Racial/ethnic disparities in income were observed within similar levels of education. Differences in prevalence of SRs by levels of education and income were wider within than across racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions In this non-safety net adult health plan population, Blacks, Latinos, and Filipinos had a higher prevalence of social risks than Whites and Chinese, and prevalence of social risks differed by age group. Our results support the assessment and EHR documentation of SDoHs and social risks and use of this information to understand and address drivers of racial/ethnic disparities in health and healthcare use."
https://openalex.org/W3097131518,"The UK Initial Operational Response (IOR) to chemical incidents includes improvised decontamination procedures, which use readily available materials to rapidly reduce risk to potentially exposed persons. A controlled, cross-over human volunteer study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of improvised dry and wet decontamination procedures on skin, both alone, and in sequence. A simulant contaminant, methyl salicylate (MeS) in vegetable oil with a fluorophore was applied to three locations (shoulder, leg, arm). Participants then received no decontamination (control) or attempted to remove the simulant using one of three improvised protocols (dry decontamination; wet decontamination; combined dry and wet decontamination). Simulant remaining on the skin following decontamination was quantified using both Gas Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (GC-MSMS) for analysis of MeS and UV imaging to detect fluorophores. Additionally, urine samples were collected for 24 hours following application for analysis of MeS. Significantly less simulant was recovered from skin following each improvised decontamination protocol, compared to the no decontamination control. Further, combined dry and wet decontamination resulted in lower recovery of simulant when compared to either dry or wet decontamination alone. Irrespective of decontamination protocol, significantly more simulant remained on the shoulders compared to either the arms or legs, suggesting that improvised decontamination procedures are less effective for difficult to reach areas of the body. There was no effect of decontamination on excreted MeS in urine over 24 hours. Overall, findings indicate that improvised decontamination is an effective means of rapidly removing contaminants from skin, and combinations of improvised approaches can increase effectiveness in the early stages of decontamination and in the absence of specialist resources at an incident scene. However, the variable control and consistency of improvised decontamination techniques means that further intervention is likely to be needed, particularly for less accessible areas of the body."
https://openalex.org/W3095147389,"Social rewards as praise from others enhance offline improvements in human motor skills. Does praise from artificial beings, e.g., computer-graphics-based agents (displayed agents) and robots (collocated agents), also enhance offline improvements in motor skills as effectively as praise from humans? This paper answers this question via two subsequent days’ experiment. We investigated the effect of the number of agents and their sense of presence toward offline improvement in motor skills because they are essential factors to change social effects and people’s behaviors in human-agent and human-robot interaction. Our 96 participants performed a finger-tapping task. Our results showed that those who received praise from two agents showed significantly better offline motor skill improvement than people who were praised by just one agent and those who received no praise. However, we identified no significant effects related to the sense of presence."
https://openalex.org/W3096626240,"Craft chocolate is a relatively new and fast-growing segment of the American chocolate market. To understand American premium chocolate consumer perception of craft chocolate and desirable chocolate product attributes, we conducted a mixed-methods study using focus groups and projective mapping. Projective mapping revealed that participants segmented products in terms of quality based upon usage occasion rather than cost or other factors. We found that American premium chocolate consumers use search attributes such as segmentation, price, availability, and packaging as quality determinants. Additionally, they desire credence attributes that convey trust through, for example, the presence or absence of sustainability certifications, or a semblance of meaning. Premium chocolate consumers seek out experience attributes such as utility and/or joy, which are achieved by purchasing a chocolate product as a gift, for its nostalgic purposes, or for desired post-ingestive effects. We propose a Desirable Chocolate Attribute Concept Map to explain our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3095172131,"Agricultural carbon emissions have become the constraints of agricultural low-carbon and circular economy development in China. China's agricultural production faces severe pressures and challenges in agricultural carbon reduction. In this paper, we take observation for the 31 provinces in china from 1997 to 2017, to explore the influencing factors and spatial spillover effects of agricultural by estimating spatial panel data models. The results show that China's agricultural carbon emissions will continue to increase in the future, because the growth of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is the main driving force to accelerate the growth of agricultural carbon emissions, but the agricultural input factors will help to reduce the growth of carbon emissions. Moreover, it is proved that economic factors and agricultural input factors have direct effects and spatial spillover effects on agricultural carbon emissions except for agricultural environmental factors. In the short term, strengthening environmental protection may bring some pressure to the economic development of some places, but to achieve high-quality development, we must fundamentally solve the problem of environmental pollution. The conclusion provides important enlightenment and scientific basis for formulating effective policies to curb the growth of CO2 emissions in China."
https://openalex.org/W3094836713,"The current study aimed to understand psychosocial and economic impacts of female caregivers and families caring for children with a disability in Belu district, Indonesia. A qualitative inquiry employing one-on-one in-depth interviews was used to collect data from participants (n = 22). Data analysis was guided by a framework analysis for qualitative research. Social implications framework and the economic consequence of disease and injury framework were used to guide the conceptualisation, analysis and discussion of the findings. Findings indicated that female caregivers of children with a disability experienced significant psychosocial challenges. These included feeling frustrated, sad, angry, worried, inferior and insecure due to rejection of their children by other kids with no disability. Poor physical conditions of and negative labelling given to their children and the fear of what the future held for their children with a disability added yet another layer of psychosocial challenges experienced by these women. Separation or divorce and reduced social interaction and engagement in the community were expressed social impact loaded to these women resulting from poor acceptability of the children by their fathers, increased time spent caring and discriminatory and stigmatising attitudes against their children with a disability. The participants also experienced economic impacts, such as increased health and transport expenses, loss of jobs and productivity, and lack of savings. The findings indicate the need for programs and interventions addressing the needs of mothers or female caregivers and families with disabled children. Further studies with large number of participants covering mothers, fathers and caregivers to understand broader experiences and the need of caring for children with a disability are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3096080542,"Many patients in HIV care in Africa considered lost to follow up (LTFU) at one facility are reportedly accessing care in another. The success of these unofficial transfers as measured by time to re-entry at the new-facility, prevalence of treatment interruptions, speed of ART-initiation, and overall continuity of care is not well characterized but may reveal opportunities for improvement. We traced a random sample of LTFU HIV-infected patients in Zambia. Among those found alive and reported in care at a new-facility, we reviewed records at the receiving facility to verify transfer; and when verified, documented the transfer experience. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to examine incidence of ART-initiation after transfer to new clinic. We assessed demographic and clinical characteristics, official and cross-provincial transfer for associations with HIV treatment re-engagement using Poisson regression models and associations between official-transfer and same-day ART initiation at the new-facility. Among 350 LTFU-patients, 178 (51%) were successfully verified through chart review at the new-facility. 132 (74.2%) were female, 72 (40.4%) aged 25–35, and 51% were ever recorded as previously being on ART. 110 patients (61.8%) were registered under new ART-IDs and 97 (54.5%) received a new HIV test. 54% of those previously on ART-initiated on the same-day. Using the same ART-ID was associated with same-day initiation compared to those receiving a new ART-ID (p = 0.07). 80% (n = 91) of those ever on ART had evidence of medication initiation at new clinic. Among these, initiation reached 66% (95% CI: 56–75) by 30 days, 77.5% (95% CI: 68–86) by 90 days after new-facility presentation. Many patients use new identifiers at new facilities, indicative of inefficiencies. Re-entry into new facilities among the unofficial-transfer population is often delayed and timely treatment initiation is inconsistent, suggesting interruptions in treatment. Health systems innovations to ensure smooth and safe transfers are needed to maintain quality HIV care."
https://openalex.org/W3095521387,"Heterotopic and orthotopic ovarian tissue autotransplantation techniques, currently used in humans, will become promising alternative methods for fertility preservation in domestic and wild animals. Thus, this study describes for the first time the efficiency of a heterotopic ovarian tissue autotransplantation technique in a large livestock species (i.e., horses) after ovarian fragments were exposed or not to a cooling process (4°C/24 h) and/or VEGF before grafting. Ovarian fragments were collected in vivo via an ultrasound-guided biopsy pick-up method and surgically autografted in a subcutaneous site in both sides of the neck in each mare. The blood flow perfusion at the transplantation site was monitored at days 2, 4, 6, and 7 post-grafting using color-Doppler ultrasonography. Ovarian grafts were recovered 7 days post-transplantation and subjected to histological analyses. The exposure of the ovarian fragments to VEGF before grafting was not beneficial to the quality of the tissue; however, the cooling process of the fragments reduced the acute hyperemia post-grafting. Cooled grafts compared with non-cooled grafts contained similar values for normal and developing preantral follicles, vessel density, and stromal cell apoptosis; lower collagen type III fibers and follicular density; and higher stromal cell density, AgNOR, and collagen type I fibers. In conclusion, VEGF exposure before autotransplantation did not improve the quality of grafted tissues. However, cooling ovarian tissue for at least 24 h before grafting can be beneficial because satisfactory rates of follicle survival and development, stromal cell survival and proliferation, as well as vessel density, were obtained."

Fieldwork by a team from the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) and the University of Sydney, Australia have identified cyclical land use practices associated with the Andronovo cultural complex. Their pattern of seasonal movements has been reconstructed through ethnographic studies and analysis of modern snow and grass cover. Using this detailed combination of data, the study defines requirements for seasonal pastures–winter, summer and spring/autumn–and shows a clear correlation between modern land use and seasonal patterns of movement in the Bronze Age."
https://openalex.org/W3097214850,"The American continent was the last to be occupied by modern humans, and native populations bear the marks of recent expansions, bottlenecks, natural selection, and population substructure. Here we investigate how this demographic history has shaped genetic variation at the strongly selected HLA loci. In order to disentangle the relative contributions of selection and demography process, we assembled a dataset with genome-wide microsatellites and HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 typing data for a set of 424 Native American individuals. We find that demographic history explains a sizeable fraction of HLA variation, both within and among populations. A striking feature of HLA variation in the Americas is the existence of alleles which are present in the continent but either absent or very rare elsewhere in the world. We show that this feature is consistent with demographic history (i.e., the combination of changes in population size associated with bottlenecks and subsequent population expansions). However, signatures of selection at HLA loci are still visible, with significant evidence selection at deeper timescales for most loci and populations, as well as population differentiation at HLA loci exceeding that seen at neutral markers."

https://openalex.org/W3095329776,"Tuberculosis prevalence surveys have demonstrated the benefit of screening with chest x-ray (CXR) and sensitive diagnostic tests compared to symptoms and smear microscopy. However, in programmatic practice there is little evidence on the yield of different algorithms. We implemented contact tracing in Chennai, India for adult sputum-positive TB patients registered from January 2015 to March 2016. Patients with symptoms or abnormal X-ray findings further underwent testing using Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and smear microscopy. A retrospective cohort study was done to summarize the key findings. We verbally screened 5553 contacts for symptoms, CXR through private sector collaboration, Xpert, and smear microscopy. Overall, 1312 (23.6%) contacts screened positive. CXR alone identified 531 (40.5%) of them, 679 (51.8%) were symptom-positive only, while 102 (7.8%) were positive on both the symptom and CXR screen. Overall, 35 bacteriologically positive cases were identified (0.7%). A standard approach of symptoms screening followed by microscopy identified only 9 (25.7%) of the total number of bacteriologically positive cases, whereas the combination of a CRX screening followed by microscopy identified 13 (37.1%) of the cases. The algorithm of symptoms screening followed by Xpert testing, detected 20 cases, whereas the combination of symptoms and CXR followed by Xpert increased this number to 35 (75% increase compared to symptoms and Xpert). Optimal use of more sensitive screening tests, better diagnostic tests, and novel private sector engagement can improve diagnostic yield in a programmatic setting."
https://openalex.org/W3095436543,"Background An effective pediatric emergency care (PEC) system is key to reduce pediatric mortality in low-income countries. While data on pediatric emergencies from these countries can drive the development and adjustment of such a system, they are very scant, especially from Africa. We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of presentations to a tertiary-care Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) in Mozambique. Methods We retrospectively reviewed PED presentations to the ""Hospital Central da Beira"" between April 2017 and March 2018. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of hospitalization and death. Results We retrieved 24,844 presentations. The median age was 3 years (IQR 1-7 years), and 92% lived in the urban area. Complaints were injury-related in 33% of cases and medical in 67%. Data on presenting complaints (retrieved from hospital paper-based registries) were available for 14,204 (57.2%) records. Of these, respiratory diseases (29.3%), fever (26.7%), and gastrointestinal disorders (14.2%) were the most common. Overall, 4,997 (20.1%) encounters resulted in hospitalization. Mortality in the PED was 1.6% (62% ≤4 hours from arrival) and was the highest in neonates (16%; 89% ≤4 hours from arrival). A younger age, especially younger than 28 days, living in the extra-urban area and being referred to the PED by a health care provider were all significantly associated with both hospitalization and death in the PED at the multivariable analysis. Conclusions Injuries were a common presentation to a referral PED in Mozambique. Hospitalization rate and mortality in the PED were high, with neonates being the most vulnerable. Optimization of data registration will be key to obtain more accurate data to learn from and guide the development of PEC in Mozambique. Our data can help build an effective PEC system tailored to the local needs."
https://openalex.org/W3096000932,"Decomposition of vertebrate remains is a dynamic process that creates localized soil enrichment zones. A growing body of literature has documented effects of vertebrate decomposition on soil pH, electrical conductivity, oxygen levels, nitrogen and carbon speciation, microbial biomass, and microbial successional patterns. However, relatively few studies have examined the microfaunal members of the soil food web that function as secondary consumers, specifically nematodes. Nematodes are often used as indicators of enrichment in other systems, and initial observations from vertebrate decomposition zones have indicated there is an effect on nematode communities. Our goal was to catalog decomposition-induced nematode succession and changes to alpha, beta, and functional diversity, and identify potential indicator taxa associated with decomposition progression. Six adult beaver (Castor canadensis) carcasses were allowed to decompose in a forest ecosystem for one year. During this period soil temperature, moisture, and electrical conductivity were monitored. Soils samples were taken at two depths in order to assess nematode community dynamics: 30-cm cores and 1-cm interface samples. Nematode abundance, alpha, beta, and functional diversity all responded to soil enrichment at the onset of active decay, and impacts persisted through skeletonization. After one year, nematode abundances and alpha diversity had recovered to original levels, however both community membership and functional diversity remained significantly altered. We identified seven indicator taxa that marked major transitions in decomposition progression. Enrichment of Rhabditidae (B1) and Diplogasteridae (B1) coupled with depletion in Filenchus (F2) characterized active and advanced decay prior to skeletonization in both cores and interface soils. Enrichment of Acrobeloides (B2), Aphelenchoides (F2), Tylencholaimidae (F4) and Seinura (P2) occurred during a narrow period in mid-skeletonization (day 153). Our study has revealed soil nematode successional patterns during vertebrate decomposition and has identified organisms that may function as indicator taxa for certain periods during decomposition."
https://openalex.org/W3096118129,"Background Surgery risks increase when electricity is accessible but unreliable. During unreliable electricity events and without data on increased risk to patients, medical professionals base their decisions on anecdotal experience. Decisions should be made based on a cost-benefit analysis, but no methodology exists to quantify these risks, the associated hidden costs, nor risk charts to compare alternatives. Methods Two methodologies were created to quantify these hidden costs. In the first methodology through research literature and/or measurements, the authors obtained and analyzed a year’s worth of hour-by-hour energy failures for four energy healthcare system (EHS) types in four regions (SolarPV in Iraq, Hydroelectric in Ghana, SolarPV+Wind in Bangladesh, and Grid+Diesel in Uganda). In the second methodology, additional patient risks were calculated according to time and duration of electricity failure and medical procedure impact type. Combining these methodologies, the cost from the Value of Statistical Lives lost divided by Energy shortage ($/kWh) is calculated for EHS type and region specifically. The authors define hidden costs due to electricity failure as VSL/E ($/kWh) and compare this to traditional electricity costs (always defined in $/kWh units), including Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE also in $/kWh). This is quantified into a fundamentally new energy healthcare system risk chart (EHS-Risk Chart) based on severity of event (probability of deaths) and likelihood of event (probability of electricity failure). Results VSL/E costs were found to be 10 to 10,000 times traditional electricity costs (electric utility or LCOE based). The single power source EHS types have higher risks than hybridized EHS types (especially as power loads increase over time), but all EHS types have additional risks to patients due to electricity failure (between 3 to 105 deaths per 1,000 patients). Conclusions These electricity failure risks and hidden healthcare costs can now be calculated and charted to make medical decisions based on a risk chart instead of anecdotal experience. This risk chart connects public health and electricity failure using this adaptable, scalable, and verifiable model."

The results showed that the calibrated WaNuLCAS model poorly predicts runoff prediction in the validation. In contrast, the calibrated WEPP model had a better performance in runoff prediction in the validation. For sediment prediction, the calibrated WaNuLCAS model predicted sediment yield better than the calibrated WEPP model in the validation because the WEPP model shows more variability of the sediment yield in the calibration (5.84 kg m–2) than the WaNuLCAS (5.18 kg m–2). Thus, the WEPP model was more suitable for runoff prediction than sediment prediction in the monocropping system, whereas the WaNuLCAS model was better suited for sediment yield prediction than runoff prediction, especially in complex intercropping systems."
https://openalex.org/W3095656478,"The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is aberrantly activated in the majority of colorectal cancer cases due to somatic mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) serves pleiotropic cellular functions with dynamic subcellular trafficking, facilitating signaling crosstalk between organelles. Nuclear-localized PHB1 is an important regulator of gene transcription. Using mice with inducible intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Phb1 (Phb1iΔIEC) and mice with IEC-specific overexpression of Phb1 (Phb1Tg), we demonstrate that IEC-specific PHB1 combats intestinal tumorigenesis in the ApcMin/+ mouse model by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Forced nuclear accumulation of PHB1 in human RKO or SW48 CRC cell lines increased AXIN1 expression and decreased cell viability. PHB1 deficiency in CRC cells decreased AXIN1 expression and increased β-catenin activation that was abolished by XAV939, a pharmacological AXIN stabilizer. These results define a role of PHB1 in inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to influence the development of intestinal tumorigenesis. Induction of nuclear PHB1 trafficking provides a novel therapeutic option to influence AXIN1 expression and the β-catenin destruction complex in Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3095729715,"Little is known about the major issues leading to postharvest losses in Peru, which are estimated to be 15–27%. We surveyed 503 farmers from the lowlands and Andean regions of Arequipa to learn more about the major grains produced and issues encountered during drying and storage. Rice, common bean, and quinoa were the most grown crops in the lowlands while starchy maize was the most cultivated crop in the highlands. Most farmers (90%) dried their crops in-field directly on the ground, which exposes them to rodents, birds, and insect pests. The majority of farmers (92%) used subjective methods to assess grain moisture content. About 77% of farmers identified insects as a major challenge during storage but only 44% said they used preventive measures such as the application of insecticides. Among farmers who stored grain, the main reason was for household consumption (61%); while among those who did not store, the main reason was the need for immediate cash at harvest (75%). Farmers who experienced insect problems, who stored seed or grain for sale, who stored longer, or farmers from the lowlands were more likely to apply insecticides on their stored products. These findings provide an opportunity for researchers, development organizations, and government agencies to improve postharvest handling and storage in Arequipa by disseminating drying technologies, moisture assessment tools and hermetic storage solutions among farmers."

Dying in a hospital can be highly stressful for patients and families. Persons with dementia are particularly vulnerable to negative outcomes in hospital. This study aims to describe changes in the proportion of older adults with and without dementia dying in nursing homes, home, hospital and other locations over an 11-year period covering the reform.This is a repeated cross-sectional, population-level study using mortality data from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry hosted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were Norwegian older adults 65 years or older with and without dementia who died from 2006 to 2017. The policy intervention was the 2012 Coordination Reform that increased care infrastructure into communities. The primary outcome was location of death listed as a nursing home, home, hospital or other location. The trend in the proportion of location of death, before and after the reform was estimated using an interrupted time-series analysis. All analyses were adjusted for sex and seasonality. Of the 417,862 older adult decedents, 61,940 (14.8%) had dementia identified on their death certificate. Nursing home deaths increased over time while hospital deaths decreased for the total population (adjusted Relative Risk Ratio (aRRR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.92) and persons with dementia (aRRR: 0.93, 95%CI 0.91-0.96) after reform implementation.This study provides evidence that the 2012 Coordination Reform was associated with decreased older adults dying in hospital and increased nursing home death; however, the number of people dying at home did not change."
https://openalex.org/W3096556967,"During the two World Wars, Bartonella quintana was responsible for trench fever and is now recognised as an agent of re-emerging infection. Many reports have indicated widespread B. quintana exposure since the 1990s. In order to evaluate its prevalence in ancient populations, we used real-time PCR to detect B. quintana DNA in 400 teeth collected from 145 individuals dating from the 1st to 19th centuries in nine archaeological sites, with the presence of negative controls. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the prevalence of B. quintana in civil and military populations. B. quintana DNA was confirmed in a total of 28/145 (19.3%) individuals, comprising 78 citizens and 67 soldiers, 20.1% and 17.9% of which were positive for B. quintana bacteraemia, respectively. This study analysed previous studies on these ancient samples and showed that the presence of B. quintana infection followed the course of time in human history; a total of 14/15 sites from five European countries had a positive prevalence. The positive rate in soldiers was higher than those of civilians, with 20% and 18.8%, respectively, in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the difference in frequency was not significant. These results confirmed the role of dental pulp in diagnosing B. quintana bacteraemia in ancient populations and showed the incidence of B. quintana in both civilians and soldiers."
https://openalex.org/W3096816742,"The idea that deaf intermarriage increases the prevalence of deafness was forcefully pushed in the late 19th century by Alexander Graham Bell, in proceedings published by the National Academy of Science. Bell’s hypothesis was not supported by a 19th century study by Edward Allen Fay, which was funded by Bell’s own organization, the Volta Bureau. The Fay study showed through an analysis of 4,471 deaf marriages that the chances of having deaf children did not increase significantly when both parents were deaf. In light of an apparent increase in non-complementary pairings when a modern dataset of Gallaudet alumni was compared with the 19th century Fay dataset, Bell’s argument has been resurrected. This hypothesis is that residential schools for the deaf, which concentrate signing deaf individuals together, have promoted assortative mating, which in turn has increased the prevalence of recessive deafness and also the commonest underlying deafness allele. Because this hypothesis persists, even though it contradicts classical models of assortative mating, it is critically important that it be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we used an established forward-time genetics simulator with parameters and measurements collected from the published literature. Compared to mathematical equations, simulations allowed for more complex modeling, operated without assumptions of parametricity, and captured ending distributions and variances. Our simulation results affirm predictions from classical equations and show that intense assortative mating only modestly increases the prevalence of deafness, with this effect mostly completed by the third generation. More importantly, our data show that even intense assortative mating does not affect the frequency of the underlying alleles under reported conditions. These results are not locus-specific and are generalizable to other forms of recessive deafness. We explain the higher rate of non-complementary pairings measured in the contemporary Gallaudet alumni sample as compared to the Fay dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3097877232,"Introduction IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulopathy worldwide. According to the Oxford Classification, changes in the kidney vascular compartment are not related with worse outcomes. This paper aims to assess the impact of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in the outcomes of Brazilian patients with IgAN. Materials and methods Analysis of clinical data and kidney biopsy findings from patients with IgAN to assess the impact of TMA on renal outcomes. Results The majority of the 118 patients included were females (54.3%); mean age of 33 years (25;43); hypertension and hematuria were observed in 67.8% and 89.8%, respectively. Median creatinine: 1.45mg/dL; eGFR: 48.8ml/min/1.73m2; 24-hour proteinuria: 2.01g; low serum C3: 12.5%. Regarding to Oxford Classification: M1: 76.3%; E1: 35.6%; S1: 70.3%; T1/T2: 38.3%; C1/C2: 28.8%. Average follow-up: 65 months. Histologic evidence of TMA were detected in 21 (17.8%) patients and those ones presented more frequently hypertension (100% vs. 61%, p <0.0001), hematuria (100% vs 87.6%, p = 0.0001), worse creatinine levels (3.8 vs. 1.38 mg/dL, p = 0.0001), eGFR (18 vs. 60 ml/min/1.73m2), p = 0.0001), low serum C3 (28.5% vs. 10.4%, p = 0.003), lower hemoglobin levels (10.6 vs. 12.7g/dL, p<0.001) and platelet counts (207,000 vs. 267,000, p = 0.001). Biopsy findings of individuals with TMA revealed only greater proportions of E1 (68% vs. 32%, p = 0.002). Individuals with TMA were followed for less time (7 vs. 65 months, p<0.0001) since they progressed more frequently to chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) (71.4% vs. 21,6%, p<0.0001). Male sex, T1/T2, and TMA were independently associated with progression to CKD-KRT. Conclusions In this study patients with TMA had worse clinical manifestations and outcomes. In terms of histologic evidence, E1 distinguished patients with TMA from other patients. Further studies are necessary to analyze the impact of vascular lesions on IgAN prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3095320258,"The past decade has been a golden age for microbiology, marked by the discovery of an unprecedented increase in the number of novel bacterial species. Yet gaining biological knowledge of those organisms has not kept pace with sequencing efforts. To unlock this genetic potential there is an urgent need for generic (i.e. non-species specific) genetic toolboxes. Recently, we developed a method, termed chassis-independent recombinase-assisted genome engineering (CRAGE), enabling the integration and expression of large complex gene clusters directly into the chromosomes of diverse bacteria. Here we expand upon this technology by incorporating CRISPR-Cas9 allowing precise genome editing across multiple bacterial species. To do that we have developed a landing pad that carries one wild-type and two mutant lox sites to allow integration of foreign DNA at two locations through Cre-lox recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). The first RMCE event is to integrate the Cas9 and the DNA repair protein genes RecET, and the second RMCE event enables the integration of customized sgRNA and a repair template. Following this workflow, we achieved precise genome editing in four different gammaproteobacterial species. We also show that the inserted landing pad and the entire editing machinery can be removed scarlessly after editing. We report here the construction of a single landing pad transposon and demonstrate its functionality across multiple species. The modular design of the landing pad and accessory vectors allows design and assembly of genome editing platforms for other organisms in a similar way. We believe this approach will greatly expand the list of bacteria amenable to genetic manipulation and provides the means to advance our understanding of the microbial world."
https://openalex.org/W3096487586,"Cytologic diagnosis of thyroid follicular adenoma and carcinoma, and Hurthle cell adenoma and carcinoma (FACHAC) is challenging due to cytomorphologic features that overlap with other follicular-patterned lesions. This study was designed to analyze diagnostic categories (DCs) of preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of histologically proven thyroid FACHACs to evaluate under- or misdiagnoses in FNAC and elucidate potential causes for such phenomena. A total of 104 thyroid nodules with preoperative FNAC which were diagnosed as FACHAC in resection specimens were included in this study. Of these, 66 cases had also undergone thyroid core needle biopsy (CNB); FNAC and CNB DCs were compared in these cases. Various cytologic and histologic parameters were compared between the nodules with different FNAC DCs. After a review of FNAC slides, DCs were re-assigned in 20 (19.2%) out of the 104 cases. Of the 66 cases with CNB diagnoses which were mostly classified as lower DCs in FNAC, 31 (47.0%) were diagnosed as suspicious for a follicular neoplasm in CNB. Cases which were underdiagnosed in FNACs were associated with lower cellularity, predominant macrofollicular pattern, absence of microfollicles arranged in trabecular pattern, and absence of transgressing vessels in cytology smears. High cellularity, microfollicles arranged in trabecular pattern, nucleolar prominence, and large cell dysplasia were more frequently found in malignancy than in benign neoplasm. In conclusion, thyroid FACHACs seem to be under- and misdiagnosed in preoperative FNAC. Innate characteristics of the nodules were associated with under-diagnosis as well as the quality of the FNAC specimens. Certain cytomorphologic features can be helpful in differentiating malignancy among FACHACs."
https://openalex.org/W3097476963,"As the number of global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases increases, the number of imported cases is gradually rising. Furthermore, there is no reduction in domestic outbreaks. To assess the risks from imported COVID-19 cases in South Korea, we suggest using the daily risk score. Confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by John Hopkins University Center, roaming data collected from Korea Telecom, and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker index were included in calculating the risk score. The risk score was highly correlated with imported COVID-19 cases after 12 days. To forecast daily imported COVID-19 cases after 12 days in South Korea, we developed prediction models using simple linear regression and autoregressive integrated moving average, including exogenous variables (ARIMAX). In the validation set, the root mean squared error of the linear regression model using the risk score was 6.2, which was lower than that of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA; 22.3) without the risk score as a reference. Correlation coefficient of ARIMAX using the risk score (0.925) was higher than that of ARIMA (0.899). A possible reason for this time lag of 12 days between imported cases and the risk score could be the delay that occurs before the effect of government policies such as closure of airports or lockdown of cities. Roaming data could help warn roaming users regarding their COVID-19 risk status and inform the national health agency of possible high-risk areas for domestic outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3097720493,"Background Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains the standard of care for young multiple myeloma (MM) patients; indeed, at-home ASCT has been positioned as an appropriate therapeutic strategy. However, despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics, neutropenic fever (NF) and hospital readmissions continue to pose as the most important limitations in the outpatient setting. It is possible that the febrile episodes may have a non-infectious etiology, and engraftment syndrome could play a more significant role. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of both G-CSF withdrawal and the addition of primary prophylaxis with corticosteroids after ASCT. Methods Between January 2002 and August 2018, 111 MM patients conditioned with melphalan were managed at-home beginning +1 day after ASCT. Three groups were established: Group A (n = 33) received standard G-CSF post-ASCT; group B (n = 32) avoided G-CSF post-ASCT; group C (n = 46) avoided G-CSF yet added corticosteroid prophylaxis post-ASCT. Results The incidence of NF among the groups was reduced (64%, 44%, and 24%; P<0.001), with a non-significant decrease in hospital readmissions as well (12%, 6%, and 2%; P = 0.07). The most important variables identified for NF were: HCT-CI >2 (OR 6.1; P = 0.002) and G-CSF avoidance plus corticosteroids (OR 0.1; P<0.001); and for hospital readmission: age ≥60 years (OR 14.6; P = 0.04) and G-CSF avoidance plus corticosteroids (OR 0.07; P = 0.05). Conclusions G-CSF avoidance and corticosteroid prophylaxis post ASCT minimize the incidence of NF in MM patients undergoing at-home ASCT. This approach should be explored in a prospective randomized clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W3095279984,"Morbidity and mortality impacts of extreme heat amplified by climate change will be unequally distributed among communities given pre-existing differences in socioeconomic, health, and environmental conditions. Many governments are interested in adaptation policies that target those especially vulnerable to the risks, but there are important questions about how to effectively identify and support communities most in need of heat adaptations. Here, we use an equity-oriented adaptation program from the state of California as a case study to evaluate the implications of the currently used environmental justice index (CalEnviroScreen 3.0) for the identification of socially vulnerable communities with climate change adaptation needs. As CalEnviroScreen is geared towards air and water pollution, we assess how community heat risks and adaptation needs would be evaluated differently under two more adaptation-relevant vulnerability indices: the Social Vulnerability Index and the Heat-Health Action Index. Our analysis considers communities at the census tract scale, as well as the patterns emerging at the regional scale. Using the current index, the state designates 25% of its census tracts as “disadvantaged” communities eligible for special adaptation funds. However, an additional 12.6% of the state’s communities could be considered vulnerable if the two other indices were considered instead. Only 13.4% of communities are vulnerable across all three vulnerability indices studied. Choice of vulnerability index shapes statewide trends in extreme heat risk and is linked to a community’s likelihood of receiving heat-related California Climate Investments (CCI) projects. Tracts that are vulnerable under the current pollution-focused index, but not under the heat-health specific index, received four times the number of heat-related interventions as tracts vulnerable under the reverse scenario. This study demonstrates important nuances relevant to implementing equity-oriented adaptation and explores the challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities in quantifying vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W3096280166,"Epigenetics plays a fundamental role in cellular development and differentiation; epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, are involved in gene regulation and the exquisite nuance of expression changes seen in the journey from pluripotency to final differentiation. Thus, DNA methylation as a marker of cell identify has the potential to reveal new insights into cell biology. We mined publicly available DNA methylation data with a machine-learning approach to identify differentially methylated loci between different white blood cell types. We then interrogated the DNA methylation and mRNA expression of candidate loci in CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD19+ and CD56+ fractions from 12 additional, independent healthy individuals (6 male, 6 female). 'Classic' immune cell markers such as CD8 and CD19 showed expected methylation/expression associations fitting with established dogma that hypermethylation is associated with the repression of gene expression. We also observed large differential methylation at loci which are not established immune cell markers; some of these loci showed inverse correlations between methylation and mRNA expression (such as PARK2, DCP2). Furthermore, we validated these observations further in publicly available DNA methylation and RNA sequencing datasets. Our results highlight the value of mining publicly available data, the utility of DNA methylation as a discriminatory marker and the potential value of DNA methylation to provide additional insights into cell biology and developmental processes."

Increasing lower extremity circumference was hypothesized in association with lower risk of diabetes. OBJECTIVE This study determined which anthropometric patterns correlates the best with pre-diabetic and diabetic status among healthy adults. DESIGN Cross-sectional study with nationwide population sampling of participants was designed. PARTICIPANTS In total, 1,358 ethnic Chinese adult participants were recruited from the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan 2013-2016; the whole-body composition was measured through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Fat and lean mass in whole and specific parts of body among heathy Asian adults with normal glycemic, pre-diabetic, and diabetic states were measured, separately. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED The generalized linear model was used to investigate the association between body composition (lean and fat mass) and hyperglycemic status. The reduced rank regression (RRR) was used to confirm the correlation between glycemic status and predicting factors (body composition parameters). RESULTS Trunk fat positively correlated with the fasting glucose level (r = 0.327, P < 0.001) and HbA1c (r = 0.329, P < 0.001), whereas limb fat negatively correlated with the fasting glucose level (r = -0.325, P < 0.001) and HbA1c (ρ = -0.342, P < 0.001), respectively. In RRR analyses, fasting glucose and HbA1c exhibited a high positive association on fat amount per lean mass of the trunk (factor loading = 0.5319 and 0.5599, respectively) and of android area (0.6422 and 0.6104) and a high negative association fat amount per lean mass of the legs (-0.3863 and -0.3083) and gynoid area (-0.3414 and -0.3725). CONCLUSIONS For healthy community participants, increasing trunk fat had a greater risk of hyperglycemic status. Increasing lower extremity mass may confer lower risk of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3096471894,"Purpose Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein that regulates intraocular pressure (IOP) by altering extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis within the trabecular meshwork (TM). We hypothesized that the lower IOP previously observed in SPARC -/- mice is due to a greater outflow facility. Methods Mouse outflow facility (Clive) was determined by multiple flow rate infusion, and episcleral venous pressure (Pe) was estimated by manometry. The animals were then euthanized, eliminating aqueous formation rate (Fin) and Pe. The C value was determined again (Cdead) while Fin was reduced to zero. Additional mice were euthanized for immunohistochemistry to analyze ECM components of the TM. Results The Clive and Cdead of SPARC -/- mice were 0.014 ± 0.002 μL/min/mmHg and 0.015 ± 0.002 μL/min/mmHg, respectively (p = 0.376, N/S). Compared to the Clive = 0.010 ± 0.002 μL/min/mmHg and Cdead = 0.011 ± 0.002 μL/min/mmHg in the WT mice (p = 0.548, N/S), the Clive and Cdead values for the SPARC -/- mice were higher. Pe values were estimated to be 8.0 ± 0.2 mmHg and 8.3 ± 0.7 mmHg in SPARC -/- and WT mice, respectively (p = 0.304, N/S). Uveoscleral outflow (Fu) was 0.019 ± 0.007 μL/min and 0.022 ± 0.006 μL/min for SPARC -/- and WT mice, respectively (p = 0.561, N/S). Fin was 0.114 ± 0.002 μL/min and 0.120 ± 0.016 μL/min for SPARC -/- and WT mice (p = 0.591, N/S). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated decreases of collagen types IV and VI, fibronectin, laminin, PAI-1, and tenascin-C within the TM of SPARC -/- mice (p < 0.05). Conclusions The lower IOP of SPARC -/- mice is due to greater aqueous humor outflow facility through the conventional pathway. Corresponding changes in several matricellular proteins and ECM structural components were noted in the TM of SPARC -/- mice."

This study aims to investigate the alteration of corneal stiffness following CXL by mimicking the inflation of the eye under the in vivo loading conditions. Seven paired porcine eye globes were involved in the inflation test to examine the corneal behaviour. Cornea-only model was constructed using the finite element method, without considering the deformation contribution from sclera and limbus. Inverse analysis was conducted to calibrate the non-linear material behaviours in order to reproduce the inflation test. The corneal stress and strain values were then extracted from the finite element models and tangent modulus was calculated under stress level at 0.03 MPa. UVA/riboflavin cross-linked corneas displayed a significant increase in the material stiffness. At the IOP of 27.25 mmHg, the average displacements of corneal apex were 307 ± 65 μm and 437 ± 63 μm (p = 0.02) in CXL and PBS corneas, respectively. Comparisons performed on tangent modulus ratios at a stress of 0.03 MPa, the tangent modulus measured in the corneas treated with the CXL was 2.48 ± 0.69, with a 43±24% increase comparing to its PBS control. The data supported that corneal material properties can be well-described using this inflation methods following CXL. The inflation test is valuable for investigating the mechanical response of the intact human cornea within physiological IOP ranges, providing benchmarks against which the numerical developments can be translated to clinic."
https://openalex.org/W3096789576,"Background Previous studies identified demographic, reproduction-related and psychosocial correlates of suboptimal mother-to-infant bonding. Their joint informative value was still unknown. This study aimed to develop a multivariable model to screen early in pregnancy for suboptimal postnatal mother-to-infant bonding and to transform it into a risk classification model. Methods Prospective cohort study conducted at 116 midwifery centers between 2010–2014. 634 women reported on the Mother-to-Infant Bonding questionnaire in 2015–2016. A broad range of determinants before 13 weeks of gestation were considered. Missing data were described, analyzed and imputed by multiple imputation. Multivariable logistic regression with backward elimination was used to develop a screening model. The explained variance, the Area Under the Curve of the final model were calculated and a Hosmer and Lemeshow test performed. Finally, we designed a risk classification model. Results The prevalence of suboptimal mother-to-infant bonding was 11%. The estimated probability of suboptimal mother-to-infant can be calculated: P(MIBS≥4) = 1/(1+exp(-(-4.391+(parity× 0.519)+(Adult attachment avoidance score× 0.040))). The explained variance was 14% and the Area Under the Curve was 0.750 (95%CI 0.690–0.809). The Hosmer and Lemeshow test had a p-value of 0.21. This resulted in a risk classification model. Conclusion Parity and adult attachment avoidance were the strongest independent determinants. Higher parity and higher levels of adult attachment avoidance are associated with an increased risk of suboptimal mother-to-infant bonding. The model and risk classification model should be externally validated and optimized before use in daily practice. Future research should include an external validation study, a study into the additional value of non-included determinants and finally a study on the impact and feasibility of the screening model."

https://openalex.org/W3095554639,"Background This article explores mental health services in Norway and their availability for women subjected to female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C). The article focus on the system of communication and referrals from the perspective of health workers, and aims to identify bottlenecks in the system, what and where they are to be found, and analyze how different mental health services deal with Sub Saharan African (SSA) women in general, but in particular with respect to FGM/C. Method The study was conducted in Oslo, Norway, using a qualitative fieldwork research design, with the use of purposeful sampling, and a semi-structural guideline. One hundred interviews were done with general practitioners (GPs), gynecologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, midwives and nurses. Analysis A system analysis is applied using socio-cybernetics as a tool to identify the flow of communication and referrals of patients. Findings The study shows that borders of subsystems, silencing mechanisms, regulations and attitudes of the system can lead to women with SSA background having difficulty getting access to the specialist services. High standards for referral letters, waiting lists, out pushing to the lower levels, insecurities around treatment and deference rules silencing mental health issues during consultancies, have a negative impact on the accessibility of services. Consequences are that mental health problems due to FGM/C are under-investigated, under-referred, and under-treated and a silenced problem within the mental health services for women. Conclusion A better integration of subsystems at the specialist level with the GP scheme is necessary, as well as providing competence on FGM/C to the different levels. It is also important to strengthen and integrating the services at the Municipal level and provide information to SSA women about the low threshold services."
https://openalex.org/W3096026280,"Laccases, oxidative copper-enzymes found in fungi and bacteria were used as the basis in the design of nona- and tetrapeptides. Laccases are known to be excellent catalysts for the degradation of phenolic xenobiotic waste. However, since solvent extraction of laccases is environmentally-unfriendly and yields obtained are low, they are less preferred compared to synthetic catalysts. The histidine rich peptides were designed based on the active site of laccase extracted from Trametes versicolor through RCSB Protein Data Bank, LOMETS and PyMol software. The peptides were synthesized using Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) with 30-40% yield. These peptides were purified and characterized using LC-MS (purities >75%), FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. Synthesized copper(II)-peptides were crystallized and then analyzed spectroscopically. Their structures were elucidated using 1D and 2D NMR. Standards (o,m,p-cresol, 2,4-dichlorophenol) catalysed using laccase from Trametes versicolor (0.66 U/mg) were screened under different temperatures and stirring rate conditions. After optimizing the degradation of the standards with the best reaction conditions reported herein, medications with phenolic and aromatic structures such as ibuprofen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), salbutamol, erythromycin and insulin were screened using laccase (positive control), apo-peptides and copper-peptides. Their activities evaluated using GC-MS, were compared with those of peptide and copper-peptide catalysts. The tetrapeptide was found to have the higher degradation activity towards salbutamol (96.8%) compared with laccase at 42.8%. Ibuprofen (35.1%), salbutamol (52.9%) and erythromycin (49.7%) were reported to have the highest degradation activities using Cu-tetrapeptide as catalyst when compared with the other medications. Consequently, o-cresol (84%) was oxidized by Tp-Cu while the apo-peptides failed to oxidize the cresols. Copper(II)-peptides were observed to have higher catalytic activity compared to their parent peptides and the enzyme laccase for xenobiotic degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3097681058,"Sex is a hallmark of eukaryotes but its evolution in microbial eukaryotes is poorly elucidated. Recent genomic studies revealed microbial eukaryotes possess a genetic toolkit necessary for sexual reproduction. However, the mechanism of sexual development in a majority of microbial eukaryotes including amoebozoans is poorly characterized. The major hurdle in studying sex in microbial eukaryotes is a lack of observational evidence, primarily due to its cryptic nature. In this study, we used a tractable fusing amoeba, Cochliopodium, to investigate sexual development using stage-specific Differential Gene Expression (DGE) and cytological analyses. Both DGE and cytological results showed that most of the meiosis and sex-related genes are upregulated in Cochliopodium undergoing fusion in laboratory culture. Relative gene ontology (GO) category representations in unfused and fused cells revealed a functional skew of the fused transcriptome toward DNA metabolism, nucleus and ligases that are suggestive of a commitment to sexual development. However, the GO categories of unfused cells were dominated by metabolic pathways and other processes indicative of a vegetative phase. Our study provides strong evidence that the fused cells represent a sexual stage in Cochliopodium. Our findings have further implications in understanding the evolution and mechanism of inheritance involving multiparents in other eukaryotes with a similar reproductive strategy."

However, there is no published study on cerebral palsy neuroimaging patterns in Ethiopia. Methods Retrospective chart and neuroimaging reviews were conducted among pediatric patients, who attended Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital between January 2016 and August 2019, fulfilling the study criteria. The magnetic resonance images and computed tomography scans reviewed by a neuroradiologist and/or pediatric neurologist were included. Data was collected using a structured checklist and analyzed using SPSS statistical software version 22. Results were represented using tables, graphs and images. Results The median age at neuroimaging was 2 years. There were more males (54.5%) than females (45.5%) with a male: female ratio of 1.2:1. Majority of the patients had magnetic resonance (81.8%) as opposed to computed tomography scans (18.2%). Most of the patients (69.7%) had been born at term with spastic quadriplegia (33.3%) found to be the leading type of cerebral palsy. 30.3% of the patients had normal neuroimaging studies whereas 69.7% had neuroimaging abnormalities. Anomalies included pathologies of the white matter (18.2%), basal ganglia (15.2%), cortex and lobes (27.3%), corpus callosum (6.1%), lateral ventricles (12.1%), cysts (18.2%) and cerebellum (3%), respectively. Other findings were seen in 45.5% of the patients. Conclusion Severe forms of cerebral palsy (spastic quadriplegia) were most common with majorly cortical and subcortical brain involvement."

https://openalex.org/W3094757853,"Towers are important structures for installing radio equipment to emit electromagnetic waves that allow radio, television and/or mobile communications to function. Feasibility, cost, and speed of the construction are considered in the design process as well as providing stability and functionality for the communication tower. This study proposes the new design for construction of segmental tubular section communication tower with ultra-high-performance fibre concrete (UHPFC) material and prestress tendon to gain durability, ductility, and strength. The proposed mix design for UHPFC in this study which used for construction of communication tower is consisted of densified Silica Fume, Silica fine and coarse Sand and hooked-ends Steel Fiber. The prestressed tendon is used in the tower body to provide sufficient strength against the lateral load. The proposed design allows the tower to be built with three precast segments that are connected using bolts and nuts. This paper presents a novel method of construction and installation of the communication tower. The advantages of proposed design and construction process include rapid casting of the precast segment for the tower and efficient installation of segments in the project. The use of UHPFC material with high strength and prestress tendon can reduce the size and thickness of the tower as well as the cost of construction. Notably, this material can also facilitate the construction and installation procedure."
https://openalex.org/W3097390629,"Tectonic lakes are among the most geologically fascinating and environmentally versatile hydrobiological systems found on the earth’s surface. We conducted a study on the limnology of Tasek Lake, a tectonic lake located in the Indo-Burma Province of the South Asian region. Physico-chemical parameters of the lake’s water along with its plankton were considered for the study. Their relationship was analysed by understanding their seasonal variations and through linear regression models. The water quality index (WQI), plankton diversity indices and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were computed. The ichthyofaunal diversity was also studied to get an insight into the lake’s fishery potential. A preliminary assessment on the economic feasibility of converting Tasek Lake into a fishery was also completed. Results indicate moderate eutrophication in the lake and the plankton population is observed to be rich and abundant. The WQI value confirms the water to be of “very poor” quality. The CCA was done to analyze the relationships of physico-chemical parameters with months and seasons, and the relation between seasons and plankton assemblages. Results corroborate the results of WQI. Identified fish population suggest ample fishery potential of the lake. The economic assessment reveals that in order to maintain the ecological sustainability of the lake, it should be transformed into a recreational fishery, following a catch-and-release model. The study calls for urgent restoration of the lake so that not only its pristine ecology is survived but also its fishery potential is sustainably harnessed and local livelihood is improved."
https://openalex.org/W3097879989,"Methods for estimating the scope of unjustified inequality differ in their sensitivity to address institutional and structural deficiencies. In the case of gender wage gaps, adjusting adequately for individual characteristics requires prior assessment of several important deficiencies, primarily whether a given labor market is characterized by gendered selection into employment, gendered segmentation and whether these mechanisms differ along the distribution of wages. Given that countries are characterized by differentiated prevalence of these deficiencies, ranking countries on gender wage gaps is a challenging task. Whether a country is perceived as more equal than others depends on the interaction between the method of adjusting gender wage gap for individual characteristics and the prevalence of these deficiencies. We make the case that this interaction is empirically relevant by comparing the country rankings for the adjusted gender wage gap among 23 EU countries. In this relatively homogeneous group of countries, the interaction between method and underlying deficiencies leads to substantial variation in the extent of unjustified inequality. A country may change its place in the ranking by as much as ten positions–both towards greater equality and towards greater inequality. We also show that, if explored properly, this variability can yield valuable policy insights: changes in the ranking positions across methods inform on the policy priority of the labor market deficiencies across countries in relative terms."
