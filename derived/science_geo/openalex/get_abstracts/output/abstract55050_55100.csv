Applied topically, it inhibits herpetic keratitis in rabbits and tail lesions induced by herpes, vaccinia, and vesicular stomatitis viruses in mice. Injected intraperitoneally into mice, it inhibits splenomegaly and hepatomegaly induced by Friend leukemia virus and respiratory infections caused by influenza A(O), A(2), and B viruses and parainfluenza 1 virus. infections is also effective."
https://openalex.org/W1503075767,"Abstract The incorporation of 2-deoxy-d-[14C]glucose by cultured Novikoff rat hepatoma cells was investigated as a function of the deoxyglucose concentration in the medium. The intracellular radioactivity was mainly associated with deoxyglucose 6-phosphate, to a small extent with 6-phosphodeoxygluconate, and the remainder with free deoxyglucose. Below a concentration of 1 to 2 mm in the medium, the initial rate of deoxyglucose incorporation followed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics at 22, 27, 32, and 37° with an apparent Km of about 2 mm. The Vmax values increased with a Q10 of about 2.5 with an increase in temperature. Between 2 and 10 mm, on the other hand, the initial rate of incorporation increased linearly with an increase in deoxyglucose concentration and the relative increase in incorporation rate with increase in deoxyglucose concentration was about the same at the temperatures tested. Treatment of the cells with 0.5 mm p-chloromercuribenzoate for 15 min or heat shock (48.5°, 5 min) abolished the saturable uptake component without affecting the nonsaturable component. When combined, the results indicate that at low concentrations, deoxyglucose is taken up mainly by carrier-mediated transport (probably facilitated diffusion), whereas at concentrations above 2 mm, simple diffusion becomes the principal mode of entry of deoxyglucose into the cells. Results from studies on d-glucose and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose incorporation support this conclusion and suggest that all three substrates are transported by a single system. Persantine competitively inhibited deoxyglucose uptake by whole cells and decreased the metabolism of glucose without affecting the phosphorylation of the substrates. Prior treatment with p-chloromercuribenzoate or heat shock also had no effect on the hexokinase activity of the cells. Little if any hexokinase activity was associated with the plasma membrane and the kinetic properties of the in vitro hexokinase reaction differed from that for glucose or deoxyglucose uptake by whole cells. These results indicate that transport of glucose into the cell is a reaction distinct from phosphorylation and is the rate-limiting step in the metabolism of glucose by the cells. Since the cells possess an excess of hexokinase, glucose is phosphorylated as rapidly as it enters the cells and thereby trapped. At low concentrations of glucose in the medium (5 to 50 µm), the glucose 6-phosphate formed was exclusively used by the cells for macromolecular synthesis and oxidative processes without net production of lactate. The rate of CO2 production and incorporation of glucose in macromolecules approached a maximum at about 1 mm glucose in the medium and the excess glucose 6-phosphate formed, particularly at higher concentrations of glucose in the medium, was converted to lactate."
https://openalex.org/W1617709375,"Abstract Putidaredoxin, the iron sulfur protein from the P450cam-mediated methylene hydroxylase system of Pseudomonas putida, is shown to be essential both as an electron transfer agent and as an effector of P450cam necessary for product formation. P450cam is recognized to progress through four well defined states in an ordered reaction cycle of oxidized, and, with substrate, oxidized, reduced, and oxygenated. Combination of reduced putidaredoxin with each of these states of P450cam, or of oxidized putidaredoxin with the reduced or oxygenated P450cam in the presence of substrate and O2 yields product stoichiometrically. Putidaredoxin is not replaced efficiently by other iron sulfur proteins, nor by the phospholipid from the hepatic microsomal P450 system. Rapid scan spectroscopy shows the oxygenated form of P450cam to be dominant during NADH turnover in the reconstituted system. A scheme is developed for the reaction cycle in which aggregates of the enzyme components are postulated to facilitate electron transfer and determine the nature of the product formed. Analytical treatment of steady state kinetic data suggests that a 1:1:1 equivalence of reductase to putidaredoxin to P450cam is functional and probably reflects participation of 1 molecule each of putidaredoxin, P450cam, and possibly reductase in the catalytic complex."
https://openalex.org/W199274330,"We describe the properties of three DNA polymerases isolated from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of freshly harvested KB cells. Two of the enzymes, cytoplasmic polylymerase and nuclear polymerase N1, have been highly purified, one of them to apparent homogeneity. The third enzyme, nuclear polymerase N2, which is only partially purified, resembles the cytoplasmic enzyme in its physical properties but possesses distinctive enzymatic characteristics that suggest it may represent an independent third protein. The KB enzymes initiate polymerization at 3′-hydroxyl termini and resemble Escherichia coli DNA polymerase II in their obligatory requirement for gap-containing templates. None of the enzymes can copy the ribonucleotide strand of hybrid templates, even under specific conditions in which E. coli DNA polymerase I does demonstrate such activity. They can, however, with low efficiency copy a deoxynucleotide strand using an oligoribonucleotide as primer. Elucidation of the possible in vivo roles of these enzymes in DNA replication, recombination, and repair must await further biochemical and genetic studies."

https://openalex.org/W1511588285,"Abstract Fraction III, separated and purified from delipidated human serum high density lipoprotein of d 1.063 to 1.125 g per ml (HDL2) by gel filtration in 8 m urea, was further fractionated by ion exchange chromatography (DEAE) in 8 m urea into two major broad components, IIIa and IIIb, in ratios varying from individual to individual and exhibiting a slight difference in mobility by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or disc gel electrofocusing. The molecular weight of each of the two fractions was about 27,000, as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis in the presence or absence of 8m urea. The same value was obtained by agarose-guanidine HCl chromatography. Both IIIa and IIIb reacted similarly against antisera raised against whole III; they contained no half-cystine or sialic acid, had aspartic acid as NH2-terminal (dansylation and Edman procedure), glutamine as COOH-terminal (digestion with carboxypeptidase and hydrazinolysis), but differed slightly in amino acid composition: an established difference was that IIIb contained no isoleucine, whereas IIIa had 1 mole of this amino acid per mole of protein. However, the presence of isoleucine in IIIa was not a constant finding. Upon rechromatography of DEAE, IIIa and IIIb were resolved into three and two components, respectively, each having the amino acid composition of the starting product. After treatment with the bifunctional reagent, dimethylsuberimidate, III exhibited two distinct bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of 27,000 and 54,000, suggesting a monomer-dimer relationship. Under the same experimental conditions, IIIa or IIIb exhibited only one band with a molecular weight of about 27,000. The results of the present studies were taken to indicate that HDL2 contains at least two polymorphic forms of III having equimolecular weight, but differing slightly in chemical composition and associated together by noncovalent linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1580190498,"Abstract A colorimetric procedure was developed for assaying the enzyme activity of chondroitinase AC from Flavobacterium heparinum and of chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris when chondroitin 4-sulfate is used as a substrate. The enzymatic digestion product, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-d-galactose, is oxidized with periodic acid to yield, among other products, formylpyruvic acid. The latter compound reacts with thiobarbituric acid to yield a chromophore with an absorption maximum at 549 nm. Both enzymes were used to remove chondroitin sulfate from bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycan. The protein-keratan sulfate core isolated after limit digestion of proteoglycan with chondroitinase AC contains about 44% protein, 38% keratan sulfate, and 18% of the enzymatically modified oligosaccharide attachment region between the chondroitin sulfate chains and protein core: gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid-(galactosyl)2-xylose. Limit digestion of proteoglycan with chondroitinase ABC leaves a residual disaccharide on the chondroitin sulfate chains in the core preparation. Both monomeric and aggregated preparations of proteoglycan were treated with chondroitinase AC and the resulting core fractions were studied in the ultracentrifuge. A single, fairly symmetrical peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 7.7 S was observed for the core prepared from monomeric proteoglycan. In addition to this monomeric peak, the core prepared from aggregated proteoglycan exhibited a faster sedimenting, broad peak with a sedimentation coefficient of about 18 S. The results indicate that the noncovalent interactions which are essential for the aggregation of proteoglycans do not require the presence of the chondroitin sulfate portion of the macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1544639113,"Abstract The endogenous phosphorylation of protein in various membranous subcellular fractions from rat cerebrum has been studied in vitro. The endogenous phosphorylation of one minor protein component of synaptic membrane fractions showed a marked dependence upon the presence of added adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The apparent molecular weight of this phosphoprotein was approximately 100,000. Under the experimental conditions used, the selective stimulation of phosphorylation of a membrane protein by cyclic AMP was observed only in those subcellular fractions enriched in synaptic membranes. The results support other evidence suggesting that certain types of synaptic transmission may involve cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of a specific protein constituent of synaptic membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1943667950,"Abstract A new technique was developed to determine linkage position of glucosamine attached to asparagine. Treatment of asparagine-oligosaccharides with 1 m NaOH-1 m NaBH4 for 4 to 6 hours at 100° resulted in complete cleavage of the glucosamine-asparagine linkage with concomitant production of terminal glucosaminitol. Periodate oxidation, NaBH4 reduction, and hydrolysis of fragments thusly produced yielded different aminopolyols depending on the linkage positions. Reference glucosaminitol compounds bearing substituents 4 or 3 produced xylosaminitol and threosaminitol, respectively. Asparagine-oligosaccharides from chicken ovalbumin, α-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae, and pineapple bromelain all produced xylosaminitol by the described procedure, indicating the presence of a 1,4-linked glucosamine disaccharide unit. By the same technique, the penultimate glucosamine was found to be substituted by mannose at the 4 position. Methylation studies confirmed these data. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that O-β-d-Man-(1 → 4)-O-β-d-GluNAc-(1 → 4)-O-β-d-GlcNAc-Asn is the common structural unit in the asparagine oligosaccharides from these glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1579739413,"Abstract Sulfated glycoproteins were purified from tryptic digests of hog stomach mucosa. The sulfated glycoprotein fractions were isolated by ethanol and cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation followed by free-flow electrophoresis. The separation of the sulfated glycoproteins was performed by elution from DEAE-Sephadex A-50 with NaCl. After gel filtration of the major fractions on Bio-Gel A-50m, final separation was achieved by rechromatography on DEAE-Sephadex. The homogeneity of the purified fractions was confirmed by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips at pH 1.76 and 9.0. All of the purified sulfated glycoprotein fractions exhibited strong (A + H) blood-group activity. The extent of activity depended on the sulfate content and decreased slightly as a sulfate content increased. Two groups of similar but distinct carbohydrate chains were separated, one containing 18 and the other 14 glycosyl units. The carbohydrate composition of the studied fractions was found to be (in residues per 2 residues of N-acetylgalactosamine): fucose, 1.9 to 4.1; galactose, 5.9 to 7.9; and N-acetylglucosamine, 3.7 to 4.0. The sulfate was present in each fraction with a molar ratio of hexosamine to sulfate ranging from 2.4 to 5.4. N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfate was the only sulfated sugar found in the studied fractions. The carbohydrate chains of the sulfated glycoproteins from hog stomach mucosa are linked to the protein through O-glycosidic bonds involving N-acetylgalactosamine and serine and threonine. Sequential Smith degradation, partial acid hydrolysis of the native and partially degraded glycoproteins, enzymatic digestion, and immunological assays established the carbohydrate sequence and some of the linkages between the sugars."
https://openalex.org/W2070982824,"Constriction of the renal artery and controlled reduction of renal perfusion pressure is followed by a prompt increase in systemic renin activity and a concomitant rise in blood pressure in trained, unanesthetized dogs. The elevated blood pressure induced by the renal artery stenosis can be prevented by prior treatment with the nonapeptide Pyr-Trp-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gln-Ile-Pro-Pro, which blocks conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Further, the nonapeptide can restore systemic pressure to normnal in the early phase of renovascular hypertension. These results offer strong evidence that the renin-angiotensin system is responsible for the initiation of hypertension in the unilaterally nephrectomized dog with renal artery constriction."
https://openalex.org/W1564529656,"Abstract Bovine liver nuclear membranes were purified by means of a high salt (0.5 m MgCl2) discontinuous sucrose gradient. The purified nuclear membranes were isolated at a density of ρ = 1.05 to 1.23 and contained 62% of the protein recovered from the gradient. The presence of nuclear pore complexes identified the fraction as nuclear membrane. Twenty-six per cent of the protein was recovered at a density of ρ = 1.23 to 1.30. Electron microscopy demonstrated both nuclear membranes and nonmembranous nucleolar components with a predominance of the latter. A fraction sedimenting through the most dense high salt sucrose solution (ρ ≥ 1.30) made up 12% of the total recovered protein. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nucleolar constituents in both a granular-fibrillar network and in the more condensed form characteristic of nucleoli in intact nuclei. In the absence of high salt, the nuclear membranes and nucleolar material aggregated and sedimented at a density intermediate between the lighter membranes and the heavier nonmembranous components. Purified nuclear membranes consisted of 70.4% protein, 5.8% RNA, 1.1% DNA, and 22.6% phospholipid. The comparatively nonmembranous nature of the heavier fractions was indicated by the much lower phospholipid contents of 9.7% and 9.8%, respectively. Since nucleoli have a characteristically high RNA content, the much higher RNA levels of the heavier fractions (8.0% and 11.4%), as compared to the lighter nuclear membranes, were consistent with the ultrastructural demonstration of nucleolar components in these fractions. Eighty to 90% of the endoplasmic reticulum-type enzymes NADH-cytochrome c reductase, glucose 6-phosphatase, and Mg++-stimulated ATPase, and the characteristic inner mitochondrial membrane activity, cytochrome c oxidase, were not due to microsomal and mitochondrial contamination. The low succinate dehydrogenase activity in purified nuclear membranes is correlated with the absence of acid nonextractable, trypsin-releasable flavin, which is associated with mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein. In addition, coenzyme Q, a characteristic component of inner mitochondrial membranes, was not detected. The above enzyme activities were increased 1.2- to 1.9-fold in purified nuclear membranes compared to the unpurified membranes. In contrast, the high salt sucrose gradient fractions of higher density demonstrated progressive decreases in specific activities from 0.32 to 0.61 in the intermediate density fraction to 0.15 to 0.41 in the heaviest fraction. This was paralleled by the progressive decreases in nuclear membranes in these two fractions. Moreover, 84 to 90% of the total enzyme activities were found in the purified nuclear membranes, whereas only 7 to 15% and 1 to 4% were present in the intermediate and heaviest fractions, respectively. The membranes contained 0.322 nmole of cytochrome b5 per mg of protein and 0.045 nmole of cytochrome a, a3 per mg of protein, which were 33% and 30% of values in microsomes and mitochondria. The cytochrome P-450 content of nuclear membranes was only 4.4% of microsomes and can be attributed to microsomal contamination. Direct enzymatic comparison of nuclear and microsomal membranes demonstrated a strong endoplasmic reticulumtype character in nuclear membranes. Nuclear membranes differed from endoplasmic reticulum, however, by the presence of cytochrome c oxidase activity and cytochrome a, a3 and the only trace amounts of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1528271923,"It has been previously established that vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) must undergo an obligatory two step metabolism to first 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and then 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol prior to the initiation in the intestine of increased calcium transport. These steps are mediated successively by the liver and the kidney. The present report compares the time course of appearance of vitamin D metabolites in various subcellular fractions of the intestinal mucosa with the onset of increased intestinal calcium transport after physiological doses of radioactive 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. With both steroids, the intestinal nucleus and its chromatin fraction, but not that of the liver or kidney, preferentially accumulated 65 to 75% of the radioactivity present in the tissue. This radioactivity was found by chromatographic analysis to be exclusively 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Maximal nuclear accumulation (4.5 to 6 pmoles per chick intestinal chromatin) occurred after 10 to 12 hours or only 4 hours with doses of 0.32 nmole of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, respectively. Under these conditions increased intestinal calcium transport is maximal 28 or 9 hours after 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, respectively. Additionally it was found that the binding capacity of the nuclear chromatin for the 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol became saturated after a dose of 1.3 nmoles of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or a dose of only 0.025 nmole of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. This correlates closely with the doses of these steroids required to elicit a maximum intestinal calcium transport response. These results collectively support the concept that the nuclear localization of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in the intestinal mucosa is an integral step in the development of the physiological response to vitamin D by this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1559954846,"Abstract The effect of dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and theophylline on the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into acid mucopolysaccharides by 3T3 and SV3T3 fibroblasts has been studied. SV40 transformation of 3T3 fibroblasts produced a marked decrease in the rate of synthesis of acid mucopolysaccharides, in agreement with the data of others. When the transformed cells were grown in medium supplemented with dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and theophylline for 3 days, they secreted, on the basis of cell protein, approximately 250% more labeled acid mucopolysaccharides during a 24-hour labeling period than did the nontreated controls. The secretion of a variety of sulfated acid mucopolysaccharides was increased including chondroitin-4- and -6-sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Comparison of the rate of sulfate incorporation into acid mucopolysaccharides and the rate of loss of previously labeled acid mucopolysaccharides from the cells indicated that the effect was due to a greater rate of synthesis of these compounds at the time of labeling rather than due to a decrease in the rate of their degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1495903120,"Abstract Inhibition of calcium absorption by dietary strontium is the result of a block in the renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2CC) from 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHCC). The administration of 1,25-(OH)2CC but not 25-OHCC restores to normal calcium absorption in strontium-fed chicks. Kidney mitochondria from strontium-fed chicks do not metabolize 25-OHCC to 1,25-(OH)2CC, but rather to a metabolite designated Peak Va. The function of Peak Va is unknown while it is believed that 1,25-(OH)2CC is the metabolically active form of vitamin D in the stimulation of calcium absorption from intestine and mobilization from bone. The changes in the kidney metabolism of 25-OHCC in response to dietary strontium occur over a period of several days and correlate closely with changes in intestinal calcium absorption. Feeding a normal calcium diet can correct the strontium-induced inhibition of intestinal calcium absorption. This restoration of calcium absorption correlates with an increased rate of in vitro 1,25-(OH)2CC synthesis. The exact mechanism whereby strontium alters the renal metabolism of 25-OHCC is unknown. However, indirect evidence suggests that it may operate through humoral agents such as parathyroid hormone, or calcitonin, or both, which are responsible for maintenance of plasma calcium concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1545748748,"Abstract Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate at 5 x 10-5 m decreased the incorporation of [2-14C]acetate into fatty acid (36 ± 5%) in rat liver slices. Concentrations of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate of 5 x 10-3 m and higher decreased cholesterol synthesis by more than 80%. The dibutyryl analog of the nucleotide produced a similar significant inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis, but at concentrations up to 100-fold less. Metabolic evolution of CO2 was not significantly depressed at any concentration of either nucleotide. The data indicate that cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate may be involved in regulating acetyl-CoA incorporation into de novo fatty acid and cholesterol in a specific manner in mammalian liver."
https://openalex.org/W1574608222,"Abstract Fraction IV, separated and purified from delipidated human serum high density lipoprotein of d 1.063 to 1.125 g per ml (HDL2) by gel filtration in 8 m urea, was further studied before and after reduction with β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), or reduction and carboxymethylation (iodoacetamide). Both the reduced (R-IV) and the reduced and S-carboxymethylated (SC-IV) preparations exhibited a single band by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of about 8,500, a figure corroborated by Sephadex G-200-8 m urea and agarose-guanidine HCl column chromatography. In the absence of the reducing agent, Fraction IV had a molecular weight of about 17,000. Treatment of R-IV (in the presence of β-ME) or of SC-IV by the bifunctional reagent dimethylsuberimidate led to the formation of four components separable by analytical sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel, with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 8,500; 17,000; 25,000; and 33,000. In turn, unreduced and suberimidate-treated IV, exhibited two bands (SDS-polyacrylamide) with an apparent molecular weight of 17,000 and 33,000, respectively. In initial studies, where partially carbamylated preparations were used, fractionation of SC-IV by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography yielded two major and three minor fractions which all reacted with antisera raised in rabbit against whole Fraction IV, and differed mainly from each other in lysine and homocitrullin content. In subsequent studies, which used noncarbamylated products, SC-IV gave a single peak by both Sephadex and DEAE-chromatography, a major component by isoelectric focusing, and exhibited a single band by 8 m urea or SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. This preparation had no histidine, arginine, or tryptophan, and had glutamine as COOH-terminal (carboxypeptidase digestion and hydrazinolysis). It contained no sialic acid, showed no NH2-terminal by either dansylation or by the Edman's procedures, and gave a single precipitin line against specific antisera. It is concluded that Fraction IV, as separated and purified from apo HDL2 by Sephadex chromatography, is made up of chemically very similar, and possibly identical protomers each having the same molecular weight (about 8,500). The data also indicate that in HDL2 these protomers are paired by a single disulfide linkage into dimers of equivalent weight."
https://openalex.org/W1518872448,"Abstract The administration of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) (CC) to rachitic chicks results in the production of two major polar metabolites, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-CC) and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-diOH-CC), and a number of other minor metabolites. Eighteen hours after a physiological dose (0.65 nmoles) of radioactive cholecalciferol, 80% of the radioactivity in the target intestine is present as 1,25-diOH-CC and 19% as 25-OH-CC. In the other major target organ, the skeletal system, 25% of the radioactivity is present in a form chromatographically identical to 1,25-diOH-CC, 50% as 25-OH-CC and 20% as unaltered CC. 1,25-diOH-CC has been shown previously to be the probable metabolically active form of vitamin D3 which initiates increased intestinal calcium transport. 1,25-diOH-CC stimulated increased bone calcium mobilization, as measured by serum calcium elevation, in both vitamin D deficient chicks and rats. 1,25-diOH-CC initiates maximal bone calcium mobilization more rapidly than either CC or 25-OH-CC; maximal activity occurs at 8 to 10 hours for 1,25-diOH-CC and at 20 to 24 hours for the other steroids. When the maximal biological activity of 1,25-diOH-CC observed at 9 hours is compared to the maximal activity obtained by the other steroids at 24 hours, it was determined that 1,25-diOH-CC is 5.5 times more active than CC and 3.6 times more active than 25-OH-CC in stimulating bone calcium mobilization. Following administration of 1,25-diOH-[3H]CC, maximal localization of radioactivity in the bone tissue occurred after only 1 to 2 hours. This radioactivity was found by chromatographic analysis to be unaltered 1,25-diOH-CC. There is an obligatory requirement for the kidney mediated hydroxylation of 25-OH-CC to occur prior to the development of a biological response. Administration of 3.25 nmoles of CC, 3.25 nmoles of 25-OH-CC, 3.25 nmoles of dihydrotachysterol3, and 0.26 nmoles of 1,25-diOH-CC all produced bone calcium mobilization in vitamin D deficient rats with kidneys present. However, in bilaterally nephrectomized rats (kidneys absent), only 1,25-diOH-CC was capable of initiating bone calcium mobilization. These results indicate that 1,25-diOH-CC, which is believed to be the active form of cholecalciferol in the intestine, may also be the form of this steroid responsible for bone calcium mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1613162969,"Abstract A comparative study has been made of mitochondria isolated from wild type Neurospora and from poky, a cytochrome-deficient mutant. Both types of mitochondria respire with a variety of Krebs cycle acids and with NADH, but State 3 respiration rates are typically 20 to 40% lower in poky than in wild type. The dehydrogenases and flavoproteins of the two strains appear qualitatively similar, as judged by the dependence of respiration rate on substrate concentration and by the effect of pyrrolnitrin, an inhibitor that acts in the flavin region. The major difference between wild type and poky is in their oxidase systems. In wild type, more than 90% of the respiration is mediated by a conventional cytochrome chain (sensitive to antimycin and cyanide), whereas poky uses both a cytochrome chain and an alternate oxidase (resistant to antimycin and cyanide but sensitive to salicyl hydroxamic acid). The alternate oxidase accounts for as much as 70% of the respiration in poky mitochondria. Two lines of evidence suggest that, in poky, the cytochrome chain and the alternate oxidase compete for reducing equivalents on the oxygen side of the dehydrogenases, and thus form a branched electron transport system. (a) Total State 3 respiration rates are significantly lower than would be predicted from the sum of the two oxidase activities measured separately. (b) In addition, it is possible to demonstrate a rapid, energy-dependent reduction of the alternate oxidase by N,N,N' ,N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride plus ascorbate (via cytochrome c); the deficiency of Site 1 in poky mitochondria (see next paper) makes it unlikely that electrons pass from cytochrome c through the dehydrogenases in this experiment."

https://openalex.org/W1518365555,"Abstract Oxidative phosphorylation has been studied in mitochondria from wild type and poky strains of Neurospora crassa and from wild type that had acquired the poky phenotype as a result of growth in the presence of chloramphenicol. Wild type mitochondria were found to be tightly coupled, with respiratory control ratios as high as 5.8 and P:O ratios as high as 1.9. Results with a variety of substrates and inhibitors led to the conclusion that most of the oxidative phosphorylation takes place at Sites 2 and 3. Site 1 is quite inefficient, judged by the small difference in phosphorylation efficiency between NAD+-linked substrates and succinate and also by the relatively low level of reduction of endogenous NAD+ during respiration with succinate (+ATP) (27 ± 4% in Neurospora compared with as much as 75% in animal mitochondria). Poky and chloramphenicol-induced mitochondria show little respiratory control and low P:O ratios under most experimental conditions. In these mitochondria the cytochrome system is known to be impaired, and a large part of the respiration is mediated by an alternate oxidase that is resistant to cyanide and antimycin. Essentially all of the oxidative phosphorylation is inhibited by cyanide or antimycin, however, suggesting that it is associated with the residual cytochrome system rather than with the alternate oxidase. Site 1 seems to be absent altogether in poky mitochondria; Sites 2 and 3 are both present but at reduced efficiency. It can be calculated that the over-all electron flux in poky is partitioned so that the cytochrome system operates at maximal activity while the nonphosphorylating alternate oxidase is used only to accommodate surplus electron flux."

https://openalex.org/W1521921411,"Synaptosomal plasma membranes were isolated from whole rat brain by a method derived from several existing ones. The procedure involves the sequential centrifugation of a crude mitochondrial fraction through a discontinuous sucrose gradient and a continuous cesium chloride gradient. The material is then subjected to osmotic lysis and centrifuged through an additional discontinuous sucrose gradient. The synaptosomal membranes prepared in this way contain only very small amounts of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, myelin, axonal and glial plasma membranes, and lysosomes; the level of contamination was estimated by assay for appropriate marker enzymes, and by assaying the final membrane preparation for radioactivity following the addition of previously labeled radioactive contaminants at the start of the isolation procedure. On the basis of these criteria, the contaminants examined appear to account for less than 10 to 15% of the protein in the preparation. The isolated membranes were sequentially extracted with Triton X-100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate; as previously described, the Triton-soluble fraction contains those portions of the synaptosomal membrane not associated with the synaptic junction, whereas the sodium dodecyl sulfate dissolves the junctional complex. The fractions were subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the gels were stained for protein with Coomassie brilliant blue. The results indicate that some proteins are common to both fractions, but that each fraction contains several unique protein species. The membrane preparation also contains RNA and DNA in limited amounts. The bulk of the RNA resembles mitochondrial RNA with respect to its mobility in polyacrylamideagarose composite gels."
https://openalex.org/W1607429748,"Abstract The conversion of 3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol-1-carboxylic acid (DHB) to catechol has been shown to be catalyzed by a single protein from the bacterium Alcaligenes eutrophus. The enzyme was purified by ultracentrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Its molecular weight is approximately 94,600 (by sedimentation equilibrium) and the molecular weight of its subunits is approximately 24,000 (by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis). The proposed mechanism of the reaction is dehydrogenation of DHB to an unstable β-ketoacid which decarboxylates to form catechol."
https://openalex.org/W1995695849,"Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and its dibutyryl derivative induce a variety of morphological changes, including those associated with in vitro axonal maturation. Established sensory ganglia treated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP show significant increases in average axonal length and number in comparison with controls; those treated with maintenance doses of Colcemid show no increases in either parameter; simultaneous treatment with both agents results in growth statistically similar to that produced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP alone. The data are consistent with our hypothesis that cyclic AMP promotes axonal elongation by stimulating microtubule assembly from a preexisting subunit pool."

https://openalex.org/W1498762800,"Abstract A method which uses cyanogen bromide for the quantitative conversion of 4-thiouridine to uridine has been developed. The general nature and the specificity of this reaction has been studied with thiouridine residues present in a hexanucleotide isolated from enzymic digests of Escherichia coli tyrosine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), and also with those present in intact E. coli tyrosine and formylmethionine specific tRNAs. Comparison of enzymic digests of tRNAs before and after treatment with cyanogen bromide showed that the conversion of 4-thiouridine was essentially quantitative. The function of 4-thiouridine in these E. coli tRNAs has been studied by comparing the biological properties of cyanogen bromide-treated tRNAs with those of native tRNAs. For tyrosine tRNA, the rate, extent, and specificity of amino acid acceptance, pyrophosphorolysis or repair of the 3'-terminal-CpCpA by tRNA pyrophosphorylase, codon-directed binding to ribosomes, amino acid incorporation studies in vitro using poly[r(U-A-C)] as messenger RNA, and absorbance versus temperature profiles were compared. Similarly, for the formylmethionine tRNA, the amino acid acceptor activity, the ability for enzymic formylation subsequent to aminoacylation and the ability to initiate protein synthesis in vitro using poly[r(U-G)] as messenger RNA were compared. With the exception of reduced binding of tyrosyltRNAtyr to ribosomes, the results show that 4-thiouridine residues can be converted to uridine without causing any other appreciable change in the properties of these tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1540704693,"Abstract The preparation of a subcellular fraction from bovine adrenal cortex is described. Characterization by electron microscopy, electron microscopic cytochemistry, and enzymatic assay indicates that this fraction is enriched plasma membranes. The preparation binds the steroidogenically active [Gln5] [14C-Phe7] corticotropin1–20 amide. The specificity of this binding is demonstrated by competitive binding studies with pig corticotropin as well as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) fragments and analogs. The membrane preparation contains an adenylate cyclase sensitive to both sodium fluoride and corticotropin1–24. Corticotropin11–20 amide binds to the membranes but fails to activate adenylate cyclase. This membrane preparation provides a means to correlate peptide structure and in vivo corticotropic activity with selective binding and adenylate cyclase activation. The observation that corticotropin11–20 amide binds to the membranes but does not activate the adenylate cyclase supports the previous hypothesis that major binding sites of the ACTH molecule reside in this portion of the sequence. Two peptides exhibiting significantly higher in vivo adrenocorticotropic activity than ACTH from natural sources were only weakly active in stimulating the membrane adenylate cyclase. The experimental results strongly suggest that the membrane preparation contains an ACTH receptor."

https://openalex.org/W118218530,"The activity of acyl-CoA:dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase in rat liver was studied by measuring the formation of labeled lipid from dihydroxyacetone [32P]phosphate and either palmitoyl-CoA or a mixture of palmitate, CoA, and ATP. Bovine serum albumin stimulated the activity of the enzyme several-fold. In the presence of albumin the acyltransferase activity in mitochondria was much higher than in microsomes. The labeled lipid was identified as acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate by its chromatographic and chemical properties. The acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate-synthesizing enzyme was also present in particulate fractions of rat kidney, heart, testis, spleen, brain, and adipose tissue. The formation of glycerolipid from dihydroxyacetone phosphate in rat liver mitochondria and microsomes was also studied by using [1-14C]palmitate, ATP, CoA, and other cofactors. [14C]Acyl dehydroxyacetone phosphate was the principal product in both mitochondria and microsomes. Phosphatidic acid and neutral glycerides were formed when either NADPH or NADH was also included in the reaction mixture. However, the major amount of glycerides formed in the presence of NADH was, possibly, due to the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate. The glycerol 3-phosphate was formed in the reaction mixture by the reduction of the added dihydroxyacetone phosphate with NADH, catalyzed by the glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) present in the mitochondrial or microsomal fractions. This activity of the glycerophosphate dehydrogenase could not be removed from mitochondrial or microsomal particles by repeated washings with 0.25 m sucrose."

https://openalex.org/W1566994129,"Abstract An improved purification scheme is presented for the putrescine oxidase of Micrococcus rubens. The procedure exploits the heat stability of the reduced form of the enzyme and utilizes conventional fractionation procedures. Disc gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation criteria demonstrate that the 250-fold purified preparation is essentially homogeneous (g95%). The hydrodynamic properties of putrescine oxidase have been determined in the ultracentrifuge at 20°. s020,w = 6.15 s, D20,w = 6.78 x 10-7 cm2 s-1 and the molecular weight = 88,000. A partial specific volume, v, of 0.730 ml per g was determined from the amino acid composition. Spectrophotometric analysis of flavin released from the holoenzyme shows that the oxidase contains one FAD moiety per 82,000 daltons. Additional criteria support the conclusion that putrescine oxidase is unique among flavoprotein oxidases in that it is a one flavin enzyme. The extinction coefficient at the 458 nm maximum is 10,800 m-1 cm-1 and e275/e458 = 10.6. E1%cm,280 = 10.0 for the flavin-free apoenzyme. Putrescine produces a rapid bleaching of the flavin spectrum of putrescine oxidase with no appearance of long wave length (540 to 600 nm) absorbance. Photoreduction in the presence of EDTA slowly transforms the enzyme to the red type semiquinone with an associated EPR spectrum, features characteristic of other flavoprotein oxidases. Unlike other oxidases, however, the enzyme is unaffected by SO3- and, in addition, is active as a weak 2-mercaptoethanol oxidase. Steady state kinetic experiments established that Vmax = 100 moles per s per mole of FAD and Km = 3.8 x 10-5 m for putrescine and 1.24 x 10-4 m for O2 at 20°. The reaction has an activation energy of 8200 cal per mole. Cadaverine acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of putrescine oxidation with Ki = 2.8 x 10-4 m."
https://openalex.org/W1551555200,"Abstract Poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) (poly(ADP-ribose)) which is normally synthesized in chromatin is also synthesized from NAD by soluble extracts of animal organs prepared in 0.5 m NaCl, KCl, or NH4Cl. Extracts of thymus, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen are the most active. The enzymically active species in liver extracts is a complex, somewhat larger than 120,000 daltons, containing ADP-ribose transferase and nucleoprotein. The synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) is inhibited by DNase and is often stimulated by double-stranded DNA, especially in tissue extracts which have been stored for several days at -20°. Heat-denatured DNA inhibits. Net accumulation of ADP-ribose ceases after a few minutes incubation when the rate of polymer synthesis equals its rate of hydrolysis by endogenous enzymes. The maximum incorporation at 37° is less than that at 20°. Poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis is inhibited by nicotinamide, EDTA, GTP, adenine and derivatives of imidazole. Very small quantities of radioactively labeled NAD can be assayed accurately by reacting the NAD completely with partially purified elongation factor 2 in the presence of activated diphtheria toxin and then counting the ADP-ribosyl EF-2 formed. This provides the basis for a sensitive assay for enzymes that hydrolyze NAD."

Fluorescence spectra and polarization measurements indicate that the hormone is bound to lysolecithin micelles. Since the rate of micelle dissociation below its critical micelle concentration is rather slow, binding is observed at all concentrations of lysolecithin. By similar criteria, the polypeptide hormone calcitonin, but not adrenocorticotropic hormone, was bound to lysolecithin micelles. Phosphatidyl serine showed very weak binding and lecithin no binding of glucagon. The colloidal properties of lysolecithin were evaluated from its interactions with two fluorescent dyes, i.e. eosin and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate."

https://openalex.org/W1570473966,"Abstract A systematic study was carried out of the subcellular distribution of hormone-sensitive lipase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase in rat adipocytes and the changes in these enzymes when the cells were incubated with epinephrine. Under the conditions of homogenization used, approximately one-third of the total hormone-sensitive lipase activity was associated with the fat cake floated to the top of a homogenate by low speed centrifugation, although as discussed in detail, this value remains uncertain in view of technical problems faced in assaying lipase tightly bound to fat. Subfractionation of the fat-free homogenate showed that over 80% of the hormone-sensitive lipase was recovered in the soluble fraction and the specific activity of that fraction was considerably higher than it was in particulate fractions. The plasma membrane fraction contained less than 2% and the microsomal fraction less than 3% of the activity in the fat-free homogenate. When adipocytes were lysed, over 80% of the total lipase activity was recovered in the supernatant fraction and less than 20% in the fat cell ghosts. The distribution of lipase activity among subcellular fractions of the fat-free homogenate was not altered by previous treatment of the adipocytes with epinephrine. Lipase activity in the soluble fraction from control cells was activated by treatment with cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase and MgATP. When the cells had been previously treated with epinephrine, the percentage of activation by protein kinase was reduced in this and in all fractions. Phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase activity were found predominantly in the soluble fraction; small amounts (21 and 14%, respectively) were associated with the fat cake assayed after resuspension in Triton X-100. The distribution of these enzymes in cells previously treated with epinephrine was not significantly different from that in control cells. Total phosphorylase activity (assayed in the presence of 5'-AMP) was significantly increased in homogenates prepared from cells previously treated with epinephrine as was the ratio of phosphorylase activities measured in the absence and in the presence of 5'-AMP. On the other hand, there was no change in total phosphorylase kinase activity after epinephrine treatment and no change in the ratio of activities measured at low pH values (6.2 or 6.8) and high pH value (8.2). Further characterization of the phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase systems in adipose tissue is needed to assess the regulatory role of phosphorylase kinase in this tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1484812486,Abstract Escherichia coli glutamyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase acylates the three homologous tRNAglu isoacceptors with very similar Km values (2.4 to 4.6 x 10-7 m). The pure enzyme forms a 1:1 complex with its cognate tRNA as judged by gradient centrifugation and fluorescence-quenching studies. The biological specificity of complex formation is not strictly observed in vitro since fluorescence-quenching studies demonstrate complexes of this enzyme with Escherichia coli tRNAval and tRNAleu. Studies on the protection by tRNAglu against heat inactivation of the enzyme give a binding constant of 3.6 x 10-7 m for this interaction. Experiments performed in this paper indicate a concerted mechanism of glutamyl-tRNA formation.
https://openalex.org/W1578508427,"Abstract Yeast NAD synthetase was purified 2,000-fold. The purified enzyme gave one protein band on disc gel electrophoresis and was found to be monodisperse on high speed equilibrium ultracentrifugation with an apparent molecular weight for the native enzyme of 630,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed the presence of apparent nonidentical subunits with molecular weights of 80,000 and 65,000. The amino acid composition of native enzyme revealed no unusual amino acid residues. The specificity of the substrates, nucleoside triphosphate requirement, and divalent and monovalent metal ion requirements were studied. Nicotinate adenine dinucleotide, but not nicotinate mononucleotide, is the amide acceptor, and glutamine or free ammonia is the amide donor. The enzyme is specific for ATP, exhibiting a stoichiometric cleavage into AMP and PPi during the amidation. Mg2+ and K+ are required for enzymatic activity. Mn2+ or Co2+ can replace Mg2+ to a certain extent. NH4+ is as effective as K+ in stimulating enzymatic activity. The enzyme displays a broad peak of activity between pH 6.2 and 8.4, with maximal activity being observed around pH 7.6 when l-glutamine is used as the amide donor. However, when ammonium chloride is employed as the substrate, the enzymatic activity exhibits a rather narrow peak between pH 8.4 and 8.8. The apparent Km values for nicotinate adenine dinucleotide, ATP, and l-glutamine at pH 7.6 were found to be 1.9 x 10-4, 1.7 x 10-4, and 5 x 10-3 m, respectively. The Km for NH4Cl at pH 8.6 is 6.4 x 10-3 m. The catalytic constant was calculated to be approximately 1,260 moles of NAD produced per min per mole of enzyme, based on a molecular weight of 630,000. When the enzyme was previously incubated with azaserine, nicotinate adenine dinucleotide, and ATP, glutamine-dependent activity was progressively inhibited as a function of prior incubation time, whereas with NH4Cl as the amide donor there was an initial 20% inhibition and then NH4Cl-dependent activity remained constant. p-Chloromercuribenzoate and heavy metals inhibit both glutamine- and NH4Cl-dependent activity. Hydroxamate analogues were formed when (nicotinate adenine dinucleotide + ATP) and/or glutamine were incubated with enzyme and hydroxylamine. Hydroxamate analogues were not formed from nicotinate adenine dinucleotide unless ATP was also present. Hydroxamate analogue formation was additive when glutamine, nicotinate adenine dinucleotide, and ATP were added."

The pure complex appeared as a single band on polyacrylamide gels, and the activities of the two enzymes showed the same profiles on an isoelectric focusing column. No other enzyme of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle could be detected in the complex. The complex was unstable, so that after 48 hours the activity of phosphoribulokinase was reduced by 80% and that of fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase by 50%.

https://openalex.org/W1607328246,"Abstract Nuclear membrane NADH-cytochrome c reductase resembled the microsomal reductase in its insensitivity to rotenone and antimycin A. The trypsin-resistant nature of these two activities distinguished them from the rotenone, antimycin A-insensitive activity of outer mitochondrial membranes. Furthermore, the nuclear and microsomal NADH-cytochrome b5 reductases were similar in sulfhydryl inhibition and the protection by NADH against inhibition. Cytochrome c oxidase in nuclear membranes resembled the mitochondrial oxidase in cytochrome a,a3 content and inhibition by cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide, but was more heat labile than its mitochondrial counterpart. Nuclear tetrachlorohydroquinone oxidase activity was revealed only at higher protamine concentrations than that optimal for the mitochondrial activity. NADH oxidase activity was cytochrome c dependent, and an 8-fold higher concentration of exogenous cytochrome c was needed for maximal activity as compared to mitochondrial NADH oxidase. The nuclear NADH oxidase was inhibited by cyanide, azide, carbon monoxide, and a sulfhydryl reagent, but not by rotenone, antimycin A, and when NADH is added prior to the sulfhydryl reagent. Moreover, the NADH oxidase was more resistant to histone inhibition, but behaved similar to the mitochondrial oxidase in blockage and reversal of the inhibition by polyanions."
https://openalex.org/W1528133927,"Abstract Fe2+ at a concentration of 1 mm caused 50% inhibition of oxygen uptake with all substrates tested (except ascorbate). Fe2+ had no effect on oxidative phosphorylation, ATP-energized reduction of NAD+ by succinate, ATP-energized reduction of NADP+ by NADH, or on substrate or ATP-supported accumulation of Ca2+, but was effective in stimulating ATPase activity under a variety of conditions. It was concluded that Fe2+ was not an inhibitor of energy utilization by the mitochondria. Fe3+ resembled Fe2+ in stimulating ATPase activity and inhibiting oxygen uptake. However, in addition, Fe3+ at concentrations of 0.25 to 0.5 mm inhibited oxidative phosphorylation, the energized reduction of pyridine nucleotides, and energized Ca2+ accumulation. Sites in the respiratory chain sensitive to Fe3+ were localized in the succinateubiquinone segment of the respiratory chain, on the oxygen side of the flavin moiety of succinate dehydrogenase, and in the NADH-ubiquinone segment of the respiratory chain on the oxygen side of the component (nonheme iron?), which reacts with ferricyanide. It is suggested that Fe3+ may inhibit energy-linked reactions by reacting with those thiols or nonheme iron proteins which have been implicated by others as playing a role in the coupling process. The effects of Cu2+ on mitochondrial metabolism resembled those of Fe3+, except that Cu2+ was a much more potent inhibitor. All of the above mentioned energy-linked reactions were completely inhibited by 10 to 25 µm Cu2+. Oxygen uptake was inhibited at higher Cu2+ concentrations (50 to 100 µm), while ATPase activity showed the least sensitivity to Cu2+, there being 50% inhibition at 500 µm Cu2+. Cu2+ was also capable of displacing Ca2+ that had already been bound by the mitochondria in an energy-dependent reaction. This displacement was independent of any effect of Cu2+ on energy production and points to the ability of Cu2+ to inhibit the binding of Ca2+ to its specific binding sites. Cu2+ inhibited all those reactions in which succinate acted as the electron donor, and it appears as though Cu2+ inhibits succinate dehydrogenase directly. A Cu2+-sensitive site was also present in the NADH-ubiquinone segment, beyond that component which reacted with ferricyanide. It is suggested that Cu2+ inhibits energy-linked reactions in a similar manner as do the mercurials, i.e. by reacting with essential thiol groups of the coupling process."

https://openalex.org/W2158600,"Abstract Replicating DNA molecules of SV40 labeled with [3H]thymidine in the newly synthesized strands were examined by sedimentation in neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients after cleavage by the Escherichia coli B restriction endonuclease. This nuclease creates 1 double strand break per superhelical SV40 DNA molecule. An intermediate in the cleavage of labeled replicating molecules was identified with a sedimentation coefficient of 18.5 S at neutral pH. The final product sedimented as a band with a broad peak between 11 S and 14 S in neutral sucrose gradients. Since linear, duplex SV40 DNA sediments at 14 S in neutral sucrose, the sedimentation characteristics of the final cleavage products were inconsistent with those expected for molecules containing between 1 and 2 times the mass of SV40 DNA. When young or partially (l50%) replicated and nearly fully (g80%) replicated molecules were cleaved by the nuclease, the newly synthesized strands in each case remained intact as judged by alkaline sucrose sedimentation. Since cleavage of replicating molecules by this enzyme occurs only in the unreplicated region, the site of cleavage may be near a specific initiation site for DNA replication or at the replication fork. Replicating molecules prepared with [14C]thymidine in the template strands and [3H]thymidine in the newly synthesized strands revealed a dissociation of the newly synthesized strands from the template strands after cleavage. This result suggests that the template strands must be intact at or very near either the initiation site or the replication fork in order to stabilize the secondary structure of the replicating molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1551495688,"Abstract An RNA phosphodiesterase of molecular weight about 100,000 was purified 330-fold from the cell-free culture fluid of a Bacillus species grown on RNA as the sole source of phosphorus. In the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, this nuclease catalyzes hydrolysis of high molecular weight RNA and synthetic polyribonucleotides, but not of DNA, dinucleoside monophosphates, 2',3'- or 3',5'-cyclic nucleotides or adenylate oligonucleotides terminating in a 2',3'-cyclic adenylic acid residue. While the initial products are nucleoside 5'-phosphates, nucleosides eventually are formed due to the presence of a 5'-nucleotidase activity which purifies together with the phosphodiesterase. These two activities, which are not separable by acrylamide gel electrophoresis or by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, account for the ability of the organism to grow on RNA as a sole source of phosphorus. Polymer cleavage appears to proceed from the 3'-hydroxyl terminus and to be exonucleolytic. Oligonucleotides characteristic of endonucleolytic degradation are not formed as intermediates during hydrolysis of RNA, and ApCpC and CpCpA are hydrolyzed to ApC plus cytidine and CpC plus adenosine, respectively. Ribose- or deoxyribose-nucleoside 5'-phosphates, but not nucleoside 2'- or 3'-phosphates, are good substrates for the 5'-nucleotidase activity."
