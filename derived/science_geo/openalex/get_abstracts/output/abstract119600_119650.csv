https://openalex.org/W2094334993,"To identify CAP3 and CAP4, components of the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) death-inducing signaling complex, we utilized nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, a recently developed technique to sequence femtomole quantities of polyacrylamide gel-separated proteins. Interestingly, CAP4 encodes a novel 55 kDa protein, designated FLICE, which has homology to both FADD and the ICE/CED-3 family of cysteine proteases. FLICE binds to the death effector domain of FADD and upon overexpression induces apoptosis that is blocked by the ICE family inhibitors, CrmA and z-VAD-fmk. CAP3 was identified as the FLICE prodomain which likely remains bound to the receptor after proteolytic activation. Taken together, this is unique biochemical evidence to link a death receptor physically to the proapoptotic proteases of the ICE/CED-3 family."
https://openalex.org/W1965019797,"We examined the ability of chemokine receptors and related G protein-coupled receptors to facilitate infection by primary, clinical HIV-1 isolates. CCR5, when expressed along with CD4, the HIV-1 receptor, allowed cell lines resistant to most primary HIV-1 isolates to be infected. CCR3 facilitated infection by a more restricted subset of primary viruses, and binding of the CCR3 ligand, eotaxin, inhibited infection by these isolates. Utilization of CCR3 and CCR5 on the target cell depended upon the sequence of the third variable (V3) region of the HIV-1 gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein. The ability of various members of the chemokine receptor family to support the early stages of HIV-1 infection helps to explain viral tropism and beta-chemokine inhibition of primary HIV-1 isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2032417513,"Fas/APO-1 and p55 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (p55-R) activate cellular mechanisms that result in cell death. Upon activation of these receptors, Fas/APO-1 binds a protein called MORT1 (or FADD) and p55-R binds a protein called TRADD. MORT1 and TRADD can also bind to each other. We have cloned a novel protein, MACH, that binds to MORT1. This protein exists in multiple isoforms, some of which contain a region that has proteolytic activity and shows marked sequence homology to proteases of the ICE/CED-3 family. Cellular expression of the proteolytic MACH isoforms results in cell death. Expression of MACH isoforms that contain an incomplete ICE/CED-3 region provides effective protection against the cytotoxicity induced by Fas/APO-1 or p55-R triggering. These findings suggest that MACH is the most upstream enzymatic component in the Fas/APO-1- and p55-R-induced cell death signaling cascades."
https://openalex.org/W2127001212,"The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), pits of the palms and soles, jaw keratocysts, a variety of other tumors, and developmental abnormalities. NBCCS maps to chromosome 9q22.3. Familial and sporadic BCCs display loss of heterozygosity in this region, consistent with the gene being a tumor suppressor. A human sequence (PTC) with strong homology to the Drosophila segment polarity gene, patched, was isolated from a YAC and cosmid contig of the NBCCS region. Mutation analysis revealed alterations of PTC in NBCCS patients and in related tumors. We propose that a reduction in expression of the patched gene can lead to the developmental abnormalities observed in the syndrome and that complete loss of patched function contributes to transformation of certain cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2131376910,"Here, we show that the β-chemokine receptor CKR-5 serves as a cofactor for M-tropic HIV viruses. Expression of CKR-5 with CD4 enables nonpermissive cells to form syncytia with cells expressing M-tropic, but not T-tropic, HIV-1 env proteins. Expression of CKR-5 and CD4 enables entry of a M-tropic, but not a T-tropic, virus strain. A dual-tropic primary HIV-1 isolate (89.6) utilizes both Fusin and CKR-5 as entry cofactors. Cells expressing the 89.6 env protein form syncytia with QT6 cells expressing CD4 and either Fusin or CKR-5. The β-chemokine receptors CKR-3 and CKR-2b support HIV-1 89.6 env-mediated syncytia formation but do not support fusion by any of the T-tropic or M-tropic strains tested. Our results suggest that the T-tropic viruses characteristic of disease progression may evolve from purely M-tropic viruses prevalent early in virus infection through changes in the env protein that enable the virus to use multiple entry cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W2028093783,"We report the expression cloning and characterization of GDNFR-α, a novel glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface receptor for glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). GDNFR-α binds GDNF specifically and mediates activation of the Ret protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK). Treatment of Neuro-2a cells expressing GDNFR-α with GDNF rapidly stimulates Ret autophosphorylation. Ret is also activated by treatment with a combination of GDNF and soluble GDNFR-α in cells lacking GDNFR-α, and this effect is blocked by a soluble Ret–Fc fusion protein. Ret activation by GDNF was also observed in cultured embryonic rat spinal cord motor neurons, a cell type that responds to GDNF in vivo. A model for the stepwise formation of a GDNF signal-transducing complex including GDNF, GDNFR-α, and the Ret PTK is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W2086779374,"Eukaryotic cells contain many fibrillarin-associated small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that possess long complementarities to mature rRNAs. Characterization of 21 novel antisense snoRNAs from human cells followed by genetic depletion and reconstitution studies on yeast U24 snoRNA provides evidence that this class of snoRNAs is required for site-specific 2'-O-methylation of preribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA). Antisense sno-RNAs function through direct base-pairing interactions with pre-rRNA. The antisense element, together with the D or D' box of the snoRNA, provide the information necessary to select the target nucleotide for the methyltransfer reaction. The conclusion that sno-RNAs function in covalent modification of the sugar moieties of ribonucleotides demonstrates that eukaryotic small nuclear RNAs have a more versatile cellular function than earlier anticipated."

https://openalex.org/W1988707760,"The molecular basis for the distinctive cytokine expression of CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) subsets remains elusive. Here, we report that the proto-oncogene c-maf, a basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor, controls tissue-specific expression of IL-4. c-Maf is expressed in Th2 but not Th1 clones and is induced during normal precursor cell differentiation along a Th2 but not Th1 lineage. c-Maf binds to a c-Maf response element (MARE) in the proximal IL-4 promoter adjacent to a site footprinted by extracts from Th2 but not Th1 clones. Ectopic expression of c-Maf transactivates the IL-4 promoter in Th1 cells, B cells, and nonlymphoid cells, a function that maps to the MARE and Th2-specific footprint. Furthermore, c-Maf acts in synergy with the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-ATp) to initiate endogeneous IL-4 production by B cells. Manipulation of c-Maf may alter Th subset ratios in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2047460928,"Mutations of the BRCA1 gone in humans are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers. We show here that Brca1+/- mice are normal and fertile and lack tumors by age eleven months. Homozygous Brca1(5-6) mutant mice die before day 7.5 of embryogenesis. Mutant embryos are poorly developed, with no evidence of mesoderm formation. The extraembryonic region is abnormal, but aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos does not rescue the lethality. In vivo, mutant embryos do not exhibit increased apoptosis but show reduced cell proliferation accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin E and mdm-2, a regulator of p53 activity. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is dramatically increased in the mutant embryos. Buttressing these in vivo observations is the fact that mutant blastocyst growth is grossly impaired in vitro. Thus, the death of Brca1(5-6) mutant embryos prior to gastrulation may be due to a failure of the proliferative burst required for the development of the different germ layers."

https://openalex.org/W2133492775,"Germ line mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes including MLH1 cause hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. To understand the role of MLH1 in normal growth and development, we generated mice that have a null mutation of this gene. Mice homozygous for this mutation show a replication error phenotype, and extracts of these cells are deficient in mismatch repair activity. Homozygous mutant males show normal mating behavior but have no detectable mature sperm. Examination of meiosis in these males reveals that the cells enter meiotic prophase and arrest at pachytene. Homozygous mutant females have normal estrous cycles and reproductive and mating behavior but are infertile. The phenotypes of the mlh1 mutant mice are distinct from those deficient in msh2 and pms2. The different phenotypes of the three types of mutant mice suggest that these three genes may have independent functions in mammalian meiosis."

https://openalex.org/W2062956001,"Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. The NH2-segment, which activates transcription, is connected to membranes by a hairpin anchor formed by two transmembrane sequences and a short lumenal loop. Using H-Ras-SREBP-2 fusion proteins, we show that the NH2-segment is released from membranes by two sequential cleavages. The first, regulated by sterols, occurs in the lumenal loop. The second, not regulated by sterols, occurs within the first transmembrane domain. The liberated NH2-segment enters the nucleus and activates genes controlling cholesterol synthesis and uptake. Certain mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells are auxotrophic for cholesterol because they fail to carry out the second cleavage; the NH2-segment remains membrane-bound and transcription is not activated."
https://openalex.org/W2088966640,"The gene cul-1 (formerly lin-19) is a negative regulator of the cell cycle in C. elegans. Null mutations cause hyperplasia of all tissues. cul-1 is required for developmentally programmed transitions from the G1 phase of the cell cycle to the G0 phase or the apoptotic pathway. Moreover, the mutant phenotype suggests that G1-to-S phase progression is accelerated, overriding mechanisms for mitotic arrest and producing abnormally small cells. Significantly, diverse aspects of cell fate and differentiation are unaffected in cul-1 mutants. cul-1 represents a conserved family of genes, designated cullins, with at least five members in nematodes, six in humans, and three in budding yeast."

Here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding a variant of the transcription factor STAT3 (named STAT3β) which was isolated by screening an eosinophil cDNA library.

We found by reconstitution of the human IL-5R in COS cells that like STAT3, STAT3β is phosphorylated on tyrosine and binds to the pIRE from the ICAM-1 promoter after IL-5 stimulation. However, STAT3β fails to activate a pIRE containing promoter in transient transfection assays. Instead, co-expression of STAT3β inhibits the transactivation potential of STAT3.

These results suggests that STAT3β functions as a negative regulator of transcription. Stimulation of transcription factors by cytokines or growth factors is an important step in activating specific gene transcription leading to cell growth, differentiation, and many other cellular functions. To activate or repress transcription, transcription factors must be located in the nucleus, bind DNA, and interact with the basal transcriptional machinery. Most of these processes are achieved by phosphorylation of a transcription factor by protein kinases (1Hunter T.

One of the earliest signaling events after cytokine stimulation is the activation of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, such as members of the Src and Janus kinase (JAK) families (3Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Many individual cytokine receptors are linked to specific members of the JAK family which are activated after ligand binding.

Although STAT3 is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated by IL-5 in these cells, it was only activated to a very low extent in mature eosinophils. Based on this and the observation that multiple STATs are activated by IL-5 in eosinophils (37van der Bruggen T. Caldenhoven E. Kanters D. Coffer P. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.W.J. Koenderman L.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a STAT3 variant which we isolated from the eosinophil cDNA library. This protein (STAT3β) is a truncated form of STAT3 which is probably generated by differential splicing. STAT3 and STAT3β protein are co-expressed in various cell types. We found that STAT3β is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine upon IL-5 stimulation of COS cells. However, although STAT3β efficiently binds to the palindromic IL-6/IFNγ response element (pIRE) from the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) promoter, it is unable to activate a promoter containing this pIRE element. We also demonstrate that STAT3β is a strong dominant inhibitor of transcription. Human eosinophils were isolated from two hyper-eosinophilic individuals according to a slight modification (41Fattah D. Page K.R. Bezbamah S. Priest R.C. Horgan C.M. Solari R.C.E.

The purity of the eosinophils collected was at least 95% as determined by histochemical staining of cytospins with May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain.

Oligonucleotides with the following sequence were used in this study (only the top strand is shown): the human ICAM-1 pIRE, 5′-AGCTTAGGTTTCCGGGAAAGCAC-3′. The 2xpIREtkluc and pICAM1-339 reporter constructs has been described by Caldenhoven et al. (43Caldenhoven E. Coffer P. Yuan J. van de Stolpe A. Horn F. Kruijer W. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol.

Cytokine Network. 1994; 5: 35-42PubMed Google Scholar) into the Not/KpnI sites of pSG513. pSGhIL5Rβ was constructed by inserting the cDNA for the human βc subunit from pSV532 (36Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI sites of pSG513. The expression vectors containing the cDNAs for hSTAT1, mSTAT3, and hSTAT4 were provided by Dr. James E. Darnell, Jr. (7Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell J.E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 11Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). The hSTAT6 cDNA was provided by Dr. Steven L. McKnight (17Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Full-length STAT cDNAs were used for the screening of the cDNA library. The hSTAT3 and hSTAT3β were isolated from the eosinophil cDNA library and cloned into the EcoRI site of PSG513. For transfection experiments, COS cells were split 1:3 in 6-well plates (Costar), and 2 h later the cells were transfected with 10-20 µg of supercoiled plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (46Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1973; 2: 607-616Google Scholar). Following 16-20 h exposure to the calcium-phosphate precipitate, medium was refreshed, and cells were incubated for 16 h with IL-5. Transfected cells were subsequently harvested for luciferase assay (47Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar) and lacZ determination (48Kress C. Vogels R. de Graaf W. Bonnerot C. Meijlink F. Nicolas J.F. Deschamps J. Development. 1990; 109: 775-786PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated and IL-5 stimulated COS cells following a previously described procedure (49Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in the cohesive ends with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Gel retardation assays were carried out according to published procedures with slight modifications (5Fu X.Y. Kessler D.S. Veals S.A. Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8555-8559Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts (10 µg) were incubated in a final volume of 20 µl, containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 2 µg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia), 20 µg of bovine serum albumin, and 1.0 ng of 32P-labeled ICAM1-pIRE oligonucleotide for 20 min at room temperature. In competition experiments, extracts were incubated for 5 min with the indicated molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. Supershift analysis were performed by preincubating 10 µg of nuclear extract with 1 µl (1 µg) of anti-STAT3 antibody for 30 min on ice prior to addition of the binding buffer and 32P-labeled probe. Unstimulated and IL-5 stimulated COS cells were incubated with RIPA lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA, Na3VO4, 10 mg/ml aprotinine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged to remove DNA and cellular debris. The cell lysates were incubated with the anti-STAT3 polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C, washed three times with lysis buffer, and boiled in 1 × Laemmli's sample buffer. The proteins were electrophoresed on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking in TBST (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.3% Tween 20) with 5% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was either incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) monoclonal antibody, or with the polyclonal anti-STAT3 antibody. After washing three times with TBST the membrane was incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit antibodies, respectively. In both cases the membrane was washed five times with TBST and immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). Between the incubation with 4G10 and STAT3 antibodies the membrane was stripped with 1% SDS, 30 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mMβ-mercaptoethanol for 2 × 15 min at 55°C. In order to identify new STAT proteins expressed in eosinophils that may play a role in IL-5 signaling, an eosinophil cDNA library was screened with a labeled probe containing the full-length STAT cDNAs of hSTAT1, mSTAT3, hSTAT4, and hSTAT6. After low stringency screening of the cDNA library, several positive phage clones were isolated. The inserts of these clones were characterized by Southern hybridization and sequencing. All the isolated clones encode known STAT proteins including hSTAT3, hSTAT4, and hSTAT6. However, one of the STAT3 positive cDNA clones showed a different restriction pattern compared to the wild type STAT3 cDNA. Sequencing of this clone revealed that it is almost identical to STAT3 but lacks an internal part of 50 base pairs, covering nucleotides 2145-2195 near the COOH terminus (Fig. 1A). This deletion removes codons 716 to 732 and in addition causes a shift in the open reading frame resulting in the formation of a stop codon after 7 amino acids (Fig. 1B). This truncated STAT3 mRNA encodes a protein consisting of the first 715 amino acids of STAT3 plus an additional 7 unique amino acids. Comparison of the amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal region shows that this truncated STAT3 protein contains the tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 704, but lacks the conserved PMSP sequence which is a substrate for a serine kinase (50Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on published work (7Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell J.E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) identifying a splice variant of STAT1 named STAT1β, it is likely that the truncated form of STAT3 results from an alternative splicing event as well. We therefore designated the STAT3 clone with this internal deletion as STAT3β. To determine whether this isoform is not a cloning artifact we performed a polymerase chain reaction experiment with internal primers depicted in Fig. 1A on mRNA from the cell types mentioned below. As expected, two polymerase chain reaction products were formed a 300-base pair fragment and a minor 250-base pair fragment (data not shown). Sequencing revealed that these DNA fragments corresponds to the internal regions of STAT3 (300 base pairs) and STAT3β (250 base pairs). Additional evidence that this isoform is not a cloning artifact comes from the independent isolation of this cDNA by Schaefer et al. (51Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), who isolated this cDNA via a two hybrid screen with a N-terminal segment of c-Jun. To investigate the existence of the STAT3β protein and to establish its tissue distribution, we performed a STAT3 immunoprecipitation from different cell types. For this purpose, cell lysates were prepared from U937, HL-60, BaF3 cells, eosinophils, COS cells, and COS cells transfected with the cDNA encoding for STAT3β (COS/STAT3β). The proteins were precipitated with a specific STAT3 antibody directed against residues 626-640 and immunoblotted with this STAT3 antibody. Fig. 2A shows that untransfected COS cells express only a low amount of the 89-kDa STAT3 protein. However, overexpressing STAT3β in COS cells results in the appearance of an 80-kDa protein which comigrated with an endogenously expressed 80-kDa protein in the other cell types analyzed with the STAT3 antibody. The expression of this 80-kDa protein varies between the different cell types studied (Fig. 2A). This 80-kDa protein was also found in blood monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils (data not shown). To ascertain that the endogenously expressed 80-kDa protein was STAT3β, we precipitated the proteins with a STAT3 antibody directed against amino acids 750-769, a domain lacking in the STAT3β protein. Using this antibody we detect only the 89-kDa wild type STAT3 protein in COS/STAT3, COS/STAT3β, U937, and HL-60 cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 5-8). When proteins from these cells were precipitated with STAT3 antibodies directed against residues 629-640, two STAT3 proteins appeared of 89 and 80 kDa, except for the COS/STAT3 cells which shows only the wild type STAT3 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1-4). We therefore conclude that the endogenously expressed 80-kDa protein in primary cells as well as in the cell lines is likely to be STAT3β since it is not recognized by an antibody against the N terminus which is lacking from STAT3β. We have previously shown that STAT3 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after IL-5 treatment in both BaF3 and COS cells (40Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.W.J. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25778-25784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since STAT3β still retains the tyrosine residue necessary for STAT3 activation, we were interested whether STAT3β is phosphorylated on tyrosine after IL-5 stimulation. To test this prediction we co-transfected COS cells with expression vectors encoding both subunits of the IL-5 receptor (IL-5Rα and IL-5Rβ), together with STAT3 or STAT3β. We immunoprecipitated STAT3 from unstimulated and IL-5 stimulated COS cells and tyrosine phosphorylation was then monitored by Western blotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Fig. 2B shows that both wild-type STAT3 and STAT3β are phosphorylated on tyrosine after IL-5 stimulation. However, although the expression of STAT3β protein is less then wild-type STAT3, the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation is higher. In addition, even in the absence of IL-5 signaling, we detected some basal level tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3β, which we have never observed with STAT3. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins leads to dimerization, translocation to the nucleus, and binding to specific binding sites on the DNA. We therefore tested the ability of STAT3β to bind DNA and compared this with wild-type STAT3. COS cells expressing the IL-5R and either wild-type STAT3 or STAT3β were treated with IL-5 for 15 min and nuclear extracts were prepared. When these nuclear extracts were assayed in a gel retardation assay for binding to a 32P-labeled ICAM-1 pIRE, an increase in STAT3 and STAT3β binding was observed after IL-5 treatment (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, however, the STAT3 complex migrated faster than the STAT3β complex. The STAT3β complex is specific because an anti-STAT3 antibody produced a supershift, while STAT1 antiserum had no effect on this complex. Furthermore, the DNA binding activity of STAT3β is higher than STAT3, which is probably due to the higher amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3β proteins observed (Fig. 2B). In addition, we observed some basal level DNA binding activity by STAT3β in unstimulated cells, which is in agreement with the observed tyrosine phosphorylation in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2B). We can conclude that both wild-type STAT3 and STAT3β are tyrosine phosphorylated after IL-5 stimulation which results in an increase in DNA binding of both proteins. To compare the transcriptional activity of STAT3 with STAT3β, we transiently transfected COS cells with expression vectors for the IL-5R, wild-type STAT3, or STAT3β together with a luciferase reporter construct, containing two copies of the pIRE from the ICAM-1 promoter. Transfection of the wild-type STAT3 cDNA shows an IL-5 dependent 15-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 4A). By contrast, transfection of STAT3β gave almost no increase in luciferase activity after IL-5 stimulation. An explanation for this could be that the region which is absent from STAT3β contains a domain important for transactivation. We further determined the effect of STAT3β on transactivation mediated by STAT3. We tested this by co-transfection of an increasing amount of STAT3β expression vector together with a constant amount of STAT3 expression vector. The total amount of DNA was kept constant by adding the pSG5 vector. In this experiment we see that transactivation by STAT3 is already inhibited by low amounts of STAT3β (Fig. 4B). Western blotting indicated that STAT3β expression did not alter the level of STAT3 (data not shown). These results implicate that STAT3β can act as a dominant negative regulator of STAT3-mediated transcription. To make sure that this dominant effect of STAT3β also occurs on a natural promoter we used the ICAM-1 promoter containing the IRE in transient transfections experiments. COS cells were transfected with this reporter construct together with STAT3, STAT3β, or a combination of both STAT proteins and stimulated with IL-5. We found that although STAT3 is an activator of the ICAM-I promoter, STAT3β is transcriptionally inactive on the ICAM-1 promoter and acts as a dominant negative regulator of STAT3-mediated transcription.

During fetal life, T cell development is alpha4 independent, but after birth further production of T cells becomes alpha4 dependent. Precursors for both T and B cells require alpha4 integrins for normal development within the bone marrow. In contrast, monocytes and natural killer cells can develop normally without alpha4 integrins. Thus, there are lymphocyte-specific, developmentally regulated requirements for alpha4 integrins in hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. We also show that alpha4 integrins are essential for T cell homing to Peyer's patches, but not to other secondary lymphoid organs, including spleen, lymph nodes, and intestinal epithelium."

In two independent series of experiments, we used the novel targeted iliac lymph node (TILN) route of immunization, aiming close to the iliac lymph nodes draining the genitorectal mucosa. Rectal challenge with the SIVmac 32H J5 molecular clone in two series induced total protection in four out of seven macaques immunized by TILN, compared with infection in 13 of 14 unimmunized macaques or immunized by other routes (P = 0.025). The remaining three macaques showed either a decrease in viral load ( > 90%) or transient viremia, indicating that all seven TILN-immunized macaques showed total or partial protection (P = 0.001). Protection was associated with significant increase in the iliac lymph nodes of IgA antibody-secreting cells to p27 (P < 0.02), CD8-suppressor factor (P < 0.01), and the chemokines RANTES and MIP-1 beta (P < 0.01)."

This exonuclease activity was dependent on Mg2+ and inhibited by addition of 5 mM nucleoside monophosphates. This exonuclease activity is intrinsic to the wild-type p53 protein: it copurified with p53 during p53 preparation; only purified wild-type p53, but not identically purified mutant p53 proteins displayed exonuclease activity; the exonuclease activity could be reconstituted from SDS gel-purified and urea-renatured p53 protein and mapped to the core domain of the p53 molecule; and finally, purified p53 protein could be UV cross-linked to GMP. A p53-intrinsic exonuclease activity should substantially extend our view on the role of p53 as a “guardian of the genome.”"

We introduced two Hoxd transcription units, labeled with lacZ, to an ectopic 5' position in the HoxD complex. Early expression of the relocated genes was delayed and resembled that of the neighboring Hoxd-13. At later stages, locus-dependent expression in distal limbs and the genital eminence was observed, indicating that common regulatory mechanisms are used for several genes. These experiments also illustrated that neighboring genes can share the same cis-acting sequence and that moving genes around in the complex induces novel regulatory interferences. These results suggest that high order regulation controls the activation of Hox genes and highlight three important constraints responsible for the conservation of Hox gene clustering."

We determined the tertiary structure of destrin by triple-resonance multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. In spite of there being no significant amino acid sequence homology, we found that the folding of destrin was strikingly similar to that of repeated segments in the gelsolin family, which resulted in a new protein fold group. Sequential dissimilarity of the actin-binding helix of destrin to that of gelsolin explains the Ca2+-independent actin-binding of destrin. Possible mechanisms of phosphorylation-sensitive phosphoinositide-competitive actin binding, of pH-dependent filament severing, and of nuclear translocation with actin in response to stresses, are discussed on the basis of the tertiary structure."
