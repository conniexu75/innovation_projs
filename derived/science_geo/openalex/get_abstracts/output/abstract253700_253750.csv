https://openalex.org/W2033452983,"STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) has recently been proposed to communicate the intracellular Ca2+ stores with the plasma membrane to mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry. Here we describe for the first time that Ca2+ store depletion stimulates rapid STIM1 surface expression and association with endogenously expressed human canonical TRP1 (hTRPC1) independently of rises in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. These events require the support of the actin cytoskeleton in human platelets, as reported for the coupling between type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in the Ca2+ stores and hTRPC1 in the plasma membrane, which has been suggested to underlie the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry in these cells. Electrotransjection of cells with anti-STIM1 antibody, directed toward the N-terminal sequence that includes the Ca2+-binding region, prevented the migration of STIM1 toward the plasma membrane, the interaction between STIM1 and hTRPC1, the coupling between hTRPC1 and type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, and reduced store-operated Ca2+ entry. These findings provide evidence for a role of STIM1 in the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry probably acting as a Ca2+ sensor.

These findings provide evidence for a role of STIM1 in the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry probably acting as a Ca2+ sensor. Cellular stimulation by a number of agonists results in an increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which consists of two components: Ca2+ release from finite intracellular stores and Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane (PM) 3The abbreviations used are: PM, plasma membrane; Cyt D, cytochalasin D; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; hTRPC1, human canonical TRP1; TRPC, transient receptor potential channel; Iono, ionomycin; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SB, Söerscen's buffer; SOCE, store-operated calcium entry; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; TG, thapsigargin; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. channels, which is often required for full activation of cellular functions (1Camello C.

Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), a major mechanism for Ca2+ entry in nonexcitable cells, is a process controlled by the filling state of the intracellular Ca2+ stores (4Putney Jr., J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which the filling state of the intracellular stores is communicated to the PM remains partially understood. Several hypotheses have been presented to explain the activation of SOCE, which involves the release of a putative calcium influx factor from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; indirect coupling), the insertion of Ca2+-permeable channels into the PM, and a direct or conformational coupling. The last suggests a physical interaction between a Ca2+ channel in the PM and a protein in the ER, which might be constitutive (the classic conformational coupling model) or reversible and regulated by the actin cytoskeleton upon store depletion (the de novo conformational coupling model (3Berridge M.

These studies are in agreement with recent works reporting a role for the protein junctate in the activation of SOCE. This protein has been shown to induce and stabilize coupling between IP3Rs and bovine TRPC3 (14Treves S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Moccagatta L. Arnoult C. Grasso C. Schrum A. Ducreux S. Zhu M.X.

The ER is a spatially and functionally heterogeneous organelle with nonuniform distribution of endoplasmic Ca2+-handling proteins, including Ca2+-binding proteins, pumps, and channels. Extracellular stimuli may induce the generation of dynamic ER compartments containing Ca2+-handling proteins that may function as “induced coupling domains” between the ER and PM, thereby facilitating Ca2+ entry into the cell (16Hisatsune C. Mikoshiba K. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : pe53Google Scholar). Among the Ca2+-handling proteins present in the ER, the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1; formerly designated GOK) protein has recently been presented as a messenger linking the ER to PM Ca2+ channels. STIM1 is a Ca2+-binding protein located both in the PM and intracellular membranes, including the ER (17Manji S. Sparker N.J. Williams R.T. van Stekelenburg L. Pearson R.B. Dziadek M. Smith P.J.

Consistent with this, Ca2+ channels in the PM are activated when STIM1 is unable to bind Ca2+ (21Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck J.T. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A.

In addition, expression of EF-hand mutants of STIM1 activates SOCE in Drosophila S2 and Jurkat T cells (21Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck J.T. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A.

In the present study, we have investigated the interaction of STIM1 with endogenously expressed hTRPC1 at resting conditions and upon store depletion and the effect of [Ca2+]i in this process. In addition, we have investigated the role of STIM1 in the activation of SOCE. Our results indicate that Ca2+ store depletion stimulates rapid STIM1 surface expression and association with hTRPC1 independently of rises in [Ca2+]i. These events require the support of the actin cytoskeleton. Electrotransjection with anti-STIM1 antibody prevented the interaction of STIM1 with hTRPC1 and, as well as incubation of nonelectropermeabilized cells with anti-STIM1 antibody, reduced SOCE. These findings are compatible with membrane trafficking underlying de novo coupling of IP3RII to hTRPC1. Materials—Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) and calcein/AM were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Apyrase (grade VII), aspirin, thrombin, thapsigargin (TG), leupeptin, benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dimethyl-BAPTA, SDS, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Ionomycin (Iono) and cytochalasin D (Cyt D) were from Calbiochem. Anti-STIM1 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Anti-hTRPC1 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). Anti-IP3R type II polyclonal antibody (C-20), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ovine anti-mouse IgG antibody (NA931) was from Amersham Biosciences. Protein A-agarose was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Madrid, Spain). Enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents, immobilized streptavidin gel, and EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin were from Pierce. Hyperfilm ECL was from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Platelet Preparation—Platelet suspensions were prepared as previously described (22Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as approved by local ethical committees and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Briefly, blood was obtained from healthy drug-free volunteers and mixed with one-sixth volume of acid/citrate dextrose anticoagulant containing 85 mm sodium citrate, 78 mm citric acid, and 111 mmd-glucose. Platelet-rich plasma was then prepared by centrifugation for 5 min at 700 × g, and aspirin (100 μm) and apyrase (40 μg/ml) were added. For loading with dimethyl-BAPTA, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm dimethyl-BAPTA-AM. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 20 min and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS), pH 7.45, containing 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4 and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 40 μg/ml apyrase. Cell viability was assessed using calcein and trypan blue. For calcein loading, cells were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm calcein-AM at 37 °C and centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in fresh HBS. Fluorescence was recorded from 2-ml aliquots using a Cary Eclipse Spectrophotometer (Varian Ltd., Madrid, Spain). Samples were excited at 494 nm, and the resulting fluorescence was measured at 535 nm. The results obtained with calcein were confirmed using the trypan blue exclusion technique. 95% of cells were viable in our platelet preparations. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Human platelets were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was recorded from 2-ml aliquots of magnetically stirred cellular suspension (2 × 108 cells/ml) at 37 °C using a Cary Eclipse Spectrophotometer (Varian Ltd., Madrid, Spain) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 505 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the fura-2 340/380 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to a established method (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 2.5 min after the addition of CaCl2 (22Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry was corrected by subtraction of the [Ca2+]i elevation due to leakage of the indicator. Ca2+ release by TG + Iono was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 3 min after the addition of the agents (22Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Ca2+ entry and release are expressed as nm·s, as previously described (24Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (22Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500-μl aliquots of platelet suspension (2 × 109 cell/ml) were lysed with an equal volume of radioimmune precipitation buffer, pH 7.2, containing 316 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% SDS, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm benzamidine. Aliquots of platelet lysates (1 ml) were immunoprecipitated by incubation with 2 μg of anti-hTRPC1, anti-STIM1, or anti-IP3R type II antibody and 25 μl of protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes for subsequent probing. Blots were incubated overnight with 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 to block residual protein binding sites. Immunodetection of STIM1, hTRPC1, and IP3R type II was achieved using the anti-STIM1 antibody diluted 1:250 in TBST for 2 h, the anti-hTRPC1 antibody diluted 1:200 in TBST for 1 h, or the anti-IP3R type II antibody diluted 1:500 in TBST for 3 h. The primary antibody was removed, and blots were washed six times for 5 min each with TBST. To detect the primary antibody, blots were incubated for 45 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ovine anti-mouse IgG antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody diluted 1:10,000 in TBST and then exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for 4 min. Blots were then exposed to photographic films. The density of bands on the film was measured using a scanning densitometry. Subcellular Fractionation—Human platelet fractionation was carried out as described previously (26Rosado J.A. Graves D. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, activated and control platelets (2 × 109 cells/ml) were immediately lysed with an equal volume of 2× Triton buffer (2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.2), 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, 2 mm Na3VO4) at 4 °C for 30 min. Platelet lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (cytosolic and membrane fraction) was removed, and the pellet (cytoskeleton-rich fraction) was solubilized into the original volume in Laemmli's buffer (22Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to Western blotting as described previously. Immunofluorescence—Samples of platelet suspension (200 μl; 2 × 108 cells/ml) were transferred to 200 μl of ice-cold 3% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then incubated for 2 h with 1 μg/ml anti-STIM1 antibody. The platelets were then collected by centrifugation and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.62 mm Na2HPO4, 1.09 mm NaH2PO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, and supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. To detect the primary antibody, samples were incubated with 0.02 μg/ml FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 h and washed twice in PBS. Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were excited at 496 nm, and emission was at 516 nm. Reversible Electroporation Procedure—The platelet suspension was transferred to an electroporation chamber containing antibodies at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml, and the antibodies were transjected according to published methods (28Dhar A. Shukla S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9123-9127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Scrutton M.C. Knight D.E. Authi K.S. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 47-66Google Scholar). Reversible electropermeabilization was performed at 4 kV/cm at a setting of 25-microfarad capacitance and was achieved by seven pulses using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell electroporation system (Bio-Rad). Following electroporation, cells were incubated with antibodies for an additional 60 min at 37 °C and were centrifuged at 350 g for 20 min and resuspended in HBS prior to the experiments. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Aliquots of cell suspensions (1 ml) were stimulated with TG + Iono or left untreated. The reaction was terminated with ice-cold Söer-scen's buffer (SB) containing 16 mm Na2HPO4, 114 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 900 × g for 13 min at 4 °C. Cell surface proteins were labeled by resuspending in EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (2.5 mg/12 ml of ice-cold SB) and incubated under mixing for 1 h at 4°C. The biotinylation reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m Tris base, and remaining biotinylating agent was removed by washing the cells in ice-cold SB. Labeled cells were resuspended in PBS and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Labeled proteins were collected by rotating the lysate overnight with streptavidin-coated agarose beads. The beads were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Laemmli's buffer (22Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to Western blotting as described previously. Statistical Analysis—Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant for a difference. Presence and Localization of STIM1 in Human Platelets—Since STIM1 has been presented as a candidate to communicate the filling state of the intracellular Ca2+ stores to the PM (19Roos J.

Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Hancock M.S. Van Stekelenburg L. Eid J.P. Senior P.V. Kazenwadel J.S. Shandala T. Saint R. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochem.

Immunoblotting of platelet whole-cell lysates with the anti-STIM1 antibody revealed the presence of STIM1 in these cells (Fig. 1A, lane 1; n = 6). Detection of STIM1 was not modified when cells were treated with TG (1 μm) plus Iono (50 nm) to deplete the intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 1A, lane 2; n = 6). We have found that STIM1 is mostly located in the cytosolic and membrane fraction and that only a small amount (about 6%) is associated with the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 1, A and B). To further investigate whether Ca2+ store depletion by TG + Iono induces association of STIM1 with the cytoskeleton, Western immunoblot analysis was performed on the “cytoskeletal” and “cytosolic and membrane” fractions of resting and TG + Iono-stimulated platelets. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment of platelets with 1 μm TG, 50 nm Iono for 3 min significantly increases the cytoskeletal association of STIM1 (196 ± 31% of control, Fig. 1B; p < 0.05; n = 6) and reduced the expression of STIM1 in cytosolic and membrane fraction. Surface Expression of STIM1—Recent studies have reported that STIM1 might be located in the membrane of the Ca2+ stores and at the PM (17Manji S. Sparker N.J. Williams R.T. van Stekelenburg L.

Saint R. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). On the basis of the N-terminal location of the epitope recognized by the anti-STIM1 antibody, we have performed a series of immunofluorescence experiments to confirm this hypothesis and further investigate the role of [Ca2+]i in this process. As shown in Fig. 2A, incubation of fixed, nonpermeabilized resting platelets in suspension with 1 μg/ml anti-STIM1 antibody followed by detection using an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody revealed the presence of STIM1 proteins in the cellular surface. The fluorescence observed was not due to nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody as demonstrated by the lower fluorescence detected in samples incubated with this antibody alone (<20% of the fluorescence in the presence of anti-STIM1 antibody). Data presented in Fig. 2A were corrected by subtraction of the fluorescence in the absence of the anti-STIM1 antibody. These findings confirm the presence of STIM1 in the PM in nonstimulated cells. To investigate whether store depletion increased surface expression of STIM1 in the PM, we repeated the experimental protocol using TG + Iono-treated cells. Treatment of human platelets with 1 μm TG, 50 nm Iono for 3 min in a Ca2+-free medium (100 μm EGTA was added) significantly increased the detection of STIM1 in the PM (204 ± 38% of control; Fig. 2A, p < 0.05; n = 6). These findings were confirmed by biotinylation of plasma membrane proteins and collection with streptavidin-coated agarose beads. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were used to identify STIM1. Plasma membrane expression was quantified by scanning densitometry. As shown in Fig. 2B, analysis of biotinylated proteins shows that STIM1 is present in the PM, and its expression significantly increases in cells stimulated with TG + Iono by 71 ± 4% (p < 0.05; n = 6). Similar results were obtained when the studies were performed in BAPTA-loaded cells to prevent changes in [Ca2+]i due to store discharge (store depletion increased the detection of STIM1 in the PM to 194 ± 37% of resting cells; Fig. 2, p < 0.05; n = 6). These findings indicate that Ca2+ store depletion increases surface expression of STIM1, which is independent of rises in [Ca2+]i. To investigate whether migration of STIM1 to the PM is supported by the actin cytoskeleton, we performed a series of experiments in the presence of Cyt D. We have previously demonstrated (24Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) that Cyt D is without significant effect on the actin filament content of nonstimulated platelets when treated for up to 40 min but effectively prevents agonist-stimulated actin filament formation. Inhibition of actin polymerization by treatment for 40 min with 10 μm Cyt D inhibited translocation of STIM1 to the PM upon Ca2+ store depletion by 70% (Fig. 2, p < 0.05; n = 6), suggesting that this process requires actin filament polymerization. Association between STIM1 and hTRPC1—Platelets have been shown to endogenously express hTRPC1 channel in the PM, as well as vascular smooth muscle cells (32Xu S.Z. Beech D.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and a functional interaction between IP3RII in the Ca2+ stores and hTRPC1 has been presented as the most likely mechanism to account for the activation of SOCE in these cells (12Rosado J.A.

Since STIM1 have been proposed to communicate the Ca2+ stores with Ca2+ channels in the PM, the characteristics reported make platelets an ideal cellular model to investigate the interaction between proteins in the Ca2+ stores and PM; therefore, we have tested for the association between STIM1 and hTRPC1 by looking for co-immunoprecipitation from platelet lysates. Immunoprecipitation and subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were conducted using control platelets and platelets in which the intracellular Ca2+ stores had been depleted by 3-min pretreatment with TG (1 μm) and Iono (50 nm) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (100 μm EGTA).

This DNA damage response factor is loaded onto DNA by the Rad24-RFC (replication factor C-like complex with Rad24) clamp loader and ATP. Although Rad24-RFC alone does not bind to naked partial double-stranded DNA, coating of the single strand with single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (replication protein A) causes binding of Rad24-RFC via interactions with RPA.

The Rad17/3/1 clamp is loaded with comparable efficiency onto naked primer/template DNA with either a 3′-junction or a 5′-junction. Remarkably, when the DNA was coated with RPA, loading of Rad17/3/1 at 3′-junctions was completely inhibited, thereby providing specificity to loading at 5′-junctions. However, Rad17/3/1 loaded at 5′-junctions can slide across double-stranded DNA to nearby 3′-junctions and thereby affect the activity of proteins that act at 3′-termini.

These studies show a unique specificity of the checkpoint loader for 5′-junctions of RPA-coated DNA. The implications of this specificity for checkpoint function are discussed. DNA damage elicits a broad range of cellular responses from DNA repair to inhibition of cell cycle progression. DNA damage checkpoints cause the arrest of cells at appropriate points in the cell cycle so that the integrity of the DNA can be restored (1Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). Although damage-induced checkpoints can be executed in many phases of the cell cycle, most of the progress in understanding the molecular details of this process has been made in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, because its execution is unencumbered by complications related to the progression of DNA replication or chromosome segregation. In G1, for the DNA damage checkpoint to be executed in response to UV irradiation, repair of damage needs to be initiated by the nucleotide excision repair machinery (2Giannattasio M. Lazzaro F. Longhese M.P. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that gaps made during the progression of nucleotide excision repair are targets for the checkpoint machinery. Gaps in the double-stranded DNA contain three structural elements, a region of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ssDNA, single-stranded; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein A; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RFC, replication factor C; Rad24-RFC, complex of Rfc2–5 and Rad24; Rad17/3/1, complex of Rad17, Mec3, and Ddc1; pol, DNA polymerase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; nt, nucleotide(s); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: ssDNA, single-stranded; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein A; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RFC, replication factor C; Rad24-RFC, complex of Rfc2–5 and Rad24; Rad17/3/1, complex of Rad17, Mec3, and Ddc1; pol, DNA polymerase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; nt, nucleotide(s); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. a ss-ds DNA junction with a 5′-terminus (5′-junction), and a ss-ds DNA junction with a 3′-terminus (3′-junction). Although the ssDNA is a target for binding by the single-stranded binding protein RPA, the 5′- and 3′-junction can be targeted by a variety of proteins, including nucleases (to either junction), DNA polymerases (to 3′-junctions), and circular clamp proteins. The replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is uniquely targeted to 3′-junctions and in that capacity serves as a processivity factor for several DNA polymerases and for a large number of other proteins that participate in various DNA metabolic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 3Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the PCNA-related checkpoint clamp Rad17/3/1, a heterotrimer composed of the yeast Rad17, Mec3, and Ddc1 subunits. This clamp is the ortholog of the human 9-1-1 clamp, consisting of Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1 subunits. The final steps of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway resulting in inhibition of the cell cycle are well understood (reviewed in Refs. 4Longhese M.P. Clerici M. Lucchini G. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and 5Kai M. Wang T.S. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, molecular details are lacking regarding its initiation. Required for checkpoint initiation are the yeast ataxia telangiectasia-related protein kinase Mec1 and the checkpoint clamp Rad17/3/1 and its loader Rad24-RFC. Mec1 forms a heterodimer with Ddc2, and localization of Mec1/Ddc2 to DNA is mediated by interactions between Ddc2 and the eukaryotic single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (6Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). Loading of the clamp at sites of DNA damage proceeds independently of Mec1 localization (7Sun Z. Fay D.S. Marini F. Foiani M. Stern D.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 8Rouse J. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 857-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The loader Rad24-RFC is a heteropentameric complex that has the four small Rfc2–5 subunits in common with the canonical clamp loader replication factor C (RFC), the loader of PCNA (9Green C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). DNA binding is specified by the clamp loader. Productive binding of RFC proceeds exclusively toward a 3′-junction. Successful loading of PCNA by RFC requires binding of ATP to the Rfc2, Rfc3, and Rfc4 subunits (10Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ATP binding causes opening of the clamp-clamp loader complex, which then is capable of binding template-primer DNA. Hydrolysis of bound ATP causes closing of PCNA around DNA and release of RFC. Substitution of the Rfc1 subunit by Rad24 (hRad17 in humans) endows this alternative complex with the capacity to load Rad17/3/1 onto DNA while abrogating loading of PCNA. Once loaded, the clamp has the ability to slide across double-stranded DNA, although less efficiently than does PCNA (11Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 12Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Several studies have been carried out to determine the DNA substrate specificity for the checkpoint clamp and clamp loader from yeast and from human. We initially showed that yeast Rad24-RFC can load its clamp onto both 3′-junctions and 5′-junctions in an ATP-dependent reaction (12Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made by Zou et al. (13Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, Ellison and Stillman conclude that 5′-junctions constitute the preferred substrate for loading of the human 9-1-1 clamp (14Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 231-243Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It is important to understand the substrate specificity and what factors contribute to it, because this specificity determines whether the clamp binds target proteins, e.g. nucleases, that likely act at 5′- or 3′-junctions. In an effort to find a reconciliation for the apparently contradictory results in DNA-loading specificity, we have carried out a comprehensive biochemical study of the substrate specificity for the yeast checkpoint clamp system. We have concluded that, although loading on naked DNA at both 5′- and 3′-junctions was observed, coating of the ssDNA with RPA strongly inhibited loading onto 3′-junctions, thereby endowing a unique specificity of the checkpoint loader for 5′-junctions. Proteins, Yeast Strains, and DNA—The checkpoint factors and DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) were overproduced in yeast and purified as described previously (12Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14541-14549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The yeast Rpa1-K45E mutation, known as rpa1-t11 (18Umezu K. Sugawara N. Chen C. Haber J.E. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 989-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was generated by tandem PCR with primers containing the desired mutation and using p11d-sctRPA as the template, analogous to that described previously (19Sibenaller Z.A. Sorensen B.R. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12496-12506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The three-subunit protein complex (RPA-t11) was overexpressed in E. coli strain Bl21 (DE3) and purified as described earlier (20Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A truncation mutant of RPA lacking the N-terminal 180-amino-acid domain of Rpa1 (RPA-1Δ) was overproduced in E. coli and purified as described previously (21Bae K.H. Kim H.S. Bae S.H. Kang H.Y. Brill S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in the SPR and replication assays were template oligonucleotide V21 (biotin-5′-TTTGAATTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGACAGCCAAACCAACTTACCATCTGGCCACAGTGCTGCAATGATATT-3′-biotin) and complementary oligos C21-1 (5′-junction, 3′-DS end, 5′-TGTCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGAATTCAAA-3′), C21-2 (3′-junction, 5′-DS end, 5′-AATATCATTGCAGCACTGTGGCCAGATG-3′), C21-3 (3′-junction, 5′-9 nt gap, 5′-GCAGCACTGTGGCCAGATGGTAAGTTGG-3′), and C21-4 (3′-junction, 5′-9 nt gap, 5′-GCAGCACTGTGGCCAGATGGTAAGTTGGTTTGGCTG-3′). When used as primers for replication assays, oligos C21-2, C21-3, and C21-4 were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP before annealing to the template V21. Streptavidin (3-fold molar excess over DNA) was then added to create biotin-streptavidin bumpers at the template ends. The 50-mer 5′-ATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGGTCG-3′ or a derivative with terminal biotin moiety(ies) was hybridized to SS Bluescript DNA followed by the addition of a 3-fold molar excess of streptavidin. Replication Assay—The 40-μl replication assays contained 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgAc2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm each dNTPs, 1 mm ATP or ATPγS, 3.6 nm DNA, either V21/C21-2, V21/C21-3, or V21/C21-4 with the primer 5′-32P-labeled, and when present, 75 nm Rad17/3/1 and 30 nm Rad24-RFC. The reaction was pre-incubated for 2 min at 30 °C before the addition of 2 nm pol δ. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times, quenched in an equal volume of sequencing stop buffer, and analyzed by 8 m urea/16% PAGE. Quantitation was done by phosphorimaging. DNA-Protein Interaction Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was performed in a BIAcore X apparatus. The running buffer used in the analysis contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgAc2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Tween 20, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The DNA chips were prepared as described previously and contained ∼50–100 resonance units of biotinylated DNA attached via streptavidin to an F1 chip (12Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The interaction between Rad24-RFC (30 nm) and Rad17/3/1 (60 nm) with DNA was monitored at 20 °C by injecting, at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, 80 μl of the protein factors and 1 mm ATP over a DNA chip. Coating of the DNA with wild-type or mutant RPA was accomplished by injecting 80 μl of 100 nm RPA across the DNA chip. Regeneration of the chip was accomplished by a 10-μl injection of 1 m NaCl, 0.02% SDS. Gel Filtration Analysis of Clamp Loading—150 fmol of effector DNA was incubated with 250 fmol of Rad24-RFC and 2 pmol of [32P]Rad17/3/1 in buffer A (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 75 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgAc2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 1 mm ATP at 23 °C for 3 min and then loaded onto a 5-ml BioGel A5m column equilibrated in buffer A. The radioactivity in each 6-drop fraction was determined in a scintillation counter. Rad24-RFC Interacts with RPA—Previously, we used an SPR methodology to detect Rad17/3/1 loading onto partial duplex DNA (12Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 15Majka J. Chung B.Y. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20921-20926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These studies allowed us to make the following general conclusions with regard to clamp-clamp loader interactions and loading onto DNA. (i) Loading of Rad17/3/1 requires Rad24-RFC and ATP. (ii) In analogy with the canonical PCNA-RFC system, ATP binding to Rad24-RFC suffices for the formation of a high affinity clamp-clamp loader complex, clamp opening, and formation of a ternary complex with effector DNA, although hydrolysis of the bound ATP results in closure of the clamp around DNA and release of the loader. (iii) Under our standard reaction conditions containing 125 mm NaCl, the measured affinities of the clamp and the loader for each other and for DNA are in the 2–5 nm range. Therefore, we have carried out most of our current studies at 30 nm Rad24-RFC and 60 nm Rad17/3/1, which were saturating under all conditions. A DNA substrate was used consisting of a 71-mer template and a 28-mer primer positioned flush at either end of the template allowing ample ssDNA for binding by RPA. Biotin residues were incorporated at both ends of the template, thereby providing a double anchor to the streptavidin chip. We used a SPR chip containing flexible dextran linkers, anticipating that, on such a chip, both biotins on the template DNA would be able to bind accessible streptavidins (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, although many different binding configurations can be envisaged with such a dual biotin arrangement, when the clamp and clamp loader together with ATP were flowed across a chip charged with 5′-junction DNA, the dissociation phase of the binding curve followed first order kinetics, suggesting that the majority of clamp-clamp loader complexes encounter DNA molecules that are in a similar environment (Fig. 1B). Control experiments showed that only background signal was observed when any two factors were flowed across the chip containing naked DNA: Rad24-RFC with ATP, or Rad17/3/1 with ATP, or Rad24-RFC together with Rad17/3/1 but without ATP (Fig. 1B). However, when the DNA had previously been coated with RPA, strong binding was observed when Rad24-RFC alone was injected, regardless of whether Rad17/3/1 or ATP were also present. This strong binding signal was also observed when Rad24-RFC was flowed over RPA-coated 3′-junction DNA (data not shown). We reasoned that the observed signal resulted from direct interactions between RPA and Rad24-RFC, as had previously been reported for the human complex hRad17-RFC (13Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This strong interaction was mediated through the Rad24 subunit because canonical RFC failed to elicit a signal when injected across a chip with RPA-coated DNA (Fig. 1C). Previously, interactions between RFC and RPA have also been reported, but these were likely too weak to give a positive signal under our assay conditions in buffer containing 125 mm NaCl (22Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 23Kim H.S. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3725-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The presence of the very strong loading-independent signal due to RPA-Rad24 interactions prevented us from determining the role of RPA in the loading process itself. Therefore, we tested mutant forms of RPA that could be expected to show a deficiency for interaction with Rad24. As most RPA-interacting proteins mediate binding through the N-terminal region of the large Rpa1 subunit (24Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar), we assessed whether mutant forms of RPA with mutations in that region would abrogate binding to Rad24-RFC. First, we tested a form of RPA lacking the N-terminal 180 amino acids of Rpa1 (RPA-1Δ). This RPA truncation mutant shows normal binding to ssDNA (21Bae K.H. Kim H.S. Bae S.H. Kang H.Y. Brill S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Bylund G.O. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5445-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, interaction with Rad24 was completely abrogated (Fig. 1C). Next, we tested a mutant RPA containing the Rpa1-t11 mutation (K45E). The rfa1-t11 allele was originally isolated in a genetic screen for damage-sensitive Rpa1 mutants (18Umezu K. Sugawara N. Chen C. Haber J.E. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 989-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rfa1-t11 mutant shows defects in mitotic and meiotic recombination and double strand break repair and affects the adaptation of cells to irreparable double-stranded DNA breaks (18Umezu K. Sugawara N. Chen C. Haber J.E. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 989-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Soustelle C. Vedel M. Kolodner R. Nicolas A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 535-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Lucca C. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 293-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The mutant does not measurably affect DNA replication, and the mutant RPA complex RPA-t11 binds ssDNA in a similar manner as wild-type (data not shown) (28Kantake N. Sugiyama T. Kolodner R.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23410-23417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mutant protein also shows reduced interactions with Ddc2, a subunit of the Mec1/Ddc2 checkpoint kinase (6Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). However, the rfa1-t11 mutant shows only very minor defects in the DNA damage checkpoint (data not shown) (6Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar, 23Kim H.S. Brill S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3725-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Clerici M. Baldo V. Mantiero D. Lottersberger F. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10126-10144Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Remarkably, in our SPR assay, no binding of Rad24-RFC to the mutant RPA (RPA-t11) was observed (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the functionality of the DNA damage checkpoint is relatively insensitive to the strength of the RPA-Rad24 interactions. When either of these two mutant RPAs was used in our checkpoint clamp-loading assay, we detected a robust signal that was dependent on the presence of Rad24-RFC, Rad17/3/1, and ATP (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Moreover, the kinetics of binding and dissociation were independent of the mutant RPA used to coat the DNA. Interestingly, when the DNA was coated with the interaction-defective mutants of RPA, the dissociation kinetics of the clamp-clamp loader were not greatly affected compared with those with naked DNA (koff = 0.018 s–1 without RPA, 0.01 s–1 with RPA-1Δ, and 0.011 s–1 with RPA-t11). In contrast, dissociation of Rad24-RFC alone from DNA coated with wild-type RPA was very slow (koff < 0.001 s–1). As expected, complex kinetics were observed when Rad17/3/1 was loaded by Rad24-RFC onto DNA coated with wild-type RPA, reflecting contributions due to RPA interactions with Rad24-RFC and to the stability of the loaded clamp (Fig. 1B). Thus, the use of RPA mutants allowed us to investigate clamp-loading kinetics on naked versus coated DNA. RPA Inhibits Loading of the Clamp at 3′-Junctions—Having established a loading assay that allows us to investigate the role of RPA without interfering with binding to the clamp loader, we next investigated the role of the effector DNA. We used two template-primer substrates, with each primer providing one unique junction for loading, because the other side of the primer was situated flush against the terminal template biotinstreptavidin moiety. On the 5′-junction substrate, which was also used in the studies presented in Fig. 1, we observed robust loading of Rad17/3/1 in a clamp loader- and ATP-dependent manner. Coating of the DNA with RPA-1Δ or with RPA-t11 resulted in loading with almost the same efficiency (Fig. 2A). However, a radically different result was obtained with the 3′-junction substrate. Although loading of Rad17/3/1 on naked 3′-junction DNA proceeded with high efficiency and in a clamp loader- and ATP-dependent manner, loading on the same effector DNA coated with RPA-1Δ or RPA-t11 was completely abrogated (Fig. 2B). These results not only indicate that the 3′-junction of RPA-coated DNA is inaccessible to the checkpoint system but also that the double-stranded end of the DNA situated against the biotin-streptavidin bumper did not provide an entry site for loading. In a control experiment, we moved the primer downwards on the template so that a 9-nt gap was created between the 5′-end of the primer and the biotin-streptavidin. This gapped substrate (depicted in Fig. 4, right panel) was fully functional for checkpoint clamp loading, even when the DNA was coated with mutant RPA (data not shown).FIGURE 4Clamp loading at 5′-junctions affects activity at nearby 3′-junctions through clamp sliding. Where indicated, Rad17/3/1 (C) was loaded by Rad24-RFC (L) on either 5′-flush-end DNA (V21/C21-2; left panel) or on 5′-gapped DNA (right panel) containing a 28-mer primer (V21/C21-3) or a 36-mer primer (V21/C21-4). Clamp loading was carried out for 2 min at 30 °C with 1 mm ATP or 1 mm ATPγS, indicated as Nucl., and the replication reaction was started at t = 0 by the addition of pol δ and dNTPs. Full-length products, as % of input DNA, were quantitated. The sizes of the ss-gaps are indicated. Details are in “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although RPA provides specificity for checkpoint clamp loading toward 5′-junctions, the exact opposite was observed for PCNA loading by RFC (Fig. 2, C and D). In these studies, we used a version of RFC that lacks the N-terminal 172 amino acids of Rfc1. This domain has been shown to bind phosphorylated 5′-junction DNA, yet this activity is dispensable for PCNA loading (17Gomes X.V. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14541-14549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Allen B.L. Uhlmann F. Gaur L.K. Mulder B.A. Posey K.L. Jones L.B. Hardin S.H.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4308-4317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both nonspecific binding of RFC to 5′-junction DNA and inefficient loading of PCNA on this substrate was completely blocked by coating the DNA with RPA (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, although low-affinity binding of RFC to 3′-junctions was eliminated by RPA, functional loading of PCNA was not (Fig. 2D) (32Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34768-34775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The SPR technique has provided us with a solid and sensitive assay for checkpoint clamp loading, and the results allow for a rigorous comparison with previous analogous studies of PCNA loading by RFC. We wanted to confirm these results using more traditional clamp-loading assays in which primed circular DNA was used as substrate and clamp-DNA complexes were isolated by gel filtration. These assays could only be performed when the ssDNA was coated with RPA, because in its absence, clamp loading was both inefficient and nonspecific, likely because of the presence of large regions of ssDNA (data not shown). However, the assay allowed us to use wild-type RPA, as control experiments showed that very little clamp was associated with the wild-type RPA-coated DNA when either ATP or Rad24-RFC was omitted from the incubation or the ssDNA lacked a primer (Fig. 3) (15Majka J. Chung B.Y. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20921-20926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike with the SPR assay, this assay allowed us to monitor complex formation on DNA coated with wild-type RPA. The clamp was 32P-labeled for ease and accuracy of quantitation. The 3-kb SS Bluescript circle was primed with a 50-mer and loading of [32P]Rad17/3/1 monitored. Blocking of the 5′-end of the primer with biotin and streptavidin substantially reduced loading, whereas blocking of the 3′-end had no effect on the loading efficiency (Fig. 3). Blocking of both the 5′- and 3′-ends yielded the same loading efficiency as did blocking of only the 3′-end. These data are consistent with our conclusion from the SPR studies, i.e. that loading to 3′-junctions is abrogated when the ssDNA is coated with RPA. They also suggest that the inactivity of the 3′-junction merely requires coating of the ssDNA, and either wild-type RPA, RPA-1Δ, or RPA-t11 can fulfill this function. We also determined whether a DNA nick served as a loading site for the checkpoint clamp, but no activity at a nick was observed (Fig. 3). PCNA is loaded at a nick by RFC, as one would expect given its function in base excision repair (33Matsumoto Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, PCNA is not loaded at a nick by the alternative clamp loader Ctf18-RFC (25Bylund G.O. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5445-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After Loading at 5′-Junctions, the Clamp Can Slide to 3′-Junctions—Previously, we have shown that Rad17/3/1 can slide across dsDNA (12Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the course of searches for enzymes that might be stimulated by the checkpoint clamp, we actually noted that Rad17/3/1 inhibited rather than activated pol δ. This inhibition did not appear to be specific, as the activity of E. coli DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment, and that of T7 DNA polymerase was also inhibited by the checkpoint clamp (data not shown). Inhibition requires the clamp loader and ATP and therefore appears to represent the result of bona fide loading of the clamp. We used this inhibition system to further investigate the polarity of clamp loading and clamp sliding. When the checkpoint clamp was loaded onto a 3′-junction substrate with the 5′-end of the primer flush-ended to the biotin streptavidin bumper, very little inhibition of pol δ activity was observed (Fig. 4, left panel; compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 2 and 3). We noted that the lack of inhibition or stimulation of a target DNA polymerase did not allow us to make any conclusions regarding clamp loading as the presence of the clamp on the dsDNA could be transparent to the polymerase. In a control reaction, ATP was replaced by the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS, which inhibits the final step of clamp loading and freezes the clamp at the site of loading (12Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As expected, pol δ activity was inhibited because the 3′-terminus was blocked by the clamp-clamp loader complex (Fig 4.; compare lanes 8 and 9 with lanes 6 and 7). Next, we provided a 9-nt gap to allow loading of the clamp at the 5′-junction (Fig. 4, right panel). A strong inhibition of pol δ activity was observed (compare lanes 13 and 14 with lanes 11 and 12). Control SPR studies showed that the 9-nt gap was sufficient for 5′-junction-mediated loading of Rad17/3/1 (data not shown). These data suggest that Rad17/3/1, after being loaded at the 5′-junction, can slide to the 3′-junction and make the 3′-terminus inaccessible for binding by DNA polymerases. An alternative possibility would be that the mere occupancy of the checkpoint clamp at the 5′-junction would provide a sufficiently large steric bulk to block access to the 3′-terminus. The 5′- and 3′-junction are separated by 28 bp of dsDNA, a distance of ∼90 Å. The width of the PCNA trimer is ∼40 Å, and this sliding clamp covers about one turn of a B-DNA helix (34Krishna T.S. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Based upon the structural homology between the checkpoint clamp and PCNA, we think it unlikely that the checkpoint clamp could extend for 90 Å along dsDNA. However, to exclude that possibility, we further increased the separation between the 5′- and 3′-terminus to 36 nt (or ∼115–120 Å). Checkpoint clamp-dependent inhibition of pol δ activity was still observed (Fig. 4; compare lanes 18 and 19 with lanes 16 and 17), suggesting that the observed inhibition most likely originates from 5′-loading followed by sliding to the 3′-junction. The replication clamp PCNA functions as a processivity factor for DNA polymerases and stimulates the activity of many other proteins in DNA metabolism, generally by increasing their residence time on the DNA. Based upon the structural and functional analogies between PCNA and Rad17/3/1, it has been assumed that the checkpoint clamp fulfills a similar function. In both S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, genetic studies suggest that the DNA damage checkpoint clamp and clamp loader are required for a robust mutagenic response (35Paulovich A.G. Armour C.D. Hartwell L.H. Genetics. 1998; 150: 75-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kai M. Wang T.S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 37Sabbioneda S. Minesinger B.K.

Interactions have been demonstrated between the clamp and DNA polymerase ζ, the major mutagenic enzyme in the eukaryotic cell (37Sabbioneda S. Minesinger B.K. Giannattasio M. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Jinks-Robertson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38657-38665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, these observations have not been verified in vitro; PCNA rather than Rad17/3/1 was shown to be a cofactor for translesion synthesis by pol ζ (38Garg P. Stith C.M. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23446-23450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have identified two enzymes that are stimulated in vitro by the presence of the human 9–1-1 complex, the human ortholog of S. cerevisiae Rad17/3/1. The human 9–1-1 complex stimulates DNA polymerase β activity, primarily by increasing the efficiency of primer recognition by pol β rather than the processivity of polymerization (39Toueille M. El-Andaloussi N. Frouin I. Freire R. Funk D. Shevelev I. Friedrich-Heineken E. Villani G. Hottiger M.O. Hubscher U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The human checkpoint clamp also stimulates FEN1 activity (40Wang W. Brandt P. Rossi M.L. Lindsey-Boltz L. Podust V. Fanning E. Sancar A. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16762-16767Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In these studies, the clamp was not loaded by the hRad17-RFC clamp loader but was allowed to slide onto the double-stranded ends of substrate DNA in a manner that was previously shown to also mediate RFC-independent loading of PCNA (41Burgers P.M. Yoder B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19923-19936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mode of clamp loading by diffusion onto dsDNA ends not only requires a large excess of clamp but also yields products with the clamp positioned in either orientation with regard to the primer-template junction. Therefore, it is not clear which side of the clamp is responsible for mediating the observed stimulation of FEN1 or pol β. For instance, is the increased primer recognition by pol β caused by interaction with the side of the clamp that the loader normally would position at the 3′-terminus or is it with the opposite side of the clamp that would be positioned there after loading at a 5′-junction followed by sliding across intervening dsDNA to the 3′-terminus (Fig. 5A)? The studies described here show that Rad24-RFC is a dual polarity loader of Rad17/3/1 on naked DNA; however, loading of the clamp on 3′-junctions is inhibited when the DNA is coated with RPA (Fig. 2). These results are in agreement with those by Ellison and Stillman (14Ellison V. Stillman B. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 231-243Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar), who carried out their studies on RPA-coated DNA templates. In contrast, they do not support the conclusion from the Elledge group (13Zou L. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) that hRad17-RFC is a dual polarity clamp loader on RPA-coated DNA. However, in their experimental protocol, these authors used a concentration of RPA insufficient to coat the entire ssDNA region of the circular DNA (1 pmol of RPA/pmol of ssDNA circle). Therefore, naked 3′-junctions likely were present and permissive for clamp loading. RPA binds ssDNA with a defined polarity (42Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 43Bochkareva E. Korolev S. Lees-Miller S.P. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The orientation of RPA is such that the N-terminal domain of Rpa1 will be at the 5′-end of the ssDNA and the C-terminal domain at the 3′-end. Consequently, the 5′-junction of primed ssDNA is closest to the N terminus, and the 3′-junction is closest to the C terminus of Rpa1. The mutant forms of RPA containing Rpa1-(ΔN1–180) or Rpa1-t11 (K45E) affect the N-terminal region of Rpa1, leaving the C-terminal region and its inhibitory effect on 3′-junction loading intact. In vivo, where RPA participates in replication and many repair processes, it is anticipated that RPA will bind to most DNA intermediates containing ssDNA, thereby restricting checkpoint clamp loading to 5′-junctions. For instance, during simple checkpoint activation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the ∼30-nt DNA gap produced during the course of nucleotide excision repair would only allow loading of the clamp at 5′-junctions because of RPA binding at the gap. Therefore, under these conditions, the target protein for the checkpoint clamp would most likely be one that acts at 5′-junctions, e.g. a 5′-nuclease, and not a DNA polymerase that acts at 3′-junctions. However, the studies in Fig. 4 suggest that additional checkpoint functionalities could exist when the DNA discontinuities are more complex. If multiple gaps are formed on the DNA, for instance at stalled DNA replication forks, loading of Rad17/3/1 at a 5′-junction could result in its presence at a neighboring 3′-junction because of its ability to slide across double-stranded DNA (Fig. 5B). And if RPA were not present at a gap, perhaps because the gap is too small for RPA binding, all four distinct clamp configurations are conceivable (Fig. 5A). Although the checkpoint clamp is not loaded at a nick (Fig. 3), robust loading was observed at a 9-nt gap. The specificity for checkpoint clamp loading revealed in this study has certain predictive value. In the checkpoint pathway elicited by nucleotide excision repair of DNA damage (2Giannattasio M. Lazzaro F. Longhese M.P. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it is likely that the checkpoint will be functionalized by an enzyme that acts at 5′-junctions, perhaps an exonuclease. On the other hand, to understand checkpoint function in response to more complex forms of DNA damage, it is possible that 3′-junctions can also be of importance. In this regard, it will be important to determine how the polarity of the clamp at a given junction can affect its interactions with a target protein in the checkpoint pathway itself or in a pathway activated by the checkpoint.

Some of these microorganisms are pathogens that can potentially cause disease, whereas most bacteria are neutral or beneficial to the host acting as symbiotic organisms (1Rastall R.A. J.

However, iE-DAP and MDP are rare molecular species of natural PGN-related products (16Höltje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, there is no direct evidence that host recognition of bacteria by Nod proteins is mediated through natural PGN-related molecules that are known to possess Nod1- or Nod2-stimulatory activity. In addition, the structures close to the recognition core in PGN-related molecules that affect the ability to stimulate Nod1 and Nod2 are heterogeneous among bacterial species (14Girardin S.E.

Thus, it is important to determine the ability of individual bacteria to induce Nod1- and Nod2-stimulatory activity to understand the interaction between the host and bacteria.

Because there is no evidence that these diseases are associated with infection of particular pathogenic bacteria, identification of bacteria with strong Nod1- and Nod2-stimulatory activity might be important to understand the functional association between these Nod proteins and disease. In this study, we constructed and screened a library of bacteria randomly isolated from soil samples, referred here as “bacterioarray” for Nod1-stimulatory activity. The analysis revealed that the highest Nod1-stimulatory activity is present in many Bacillus species. Unexpectedly, we also found that the most potent Nod1-stimulatory molecules are not found in bacterial cells, but they are released from growing bacteria into the culture medium. These results suggest that non-pathogenic bacteria might stimulate host cells through Nod1 in the absence of physical contact with bacteria.

For pH stability, synthetic Nod1 ligands were treated with 1 m HCl or NaOH for 12 h at 55 °C and neutralized with 10-fold excess volume of 1 m HEPES (pH 7.4). To determine the stability of bacterial molecules for host stimulation, synthetic ligands or Cellosyl-treated soluble PGN were incubated with HEK293T cells or bone marrow-mϕ. 24 h postincubation the Nod1-stimulatory activity in the medium containing the ligands was determined by the HEK293T bioassay as described (25Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Isolation of Bacteria and Construction of Bacterioarray— Corynebacterium amycolatum NI402, Corynebacterium xerosis NI355, Staphylococcus epidermis NI379, and Rothia mucilaginosa NI343 were isolated from the body of a healthy donor. P. putida NI395 was isolated from a household. Soil bacteria for bacterioarray were isolated from the University of Michigan Arboretum. Soil samples were suspended in water and plated in L-broth and BHI agar. 1920 bacterial colonies were picked up randomly and aerobically cultured with L-broth or BHI medium in 96-well plates at 37 °C for 48 h. Bacterial cells and media were inactivated at 75 °C for 1 h. Reporter HEK1G cells were incubated with the medium containing bacterial cultures and media at 1:100 dilution. 24 h post-stimulation, the cells were suspended in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and NF-κB-dependent transcription activity was determined by GFP intensity using the fluorometer FluoroCount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm. Bacteria were identified by DNA sequencing using primers corresponding to the consensus sequences of 16 S ribosomal RNA genes. The 16 S rDNA was amplified from single bacterial colonies by 35 cycles of PCR at 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, using the broad-range bacterial primers CCAAACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG and CATGGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATC. Amplified products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by QIAEX II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and sequenced from both ends using the same primers. The resulting sequences were subjected to an online BLASTN analysis (NCBI, National Institutes of Health) for bacterial identification. Preparation of Culture Supernatant and Heat-inactivated Bacterial Cell Extracts—Listeria and Corynebacteria were cultured with BHI medium (BD Biosciences). Lactobacilli and L. pneumophila were cultured with MRS and AYE media, respectively (BD Biosciences). Otherwise all bacteria were grown with L-broth medium. All aerobic bacteria were grown in the aerobic conditions and Bacteroides were anaerobically grown with GAM broth (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) with 10% skim milk (BD Biosciences) at 37 °C with vigorous shaking for 24 h. Bacterial growth was monitored by absorbance at 600 nm. Culture supernatant was prepared by filtration of the culture though sterilizing filter (pore size 0.22 μm, Corning, Corning, NY), followed by removal of bacterial cells by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The bacterial pellets were washed with water once, resuspended in the original culture volume of water, and heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 30 min. Infection of L. monocytogenes—Bone marrow-mϕ, RAW267.4, and HEK293, plasmid-transfected HEK293T cells were infected with L. monocytogenes at a multiplicity of infection ratio of 1:10 for 30 min. Extracellular bacteria was removed by washing with medium and killed with 100 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen). 24 h post-infection, infected cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and the NF-κB-dependent transcription was determined as described (25Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nuñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The number of intracellular bacteria was determined by serial dilution of lysate following plating and counting bacterial colonies on L-broth plates. Preparation of Environmental Bacterial Samples—Water-soluble immunostimulatory fractions were isolated from foods, soil, and mouse bedding materials and intestinal contents by the following methods. Different brands of Natto (n = 6) and yogurt (n = 10) were purchased from local grocery stores. Bacteria in these foods were shown in the FDA description labels and verified by 16 S rDNA sequencing as described above. Soil samples (n = 11) were collected under the forests at different sites in University of Michigan Arboretum. Mouse cage bedding material was collected before and after animal housing of WT B6 mice (n = 8). Ileal and cecal contents from 8-week-old B6 mice (n = 10) were prepared by squeezing the luminal material from the intestinal organs. The water-soluble extract was prepared from the suspension of contents with 5-fold excess water, followed by centrifugation and filtration as described above for ligand fractions of bacterial cultures. HEK293T Bioassay for Specific Pathogen Receptors—Ligand-dependent NF-κB activation was determined using 0.5 × 105 HEK293T cells transfected with expression plasmids of Nod1 (0.17 ng of pCMV-SPORT6-Nod1), Nod2 (33 ng of pMX2-HA-Nod2), or TLR4 (1.7 ng of pcDNA3-TLR4-FLAG) and MD2 (1.7 ng of pcDNA3-MD2-FLAG) in the presence of reporter plasmids, NF-κB-dependent pBxIV-luc, and control pEF1BOS-β-Gal as described (10Chamaillard M.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate method and 8 h post-transfection cells were treated with medium containing various ligands or bacterial products. 24 h post-transfection, ligand-dependent NF-κB activation was determined with reporter assay. Ligand-specific NF-κB Activation in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells Expressing Nod1, Nod2, or TLR4—Host cells recognize bacteria through several receptors that are specific for particular bacterial components (6Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar). These receptors including Nod1, Nod2, and TLRs mediate innate and acquired immune responses against bacteria. However, the levels of microbial ligands present in bacteria that are capable of stimulating these receptors are poorly characterized. Because bacteria express multiple immunostimulatory molecules that synergistically activate NF-κB (10Chamaillard M. Hashimoto M. Horie Y. Masumoto J. Qiu S. Saab L. Ogura Y. Kawasaki A. Fukase K.

Unlike macrophages, HEK293T cells express no or low levels of Nod and TLR proteins and are insensitive to less than 100 ng/ml of synthetic microbial compounds capable of stimulating Nod1, Nod2, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9 (Fig. 1A). To determine the levels of receptor-specific immunostimulatory activity in bacterial cells and cultured media, HEK293T cells expressing Nod1, Nod2, and TLR4 were stimulated with their corresponding bacterial activators. The synthetic bacterial compounds that are specifically recognized by Nod1, Nod2, and TLR4, activated NF-κB in HEK293T cells expressing each specific receptor, but not parental HEK293T cells, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Co-administration of two compounds that are recognized by distinct receptors did not induce significant synergistic effects (Fig. 1C). Therefore, the level of immunostimulatory activity for each host receptor could be determined by the HEK293T bioassay, even when bacteria and bacterial extracts contain different types of immunostimulatory molecules.

https://openalex.org/W1995086580,"Alzheimer disease is characterized by the accumulation of aggregated amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the brain. The physiological mechanisms and factors that predispose to Aβ aggregation and deposition are not well understood. In this report, we show that calcium can predispose to Aβ aggregation and fibril formation. Calcium increased the aggregation of early forming protofibrillar structures and markedly increased conversion of protofibrils to mature amyloid fibrils. This occurred at levels 20-fold below the calcium concentration in the extracellular space of the brain, the site at which amyloid plaque deposition occurs. In the absence of calcium, protofibrils can remain stable in vitro for several days. Using this approach, we directly compared the neurotoxicity of protofibrils and mature amyloid fibrils and demonstrate that both species are inherently toxic to neurons in culture. Thus, calcium may be an important predisposing factor for Aβ aggregation and toxicity. The high extracellular concentration of calcium in the brain, together with impaired intraneuronal calcium regulation in the aging brain and Alzheimer disease, may play an important role in the onset of amyloid-related pathology.

Cleavage of the amyloid β precursor protein leads to the production of Aβ peptides of varying lengths, of which the 40-amino acid peptide is the major species (Aβ1–40) (1Suzuki N. Cheung T.T.

The aggregation of Aβ into mature amyloid fibrils occurs through a number of intermediate structural forms, variously referred to as oligomers or protofibrils.

The mechanism by which Aβ aggregates in the brain is not fully understood, although there is increasing evidence that metal ions may play a role. Physiological levels of copper and zinc have been shown to accelerate Aβ aggregation (8Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol.

It has also been suggested that the binding of Aβ to the membrane sialoglycolipid GM1 ganglioside can lead to a conformational change in Aβ and seeding of aggregation (12Hayashi H. Kimura N.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that Aβ1–42 is the Aβ species required for the seeding of amyloid fibril formation and plaque deposition in vivo, as mice overexpressing only Aβ1–42 developed amyloid plaques, whereas mice overexpressing only Aβ1–40 did not (13McGowan E. Pickford F. Kim J. Onstead L. Eriksen J. Yu C. Skipper L. Murphy M.P. Beard J. Das P. Jansen K. Delucia M. Lin W.L. Dolios G. Wang R. Eckman C.B. Dickson D.W. Hutton M. Hardy J. Golde T. Neuron. 2005; 47: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In this report we show that calcium can accelerate aggregation of Aβ1–42, with marked effects on the formation of early protofibrillar structures, as well as the protofibril to fibril conversion event. Both protofibrillar and fibrillar forms of Aβ are neurotoxic. These effects of calcium on Aβ aggregation occurred at concentrations 20-fold lower than the 2 mm calcium concentration present in the extracellular space of the brain, implicating a potential role for calcium in Aβ aggregation and toxicity in the AD brain. Chemicals and Reagents—All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, and chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich, unless stated otherwise. Preparation of Aβ—Aβ1–42 was from either rPeptide, BIOSOURCE, or Bachem, and all gave similar results (Aβ1–42 was used for all the experiments described and will be referred to as Aβ from here on). Aβ was solubilized in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) at a concentration of 1 mm. HFIP was allowed to evaporate off in a fume hood, followed by drying under vacuum in a Savant SpeedVac. The Aβ HFIP film was stored at –20 °C until use. For experiments in which Aβ was aggregated in the presence of 150 mm NaCl or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Aβ was resuspended at 200 μm in reverse osmosis-purified water (MP Biomedicals) and taken to pH 11.5 with 1 n NaOH to solubilize the peptide. Aβ was then filtered through a 30-kDa Ultrafree-MC with Ultracel-PL membrane centrifugal filter (Millipore). The concentration of Aβ postfiltration was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit with unfiltered Aβ as a standard. Aβ Aggregation—Aβ solubilized in HFIP was resuspended at 2 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). 2 mm Aβ in Me2SO was diluted to 100 μm in 75 mm MOPS pH 7.4 buffer, and metal ions were added as described in the text. pH was confirmed to be 7.4 by using an Orion Micro pH electrode (Thermo Electron Corp.) or by the addition of phenol red. Aggregation was at 37 °C without stirring. For investigation of Aβ aggregation at early time points, Aβ was brought to 100 μm in MOPS buffer as described above and immediately centrifuged at 320,000 × g for 1.5 h in an Optima TLX desktop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) to remove pre-existing aggregates. Aβ concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit, with non-centrifuged Aβ as a standard, and the Aβ was aged at 50 μm at 37 °C without stirring. For aging in the presence of 150 mm NaCl or in DMEM, 30-kDa filtered Aβ was brought to pH 7.4 with 75 mm MOPS buffer and aged at 50 μm at room temperature or 10 μm at 37 °C, without stirring. All aggregation experiments were performed at least 3 times per condition. Congo Red Binding Assay—The Congo Red assay was performed according to Klunk et al. (14Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Aβ and Congo Red (dye content 97%) were diluted to 8–10 μm and 25 μm, respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a final volume of 150 μl. Aβ aged at 10 μm was used without dilution. Absorbance was read at 405 nm and 540 nm in a Titertek Multiskan Plus 96-well plate spectrophotometer. Congo Red binding by Aβ fibrils was calculated using Equation 13 of Klunk et al. (14Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T Binding Assay—The thioflavin T binding assay was performed according to Naiki and Nakakuki (15Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). 0.5 μm Aβ and 5 μm thioflavin T diluted in 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.5, in a total volume of 2 ml were analyzed in a F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Excitation was set at 446 nm, and emission data were collected at 485 nm. Electron Microscopy—For protofibril and fibril visualization, Aβ was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a desktop centrifuge (Eppendorf) at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended at 10 μm in reverse osmosis-purified water. For preformed fibrils and protofibrils that had been added to culture medium for 24 h at 20 μm, the medium was centrifuged as above, and the pellet was resuspended at 100 μm for use in the Congo Red assay and 10 μm for electron microscopy. Aβ aged at 10 μm was diluted 1:1 with reverse osmosis-purified water. For electron microscopy of early forming Aβ species no spin was performed and samples were diluted 1:1 with reverse osmosis-purified water. All samples were then prepared for negative staining as follows: 2–5 μl of the sample was adsorbed to a carbon-coated grid that was glow-discharged in an Edwards Auto 306 vacuum evaporator for 30 s. Excess liquid was removed with a filter paper (Whatman No. 1), and the samples were stained with 1% uranyl acetate or 1% uranyl formate for 1 min. The grids were examined using a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry—Samples were acidified to 5% HNO3 using trace metal grade concentrated acid (J. T. Baker Inc.). The amount of metal in each sample was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Elan 6100). Standards were prepared from a concentrated multi-element standard (SPEX CertiPrep Inc, Metuchen, NJ) that was serially diluted in 5% HNO3 to obtain working standards in the range of 0.5 μg/liter to 25μg/liter. Indium (2 μg/liter) was used as an internal standard. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting— 0.5 μl of a 100 μm Aβ sample was diluted with reverse osmosis-purified water and 2× sample buffer to a final volume of 20 μl, and 5 μl was run on a 10–20% Tricine gel (Invitrogen), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Whatman), and probed with monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Signet) for the detection of Aβ. Neuronal Cultures—E18 rat hippocampal neurons were plated at 1.25 × 105 per well on coverslips coated with lysine and laminin in 24-well plates or at 2 × 104 in 96-well plates coated with lysine. Neurons were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). After 2 days in culture the medium was replaced with neurobasal medium supplemented with B27-AO, and a half-medium change performed every 3–4 days. Neurons were treated after 6–7 days in vitro. Detection of Cell Death—Apoptosis was detected by the characteristic condensed and fragmented morphology of neuronal nuclei observed by Hoechst staining. Cell death due to loss of membrane integrity was measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the cell culture medium. Aβ was aged at 100 μm in the presence or absence of 1 or 2 mm calcium for 24–48 h at 37 °C, and fibril and protofibril content was measured by Congo Red and thioflavin T as described. Aβ was then added to 6–7 days in vitro neurons on coverslips in 24-well plates for Hoechst staining or to 96-well plates for LDH measurement for 24 h. For Hoechst staining, the culture medium was removed and the neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed in PBS for 5 min, stained with Hoechst dye for 5 min in PBS, and washed in PBS and then water. At least 500 cells were counted per well by an investigator blind to the treatment, and triplicate wells were used per condition. The results shown are the average of at least three independent experiments. For LDH measurement, the CytoTox non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three independent experiments were performed using 6 wells per condition. Calcium Accelerates Aβ Protofibril to Fibril Conversion—We observed that Aβ aggregates more rapidly in tap water than reverse osmosis-purified water and that calcium was the main agent in tap water that correlated with this effect (supplemental Fig. 1). We therefore decided to investigate the effects of calcium on Aβ aggregation. Aβ was incubated at 100 μm for up to 120 h at 37 °C in 75 mm MOPS buffer in the presence or absence of 2 mm calcium. The formation of fibrils, as determined by Congo Red binding, was significantly accelerated in the presence of calcium. Fibrils start to form within 6 h in the presence of calcium but require 48 h for a similar amount of fibril formation in the absence of calcium (Fig. 1A). In contrast, thioflavin T binding did not show a difference in Aβ aggregation kinetics in the presence or absence of calcium (Fig. 1B). This suggested that calcium was accelerating the formation of an Aβ species that was recognized by Congo Red but not thioflavin T. To further investigate this difference in Aβ structure, Aβ was Western-blotted after incubation for 24 h in either the presence or absence of 2 mm calcium. A species of ∼80–120 kDa was identified only in the absence of calcium, and Aβ species of 12 kDa and 16 kDa were also increased in the absence of calcium (Fig. 2A). The sample aged in the presence of calcium had little Aβ signal due to the formation of high molecular weight aggregated protein that was unable to enter the gel. We performed electron microscopy on the Aβ species produced after 48 h in the presence or absence of calcium. When Aβ was incubated with calcium, mature amyloid fibrils formed (Fig. 2B). When Aβ was incubated without calcium for 48 h, small curvilinear structures formed that resembled previously described protofibrils (16Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 17Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), as well as a few longer fibrils (Fig. 2B). The protofibrillar structures had lengths less than 200 nm, also consistent with the dimensions of previously described protofibrils (16Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 17Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appeared that protofibrils were forming in either the presence or absence of calcium, giving rise to a positive thioflavin T signal and the presence of the 80–120 kDa Aβ species identified by immunoblotting. However, in the presence of calcium, protofibrils were rapidly converted to mature amyloid fibrils. To confirm this sequence of events, an electron microscopy time course was performed. After 6 h of incubation in the presence of calcium, both protofibrils and fibrils were present but by 24 h only mature amyloid fibrils were detected (Fig. 3). In contrast, Aβ incubated in the absence of calcium became protofibrillar by 6 h and remained protofibrillar for up to 72 h of incubation before converting to fibrils (Fig. 3). These results suggest that calcium promotes the conversion of protofibrils to mature amyloid fibrils.FIGURE 2Calcium accelerates protofibril to fibril conversion. Aβ was incubated at 100 μm in 75 mm MOPS at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2 mm calcium for 24–48 h. A, immunoblotting with an anti-Aβ antibody (6E10) reveals a species of ∼80–120 kDa when Aβ is incubated in the absence of calcium, presumably protofibrils that bind thioflavin T but not Congo Red. This species is not present when Aβ is incubated in the presence of calcium, due to the formation of mature fibrils that do not enter the gel. B, electron microscopy shows small curvilinear protofibrils form when Aβ is incubated in the absence of calcium, and mature amyloid fibrils form when calcium is present. The scale bar is 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Time course of fibril formation in the presence and absence of calcium. Electron microscopy was performed on Aβ incubated at 37 °C in 75 mm MOPS in the presence or absence of 2 mm calcium for 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. At 6 h with calcium the Aβ is a mixture of protofibrils and fibrils. By 24 h only mature fibrils are present. In the absence of calcium, protofibrils are present at 6 and 24 h. At 48 h the majority of the Aβ is protofibrillar with some longer fibril-like structures. At 72 h most Aβ is fibrillar, but some protofibrils remain, shown in the boxed inset. The scale bar is 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Zinc and Copper Do Not Accelerate Protofibril to Fibril Conversion—It has previously been shown that physiological levels of copper and zinc can accelerate Aβ aggregation (8Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12817-12826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 9Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. de Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether these concentrations of copper and zinc had an effect on protofibril to fibril conversion. Aβ was aged for 24 h in the absence of metal ions or in the presence of 2 mm calcium, 20 μm copper, or 20 μm zinc. Congo Red and thioflavin T binding showed that only calcium was able to accelerate protofibril to fibril conversion (Fig. 4). We also measured the levels of copper and zinc in our 2 mm calcium solution by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to ensure that contaminating trace copper and zinc were not having an effect. Copper was below our detection limits of 0.5 μg/liter, and zinc was at the level of our detection limits, 0.5 μg/liter ± S.D. of 0.039. This is equivalent to an upper limit of 140 nm zinc. These results suggest that copper and zinc do not have an effect on protofibril to fibril conversion in this Aβ aging paradigm. Calcium Accelerates Aβ Aggregation at a Range of Calcium and Aβ Concentrations—We then determined the concentra-tion range for calcium-induced acceleration of protofibril to fibril conversion. A standard curve shows that the EC50 for calcium-mediated fibril formation was ∼4 mg/liter (100 μm) (Fig. 5). This is 20-fold lower than the 2 mm calcium concentra-tion in the extracellular space of the brain, the site at which amyloid plaque deposition occurs. Thus, calcium in the extra-cellular space of the brain may provide a favorable milieu for amyloid fibril formation and plaque deposition. The effects of calcium were then assessed in the presence of a physiological concentration of sodium chloride at lower Aβ concentrations. Aβ was first passed through a 30-kDa filter to remove preformed larger aggregates. Aβ was aged at 50 μm at room temperature or at 10 μm at 37 °C. Congo Red binding, thioflavin T binding, and electron microscopy showed that under these conditions calcium accelerated protofibril to fibril conversion (Fig. 6A–D). These experiments show that calcium accelerates Aβ aggregation in the presence of physiological concentrations of salt. Calcium Accelerates the Formation of Early Aβ Aggregates—To determine if calcium can also accelerate the formation of early Aβ aggregates, we analyzed the aggregation state of Aβ in the presence or absence of calcium during the first 2 h of incubation. Freshly solubilized Aβ was centrifuged for 1.5 h at 320,000 × g to remove preformed aggregates. Electron microscopy performed following centrifugation showed that just a few small spherical Aβ aggregates remained (Fig. 7B), which did not lead to a thioflavin T-positive signal (Fig. 7A). After 30 min of incubation, there was a small increase in thioflavin T-positive species in the presence of calcium (Fig. 7A). By electron microscopy, the effect of calcium was more striking. Short individual protofibrils were observed as well as aggregates of protofibrils (Fig. 7B). After 1 h of incubation in the presence of calcium, thioflavin T binding was significantly greater than that observed in the absence of calcium (Fig. 7A), and protofibrillar and fibrillar structures were apparent by electron microscopy (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that calcium accelerates the formation of protofibrillar as well as fibrillar Aβ aggregates. Protofibrils and Fibrils Are Both Neurotoxic—To investigate the neurotoxicity of fibrils and protofibrils, these two forms were selectively generated by incubating Aβ in the presence or absence of calcium, respectively. Preformed fibrils and protofibrils were then added to primary rat hippocampal neuronal cultures. The extent of protofibril to fibril conversion in the culture medium of neurons after a 24-h incubation was determined by Congo Red binding and electron microscopy (Fig. 8A and B). There was no significant conversion to fibrils during this time period suggesting that protofibrils are stable in the cell culture medium. Thus, neurobasal/B27-AO medium, which contains 1.8 mm calcium (18Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar), did not promote the conversion of protofibrils to fibrils within 24 h. In contrast, DMEM containing calcium significantly accelerated Aβ aggregation and fibril formation, as determined by Congo Red binding, thioflavin T binding, and electron microscopy (Fig. 8, C–E). It is unclear why our preformed protofibrils are stable in neurobasal/B27-AO medium. However, this enabled us to examine the neurotoxicity of stable Aβ protofibrils. Cell death was measured after 24 h to ensure that the protofibrils had not converted to fibrils. Hoechst dye was used to identify the characteristic nuclear morphology of apoptotic cells. The LDH assay was used to measure cell death via loss of membrane integrity through release of LDH into the cell culture medium. The LDH assay gave a very small but statistically significant increase in cell death with both protofibrils and fibrils at 20 μm (Fig. 8F). The insensitivity of the LDH assay for measuring protofibril and fibril toxicity over the relatively short time period of 24 h has been described previously, with 2–3 days required to see significant cell death (4Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore focused on the more sensitive method of scoring apoptotic cells using Hoechst dye. Both protofibrils and fibrils induced neuronal apoptosis, with a trend toward increased toxicity of fibrils versus protofibrils that was statistically significant at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 8G). To ensure that small amounts of soluble Aβ species that might remain in our fibrillar preparations after in vitro aggregation were not responsible for the observed toxicity, we centrifuged the fibrillar Aβ preparation and compared the toxicity of the pellet and supernatant. Only the pelletable insoluble Aβ was neurotoxic whereas the supernatant did not elicit any neurotoxicity, indicating that small amounts of contaminating soluble Aβ are not responsible for the observed toxicity (Fig. 8H). These results suggest that both protofibrils and fibrils are inherently neurotoxic. The aggregation of Aβ is a characteristic pathological feature of AD that may contribute to neurodegeneration. These experiments indicate that physiological concentrations of calcium markedly accelerate Aβ aggregation. Calcium had significant effects on the generation of both early protofibrillar forms of Aβ, as well as the conversion of protofibrils to mature amyloid fibrils. The concentration of calcium in the extracellular space of the brain is ∼2 mm, which is 20-fold higher than the calcium concentration required to promote fibril formation in vitro. Thus, calcium may play an important role in Aβ aggregation and amyloid deposition in AD. Moreover, the increased formation of early protofibrillar aggregates suggests that calcium may play a role in the initiation of Aβ aggregation. A role for metal ions in accelerating Aβ aggregation has previously been reported for zinc and copper (8Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E.

Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). We did not observe an effect of zinc and copper on protofibril to fibril conversion under the conditions used. The effects of copper and zinc may occur at earlier stages of Aβ aggregation. This would be consistent with evidence that trace levels of copper and zinc can initiate Aβ aggregation and increase oligomer formation (11Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 9: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The studies on zinc and copper were performed with Aβ40 (8Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C.

Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), whereas this study used Aβ42, which could also explain the differences observed. Further, the copper effect required a slightly acidic pH (8Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Scarpa R.C. Bacarra N.M. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12817-12826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar) that was not required for the effects of calcium, which occur at physiological pH. In addition, the effect of zinc on Aβ aggregation is salt-dependent and reversible by zinc chelation (10Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Hartshorn M.A. Vonsattel J.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26464-26470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In contrast, the effects of calcium are independent of salt concentration and were not reversed by calcium chelation (data not shown). This difference in the stability of zinc- and calcium-induced aggregates suggests that they may have different conformations. The conformation of different Aβ species clearly has an effect on their ability to bind the dyes Congo Red and thioflavin T. The inability of protofibrils to bind Congo Red that we observed is consistent with another report (4Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a different study reported variable binding of Congo Red to protofibrils (19Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The stability of protofibrils in the absence of calcium enabled an assessment of their effects on cultured neurons, providing evidence that both protofibrils and fibrils are neurotoxic, consistent with previous reports (4Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Ye C.P. Diehl T. Vasquez S. Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1998; 4: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The toxicity of protofibrils appears to be inherent to the protofibrillar structure, as we did not detect significant conversion to fibrils in the conditioned medium of cells treated with protofibrils. This lack of conversion in tissue culture medium appears to be a property of neurobasal/B27-AO medium, as protofibril conversion did occur in DMEM. The reason for this is presently unclear but may relate to the presence of albumin in B27 medium (18Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar), which has been shown to bind Aβ (33Biere A.L. Ostaszewski B. Stimson E.R. Hyman B.T. Maggio J.E. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32916-32922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Fibrils also appear to be inherently neurotoxic, as we did not detect protofibrillar contamination in fibrillar preparations generated in the presence of calcium. As a further control, we centrifuged fibrillar Aβ and compared the toxicity of the peptide in the pellet and supernatant. Only the insoluble pelleted fraction that contained the fibrils was toxic, indicating that fibrils alone can mediate toxicity. The supernatant is likely to contain very small amounts of soluble Aβ, as most of the Aβ converts to fibrils during aging in the presence of calcium. Therefore, the lack of neurotoxicity of the supernatant does not suggest that soluble Aβ per se is not toxic but that it cannot explain the toxicity of the fibrils in this case. Previous reports suggest that soluble oligomeric Aβ can be neurotoxic (3Lambert M.P. Barlow A.K. Chromy B.A. Edwards C. Freed R. Liosatos M. Morgan T.E. Rozovsky I. Trommer B. Viola K.L. Wals P.

Vassilev P.M. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another study, however, reported that neither fibrils nor soluble Aβ were toxic unless they were combined, suggesting that ongoing polymerization of Aβ is required for Aβ toxicity (34Wogulis M. Wright S. Cunningham D. Chilcote T. Powell K. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although this is likely to be an important mechanism, our results suggest it is not required, as Aβ fibrils alone are neurotoxic. Several lines of evidence suggest that calcium homeostasis may become altered in the aging brain. Using microarray analysis, we have shown that mRNA levels of the calcium binding proteins calbindin and calretinin decrease significantly in the aging human brain, as does PMCA2, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase responsible for pumping calcium out of the cell (21Lu T. Pan Y. Kao S.Y. Li C. Kohane I. Chan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Decreases in calbindin and calretinin have also been detected by immunohistochemistry in the brains of aged humans, monkeys, and rodents (22Fahandejsaadi A. Leung E. Rahaii R. Bu J. Geula C.

These changes would be expected to lead to an increase in intracellular free calcium, which could potentially initiate Aβ aggregation. Calcium homeostasis may also be altered by AD-causing mutations in presenilin 1 (PS1) (26Leissring M.A. Akbari Y. Fanger C.M. Cahalan M.D. Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. J.

Moreover, memantine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist that reduces calcium influx, can improve cognition in moderate to severe AD patients (32Tariot P.N. Farlow M.R. Grossberg G.T. Graham S.M. McDonald S. Gergel I. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2004; 291: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Thus, calcium dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD by increasing the formation of neurotoxic aggregated forms of Aβ.

https://openalex.org/W1964457709,"The Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role in specifying cellular fates by interaction between cellular neighbors; however, the molecular mechanism underlying smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation by Notch signaling has not been well characterized. Here we demonstrate that Jagged1-Notch signaling promotes SMC differentiation from mesenchymal cells. Overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain, an activated form of Notch, up-regulates the expression of multiple SMC marker genes including SMC-myosin heavy chain (Sm-mhc) in mesenchymal 10T1/2 cells, but not in non-mesenchymal cells. Physiological Notch stimulation by its ligand Jagged1, but not Dll4, directly induces Sm-mhc expression in 10T1/2 cells without de novo protein synthesis, indicative of a ligand-selective effect. Jagged1-induced expression of SM-MHC was blocked byγ-secretase inhibitor, N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-l-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, which impedes Notch signaling. Using Rbp-jκ-deficient cells and site-specific mutagenesis of the SM-MHC gene, we show that such an induction is independent of the myocardin-serum response factor-CArG complex, but absolutely dependent on RBP-Jκ, a major mediator of Notch signaling, and its cognate binding sequence. Of importance, Notch signaling and myocardin synergistically activate SM-MHC gene expression. Taken together, these data suggest that the Jagged1-Notch pathway constitutes an instructive signal for SMC differentiation through an RBP-Jκ-dependent mechanism and augments gene expression mediated by the myocardin-SRF-CArG complex. Given that Notch pathway components are expressed in vascular SMC during normal development and disease, Notch signaling is likely to play a pivotal role in such situations to modulate the vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) 2The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; SM, smooth muscle; MHC, myosin heavy chain; HES, hairy and enhancer of split; SRF, serum response factor; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; HERP, hairy and enhancer of split-related repressor protein; HASMC, human aortic smooth muscle cells; DAPT, N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-l-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 2The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; SM, smooth muscle; MHC, myosin heavy chain; HES, hairy and enhancer of split; SRF, serum response factor; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; HERP, hairy and enhancer of split-related repressor protein; HASMC, human aortic smooth muscle cells; DAPT, N-(N-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-l-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. maintain considerable phenotypic plasticity throughout life and this plasticity is essential for vascular development and the pathogenesis of vascular disease such as atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). Differentiated VSMC exhibit a contractile phenotype that is characterized by a low rate of proliferation, low synthetic activity, and expression of a unique repertoire of proteins such as smooth muscle α-actin (SM α-actin), SM22α, h-caldesmon (h-CaD), smoothelin-B, and smooth muscle-myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC). Once VSMC are exposed to injurious stimuli, they dedifferentiate into a so-called synthetic phenotype that exhibits a high rate of proliferation, high synthetic activity, and down-regulated expression of SMC marker genes accompanied by the induction of some marker genes for immature SMC.Among the many transcription factors involved in SMC differentiation, the myocardin-SRF complex is a key regulator as its expression is essential for SMC differentiation (2Chen J. Kitchen C.M. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1345-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Du K.L. Ip H.S. Li J. Chen M. Dandre F. Yu W. Lu M.M. Owens G.K.

Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Promoter/enhancer regions of most SMC marker genes such as SM-MHC and SM22α include several SRF binding elements, referred to as CArG or SRE. SRF recruits a potent coactivator, myocardin, resulting in the induction of SMC marker genes. Most importantly, mouse embryos deficient in myocardin show no evidence of vascular SMC development (6Li S. Wang D.Z. Wang Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9366-9370Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), suggesting an indispensable role of myocardin in SMC differentiation; however, several lines of evidence indicate that the myocardin-SRF complex does not govern the entire program of VSMC differentiation. First, forced expression of myocardin did not induce a subset of SMC marker genes such as smoothelin-B and aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (7Yoshida T. Kawai-Kowase K. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1596-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Second, the Sm α-actin and Sm22α genes are expressed within the developing aorta as early as E9.5 (8Li L. Miano J.M. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), whereas myocardin is undetectable until E12.5 (3Du K.L. Ip H.S. Li J. Chen M. Dandre F. Yu W. Lu M.M. Owens G.K. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2425-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To date, transcription factors that function prior to the expression of myocardin remains to be determined.The evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway controls various cell fates in metazoans through local cell-cell interactions (9Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar). Interaction of Notch receptors with their ligands (Delta-like or Jagged) leads to proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane Notch receptor, giving rise to the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that migrates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, NICD associates with transcription factor RBP-Jκ (also known as CSL for CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1) and activates transcription from its cognate DNA binding sequence, GTGGGAA. In mammals, the NICD·RBP-Jκ complex up-regulates the expression of primary target genes of Notch, such as hairy and enhancer of split (HES) and HES-related repressor protein (HERP) families that act as transcriptional repressors as well as Notch effectors (10Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar).Notch activation has been shown to inhibit cell fate determination through its effector and maintain cells in an undifferentiated state (9Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4859) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also demonstrated that Notch signaling promotes cell fate in various lineages during organogenesis, such as gliogenesis, hematopoiesis, adipogenesis, and osteogenesis, although there are some controversial reports (11Amsen D. Blander J.M. Lee G.R. Tanigaki K. Honjo T. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 515-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 12Garces C. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. de Mora J.F. Park C.

Miyatani S. Hozumi N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Importantly, Notch signaling often induces target genes other than HES/HERP without mediating putative Notch effectors, HES/HERP. For instance, Notch signaling directly induces brain lipid-binding protein and interleukin-4, markers for glia and the Th2 lineage of T cells, respectively, in an RBP-Jκ-dependent manner (11Amsen D.

Heintz N. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of cell-fate specification by Notch is highly pleiotropic and indeed context dependent.Recent studies have documented that Notch signaling is involved in multiple aspects of vascular development including differentiation and homeostasis of VSMC (16Iso T. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, several receptors, ligands, and other components of Notch signaling are expressed in VSMC. The human disease CADASIL (cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is caused by highly stereotyped mutations of the receptor Notch3 (17Joutel A. Corpechot C. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Alamowitch S. Domenga V. Cecillion M. Marechal E. Maciazek J. Vayssiere C. Cruaud C. Cabanis E.A. Ruchoux M.M. Weissenbach J. Bach J.F. Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E. Nature. 1996; 383: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). They cause a defect in vessel homeostasis due to VSMC degeneration, resulting in the early onset of ischemic stroke (17Joutel A. Corpechot C. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Alamowitch S. Domenga V. Cecillion M. Marechal E. Maciazek J. Vayssiere C. Cruaud C. Cabanis E.A. Ruchoux M.M. Weissenbach J. Bach J.F. Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E. Nature. 1996; 383: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Notch3-deficient mice also revealed that Notch3 is required for arterial differentiation and maturation of VSMC (18Domenga V. Fardoux P. Lacombe P. Monet M. Maciazek J. Krebs L.T. Klonjkowski B. Berrou E. Mericskay M. Li Z. Tournier-Lasserve E. Gridley T. Joutel A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that HERP1, a target gene of Notch, inhibits myocardin-mediated SMC differentiation (19Doi H. Iso T. Yamazaki M. Akiyama H. Kanai H. Sato H. KawaiKowase K.

Walls D. Redmond E.M. Cahill P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C1188-C1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) also reported that Notch signaling inhibits SMC differentiation through an RBP-Jκ/Hrt-dependent mechanism. On the other hand, several reports have suggested that Notch positively regulates VSMC differentiation. In Notch3-deficient mice, the expression of several VSMC marker genes such as Sm22α and smoothelin was markedly down-regulated (18Domenga V. Fardoux P. Lacombe P. Monet M. Maciazek J. Krebs L.T. Klonjkowski B. Berrou E. Mericskay M. Li Z. Tournier-Lasserve E. Gridley T. Joutel A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In addition, SM α-actin was strongly induced by NICD in human umbilical vein endothelial cells during the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (22Noseda M. McLean G. Niessen K. Chang L. Pollet I. Montpetit R. Shahidi R. Dorovini-Zis K. Li L. Beckstead B. Durand R.E. Hoodless P.A. Karsan A. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Very recently, Noseda et al. (23Noseda M. Fu Y. Niessen K. Wong F. Chang L. McLean G. Karsan A. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1468-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) reported that SM α-actin was a direct target of Notch signaling via RBP-Jκ-dependent pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest that the function of Notch signaling in VSMC differentiation remains to be determined.Here we report that Jagged1-selective activation of Notch signaling positively and directly regulates SMC differentiation. Our data also implicate functional interaction between NICD·RBP-Jκ and myocardin-SRF complexes on SMC differentiation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Culture conditions for C3H10T1/2 cells (murine embryonic fibroblasts), L cells stably exppressing GFP alone, Jagged1 and Dll4 (L-GFP, L-Jagged1, and L-Dll4, respectively), Rbp-jκ–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast (OT11), and the wild-type cell line (OT13) were previously described (24Iso T.

To test this hypothesis, we first studied the effect of N1-ICD on SMC marker gene expression in human aortic SMC, HASMC (Fig. 1A). Contrary to our expectations, forced expression of N1-ICD increased the steady state level of mRNA for SM-MHC and SM22α despite the strong induction of HERP1 expression. These observations offer the intriguing idea that Notch signaling rather promotes SMC differentiation. Thus, we next chose a cell line, C3H10T1/2, a mesenchymal precursor cell line of murine embryonic origin, in which Notch signaling should recapitulate, at least partially, its effects in embryogenesis because many studies have revealed its pluripotency, that is, its ability to differentiate toward different mesenchymal lineages including SMC, skeletal muscle, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts (32Lu Y.

The mRNA expression for a series of SMC marker genes such as Sm-mhc, h-Cad, and smoothelin-B were also induced by N1-ICD overexpression despite the induction of Herp1 (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the expression level of SM-MHC, the most reliable marker for mature SMC (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar), was up-regulated by N1-ICD, strongly suggesting that NICD induces SMC differentiation, not merely several SMC marker genes. We further confirmed that N1-ICD induced the expression of SM-MHC (SM1) and h-CaD at the protein level as myocardin did (Fig. 1D). In contrast, we observed no induction of SM-MHC by N1-ICD in other non-mesenchymal cell lines tested (Fig. 2, A–C), which suggests that SMC differentiation by Notch signaling is cell-type specific.FIGURE 2Effect of NICD on the induction of SM-MHC mRNA in various cells. Normal murine mammary gland epithelial (NMuMg)(A), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)(B), or normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) (C) were infected with Ad-empty or Ad-N1-ICD at a multiplicity of infection of 20. Two days after infection, total RNA was isolated and gene expression was assayed by RT-PCR. GAPDH was used as an internal control.

Fig. 1E showed that N3-ICD induced mRNA expression for a series of SMC markers including Sm-mhc, Sm22α, h-Cad, and Smoothelin-B as N1-ICD did. We confirmed that the protein expression level of those Notch proteins was comparable as assessed by Western blot (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2049842391,"Temporins are short and homologous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) isolated from the frog skin of <i>Rana</i> genus. To date, very little is known about the biological significance of the presence of closely related AMPs in single living organisms. Here we addressed this question using temporins A, B, and L isolated from <i>Rana temporaria</i>. We found that temporins A and B are only weakly active toward Gram-negative bacteria. However, a marked synergism occurs when each is mixed with temporin L. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms involved in these activities, we used various experimental strategies to investigate: (i) the effect of the peptides' interaction on both the viability and membrane permeability of intact bacteria and spheroplasts; (ii) their interaction with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and the effect of LPS on the oligomeric state of temporins, alone or combining one with another; (iii) their structure in solution and when bound to LPS, by using circular dichroism and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies. Our data reveal that temporin L synergizes with A and B by preventing their oligomerization in LPS. This should promote their translocation across the outer membrane into the cytoplasmic membrane. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explains how a combination of native AMPs from the same species can overcome bacterial resistance imposed by the LPS leaflet."

The bHLH signature that defines the family is constituted by an N-terminal ∼16-amino acid-long basic α-helix that binds DNA to the canonical E-box (CANNTG) (5Murre C. Baltimore D. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992Google Scholar) and a C-terminal helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain involved in homo- and/or heterodimerization (6Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). Some factors, however, such as the Id myogenic regulator, lack the basic region and function as inhibitors by forming heterodimers that cannot bind DNA (7Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). It is common for bHLH proteins to contain additional protein-protein interaction domains that contribute in unique ways to their regulatory function (8Morgenstern B. Atchley W.R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For example, the Myc proto-oncoprotein forms heterodimers with Max through the respective bHLH and adjacent basic leucine zipper (bZip) domains (9Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). In contrast to Myc, which cannot homodimerize, Max can form homo- or heterodimers with several related proteins, including Mad1 and Mnt (10Adhikary S. Eilers M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The bHLH region of Myc mediates the interaction with Miz-1, a POZ transcription factor that permits Myc to bind and repress promoters lacking the CACGTG E-box (10Adhikary S. Eilers M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Plant bHLH proteins are also characterized by the presence of several conserved domains in addition to the bHLH motif. For example, the analysis of the 133 Arabidopsis bHLH factors uncovered 40 or more domains present in three or more proteins (3Heim M.A. Jakoby M. Werber M. Martin C. Weisshaar B. Bailey P.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). By and large the function of these domains is not known. Among the few for which functions have been identified are the N-terminally located small APB domain present in several phytochrome-interacting factors (12Khanna R. Huq E. Kikis E.A. Al-Sady B. Lanzatella C. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and the region that mediates the interaction with R2R3-MYB factors (13Goff S.A. Cone K.C. Chandler V.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 864-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 14Zimmermann I.M. Heim M.A. Weisshaar B. Uhrig J.F. Plant J. 2004; 40: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) central to providing R2R3-MYB transcriptional regulators with very similar DNA binding preferences with the ability to control distinct sets of target genes in vivo (15Quattrocchio F. Baudry A. Lepiniec L. Grotewold E. Grotewold E. The Science of Flavonoids. Springer, NY2006: 97-122Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The bHLH/R2R3-MYB cooperation is best exemplified by the interaction between the N-terminal region of a member of the R/B group of bHLH regulators and the R2R3-MYB domain of C1 (13Goff S.A. Cone K.C. Chandler V.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 864-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The interaction with R is essential for the ability of C1 to activate all known flavonoid biosynthetic genes, resulting in anthocyanin pigment accumulation (16Hernandez J. Heine G. Irani N.G. Feller A. Kim M.-G. Matulnik T. Chandler V.L. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48205-48213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A second function of R was uncovered using a mutant of the R2R3-MYB P1 regulator (P1*) (17Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad .Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). P1 normally regulates a subset of the C1/R-regulated genes (18Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Among the P1-regulated genes is A1, which encodes dihydroflavanone reductase, an enzyme necessary for the formation of the anthocyanins (controlled by C1+R) and the phlobaphenes (controlled by P1) (19Grotewold E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 761-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Different from P1, P1* interacts with R (17Grotewold E. Sainz M.B. Tagliani L. Hernandez J.M. Bowen B. Chandler V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad .Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and in the presence of R, the P1* regulatory activity is enhanced. This R-enhanced activity requires the anthocyanin regulatory element (ARE) (16Hernandez J. Heine G. Irani N.G. Feller A. Kim M.-G. Matulnik T. Chandler V.L. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48205-48213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) present in the promoter of A1 and other anthocyanin biosynthetic genes (20Lesnick M.L. Chandler V.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence homology of the bHLH domain and the presence of conserved N-terminal regions, R belongs to group IIIf of the plant bHLH gene family (3Heim M.A. Jakoby M. Werber M. Martin C. Weisshaar B. Bailey P.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). This group is shared by the Arabidopsis GL3 (GLABROUS3), EGL3 (ENHANCER OF GLABROUS3), TT8 (TRANSPARTENT TESTA8) and AtMYC1 proteins, which participate in trichome and root hair formation and in the control of flavonoid pigments (21Nesi N.

Genetics. 2000; 156: 1349-1362PubMed Google Scholar), functions that can be complemented by the maize R gene, Lc (26Lloyd A.M. Schena M. Walbot V. Davis R.W. Science. 1994; 266: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Similar to the interaction of R with C1, members of this group of bHLH proteins function by interacting with R2R3-MYB factors. For example, GL3 and EGL3 interact with the related R2R3-MYB GL1 (GLABROUS1) and WER (WERWOLF) proteins to control trichome or root hair production, respectively, or with PAP1 (PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1) to control anthocyanin accumulation (27Zhang F. Gonzalez A. Zhao M. Payne C.T. Lloyd A. Development. 2003; 130: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Similarly, TT8 interacts with the R2R3-MYB TT2 (TRANSPARENT TESTA2) to activate proanthocyanidin accumulation in the seed coat (22Baudry A. Heim M. Dubreucq B. Caboche M. Weisshaar B. Lepiniec L. Plant J. 2004; 39: 366-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The picture that emerges from these and other studies is that the R2R3-MYB factors are responsible for providing the specificity for a particular process, whereas the bHLH factors play more pleiotropic roles, being shared between two or more cellular processes (16Hernandez J. Heine G. Irani N.G. Feller A. Kim M.-G. Matulnik T. Chandler V.L. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48205-48213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27Zhang F. Gonzalez A. Zhao M. Payne C.T. Lloyd A. Development. 2003; 130: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Given the multiplicity of conserved domains in R and R-related proteins and what is known on the mechanisms by which animal bHLH proteins function, the question remains as to whether regions in R participate in hetero- or homodimer formation and how these interactions contribute to R function. Here we show that, similar to other bHLH proteins, R contains a dimerization domain that can direct the formation of homodimers in vitro and in vivo. This dimerization domain is necessary for the R regulatory activity, as demonstrated by mutants that exhibit a significant reduction of the activation of maize flavonoid genes and anthocyanin accumulation. The dimerization region of R is C-terminal to the bHLH motif and has structural similarity to the ACT domain involved in the allosteric regulation of many amino acid metabolic enzymes. Structural homology searches identified other bHLH factors with similar ACT domains, and we show that at least one of them can also mediate the formation of specific dimers. These findings highlight the role of a novel dimerization domain for the R regulatory activity and provide evidence for the recruitment by eukaryotic transcription factors of protein-protein interaction domains characteristic of metabolic enzymes.

Plasmids Used in Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—The C terminus of R with (amino acids 411-610) and without (462-610) the bHLH region, the bHLH domain only, and a region containing the last 86 amino acids (525-610) were generated by PCR and cloned into pAD-GAL4 and/or pBD-GAL4 vector (Stratagene). The At2g22770233-314 was amplified by PCR and cloned in the pAD-GAL4 and pBD-GAL4 vectors. The maize RIF-1C gene was isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen for protein interacting with the C-terminal (411-610) region of R. 4J. M. Hernandez, A. Feller, and E. Grotewold, unpublished results. Microprojectile Bombardment and Gene Expression Experiments—Bombardment conditions of suspension cells and transient expression assays for luciferase and GUS were performed essentially as previously described (18Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). For each microprojectile preparation, the mass of DNA was adjusted to 10 μg with p35S::BAR (48Grotewold E. Chamberlin M. Snook M. Siame B. Butler L. Swenson J. Maddock S. Clair G.S. Bowen B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 721-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) to equalize the amount of 35S promoter in each bombardment. One μg of each of the regulators and 3 μg of reporter plasmid (pA1::Luc, pA2::Luc, pBz2::Luc, pBz1::Luc, pA1mPBS::Luc, or pGal4BS::Luc) were used in each bombardment. To normalize luciferase activity to GUS activity, 3 μg of pUBI::GUS was included in every bombardment. Each treatment was done at least in triplicate, and entire experiments were repeated at least twice. The assays for luciferase and GUS and the normalization of the data were done as described (18Grotewold E. Drummond B.J. Bowen B. Peterson T. Cell. 1994; 76: 543-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the ratio of arbitrary light units (luciferase) to arbitrary units of fluorescence (GUS). Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—The plasmid containing R411-610, R411-462, or R525-610 in the pBD-GAL4 (TRP+) vector and R411-610, R525-610, or RIF-1C cloned into pAD-GAL4 (LEU+) vector were cotransformed into yeast strain PJ69.4a (51James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plated on SC-LEU-TRP medium. Colonies were then screened for growth on SC-LEU-TRP, SC-LEU-TRP-HIS, and SC-LEU-TRP-HIS-ADE. β-Galactosidase assays were performed on the pJ69.4 strain on three separate cultures carrying each set of plasmids (biological triplicates). Cells were grown in selective -Leu -Trp media overnight and then used to inoculate 10 ml of yeast extract/peptone/dextrose-rich media. When cultures reached an A600 of ∼0.8, the cells were collected and lysed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol using glass beads on a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products). β-Galactosidase assays were carried out essentially as described previously (52Mount R.C. Jordan B.E. Hadfield C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 239-248PubMed Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase units were calculated using the formula (A420 × 377.8)/(time of incubation × volume of extract × protein concentration in mg/ml). GST Pull-down Experiments—The GST pull-down bait was made by cloning the R C-terminal region (residues 411-610) into the vector pGEX-KG (53Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) as a XhoI-HindIII fragment. The pGEX-KG vector was used as a negative control. The R cDNA was excised and cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). The GST-R411-610 and pGEX-KG constructs were each transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) PlyS cells for expression. Cultures were grown, induced with IPTG and purified essentially as described (54Williams C.E. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 563-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: After induction of a 500 ml culture with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C until further use. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) and passed twice through a French press. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 20 min; the supernatant was filtered through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem). The GST pull-down protocol previously described was used (55Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Novagen) were prewashed with NETN150 buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) 4 times and equilibrated in NETN150 buffer. The beads were coated by incubating the bacterial cell extract (100-200 μl) containing GST (used as negative control) or GST-R411-610 with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C and nutating for 1 h. The beads were washed 4 times by nutating with 1 ml of NETN150 at 4 °C (20 min/wash) and then resuspended in 20 μl of NETN150. Proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of Redivue [35S]methionine in vitro translation grade (Amersham Biosciences) using the TNT T7/T3 coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega, Madison, WI). The pull-down reactions were done with 20-μl samples of coated beads to which 100 μl of NETN150 buffer was added together with 5 μl of labeled protein and incubated at 4 °C nutating for 1 h or overnight. Reactions included beads loaded with GST-R411-610 and GST, used as a negative control. The beads were washed 4 times (nutation at 4 °C for 5 min) with 1 ml of NETN150 buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 10 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and visualized using Coomassie Blue staining followed by autoradiography. Plant Transformation and Confocal Microscopy—Plasmids corresponding to the GFP fusions were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101, and infiltration was performed as described by Voinnet et al. (56Voinnet O. Rivas S. Mestre P. Baulcombe D. Plant J. 2003; 33: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, bacteria strains carrying binary constructs were grown at 29 °C to stationary phase in LB media supplemented with antibiotics, acetosyringone, and MES. Cells were harvested and resuspended in media containing MgCl2, MES, and acetosyringone giving a final A600 of 0.9-1.1. After 3 h at room temperature, co-transfection of 3-4-week-old N. benthamiana plant leaves with Agrobacterium cells containing the R-GFP or RΔ532-560-GFP plasmid and a plasmid expressing the tomato bushy stunt virus (pBIN61) silencing suppressor (56Voinnet O. Rivas S. Mestre P. Baulcombe D. Plant J. 2003; 33: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar) were performed. After 3 days infiltrated leave areas were excised, and localization of GFP was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Nikon Eclipse E600, Japan) using the same gain (2000). Analysis of Dimerization Domain Structure—The structural analysis of the C-terminal dimerization domain of the R-like proteins and the other Arabidopsis proteins was done using the FUGUE Version 2.s.07 software (updated on May 2, 2002) (34Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The sequences of the C-terminal domains of R, GL3, JAF13, AN1, NAI1, At2g46810, At1g49770, At2g31210, At5g65640, At1g32640, At4g16430, At5g54680, At1g68810, At1g27740, At3g19500, At4g30980, and At1g73830 were individually analyzed with FUGUE, which used a fold library of size 6348. The length of the probe sequence varied between 79 and 88 amino acids. The probe divergence values were 0.577 for R and GL3, 0.656 for JAF13, 0.735 for NAI1, 0.586 for AN1, 0.779 for At2g46810, 0.732 for At1g49770, 0.443 for At2g31210, 0.759 for At5g65640, 0.794 for At1g32640, 0.76 for At4g16430, 0.708 for At5g54680, 0.755 for At1g68810, 0.266 for At1g27740, 0.555 for At3g19500, 0.413 for At4g30980, and 0.302 for At1g73830. The recommended cutoff values were as follows: ZSCORE ≥ 6.0 (CERTAIN 99% confidence), ZSCORE ≥ 4.0 (LIKELY 95% confidence), ZSCORE ≥ 3.5 (MARGINAL 90% confidence), ZSCORE ≥ 2.0 (GUESS 50% confidence), and ZSCORE < 2.0 (UNCERTAIN). After the scores were obtained for all R-like proteins, three common structural hits were chosen and aligned with the dimerization domain sequences. The MEME/MAST system was used with the sequences mentioned above to generate a motif that was then utilized as a probe to search the nr data base available at the same site. R Contains a C-terminal Dimerization Domain—To investigate whether the C-terminal region of R (residues 411-610, R411-610, Fig. 1), which includes the bHLH domain, was capable of mediating the formation of dimers, we fused this region to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD) and GAL4 activation domain (GAL4AD) and tested them for interaction in yeast. Growth in media lacking leucine and tryptophan (for the selection of the plasmids) and histidine and adenine (-Leu -Trp -His -Ade) is indicative of the formation of interacting partners (Fig. 2A, #1), providing evidence that the C-terminal region of R contains a dimerization domain. The equivalent regions of GL3 and EGL3 were also shown to interact with each other and to mediate homodimer formation in yeast two-hybrid experiments (27Zhang F. Gonzalez A. Zhao M. Payne C.T. Lloyd A. Development. 2003; 130: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), suggesting that the presence of a C-terminal dimerization domain is a general feature of this group of bHLH proteins.FIGURE 2The C-terminal region of R contains a dimerization domain. A, yeast two-hybrid experiments showing interaction between a fusion of the GAL4 activation domain to the C-terminal region of R containing the bHLH (R411-610-GAL4AD) or to the C-terminal 86 amino acids (R525-610-GAL4AD) with R525-610, R411-610, or R411-462 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4DBD) in the yeast strain PJ69.4a (51James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the HIS3 and ADE2 genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. RIF-1C corresponds to a R partner that specifically interacts with the bHLH region. B, GST pull-down experiment showing interaction of in vitro transcribed/translated [35S]methionine-labeled R and E. coli-expressed GST-R411-610. Lane 1, [35S] R; lane 2, [35S] R and GST-R411-610; lane 3, [35S] R and GST. C, 35S::R411-610 was fused to the GAL4DBD and co-bombarded with 35S::R into maize BMS cells. A pUbi::GUS construct was included in every bombardment as a normalization control. The -fold activation was calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The average values from at least three replicates for each treatment are shown, and the error bars indicate the S.D. of the samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether this dimerization was mediated by the bHLH motif, residues 411-462 (bHLH, Fig. 1A) were fused to the GAL4DBD and tested for interaction with R411-610-GAL4AD. Under the conditions used no interaction was observed (Fig. 2A, #3). To ensure that the R411-462-GAL4DBD protein is properly expressed, we tested this protein for interaction with RIF-1C-GAL4AD, where RIF-1C corresponds to a maize R-interacting factor that interacts with the bHLH region of R.4 The growth observed in -Leu -Trp -His -Ade indicates that R411-462-GAL4DBD is properly expressed (Fig. 2A, #4). Deletion analyses of R462-610 demonstrated that the R525-610 region was necessary and sufficient for homodimer formation in yeast (Fig. 2A, #5) and does not activate on its own when fused to the GAL4DBD (Fig. 2A, #6). To biochemically verify the ability of R411-610 to mediate homodimer formation, the full-length R protein was in vitro transcribed/translated in the presence of [35S]Met ([35S] R, Fig. 2B) and assayed in GST pull-down experiments for its ability to interact with bacterially expressed GST-R411-610 (Fig. 2B). As a control, the pull-down experiment was performed in parallel with GST (Fig. 2B). GST-R411-610 (Fig. 2B, lane 2), but not GST (Fig. 2B, lane 3), resulted in the efficient recovery of the ∼79-kDa R protein (Fig. 2B, lane 1) after autoradiography (Fig. 2B, top panel), providing evidence that the dimerization observed in yeast can also happen in vitro. To establish whether the C-terminal region of R can mediate homodimer formation in maize cells, we took advantage of the presence of the acidic region in R (Fig. 1A), which can mediate transcriptional activation when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (e.g. GAL4DBD, not shown). p35S::GAL4DBD-R411-610 does not activate transcription from a promoter containing GAL4 binding sites, driving the luciferase reporter (pGAL4BS::Luc (16Hernandez J. Heine G. Irani N.G. Feller A. Kim M.-G. Matulnik T. Chandler V.L. Grotewold E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48205-48213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)) in Black Mexican Sweet (BMS) maize cells, because the acidic region is absent (Fig. 2C). However, when p35S::R is co-expressed with p35S::GAL4DBD-R411-610, a significant induction of the pGAL4BS::Luc reporter construct was observed (Fig. 2C, compare p35S::GAL4DBD-R411-610 and p35S::GAL4DBD-R411-610 + p35S::R) at levels comparable with those attained by the C1 transcriptional activation domain (28Sainz M.B. Goff S.A. Chandler V.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) fused to the GAL4DBD (Fig. 2C, p35S::GAL4DBD-C1TAD). This plant two-hybrid result suggests that the R411-610 region can mediate dimerization in vivo in maize cells. Taken together, these findings identify a novel dimerization region in the C-terminal domain of R (R525-610). The Dimerization Region of R Is Necessary for Regulatory"

The protein C/APC Gla domain is implicated in both interactions. We sought to identify how the protein C Gla domain enables specific protein-protein interactions in addition to its conserved role in phospholipid binding. The human prothrombin Gla domain, which cannot bind EPCR or support protein S cofactor activity, has 22/45 residues that are not shared with the human protein C Gla domain. We hypothesized that the unique protein C/APC Gla domain residues were responsible for mediating the specific interactions. To assess this, we generated 13 recombinant protein C/APC variants incorporating the prothrombin residue substitutions. Despite anticoagulant activity similar to wild-type APC in the absence of protein S, APC variants APC(PT33-39) (N33S/V34S/D35T/D36A/L38D/A39V) and APC(PT36/38/39) (D36A/L38D/A39V) were not stimulated by protein S, whereas APC(PT35/36) (D35T/D36A) exhibited reduced protein S sensitivity. Moreover, PC(PT8/10) (L8V/H10K) displayed negligible EPCR affinity, despite normal binding to anionic phospholipid vesicles and factor Va proteolysis in the presence and absence of protein S. A single residue variant, PC(PT8), also failed to bind EPCR. Factor VIIa, which also possesses Leu-8, bound soluble EPCR with similar affinity to wild-type protein C, collectively confirming Leu-8 as the critical residue for EPCR recognition. These results reveal the specific Gla domain residues responsible for mediating protein C/APC molecular recognition with both its cofactor and receptor and further illustrate the multifunctional potential of Gla domains.

Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent protein with a multidomain structure comprising a serine protease domain, two epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, and a Gla domain (15Foster D. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4766-4770Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Situated at the protein C N terminus, the Gla domain consists of 45 amino acid residues. Of these, 9 glutamic acid (Glu) residues are post-translationally modified to γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues. Gla residues facilitate Ca2+ ion coordination, which causes the domain to undergo a profound structural transition (16Christiansen W.T. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J.

A direct role for the APC Gla domain in mediating protein S cofactor activity was suggested by a study in which a recombinant protein C chimera was generated and the protein C Gla domain (residues 1-45) was replaced by that of prothrombin (18Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9031-9040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This chimera was resistant to protein S cofactor stimulation. Furthermore, the anticoagulant activity of an APC chimera in which the APC Gla domain residues 1-22 were substituted with the corresponding prothrombin residues was enhanced by protein S, suggesting a role for APC residues 22-45. However, the precise residues responsible, present in the protein C/APC Gla domain but not in prothrombin, were not determined. The protein C Gla domain is also required for EPCR binding (29Regan L.M. Mollica J.S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26279-26284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of part of the protein C Gla domain (residues 1-33) bound to soluble EPCR (sEPCR) indicated that hydrophobic residues Phe-4 and Leu-8 contained within the ω-loop of the protein C Gla domain and Gla residues 7, 25 and 29, bind EPCR (30Oganesyan V.

Despite the significant amino acid sequence conservation between the EPCR binding residues of the protein C/APC Gla domain and that of other vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins, surprisingly only protein C/APC has been reported to bind EPCR. Binding competition experiments using FX, FXa, and protein S failed to prevent high affinity protein C-EPCR binding (31Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the residues that enable the EPCR to recognize and bind specifically to the protein C/APC Gla domain are currently unknown. In this study, we evaluated 13 protein C/APC recombinant variants where protein C residues were substituted for those of prothrombin at non-identical positions (22/45 Gla domain residues). We assessed the binding of each variant for both phospholipids and sEPCR and evaluated the APC variants in anticoagulant activity assays in the presence and absence of protein S in both purified protein and plasma systems. We describe the critical residues in the APC Gla domain that mediate protein S cofactor activity. Moreover, we have identified the protein C Gla domain residue responsible for the specific “recognition” of EPCR and how its presence in factor VII (FVII) also enables it to bind EPCR. Generation of Protein C Variants—The pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) containing full-length protein C cDNA was used to generate recombinant wild-type protein C and as a template for PCR site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (available on request) as before (32Preston R.J.

Expression vectors for each protein C variant were used to transfect human embryonic kidney 293 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Wiltshire, UK), and G418-selected colonies expressing protein C at high levels were picked for further expansion. Serum-free conditioned medium containing each recombinant protein C was buffer exchanged against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Protein C was purified by ion exchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) with a gradient elution using 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm CaCl2 as previously described (19Sun Y.H.

Protein C concentrations were determined either by absorbance at 280 nm or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (32Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The purity of all recombinant proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and Western blotting was performed using a horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-protein C antibody (Dako, Ely, UK). To generate APC, wild-type protein C and protein C variants were activated with Protac as previously described (32Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Kinetic values were used to active site titrate each recombinant APC variant against wild-type APC. Phospholipid Binding of Protein C Variants—A BIAcore X system (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to evaluate protein C binding to anionic phospholipids. 10 μg/ml of a Ca2+-dependent anti-protein C monoclonal antibody (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) was immobilized onto both flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore), corresponding to ∼12,000 RU on each flow cell. 50 μl of wild-type or variant protein C was then passed over the surface of one flow cell at a flow rate of 30 μl/min until a response of ∼2,000 RU was achieved for each protein C species tested. The flow cell with no protein C bound was used to detect nonspecific binding. Phospholipids phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PC/PS, 80%:20%) were prepared as described previously (32Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in HBS-N buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) (BIAcore) containing 3 mm CaCl2 and 0.6 mm MgCl2 and then passed over the surface of the sensor chip at 30 μl/min for 1 min. Phospholipids were dissociated from the surface using 5 μl of 40 mm octyl glucoside (Sigma) at the same flow rate. The maximum binding response at each phospholipid concentration was assessed using BIA-evaluation software (3.0) (BIAcore). The sensor chip surface was regenerated using HBS-EP buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20) (BIA-core), for 5 min at 30 μl/min. EPCR Binding Affinity of Protein C Variants—Protein C binding to sEPCR was quantitatively assessed as previously described (32Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 ng of RCR-2 (a kind gift from K. Fukudome, Saga Medical School, Japan; characterized in Ref. 32Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was injected for 6 min across both flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip, generating a response of 8,000-9,000 RU. sEPCR was expressed as described previously (32Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). sEPCR in HBS-P buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% v/v surfactant p20) containing 3 mm CaCl2 and 0.6 mm MgCl2 was injected and equilibrated. Protein C concentrations (12.5-200 nm) were sequentially injected over both flow cells at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 80 s. The flow cell immobilized with RCR-2 without sEPCR bound was used to detect nonspecific binding. Any influence of mass transport effects was discounted from results of binding and dissociation at different flow rates. HBS-EP buffer (BIAcore) was used to dissociate the protein C-sEPCR complex. The RCR-2 surface was regenerated with 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, after each set of experiments. Determination of APC-mediated Factor Va Proteolysis—To determine FVa degradation by APC, 0.32 nm APC was incubated at 37 °C with phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS, 80%:20%) and 4 nm FVa (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.3% w/v bovine serum albumin (0.08 nm APC, 19 μm phospholipids, and 1 nm FVa, final concentration). At specified time points over 20 min, 2-μl aliquots were removed and added to a prothrombinase mixture consisting of 75 μm phospholipids, 3 nm factor Xa, and 1.5 μm prothrombin (25 μm phospholipids (PC/PS, 80%:20%), 1 nm factor Xa, and 0.5 μm prothrombin, final concentrations) (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) for 3 min. Each reaction was then stopped using 5 μl of ice-cold 0.5 m EDTA. 100 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and incubated with 50 μl of chromogenic substrate S-2238 (Chromogenix, Milan, Italy) to assess thrombin generation. The rate of S-2238 cleavage was measured at 405 nm using an iEMS plate reader MF (Labsystem, Basingstoke, UK). Protein S-enhanced Proteolysis of FVa by APC—Human protein S (2.5-25 nm) was incubated with 0.8 nm APC, 8 nm FVa, and 75 μm phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 60%:20%:20%) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (0.2 nm APC, 2 nm FVa, and 19 μm phospholipid vesicles, final concentrations) for 2 min at 37 °C. A 2-μl aliquot was added to 0.3 nm FXa, 1.5 μm prothrombin, and 75 μm phospholipid vesicles (0.1 nm FXa, 0.5 μm prothrombin, and 25 μm phospholipid vesicles, final concentrations) at 37 °C for 3 min. 5 μl of ice-cold 250 mm EDTA stopped the reaction. 50 μl of S-2238 was diluted 1:2 with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.3, and added to 50 μl of the reaction mixture. The rate of S-2238 cleavage was then measured as before. Protein S-dependent APC Anticoagulant Activity in Plasma— Thrombin generation was assessed using a Fluoroskan Ascent Plate Reader (Thermo Lab System, Helsinki, Finland) in combination with Thrombinoscope software (SYNAPSE BV) as previously described (35Hemker H.C. Beguin S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 36Sere K.M. Rosing J. Hackeng T.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 3624-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 80 μl/well of protein C-deficient plasma (Affinity Biologicals Inc., Ontario, Canada) was incubated with 240 μg/ml of anti-protein S polyclonal antibody or the equivalent volume of water for 15 min at room temperature. Each plasma pool was then incubated with 16 pm recombinant tissue factor (Dade Innovin, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) and 17.5 μm phospholipid vesicles (PC/PS/PE, 60%:20%:20%). 42 μg/ml corn trypsin inhibitor (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) was added to prevent contact activation. APC (3.5-7 nm) was added to microtiter plate wells and the plasma mix with or without anti-protein S polyclonal antibody subsequently added, making a final volume of 100 μl/well. Thrombin generation was initiated by automatic dispensation of 2.5 mm Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC·HCl, 2.5% Me2SO, 18 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 54 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm CaCl2 into each well. Thrombin generation was quantitated using a thrombin calibration standard (Synapse, Maastricht, Netherlands). Measurements were taken at 20-s intervals for 40 min at wavelengths 390 nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission). Generation and Characterization of Protein C Variants—To identify protein C Gla domain residues that enable protein S cofactor activity and EPCR recognition, a series of protein C variants with prothrombin residue substitutions at non-identical positions were generated (Fig. 1). These variants were divided into two groups, those situated at the N-terminal end of the protein C Gla domain (residues 1-25) and those located at the C-terminal end incorporating the hydrophobic stack (residues 26-45). The purity of each recombinant protein C variant was confirmed by Coomassie staining and exhibited identical characteristic double bands under non-reducing conditions upon Western blotting with an anti-protein C polyclonal antibody (data not shown). Phospholipid Binding of Protein C Variants—To characterize the Gla domain integrity of the recombinant protein C variants, the ability of each variant to bind to phospholipids was assessed. Protein C was bound to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip by a Ca2+-dependent anti-protein C monoclonal antibody directed against the heavy chain, and not the Gla domain-containing light chain, of protein C. A protein C variant (E16D), possessing a residue substitution that causes aberrant Ca2+ binding and Gla domain misfolding (32Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was found to bind to the immobilized antibody with equal affinity to human protein C, indicating that the antibody epitope was not on the Gla domain (data not shown). Increasing concentrations of anionic phospholipid vesicles were passed over the protein C surface and specific binding was detected (Fig. 2A). Due to the slow dissociation rate of the phospholipid-protein C interaction, thorough analysis of the binding kinetics was not possible. The maximum binding response at each phospholipid concentration was therefore measured and used to qualitatively assess phospholipid binding. The binding response of both human protein C and recombinant wild-type protein C at each phospholipid concentration tested was essentially identical (Fig. 2B). When the E16D protein C variant (which does not bind phospholipids) (32Preston R.J. Villegas-Mendez A. Sun Y.H. Hermida J. Simioni P. Philippou H. Dahlback B. Lane D.A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was immobilized, a minimal response to phospholipids was detected (Fig. 2B, top panel), demonstrating the specificity of this approach. The phospholipid binding of the remaining variants was found to be very similar to that of wild-type protein C (Fig. 2B, middle and lower panels), with the exception of PC(PT21/23/24) and PC(PT31-35). These variants exhibited markedly reduced binding to phospholipids (Fig. 2B, middle and lower panel, respectively), suggesting that these variants most likely possess a misfolded Gla domain due to suboptimal γ-carboxylation. The defective phospholipid binding of both variants also resulted in severely impaired anticoagulant activity in protein C-deficient plasma (data not shown). Consequently, these variants were not investigated further. Protein S-independent FVa Proteolysis by APC Variants— Each protein C variant was activated by Protac, and the amidolytic activity of each APC variant against a short chromogenic substrate (S-2366) was tested and found to be identical to that of wild-type APC (data not shown). To determine whether the introduced prothrombin residue substitutions influenced FVa proteolysis in the absence of protein S, each APC variant was investigated for its ability to proteolyze FVa in a phospholipid-dependent time course reaction (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, wild-type APC reduced FVa cofactor activity to 21 ± 5% after 20 min. APC variants were found to inactivate FVa at effectively the same rate as wildtype APC. Some variants exhibited mildly increased FVa proteolysis, including APC(PT11/12) (S11G/S12N), APC(PT33-39) (N33S/V34S/D35T/D36A/L38D/A39V), and APC(PT35/36) (D35T/D36A) (Fig. 3, A and B), possibly as a result of the slightly increased affinity for phospholipids of these variants (Fig. 2). Protein S Does Not Enhance FVa Proteolysis by APC Variants APC(PT33-39), APC(PT35/36), and APC(PT36/38/39)—To examine the influence of substituted protein C Gla domain residues in mediating protein S cofactor activity, the ability of each APC variant to proteolyze FVa in the presence of varying protein S concentrations was determined. Wild-type APC reduced FVa cofactor activity to 27 ± 8% of its original activity in the presence of 25 nm protein S (Fig. 4). All N-terminal Gla domain APC variants tested were stimulated by protein S normally (Fig. 4A), as were half of the C-terminal variants (Fig. 4B). However, FVa proteolysis by APC variants APC(PT33-39) and APC(PT36/38/39) (D36A/L38D/A39V) was not enhanced by protein S. The remaining FVa activity in the presence of 25 nm protein S with variants APC(PT33-39) and APC(PT36/38/39) was 92 ± 7 and 91 ± 2%, respectively (Fig. 4B). The APC(PT35/36) variant also exhibited a significantly impaired response to protein S compared with wild-type APC, only reducing FVa cofactor activity to 73 ± 9% of its original value in the presence of 25 nm protein S (Fig. 4B). APC Variants Containing Residue Substitutions between Positions 33-39 Are Not Enhanced by Protein S in Plasma—To assess whether the observed reduced sensitivity to protein S exhibited by APC variants APC(PT33-39), APC(PT36/38/39), and APC(PT35/36) using purified plasma proteins was replicated in the plasma milieu, an assay measuring tissue factor-induced thrombin generation in protein C-deficient plasma was used. Thrombin generation in protein C-deficient plasma was initiated by the presence of tissue factor and anionic phospholipid vesicles, generating an estimated thrombin potential (ETP) of 1720 ± 82 nm. When wild-type APC was incubated in the protein C-deficient plasma, the ETP diminished in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, top panel). At the highest APC concentration tested (7 nm), the ETP was reduced to 15 ± 1% of the ETP determined with no APC present (Fig. 5, A and C). However, when a polyclonal anti-protein S antibody known to inhibit APC-dependent protein S cofactor function (36Sere K.M. Rosing J. Hackeng T.M. Blood. 2004; 104: 3624-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was incubated with 7 nm wild-type APC, the ETP was not diminished and the anticoagulant effect of wild-type APC was effectively lost (Fig. 5B). In this way, the assay was shown to be completely dependent upon protein S to facilitate APC down-regulation of thrombin generation. Variants APC(PT33-39), APC(PT35/36), and APC(PT36/38/39) were tested in both the presence and absence of the inhibitory anti-protein S antibody. In the presence of the anti-protein S antibody, minimal ETP reduction (<10%) was observed for each of the APC variants tested (data not shown). In the absence of the anti-protein S antibody, APC(PT35/36) reduced thrombin generation ∼2-fold less effectively than wild-type APC (Fig. 5, A and C). Variants APC(PT33-39) and APC(PT36/38/39) failed to inhibit thrombin generation at any of the APC concentrations tested (Fig. 5, A and C), highlighting their inability to interact with protein S to reduce thrombin generation. The phospholipid PE has been previously shown to significantly enhance APC anticoagulant activity (18Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L.

To confirm that the results observed for variants APC(PT33-39), APC(PT35/36), and APC(PT36/38/39) were not a consequence of defective interaction with PE, the same experiments were performed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles composed of PC/PS only. The results of these experiments we"

Fernandez-Vina M. Honda M. Risch N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 686-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), it is generally presumed that hypocretin cells are the target of an autoimmune process (13Chabas D. Taheri S. Renier C. Mignot E. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2003; 4: 459-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This cell destruction in human narcolepsy is likely triggered by environmental factors interacting with a specific genetic background.An understanding of the processes underlying hcrt cell specification, differentiation, and maintenance as well as why they are susceptible to loss are key questions of both basic and clinical relevance. The zebrafish is well suited for such studies by virtue of nearly transparent and rapid external development. Another important feature is the ease and efficiency of genetic manipulation of zebrafish embryos to create transgenic marker lines or to achieve rapid overexpression or phenotypic knock-down of selected genes (14Stuart G.W. McMurray J.V. Westerfield M. Development. 1988; 103: 403-412PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). The zebrafish is a simple and powerful model for studying promoter function, and recently genetic manipulation has been extended to functional characterization of putative regulatory sequences (16Dickmeis T. Plessy C. Rastegar S. Aanstad P. Herwig R. Chalmel F. Fischer N. Strahle U. Genome. Res. 2004; 14: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Amsterdam A. Becker T.S. Dev.

Dyn. 2006; 235: 870-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transgenesis is far simpler than in the mouse, with the additional advantage of being able to assess transient promoter activity in the context of the whole animal for accurate study of spatial and temporal gene regulation. Hundreds of independent transgenic animals can be easily monitored; thus position-dependent integration effects do not bias the results.The hypocretin gene is conserved in teleost genomes and is similarly expressed in lateral hypothalamic cell clusters in the adult zebrafish (21Kaslin J. Nystedt J.M. Ostergard M. Peitsaro N. Panula P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2678-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It may thus be involved in the regulation of states of “wakefulness” and energy homeostasis as in mammals. Larval zebrafish display a diurnal rhythm of locomotor activity and have periods of nocturnal immobility that are associated with a stereotypic posture and an increased arousal threshold, key behavioral indicators of a sleep-like state (22Zhdanova I.V. Wang S.Y. Leclair O.U. Danilova N.P. Brain Res. 2001; 903: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 23Yokogawa T. Zhang J. Mignot E. Sleep. 2006; 29: A36Google Scholar, 24Zhdanova I.V. Zebrafish. 2006; 3: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Sleep homeostatic mechanisms are also present; following rest deprivation, larvae display a compensatory rest rebound with an increased arousal threshold (22Zhdanova I.V. Wang S.Y. Leclair O.U. Danilova N.P. Brain Res. 2001; 903: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Hypnotic compounds of the benzodiazepine and barbiturate families induce a sleep-like behavior in zebrafish; thus the role of GABA in behavioral sleep is likely to be functionally conserved (22Zhdanova I.V. Wang S.Y. Leclair O.U. Danilova N.P. Brain Res. 2001; 903: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This may also be the case with other sleep-modulatory neurotransmitters that have been identified in the zebrafish (25Kaslin J. Panula P. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 440: 342-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 26Renier C. Faraco J. Mignot E. Sleep. 2006; 29: A360Google Scholar) including acetylcholine, histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and dopamine (27Eriksson K.S. Peitsaro N. Karlstedt K. Kaslin J. Panula P. Eur. J.

Bull. 2005; 66: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In our efforts to understand the origins and unique character of hypocretin cells, we have applied both embryologic and transgenic studies in zebrafish. We have extended the genetic characterization of the zebrafish hypocretin gene to include the first coding exon and demonstrate a selective pattern of lateral hypothalamic expression. Hcrt transcripts were localized in a cluster of ∼9 cells/hemibrain by the end of the first week of development. A similar genomic characterization was performed in Tetraodon nigroviridis. Transgenesis revealed a compact, phylogenetically conserved promoter driving enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression exclusively in native HCRT-producing cells. We have used this promoter to create transient and stably transgenic EGFP marker strains to characterize the process of formation of hypocretin projections. Finally, a 13-base pair functional element essential to promoter function was also identified.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESZebrafish Husbandry—Wild-type zebrafish were maintained at 28 °C on a 14:10 light-dark cycle under optimal maintenance conditions (32Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio rerio). 2nd Ed. University of Oregon Press, Eugene, OR1993Google Scholar) in accordance with the animal protocol approved by Stanford University. The embryos were generated by natural spawning and were raised in egg water containing methylene blue (0.3 ppm). For in situ hybridization and EGFP observation, the embryos were incubated in 0.003% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea after 24 hpf to prevent pigment formation.BAC Clones—Zebrafish HCRT clones were isolated from two BAC libraries through hybridization and analyzed by hybridization, PCR, sequence analysis, and subcloning. Genome systems (Incyte Genomics) clones 87J11, 91K13, and 147H8 were a kind gift from Will Talbot; Chori 211 clones 3K3, 37N13, 59P20, 134F5, and 135D16 were obtained through CHORI (Oakland, CA). T. nigroviridis BAC clones 50L6, 38I21, 49B24, 10G8, and 20D23 were identified through blast searches of the GenBank™ Genome Survey Sequence database and obtained from Genoscope, Paris.Reverse transcription-PCR and RACE—The full transcripts of the zebrafish and T. nigroviridis hcrt genes were determined through reverse transcription-PCR and 5′- and 3′-RACE. Total RNA was extracted from excised, pooled juvenile zebrafish brains and adult Tetraodon brain and then treated by on-column DNase I digestion (RNeasy; Qiagen). cDNA was prepared with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. 5′- and 3′-RACE were performed according to the GeneRacer protocol (Invitrogen) with primers 3′zhcrt-RACE-GSP2 (5′-GGAAGAGGCTGGAGGAGCCCGCTA-3′) and 5′zhcrt-RACE-GSP2 (5′-TAGCAGCGCCATGAAGACGAGCAC-3′). PCR products were cloned into pCRII TOPO® (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The expression and splicing of Tetraodon and zebrafish hcrt were confirmed through reverse transcription-PCR (Superscript II; Invitrogen). Primers were tet-F1 (5′-ACTTGTTCCAAAAAGGAAGATCAG-3′) and tet-R1 (5′-CAACACGTAGAGTCGACAGGAGCG-3′).Bioinformatics—Fish hcrt sequences were identified through Blast searches of databases including: Zv6 v38 May 2006 (zebrafish), TETRAODON 7 April 2003, FUGU 4.0 June 2005, and Gasterosteus aculeatus BROAD S1 (stickleback) (all available at www.ensembl.org/index.html); Oryzias latipes (medaka) databases golw_scaffold_last.seq, golw_scaffold Hd-rR (200506, 200406), golw_contig Hd-rR (200506, 200406) are available at dolphin.laboratorynig.ac.jp/medaka/srch_db/search_medaka_blastdb2.php?hmpage=/medaka/index.php&lang=eg&lmode=all. Hit and database for Exon 2 were GOLWno5793_l17.g1 golw05 (494–132).DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI 377 automated sequencer, and analysis was performed using Sequencher (Gene Codes). Alignments were made with ClustalW (1.83). Analysis of transcription factor binding sites was made with TESS (www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess/tess) and the public version of Match 1.0 (www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs.html#match, (33Kel A.E. Gossling E. Reuter I. Cheremushkin E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) using the best selection profile and minimize sum of both error rate options. Fgenes, Fex, and Spl (Softberry.com) were used to identify potential first exons and/or splice donor sites. Signal peptide cleavage sites were predicted with SignalP 3.0 www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/. Putative first exons were next compared for conserved encoded amino acids, predicted intron length, and relative conservation of promoter elements (TATAA box) using ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Footprinter (bio.cs.washington.edu/software.html) (34Blanchette M. Tompa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3840-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and MEME (meme.sdsc.edu/meme/intro.html) were used to identify conserved motifs.Constructs—Zebrafish hcrt promoter constructs 2kb-zhcrt-EGFP (–1941 to +62) and 1kb-zhcrt-EGFP (–941 to +62, GenBank™ DQ831347) fragments were amplified by PCR of genomic DNA and ligated into the SalI-BamH1 sites of pEGFP-1. A 1040-bp T. nigroviridis hcrt promoter fragment (1–1040 of GenBank™ DQ831348) was amplified from BAC 10G8 DNA by PCR and ligated into the BglII site of pEGFP-1 (Clontech). Deletion and substitution mutations were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as instructed by the manufacturer. The resulting clones were tested through restriction analysis and confirmed through sequencing.Substitution Primers—Forward primers are listed, and overlapping reverse primers are reverse complement: Region 1-SalI, 5′-GTTAGCAAATACCAACAGGTCGACTGTGTGACGAGGCCTTGATT-3′; Region 2-SalI, 5′-CACTCATTCTGTTGGTATTTGCTGTCGACGCTCGTCCTCCTGTCCATAAT-3′; Region 3-NotI, 5′-AGCTCGTCCTCCTGTCCATAAGCGGCCGCTTAAGAACTTGCCGGGATA-3′; and Region 4-NotI, 5′-AAGAACTTGCCGGGATACAGGGCGGCCGCGTTACACGCTAATGACAA-3′.Deletion Primers—The deletion primers used are: 1000 to 750-Right, 5′-pATATCTCGTTTAGAGTGCTGCATT-3′; 1000 to 750-Left, 5′-pTTTTCTGCTCTGAGCACAGTGTAG-3′; 750 to 500-Right, 5′-pTTAAATCTGACTGCTCTCTGACCT-3′; 750 to –500-Right Left, 5′-pGCTGTTGTTTCAGGTGAAAGTTTG-3′; 500 to 250-Right, 5′-pGACAAAGATGCTAACAACCCCGAA-3′; 500 to 250-Left, 5′-pTGATGAGGCGCTCGAACACATTCA-3′; 251 to 99 (also known as “–250 to TATAAA”)-Right, pGTGGCACATCTGTATAAAAACGAG; 251 to 99-Left, pATTAGCGTGTAACCAGGATTACCT; Region 2-Right, 5′-pCGTACTCCTGTCCATAATAGTTGTTTTAAG-3′; and Region 2-SnabI-Left, 5′-pTAATACCAACAGAATGAGTGTGTGACG-3′.Transient and Stable Expression Assay—Upon fertilization, 100–400 eggs were harvested and placed in agarose grooves for injection. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (transient experiments) or gel-purified, linearized DNA (stable transgenic lines) was diluted to 50 ng/μl, and ∼2 nl were injected into the cytoplasm of one-cell stage wild-type embryos using a micromanipulator and a PLI 90 injector (Harvard Apparatus). The embryos were transferred to 10-cm dishes (<60/dish) and maintained as above. For promoter analysis EGFP positive embryos were counted at two time points (30 and 54 hpf) using a Zeiss M2Bio fluorescence microscope fitted with a 10× objective lens and an EGFP filter. Hypothalamic fluorescence of one or more cells (unilateral or bilateral) in the hypocretin cells region was scored as specific. For hcrt cell projection analysis, the embryos were injected with the 1kb-zhcrt-EGFP construct and monitored during the first week of development.Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Whole mount RNA in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (35Hauptmann G. Gerster T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 36Jowett T. Lettice L. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 73-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin- or fluorescein-labeled full-length antisense riboprobes for egfp and zebrafish hcrt were transcribed in vitro using standard reagents (ProMega).RESULTSGenomic Structure of zhcrt and thcrt Genes—We performed 5′-RACE to identify the transcriptional start site of zebrafish hypocretin (zhcrt) and identified a small first exon encoding 6 amino acids and containing 62 bp of 5′-untranslated sequences (GenBank™/EBI accession number DQ831346). This exon was not identified in prior published work (21Kaslin J. Nystedt J.M. Ostergard M. Peitsaro N. Panula P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2678-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The two-exon structure is similar to the structure of mammalian hcrt genes. Through sequence and Southern analysis of BAC clones from two libraries (Genome systems, Chori 211), we identified the presence of a single zhcrt locus with a polymorphic intron sized 3.6 or 6 kb associated with a 2408-bp insertion located 137 bp upstream of exon 2, with homology to the helentron Hel_Dr6 repetitive element, as well as numerous SNPS and indel polymorphisms in BAC clones from the AB strain (GenBank™/EBI accession number DQ831349) (Fig. 1A). This polymorphism was confirmed through Southern analysis of genomic zebrafish strains from various strains. The Tetraodon hcrt (thcrt) gene was identified through Blast searches and resequenced on BAC DNA revealing also a two-exon hypocretin gene. Expression and splicing of the predicted Tetraodon gene were confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Further studies of the zebrafish and Tetraodon BAC clones indicated conservation of synteny in this region, with the Stat3, Stat5, hcrt, and Bec2/KCNH4 genes located in the BAC contigs, as reported in mouse (37Miyoshi K. Cui Y. Riedlinger G. Robinson P. Lehoczky J. Zon L. Oka T. Dewar K. Hennighausen L. Genomics. 2001; 71: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the most recent zebrafish and Tetraodon whole genome assemblies (Sanger Institute, Ensembl), hcrt corresponds to FGENESH00000056346 on chromosome 3 in zebrafish and GSCT000132001 on chromosome 3 in Tetraodon.We also identified two-exon hcrt genes in other teleosts through searches of genome databases and subsequent analysis of the regions surrounding the hits. These other teleost hcrt genes were identified in Fugu (NEWSINFRUG00000161995), Stickleback (GENSCAN00000033466, with 5′ sequence and exon 1 reported here located on contig_4260: 5838783–5839782), and medaka (5′ sequence and exon 1 on scaffold5097: 24560–23509, and exon 2 on GOLWno5793_l17.g1: 494–132). The medaka, stickleback, and both pufferfish genes all have multiple in-frame ATG codons in the predicted first exons, but these correspond to an out of frame ATG in zebrafish in alignments. Because there are no data on the transcriptional or translational start sites in these animals, predicted translational start sites were selected as the last ATG based on conservation (7 encoded amino acids in mammals and 6 in zebrafish) (Fig. 1B). Flanking 5′ noncoding sequences showed substantial conservation between various fish species, supporting our exon predictions (data not shown). Predicted signal peptide cleavage sites were in a localized region of the precursor protein similar to that known in mammals (Fig. 1B). In the two pufferfish, two potential sites were predicted (22↓23 and 24↓25) and the first site (22↓23) was reported. In all of the fish studied, an additional stretch of amino acids is present within the mature HCRT-1 peptide when compared with mammals (Fig. 1B).Alignment of human and predicted protein sequences of HCRT in five teleosts revealed a strikingly high homology at the predicted C-terminal end of both hypocretin peptides and at dibasic cleavage sites. As these amino acids are indispensable for proper peptide processing and ligand binding to the receptor (38Asahi S. Shin-ichiro E. Matsuda M. Iwaasa H. Kanatani A. Ohkubo M. Ihara M. Sakurai T. Morishima H. Fujii N. Peptide Science 1999. Protein Research Foundation, Toyonata, Japan2000: 37-40Google Scholar), the data add credence to the functional similarity of the hypocretin system across fish and mammals.Embryonic and Larval Expression of Hypocretin—We examined the development of hypocretin-producing cells through whole mount in situ hybridization ISH. Starting at ∼22 hpf hcrt expression was observed either unilaterally or bilaterally in loose clusters in the lateral ventral diencephalon corresponding to the developing hypothalamus (Fig. 2, A–C). There was variability in both the number and positioning of cells within the bilateral clusters through all time points. Signal was never detected outside this unique hypothalamic cluster at any larval time point, indicating that in the zebrafish, hcrt transcripts are restricted to the lateral hypothalamus. The positions of the cell clusters changed with the ongoing development of the brain, first appearing rostral with respect to the lens axis, then moving directly between the lenses (2 dpf), and finally reaching a position slightly dorsal and caudal to the lens axis (6 dpf) (Fig. 2). Cell counts were determined by observation of 20 animals aged from 1 to 7 dpf. At day 1, up to 5 cells per cluster were observed, with an average total number of 4.6 ± 0.5 (S.E.). Average total cell numbers were 14.4 ± 0.9 at 2 dpf, 17.1 ± 0.7 at 3 dpf, 20.5 ± 0.9 at 4 dpf, 15.7 ± 0.7 at 5 dpf, 15.9 ± 0.5 at 6 dpf, and 18.9 ± 0.7 at 7 dpf. Overall, an average total of 17.63 ± 0.36 cells were seen at 2–7 dpf.FIGURE 2Whole mount in situ hybridization of zhcrt in the first week of development using antisense zhcrt riboprobes. Hcrt is exclusively detected in bilateral clusters of the developing hypothalamus and onset of ∼22 hpf marked by arrowheads in A–C. Rotation of cells along a dorsal-caudal path with respect to the lens axis is notable through the first week. Cells proliferate early and reach ∼8–9 cells/hemibrain cluster during the first week of development. Frontal (C, F, I, L, and O) and dorsal (A, D, G, J, and M) views show the localization of the cluster in the lateral hypothalamus. Vitellus was removed to picture stained cells in A and D. Lateral views are depicted in B, E, H, K, and N, and frontal views in (C, F, I, L, and O) illustrate the gradual movement of the clusters during development along the dorso-ventral and antero-posterior axes with lens position as a reference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A One-kilobase Promoter Fragment Is Sufficient to Drive Cell-specific Hypocretin Expression—The promoter activity of putative zebrafish 5′ genomic fragments was explored through expression of EGFP. Purified DNA was injected into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage, and EGFP fluorescence was observed after 24 hpf. We found that reporter constructs containing 1 and 2 kb of sequence upstream of the translational start site (1kb-zhcrt GenBank™/EBI accession number DQ831347, and 2kb-zhcrt, containing bases –1941 or –941 through +62; Fig. 1) were efficient at driving EGFP expression in a pattern consistent with time of onset and position of native hcrt expression (Fig. 3). In addition, a 1040-bp Tetraodon fragment (1kb-thcrt, spanning 1–1040 of GenBank™/EBI accession number DQ831348) was able to drive expression of EGFP in zebrafish embryos in a similar manner (Fig. 3). Strikingly, ectopic EGFP expression was never observed. Co-expression of egfp and endogenous hcrt mRNAs was demonstrated by double in situ hybridization (Fig. 3). A stable strain of zebrafish with fluorescent hcrt cells was derived using the 1kb-thcrt-EGFP Tetraodon construct (two germline founders among 100 animals raised). We also tested the 3.2-kb human hypocretin promoter fragment effective in mouse (39Sakurai T. Moriguchi T. Furuya K. Kajiwara N. Nakamura T. Yanagisawa M. Goto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17771-17776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) 4Human hcrt-EGFP promoter construct kindly provided by T. Sakurai (Japan). and never observed any fluorescence.FIGURE 3EGFP fluorescence in zebrafish hcrt cells. EGFP fluorescence under the control of 1kb-thcrt and 1kb-zhcrt promoter fragments were visualized in live animals on the second day of development. Observed fluorescence from the stable 1kb-thcrt-EGFP transgenic strain and transient expression from 1kb-zhcrt-EGFP construct are consistent with the timing and position of native hcrt expression (lateral and frontal views). Expression of egfp and hcrt are localized in the same cell bodies, establishing that observed fluorescence accurately tracks hcrt cells. Single and double in situ hybridization experiments demonstrate identical expression of egfp (INT/BCIP, red color) and endogenous hcrt (BM purple, blue color) mRNA within the same cell population in transgenic animals (co-localized colors appear purple).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Elaboration of hcrt Projections—Development of HCRT fibers was characterized by observation of EGFP fluorescence under the control of the 1kb-zhcrt and 1kb-thcrt promoters. Mosaic transient expression resulted in the intense expression of EGFP in a variable number of cells (up to a number similar to native expression; compare Fig. 4, F and G), allowing observation of projections. Cell projections were initiated by 1 dpf, during the proliferative phase, and first extended caudo-dorsally at an oblique angle (Fig. 4, A and B). After 2 dpf, the projections bend to attain a sharp 90° turn located in the center of the midbrain (Fig. 4C"
https://openalex.org/W2040923092,"Nitrogen is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe. In the interstellar medium, it has been thought to be mostly molecular (N2). However, N2 has no observable rotational or vibrational transitions, so its abundance in the interstellar medium remains poorly known. In comets, the N2 abundance is very low, while the elemental nitrogen abundance is deficient with respect to the solar value. Moreover, large nitrogen isotopic anomalies are observed in meteorites and interstellar dust particles. Here we report the N2H+ (and by inference the N2) abundance inside a cold dark molecular cloud. We find that only a small fraction of nitrogen in the gas phase is molecular, with most of it being atomic. Because the compositions of comets probably reflect those of dark clouds, this result explains the low N2 abundance in comets. We argue that the elemental nitrogen abundance deficiency in comets can be understood if the atomic oxygen abundance is lower than predicted by present chemical models. Furthermore, the lack of molecular nitrogen in molecular clouds explains the nitrogen anomalies in meteorites and interstellar dust particles, as nitrogen fractionation is enhanced if gaseous nitrogen is atomic."
https://openalex.org/W2130277194,"Androgen ablation inhibits androgen receptor (AR) activity and is as an effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Invariably, PCa relapses in a form resistant to further hormonal manipulations. Although this stage of the disease is androgen-refractory, or androgen depletion-independent (ADI), most tumors remain AR-dependent through aberrant mechanisms of AR activation. We employed the LNCaP/C4-2 model of PCa progression to study AR activity in androgen-dependent and ADI PCa cells. In this report, we show that the AR is transcriptionally inactive in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells in the absence of androgens. However, in ADI C4-2 cells, the AR displays a high level of constitutive, androgen-independent transcriptional activity. To study the mechanisms of ligand-dependent and ligand-independent AR activation in these AR-expressing cells, we generated a reporter system based on swapping the DNA binding domain of the AR with the DNA binding domain of the yeast Gal4 transcription factor. In androgen-dependent PCa cells, the well characterized C-terminal AR activation function-2 (AF-2) domain was critical for strong, ligand-dependent activity. Conversely, in ADI PCa cells, constitutive, ligand-independent AR activity was AF-2-independent but instead dependent on N-terminal AR domains. Importantly, the ligand- and AF-2-independent mode of AR activation observed in ADI PCa cells was completely resistant to the antiandrogen, bicalutamide. Our data thus demonstrate that the AR can inappropriately activate transcription in ADI PCa cells via mechanisms that are resistant to castration and AR antagonism, the two modes of androgen ablation used to treat advanced PCa.

Swindle P.W. Scardino P.T. Urology. 2003; 61: 14-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This approach results in reduced expression of AR target genes, such as prostate specific antigen (PSA), and concomitant tumor regression (4Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). However, PCa invariably relapses in a form that is resistant to these hormonal manipulations, and further treatment is essentially palliative (5Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This stage of the disease is referred to as androgen-independent, androgen-refractory, or androgen depletion-independent (ADI) (6Roy-Burman P. Tindall D.J. Robins D.M. Greenberg N.M. Hendrix J.C. Mohla S. Getzenberg R.H. Isaacs J.T. Pienta K.J. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 4-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Significantly, although ADI PCa is resistant to androgen ablation, the AR remains critical for the growth and survival of most tumors (7Litvinov I.V. De Marzo A.M. Isaacs J.T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For example, most ADI PCa retains AR expression (8Shah R.B. Mehra R. Chinnaiyan A.M. Shen R. Ghosh D. Zhou M. Macvicar G.R. Varambally S. Harwood J. Bismar T.A. Kim R. Rubin M.A. Pienta K.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9209-9216Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Moreover, the PSA gene continues to be expressed at this stage of the disease (8Shah R.B. Mehra R. Chinnaiyan A.M. Shen R. Ghosh D. Zhou M. Macvicar G.R. Varambally S. Harwood J. Bismar T.A. Kim R. Rubin M.A. Pienta K.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9209-9216Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Indeed, targeted AR inhibition decreases PSA expression, cell proliferation, and survival in various cell-based models of ADI PCa (9Eder I.E. Culig Z. Ramoner R. Thurnher M. Putz T.

These findings suggest that ADI PCa cells continue to proliferate and survive through aberrant mechanisms of AR activation, and thus the AR remains a valid target for therapy. The AR shares a modular organization with other nuclear receptors and contains a loosely structured N-terminal domain (NTD) consisting of the AF-1 transactivation function, a zinc-finger DNA binding domain (DBD), a hinge region, and a C-terminal domain (CTD) ligand binding (LBD)/AF-2 transactivation function module (13Lamb D.J. Weigel N.L. Marcelli M. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 62: 199-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, the AR CTD serves to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the NTD AF-1 module. Ligand binding, conversely, relieves this negative regulation on AR AF-1 and also allows the AR AF-2 domain to adopt a structure that can bind FXXLF or LXXLF motifs present in AR coactivators such as ARA70 and members of the p160 coactivator family (14Estebanez-Perpina E. Moore J.M. Mar E. Delgado-Rodrigues E. Nguyen P. Baxter J.D. Buehrer B.M. Webb P. Fletterick R.J. Guy R.K. J. Biol.

Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, both the AF-1 and AF-2 modules are able to recruit coregulatory proteins to genomic androgen response elements (AREs) encoded in the promoter and enhancer regions of target genes (16Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). These coregulators are responsible for mediating full transcriptional activation (17Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). AR mutation or overexpression, altered expression or activity of coregulators, or cross-talk with activated signal transduction pathways can influence AR activity in ADI PCa cells (4Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 5Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). These mechanisms can elicit ligand-independent activation of the AR, or allow inappropriate AR activation in response to low ligand concentrations, alternative steroids, or antiandrogens (4Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). These mechanisms can operate alone or in concert to mediate a critical level of AR activity in ADI PCa cells. Therefore, each plays a key role in the development of resistance to androgen ablation. Before new anti-AR therapies can be developed and tested as treatments for ADI PCa, the domains of the AR that are relevant for targeting must first be identified. To date, all knowledge on mechanisms of AR transactivation comes from studies in AR-null, and usually non-epithelial, non-human cell lines (14Estebanez-Perpina E. Moore J.M. Mar E.

To this end, we developed a system to allow functional study of the AR in a human cell-based model of AR-dependent PCa progression. Our results show that AR activity is strictly ligand-dependent as well as AF-2-dependent in androgen-dependent PCa cells and can thus be blocked by the antiandrogen, bicalutamide. In ADI PCa cells, AR activity is constitutive, ligand-independent, AF-2-independent, and antiandrogen-resistant. We identified transcriptionally active domains in the AR NTD and found that transactivation unit (TAU)-1 was important for full ligand-dependent as well as ligand-independent AR activity in androgen-dependent and ADI cells. Together, these findings suggest that therapies targeted to the AR CTD may lack long term effectiveness due to an inability to inhibit AF-2-independent AR activity. Thus, AR NTD modules such as TAU-1 may be more important and relevant targets for the development of novel anti-AR strategies in androgen-dependent and ADI PCa. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Androgen-dependent LNCaP cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The ADI LNCaP-derived C4-2 cell line was purchased from UroCor (Oklahoma City, OK). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. LNCaP cells between passages 29 and 45 and C4-2 cells between passages 34 and 50 were used for experiments. For androgen response experiments, LNCaP and C4-2 cells were grown in serum-free medium or medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped (steroid depleted) serum (CSS) for 48h. Growth medium was replaced with serum-free medium or medium plus 10% CSS containing 1 nm mibolerone (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 10 μm bicalutamide (AstraZeneca) ethanol, or combinations of these compounds. Cells were cultured for an additional 24 h and then harvested. For C4-2 siRNA-transfection experiments, culture medium was replaced 24 h post-transfection with RPMI plus 5% CSS. After 48-h growth, cells were harvested. Plasmid Constructs—The SV40-Renilla luciferase reporter vector and pG5-LUC were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All PSA promoter-based fragments contained the firefly luciferase reporter pGL3-Basic backbone (Promega). The full-length PSA promoter luciferase reporter, –5746PSA-LUC, containing a 5.8-kb genomic fragment from the PSA locus was obtained from Dr. Charles Young (Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN). The –5746PSA-LUCΔEco/Pst construct was generated by digestion of –5746PSA-LUC with EcoRI/PstI, generation of blunt ends, and re-ligation to create –5746PSA-LUCΔEco/Pst. sPSA-luc (28Yeung F. Li X.

PSAenh(ARE)-E4-LUC and S-All (29Huang W. Shostak Y. Tarr P. Sawyers C. Carey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25756-25768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), referred to here as PSAenh(GAL4)-E4-LUC, were gifts from Dr. Michael Carey (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). PSAenh(GAL4)-LUC has been described previously (30Debes J.D. Comuzzi B. Schmidt L.J. Dehm S.M. Culig Z. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Gal4 expression plasmid, pM, was purchased from Clontech. p5HBhAR-A, containing the full-length human AR cDNA cloned into the pCMV5 expression vector, was a gift from Dr. Frank French (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill). hARGal4 was generated by first creating a MluI site at the 5′-end of the AR DBD within p5HBhAR-A via QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the mutagenic primers ARDBD5′mutFWD (5′-CCACCCCAGAAGACGCGTCTGATCTGTGGAGATGAAGC) and ARDBD5′mutREV (5′-GCTTCATCTCCACAGATCAGACGCGTCTTCTGGGGTGG). An SacII site was then created at the 3′-end of the AR DBD via mutagenesis using the mutagenic primers ARDBD3′mutFWD (5′-GGGATGACTCTGGGACCGCGGAAGCTGAAGAAACTTGG) and ARDBD3′mutREV (5′-CCAAGTTTCTTCAGCTTCCGCGGTCCCAGAGTCATCCC). The Gal4 DBD was then amplified from pM using the primers GAL4DBDMluIFWD (5′-GAAAGACGCGTCTACTGTCTTC) and GAL4DBDSacIIREV (5′-AATTCCCGCGGTACAGTCAAC), digested with MluI/SacII, and cloned into the newly created MluI/SacII sites flanking the AR DBD in p5HBhAR-A. This version of the AR contained 24 CAG repeats in the AR NTD; however, amino acid residues were numbered based on an AR containing 22 CAG repeats and a wild-type DBD to maintain consistency with the literature. For the generation of hARGal4 NTD deletions, successive QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis reactions were carried out to generate in-frame BssHII sites at positions 101 and 211, 211 and 253, 253 and 361, or 361 and 490. The resultant ARGal4 BssHII double mutants were subsequently digested with BssHII and re-ligated to generate the ARGal4 deletions Δ101/211, Δ211/253, Δ253/361, and Δ361/490. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis was employed to create N705S, R752Q, V716R, K720A, and E897K mutant versions of hARGal4. Details of the primers used for these mutagenesis reactions will be made available upon request. All deletion and point-mutant constructs were sequenced to verify their integrity and tested for expression via transfection and Western blot with anti-Gal4 antibodies. Transient Transfections—For experiments that directly compared the activities of reporter constructs in LNCaP versus C4-2, cells were transfected 1.5 μg of a promoter-LUC construct and 0.5 μg of SV40-Renilla, using 10 μl of SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). Cells were seeded the previous day at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. Transfections were allowed to proceed for 2 h followed by the addition of 2 ml of fresh medium plus 5% CSS. For transfections using PSAenh(ARE)-E4-LUC or PSAenh(GAL4)-E4-LUC as a reporter construct, the same protocol was followed, except transfection mixtures consisted of 1 μg of a promoter-LUC reporter, 0.5 μg of SV40-Renilla, and 0.2 or 0.5 μg of either pM or hARGal4 and pBluescript to a total DNA content of 2 μg. For transfections using PSAenh(ARE)-LUC, PSAenh(GAL4)-LUC, or pG5-LUC as reporters, transfection mixtures consisted of 0.875 μg of a promoter-LUC reporter, 0.25 μg of SV40-Renilla, and 13.7 or 54.7 ng of either pM or hARGal4 and pBluescript to a total DNA content of 2 μg. We also employed electroporation for LNCaP transfections with pG5-LUC and PSAenh(ARE)-LUC. For this approach, components were increased by a factor of 6 from the SuperFect-based protocol. Therefore, for a typical electroporation, 3 × 106 cells were suspended in 350 μl of medium plus 5% CSS and mixed with 50 μl of a DNA mixture containing 5.25 μg of a promoter-LUC reporter, 1.5 μg of SV40-Renilla, and 328 or 82 ng of either pM or hARGal4 and pBluescript to a total DNA content of 12 μg. The cell/DNA mixture was subjected to a 305-V electrical pulse for 10 ms in cuvettes with a 4-mm gapwidth using a BTX ElectroSquare electroporator. For siRNA and hARGal4 cotransfection experiments in LNCaP cells, 4 μl of a GFP-targeted siRNA (Dharmacon) or an AR DBD-targeted siRNA were added to mixtures prior to electroporation. Cells were subsequently plated in medium plus 5% CSS. For all experiments, 24 h post-transfection, medium was aspirated and replaced with serum-free, phenol red-free medium containing 1 nm mibolerone, 10 μm bicalutamide, ethanol (vehicle control), or combinations of these compounds. Cells were harvested after an additional 24 h. For both SuperFect- and electroporation-based protocols, transfection efficiency was consistently 60–80%. Firefly and Renilla luciferase reporter activities were assayed via a Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega). Activities were normalized by dividing firefly luciferase activity by Renilla luciferase activity of samples cultured in the absence of androgens. Data presented represent the mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. For siRNA transfections in C4-2 cells, 1.8 × 106 cells were seeded on 10-cm dishes in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected 24 h later with 500 pmol of a pool of four siRNAs targeted to the AR (AR Smart-Pool, Dharmacon), or a pool of four non-targeted, control siRNAs (Dharmacon) using 25 μg of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated via acid-guanidinium phenol/chloroform extraction as described (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA (15 μg per lane) were fractionated on 1% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels. RNA was transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), UV cross-linked, and then hybridized with cDNA probes specific for PSA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a RadPrime labeling kit (Invitrogen). Autoradiography was performed at –80 °C using an intensifier screen (Kodak). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested directly in a loading buffer containing 65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Equal amounts (typically 30 μg per lane) of protein were resolved in 10% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen), followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and membrane blocking. Blots were incubated with antibodies specific for AR (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) ERK-2 (D-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Gal4 (RK5C1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, washed, and probed with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:10,000. Membranes were immersed in chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film for signal detection. Cell Viability Assays—C4-2 cells were seeded at a density of 3000 cells/well on 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 plus 5% CSS. Following 24-h growth, the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 plus 5% CSS containing 10 μm bicalutamide or ethanol (vehicle control). Following 0, 24, 48, and 72 h of growth, the number of viable cells was determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium reduction (Cell Titer 96 AQueous One, Promega), which was measured at 490 nm. Data presented represent the mean ± S.E. from quadruplicate experiments. Constitutive AR Activity in ADI PCa Cells—We employed the isogenic LNCaP/C4-2 cell model of PCa progression to study regulated and de-regulated mechanisms of AR activation. C4-2 cells grow in an ADI manner in vivo and in vitro, and were derived from androgen-dependent LNCaP cells through serial passage as xenografts in castrated athymic male mice (32Wu H.C. Hsieh J.T. Gleave M.E. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To characterize the influence of serum-derived as well as autocrine growth factors on basal AR activity in this model of PCa progression, we cultured LNCaP and C4-2 cells for 72 h in medium supplemented with steroid-depleted serum or serum-free medium. In addition, we also tested the effect of a 6-h re-feeding regimen with serum-free medium, designed to minimize the accumulation of autocrine factors. Under all conditions tested, LNCaP cells expressed very low mRNA levels of the AR target PSA gene in the absence of androgens (Fig. 1A). Conversely, C4-2 cells displayed constitutive PSA expression in the absence of androgens, which was on average 3- to 4-fold higher than in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1A). In the presence of 1 nm mibolerone, LNCaP cells displayed an average 9.5-fold androgen induction of PSA expression, whereas C4-2 cells displayed an average 3.8-fold androgen induction (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that AR proteins have a relatively high level of constitutive activity but a lower degree of responsiveness to androgens in C4-2 versus LNCaP cells. To test the AR dependence of this apparent androgen-independent PSA expression in C4-2 cells, we employed siRNA. We observed a decrease in PSA mRNA expression when we compared C4-2 cells transfected with AR-targeted siRNA to cells transfected with non-targeted siRNA (Fig. 1B). This finding agrees with a previous study, which employed both AR-targeted siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides to demonstrate the AR dependence of constitutive PSA expression in C4-2 cells (33Agoulnik I.U. Vaid A. Bingman 3rd, W.E. Erdeme H. Frolov A. Smith C.L. Ayala G. Ittmann M.M. Weigel N.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7959-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that the AR is aberrantly active in the absence of androgens in C4-2 cells. To assess whether constitutive AR activity in C4-2 cells was due to an activating AR mutation(s), we generated AR cDNAs from LNCaP and C4-2 cells via reverse transcription-PCR. We sequenced several cDNA clones from each cell line and found that no sequence aberrations existed apart from the previously described AR T877A mutation (data not shown). These findings extend others' sequencing efforts in these cell lines, which described an identical AR coding sequence throughout the DBD/CTD (28Yeung F. Li X. Ellett J. Trapman J. Kao C. Chung L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40846-40855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the C4-2 cellular milieu is distinct from LNCaP cells and is supportive of aberrant AR activity. To identify regions of the PSA promoter that mediate constitutive AR activity, LNCaP and C4-2 cells were transfected with an expression construct regulated by a 5.8-kb PSA promoter fragment (–5746 PSA-LUC) in the absence of serum and androgens. Transfection efficiencies were consistently 60–80% in both cell lines (data not shown). We observed 5-fold higher androgen-independent activity of –5746 PSA-LUC in C4-2 compared with LNCaP cells (Fig. 1C). In agreement with a previous study (28Yeung F. Li X. Ellett J. Trapman J. Kao C. Chung L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40846-40855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the upstream PSA enhancer core (AREc) mediated this elevated androgen-independent PSA promoter activity in C4-2 cells, and deletion constructs lacking this element did not display detectable activity (Fig. 1C). Based on these findings, we conclude that the enhancer core of the PSA promoter contains elements that are regulated by constitutively active AR in C4-2 cells. An AR-Gal4 Fusion Strategy to Functionally Study the AR in AR-dependent Cells—To allow the study of AR structure/function relationships in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, we developed an AR-Gal4 fusion strategy. This strategy was based on the premise that swapping AREs in PSA enhancer-based reporter constructs with binding sites for the Gal4 yeast transcription factor would render these constructs responsive to hARGal4, a hybrid protein wherein the zinc-finger AR DBD was swapped with the zinc-finger Gal4 DBD (Fig. 2, A and B). A reporter construct regulated by the PSA enhancer, PSAenh(ARE)E4-LUC, displayed robust activation in response to 1 nm mibolerone (Fig. 2C), and replacement of the 4 AREs with GAL4 binding sites completely abolished this androgen response (Fig. 2C). Cotransfection with an expression construct encoding the Gal4 DBD alone failed to restore androgen responsiveness (Fig. 2C). However, cotransfection with hARGal4 restored this robust androgen response (Fig. 2C). hARGal4 was also able to activate pG5-LUC, a reporter construct containing five tandem GAL4 binding sites upstream of the adenovirus major late core promoter, only in the presence of androgen (Fig. 2C). Importantly, siRNA targeted to the wild-type AR DBD, which selectively knocked down endogenous AR expression in these cells, did not affect the activity of hARGal4 (Fig. 2D). To test whether this system was a sensitive measure of constitutive AR activity in C4-2 cells, the AREs in PSAenh(ARE)-LUC were replaced with GAL4 binding sites (Fig. 2A). Under androgenfree conditions, replacement of AREs with GAL4 binding sites significantly inhibited promoter activity in C4-2 (Fig. 3A) but not LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B). Cotransfection with hARGal4 resulted in robust androgen-independent activation of PSAenh(GAL4)-LUC in C4-2 (Fig. 3A) but not LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B). To test whether these observations were restricted to the PSA gene, or represented a more general indication of AR activity in these cells, we tested the ability of hARGal4 to activate pG5-LUC in an androgen-independent manner. Indeed, hARGal4 was able to activate pG5-LUC in C4-2 (Fig. 3A) but not LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B) in the absence of androgens. Overall, the Gal4-based reporter system (Fig. 3C) mirrored the most salient properties of endogenous AR (Fig. 1A) in these cell lines. For example, although endogenous AR and hARGal4 displayed a higher level of constitutive activity and overall activation in C4-2 versus LNCaP cells, the overall androgen induction of endogenous AR and hARGal4 was much lower in C4-2 cells (Figs. 1A and 3C). These results demonstrate that the AR-Gal4 fusion strategy is ideally suited for functiona"
https://openalex.org/W2064944029,"Although soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) functions in an environment in which O2, NO, and CO are potential ligands for its heme moiety, the enzyme displays a high affinity for only its physiological ligand, NO, but has a limited affinity for CO and no affinity for O2. Recent studies of a truncated version of the sGC β1-subunit containing the heme-binding domain (Boon, E. M., Huang, S H., and Marletta, M. A. (2005) Nat. Chem. Biol., 1, 53–59) showed that introduction of the hydrogen-bonding tyrosine into the distal heme pocket changes the ligand specificity of the heme moiety and results in an oxygen-binding sGC. The hypothesis that the absence of hydrogen-bonding residues in the distal heme pocket is sufficient to provide oxygen discrimination by sGC was put forward. We tested this hypothesis in a context of a complete sGC heterodimer containing both the intact α1- and β1-subunits. We found that the I145Y substitution in the full-length β-subunit of the sGC heterodimer did not produce an oxygen-binding enzyme. However, this substitution impeded the association of NO and destabilized the NO·heme complex. The tyrosine in the distal heme pocket also impeded both the binding and dissociation of the CO ligand. We propose that the mechanism of oxygen exclusion by sGC not only involves the lack of hydrogen bonding in the distal heme pocket, but also depends on structural elements from other domains of sGC. Although soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) functions in an environment in which O2, NO, and CO are potential ligands for its heme moiety, the enzyme displays a high affinity for only its physiological ligand, NO, but has a limited affinity for CO and no affinity for O2. Recent studies of a truncated version of the sGC β1-subunit containing the heme-binding domain (Boon, E. M., Huang, S H., and Marletta, M. A. (2005) Nat. Chem. Biol., 1, 53–59) showed that introduction of the hydrogen-bonding tyrosine into the distal heme pocket changes the ligand specificity of the heme moiety and results in an oxygen-binding sGC. The hypothesis that the absence of hydrogen-bonding residues in the distal heme pocket is sufficient to provide oxygen discrimination by sGC was put forward. We tested this hypothesis in a context of a complete sGC heterodimer containing both the intact α1- and β1-subunits.

We propose that the mechanism of oxygen exclusion by sGC not only involves the lack of hydrogen bonding in the distal heme pocket, but also depends on structural elements from other domains of sGC. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) 4The abbreviations used are: sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; TEA, triethanolamine; DEA-NO, 2-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenolate-2-oxide diethylammonium salt; PPIX, protoporphyrin IX.4The abbreviations used are: sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; TEA, triethanolamine; DEA-NO, 2-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenolate-2-oxide diethylammonium salt; PPIX, protoporphyrin IX. is a member of the guanylyl cyclase family of proteins, which respond to various ligands by converting GTP into cGMP. sGC stands apart from other members of its family by the nature of its activating ligand. Although other guanylyl cyclases are stimulated in response to various hormonal peptide ligands such as natriuretic peptides, guanylins, or toxins like heat-stable enterotoxin (see Ref. 1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414PubMed Google Scholar for review), sGC is activated several hundredfold upon exposure to NO produced by nitric-oxide synthase. sGC is the key component of the NO/cGMP pathway and is crucial in mediating various physiological effects of NO such as blood vessel relaxation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, neurotransmission, and many others (2Martin E. Sharina I. Seminara A.R. Krumenacker J. Murad F. Lamas S. Cadenas E. Nitric Oxide, Cell Signaling and Gene Expression. Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL2005: 167-216Google Scholar). The affinity of the sGC enzyme for NO is mediated by the ferrous heme prosthetic group. sGC possesses a ligand selectivity unique for hemeproteins. NO binds to the sGC heme at rates that are almost diffusion-limited (3Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) to form a stable NO·heme complex. High affinity coupled with high specificity for NO is essential for sGC to function as an NO receptor. Although sGC functions in the intracellular environment containing 20–40 μm O2 and up to 10 nm NO during NO synthesis (4Condorelli P. George S.C. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2110-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), sGC is capable of discriminating between these two similar molecules in favor of NO. Moreover, even in the absence of NO, sGC does not form an oxyferrous heme complex and does not show any significant autoxidation. This is especially interesting considering that, in some aspects, the sGC heme is similar to the heme moiety of globin oxygen carriers such as myoglobins and hemoglobins. Similar to globins, the heme iron is in a 5-coordinate ferrous state with histidine as the proximal ligand. Until recently, the explanation for this oxygen exclusion by sGC included a weakened histidine–iron bond (5Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Oertling W.A. Kean R.T. Wever R. Babcock G.T. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 29: 2633-2645Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or a negative polarity in the surroundings of the sGC distal heme pocket (5Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The absence of structural information hampered elucidation of this ligand selectivity. Recently, several bacterial hemoproteins that share 15–40% sequence homology with the sGC heme domain have been identified. These proteins also have a proximal histidine ligand and contain a Y(S/R)T motif shown to interact with the propionic acid moiety of the sGC heme (7Schmidt P.M. Rothkegel C. Wunder F. Schroder H. Stasch J.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 513: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Schmidt P.M. Schramm M. Schroder H. Wunder F. Stasch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3025-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Analysis of the ligand specificity of several of these hemoproteins demonstrated that both NO and oxygen could be ligands for this group of proteins (9Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, this group of proteins, which includes the β-subunit of mammalian sGC, was tentatively named H-NOX (heme-NO/oxygen binding (9Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)) or SONO (sensor of NO (11Nioche P. Berka V. Vipond J. Minton N. Tsai A.-L. Raman C.S. Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)). The x-ray structure of the heme sensor domain of an H-NOX protein from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (11Nioche P. Berka V. Vipond J. Minton N. Tsai A.-L. Raman C.S. Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Pellicena P. Karow D.S. Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. Kuriyan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) provided valuable information about the general fold of the hemebinding domain of the H-NOX family. Based on the x-ray structure of T. tengcongensis H-NOX, homology models of the sGC heme-binding pocket were predicted (9Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Nioche P. Berka V. Vipond J. Minton N. Tsai A.-L. Raman C.S. Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Pellicena P. Karow D.S. Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. Kuriyan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). None of these models show residues that would provide a negative polarity in the heme pocket of sGC. These analyses thus greatly disfavor the hypothesis of negative polarity in distal heme pocket (9Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The T. tengcongensis H-NOX structure also reveals that the distal heme pocket Tyr140, which is conserved in H-NOX proteins from anaerobic bacteria (13Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), is crucial for ligand specificity. Under aerobic conditions, the T. tengcongensis H-NOX Tyr140 forms a hydrogen bond with a molecule of oxygen and stabilizes the heme·O2 complex. It has been suggested that all H-NOX proteins with Tyr140 are oxygen sensors. However, in a heme sensor protein from Clostridium botulinum, this tyrosine does not form a hydrogen bond with oxygen, but stabilizes the complex with NO (11Nioche P. Berka V. Vipond J. Minton N. Tsai A.-L. Raman C.S. Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) even in the presence of oxygen. Thus, it appears that, despite a common protein fold of H-NOX proteins, slight differences in the structure may be crucial in determining the selectivity for gaseous ligands. In the mammalian β-subunit of sGC, the ortholog position of this Tyr140 is Ile145. The effect of the I145Y substitution in the heme domain of sGC on oxygen binding was tested in the fragment of the sGC β-subunit (residues 1–385) containing the heme-binding domain of the enzyme (10Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements of oxygen binding performed on the β1-(1–385) I145Y mutant fragment as well as on the reverse substitution mutant (Y140I) of the T. tengcongensis H-NOX protein suggested that the distal pocket tyrosine is necessary and sufficient for oxygen binding in the H-NOX/SONO family of proteins. It has been proposed that lack of the distal tyrosine or of other hydrogen bond donors is the key determinant of the oxygen discrimination by the sGC enzyme (10Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As this conclusion was based on evidence derived from only a fragment of the sGC enzyme, we tested this hypothesis in the more natural context of the sGC heterodimer, which contains both the full-length α- and β-subunits. From previous reports, it also remained unclear how the tyrosine in the distal heme pocket of sGC affects the specificity of sGC protein for NO and CO. In this study, we present the catalytic and spectral properties of heterodimeric sGC carrying the I145Y substitution in the β-subunit. This mutation in full-length sGC significantly decreased the enzyme activation by NO, lowered the affinity for NO, and affected CO binding, but surprisingly did not facilitate oxygen binding under the tested conditions. On the basis of our data, we propose that the presence of hydrogen-bonding residues in the distal heme pocket is not sufficient to confer oxygen binding to the sGC heme and that contributions from other parts of the enzyme are critical in ligand discrimination. Moreover, introduction of a hydrogen-bonding tyrosine into the distal heme pocket strongly affects the binding characteristics of sGC for other gaseous ligands. Protein Expression and Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the I145Y substitution in the coding region of the pVL-β baculoviral transfer vector (15Lee Y.C. Martin E. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This vector was used to generate the baculovirus expressing the I145Y mutant sGC β-subunit (βI145Y). The wild-type and mutant sGC enzymes were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (16Martin E. Berka V. Tsai A.-L. Murad F. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In short, a 100,000 × g supernatant was applied to a 30-ml DEAE FF-Superose column, and sGC-containing fractions were eluted with 350 mm NaCl and loaded onto a 20-ml nickel-agarose column with HisBind resin (Novagen). After a 50 mm imidazole wash, the sGC enzyme was eluted with 175 mm imidazole. To remove the imidazole, the sample was captured on a 5-ml HiTrap DEAE FF-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and eluted with 300 mm NaCl. The sGC-containing fractions were concentrated on a Centricon YW-100 concentrator (Millipore). Preparations were at least 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting as described previously (16Martin E. Berka V. Tsai A.-L. Murad F. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To prepare anaerobic samples, the enzyme sample was placed in a tonometer and subjected to five cycles of vacuum (30 s)/argon (5 min) replacement using an anaerobic train. Assay of sGC Activity—Enzyme activity was assayed by formation of [32P]cGMP from [α-32P]GTP at 37 °C as described previously (17Martin E. Sharina I. Kots A. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was initiated by addition of 1 mm GTP to the enzyme in 25 mm TEA (pH 7.5), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mm cGMP, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm creatine phosphate. Dilutions of 2-(N,N-diethylamino)diazenolate-2-oxide diethylammonium salt (DEA-NO) donor were prepared in 10 mm NaOH and added to the enzyme immediately before starting the reaction with GTP. The enzyme was incubated with GTP at 37 °C for 4 min, stopped by zinc acetate, and processed as described previously (17Martin E. Sharina I. Kots A. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To measure the extent of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) activation, the Sf9 lysates containing wild-type or mutant enzyme were treated with 0.2% Tween 20 for 10 min on ice and then added to the reaction buffer containing various concentrations of PPIX. After a 10-min incubation, the reaction was initiated by addition of GTP. The activity of the CO-treated enzyme was measured in gas-tight vials using CO-equilibrated reaction buffers in the presence or absence of BAY41-2272 (5-cyclopropyl-2-[1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-3-yl]-pyrimidin-4-ylamine). The allosteric regulator BAY 41-2272 was a generous gift from Bayer. Time-resolved Measurement of NO·sGC Heme Complex Formation—Working NO solutions of different concentrations were prepared by transferring aliquots of a 1 mm NO stock solution into a gas-tight reaction syringe with N2-saturated 50 mm TEA buffer (pH 7.4). The working solution was used immediately for time-resolved measurements. Measurements of NO·sGC heme complex formation were conducted using a Bio-SEQUENTIAL DX-18MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) equipped with a rapid scan photodiode array detector and all fluid channels made of PEEK™ material. Before measurements, the stopped-flow apparatus was made anaerobic by filling the instrument for 2–5 h with anaerobic 0.1 m pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.3) containing excess sodium dithionite. The anaerobic sGC solution was mixed with NO solutions at 24 °C in the stopped-flow instrument. Changes in the UV-visible spectra between 300 and 700 nm were recorded using the photodiode array detector at 400 scans/s. To analyze the effect of GTP on the NO binding kinetics, a sequential mixing technique was applied. In the first mixing step, the enzyme was mixed with 5 mm GTP solution and incubated in an aging loop for 100 ms. In the second mixing step, the sample from the aging loop was mixed with NO solution, and changes in UV-visible spectra were recorded as described above. To determine the binding rates of NO or CO ligands, changes at single wavelengths were monitored. The wavelengths used for the experiments were selected based on the analysis of the rapid scanning experiments. To determine the observed rate of ligand binding, the single wavelength traces were fitted to a single exponential function using built-in software. The observed rates were plotted versus the final concentrations of gaseous ligand in the reaction mixture. Plots for each analyzed ligand-enzyme pair were used to calculate koff, kon, and KD as described later under “Results.” Time-resolved measurements of CO·sGC complex formation were performed similarly, but under aerobic conditions with aerobic samples and buffers. NO Titration Experiment—The anaerobic enzyme sample was prepared in a tonometer fitted with a cuvette and adaptor for a gas-tight syringe. A Hamilton syringe with a threaded plunger was used for this experiment. The volume delivered by each turn of the plunger was calibrated in advance. A saturated NO solution (1 mm) was prepared in 50 mm TEA buffer (pH 7.4) as described previously (16Martin E. Berka V. Tsai A.-L. Murad F. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and loaded into the syringe. The syringe adaptor was opened under continuous positive argon pressure, and the syringe with saturated NO solution was fitted into the adaptor. As a result, the head space of the assembled tonometer (∼15 ml) was under positive argon pressure. NO was delivered directly into the enzyme solution by rotation of the calibrated screw at the end of the plunger. UV-visible spectra were recorded after each addition of NO on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Titration was continued until no further changes in the spectra were detected. We calibrated the effective amount of NO delivered under these experimental conditions by titrating oxyhemoglobin as an NO acceptor. Based on this calibration, it was determined that a 2-fold correction should be introduced to convert the amount of NO delivered by the syringe into the effective NO concentration dissolved in the sample. This discrepancy is due to positive argon pressure, which affects the solubility of NO. EPR Measurement—The EPR samples of the NO·heme complex of sGC containing the I145Y mutant α- and β-subunits (αβI145Y) were prepared by an anaerobic single turnover procedure as described previously (18Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The protein sample was first subjected to vacuum/argon replacement cycles to make it anaerobic in a titration vessel with a glass magnetic bar to keep the enzyme solution under constant mixing. Anaerobic 50 μm NO solution was added via the rubber septum to the enzyme solution by an airtight syringe. After different incubation times (2–5 s) the positive argon pressure was applied to evacuate the reaction mixture via a stainless steel needle into an EPR tube flushed with argon. When ∼3 cm of the EPR tube was filled with sample, the tube was immersed quickly in an acetone/dry ice bath to stop further reaction. The EPR tube was transferred to liquid nitrogen for storage and later EPR measurements. Western blotting was performed using rabbit anti-β- and anti-α-subunit polyclonal antibodies (Sigma) at 1:1000 dilution as primary antibodies, and the signal was visualized using ECL Plus detection reagent (GE Healthcare). Catalytic Activity of αβI145Y—To test the hypothesis that the absence of residues capable of forming hydrogen bonds dictates oxygen discrimination by sGC, we substituted Ile145 in the β-subunit with tyrosine. As a first step in the functional analysis of such a mutation, we coexpressed the I145Y mutant α- and β-subunits of human sGC (αβI145Y) in Sf9 cells and tested the catalytic activity of the mutant enzyme. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the mutant enzyme showed a decreased activation by 200 μm DEA-NO (10-fold versus 230-fold for the wild-type enzyme). Although the mutant was activated by the allosteric regulator BAY 41-2272, the enzyme was not responsive to stimulation by CO and showed a greatly reduced synergistic activation by a combination of CO and BAY 41-2272 (Fig. 1A). This is unlike the strong synergism of activation observed for the wild-type enzyme treated with CO and BAY 41-2272. It should be noted, however, that the mutation did not affect the stimulatory effect of manganese ion on the activity of the enzyme (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the function of the catalytic domain was not directly affected. To analyze the effect of the mutation on the NO-dependent activation, we compared the DEA-NO activation response in the lysates containing the wild-type or αβI145Y enzyme at different concentrations of the donor. The wild-type enzyme showed a strong activation with an EC50 of ∼600 nm. However, the mutant enzyme, despite showing activation at all concentrations of DEA-NO, did not reach maximal activation even when 1 mm DEA-NO was applied (Fig. 1B). This behavior of the mutant enzyme suggests that the enzyme affinity for NO and/or enzyme activation was altered by the tyrosine. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the effect of PPIX on the heme-depleted enzyme. PPIX effectively activates the enzyme in the absence of any gaseous ligands by replacing the ferrous heme moiety (19Ignarro L.J. Wood K.S. Wolin M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2870-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Low concentrations of Tween 20 facilitates this replacement (17Martin E. Sharina I. Kots A. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9208-9213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Foerster J. Harteneck C. Malkewitz J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) by promoting heme depletion. As demonstrated in Fig. 1C, the Sf9 lysate expressing the mutant enzyme showed a right shift in the PPIX activation response curve compared with the wild-type enzyme, possibly because of some steric hindrance induced by the tyrosine in the heme domain. In addition, we observed a decreased maximal activation of the mutant enzyme, which could not be explained by the difference in the expression levels (Fig. 1C, inset). It appears that introduction of a tyrosine into the heme domain interferes with propagation of the activating signal. This conclusion is corroborated by the absence of CO-dependent activation of the enzyme, by the lack of BAY 41-2272-induced synergism of CO activation, and by the significant right shift in the DEA-NO response curve. Thus, these data indicate that the perturbations in the heme-binding domain introduced by the I145Y substitution interfered with the activation process or the enzyme and may have affected the ligand affinity. Spectral Properties of αβI145Y—The UV-visible spectra of the purified αβI145Y mutant displayed a Soret maximum at 430 nm and a broad α/β-band in the 560–590 nm range, which are identical to the wild-type enzyme spectral characteristics (21Gerzer R. Bohme E. Hofmann F. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of a tyrosine at position 145, we found no evidence of oxygen binding to the mutant in aerobic buffer (258 μm O2) (Fig. 2A). The spectral properties did not change after oxygen was removed from the sample by several cycles of vacuum/argon replacement and remained the same when placed under 1 atmosphere of O2 (1.28 mm O2) (Fig. 2A). Although no CO-dependent activation of the mutant was observed (Fig. 1), the exposure to CO shifted the Soret maximum to 423 nm and resulted in split α- and β-bands (Fig. 2A). This spectrum of the CO·αβI145Y complex is identical to that of the CO·sGC (wild-type) complex (22Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 2B. However, exposure of the mutant to NO resulted in a UV-visible spectrum different from that of the wild-type NO·sGC adduct. The NO·αβI145Y complex showed a major Soret peak with a maximum at 417 nm and a shoulder at 399 nm, suggesting that the majority of NO·αβI145Y is 6-coordinate (417 nm), whereas a smaller fraction of the complex becomes 5-coordinate. The ratio between the 417 and 399 nm bands did not change upon longer incubations (data not shown) or addition of a high concentration of DEA-NO (Fig. 2A). To confirm the coordination structure of the NO·αβI145Y complex, we recorded its EPR spectra. The spectrum of the EPR sample freeze-trapped after reaction of 10 μm αβI145Y for 2–3 s with 5 eq of NO is shown in Fig. 2C (upper trace). This low spin NO·heme complex spectrum is fairly typical for a 6-coordinate NO·heme complex with a proximal imidazole ligand. Two sets of nitrogen hyperfine splitting were discernible: the ∼22-G hyperfine splitting for the NO nitrogen (ANO) and the ∼8-G super-hyperfine splitting for the His105 imidazole nitrogen (Aim). The simulations for these EPR data (Fig. 2C, middle trace) indicate the positions of the three principal g values as 2.078 (gx), 2.011 (gz), and 1.986 (gy) and anisotropic hyperfine splitting constants for both nitrogen nuclei as Axx/Ayy/Azz = 17/16/31 for ANO and Axx/Ayy/Azz = 9/7/7 for Aim. When NO gas was replaced with 375 μm DEA-NO, the freeze-trapped NO·heme complex exhibited an EPR spectrum that was a mixture of both the 6- and 5-coordinate low spin heme complexes, with the former being the prominent species. The triplet hyperfine splitting of NO in the 5-coordinate complex (ANO = 18.5 G) was superimposed upon a 6-coordinate NO·heme complex EPR spectrum with essentially identical structure as the upper trace. Kinetics of NO Binding to αβI145Y—The different spectral characteristics of the mutant enzyme in complex with NO and the data from Fig. 1B clearly indicate that the nature of the NO-sGC interaction is affected by introduction of a tyrosine into the heme domain. To determine the mechanism of such changes, we measured the NO binding kinetics of mutant sGC using the stopped-flow apparatus (Fig. 3). For comparison, the kinetics of NO binding to the wild-type enzyme is presented in Fig. 3A. In corroboration with previous reports (3Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 16Martin E. Berka V. Tsai A.-L. Murad F. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 396: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Makino R. Matsuda H. Obayashi E. Shiro Y. Iizuka T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7714-7723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the binding of NO to the enzyme and the formation of the 6-coordinate intermediate were very fast and essentially completed in the dead time of the instrument, which agrees with the diffusion-limited rate of binding. This 6-coordinate intermediate was rapidly converted into the 5-coordinate NO·sGC complex (Fig. 3A). In several recent studies in which the kinetics of NO association was monitored after mixing the enzyme with NO donors, an apparent 6-coordinate intermediate was observed even after 12 and 16 s of measurements (24Russwurm M. Koesling D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that addition of GTP facilitates the transition from 6- to 5-coordinate NO·sGC complexes. Our measurements performed with predetermined concentrations of authentic NO (Fig. 3A) demonstrate that the 6-coordinate intermediate was clearly observed even in the presence of GTP (data not shown). Moreover, the rates of transition from 6- to 5-coordinate complexes estimated from the change in 420 nm absorbance (Fig. 3A, inset) were almost identical in the absence or presence of GTP: 17 and 14 s–1, respectively. These data suggest that GTP had an insignificant effect on the NO binding step and thus allowed us to monitor the kinetics of NO binding to the mutant enzyme in the absence of GTP. To ensure that the time-resolved changes in the spectra of the mutant can be monitored, we first used low concentrations of NO. Rapid scan stopped-flow measurements performed with stoichiometric amounts of ligand showed that NO binding caused an almost complete shift from the 430 nm Soret maximum to 417 nm with an isosbestic point at 423 nm (Fig. 3B), suggesting a single step transition to a 6-coordinate complex. Such a transition has not been previously recorded with the wild-type enzyme because of the very fast kinetics of NO binding. Increasing amounts of NO (5-fold molar excess) not only accelerated the formation of the 6-coordinate nitrosyl heme, but also resulted in a partial transition of the NO·heme complex into a 5-coordinate state (Fig. 3C). However, the prop"

To identify the molecular determinants of the unique specificity of EphB4 for ephrinB2, we determined the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of EphB4 in complex with the extracellular domain of ephrinB2. This structural analysis suggested that one amino acid, Leu-95, plays a particularly important role in defining the structural features that confer the ligand selectivity of EphB4. Indeed, all other Eph receptors, which promiscuously bind many ephrins, have a conserved arginine at the position corresponding to Leu-95 of EphB4. We have also found that amino acid changes in the EphB4 ligand binding cavity, designed based on comparison with the crystal structure of the more promiscuous EphB2 receptor, yield EphB4 variants with altered binding affinity for ephrinB2 and an antagonistic peptide. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments with an EphB4 Leu-95 to arginine mutant confirmed the importance of this amino acid in conferring high affinity binding to both ephrinB2 and the antagonistic peptide ligand. Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements also revealed an interesting thermodynamic discrepancy between ephrinB2 binding, which is an entropically driven process, and peptide binding, which is an enthalpically driven process. These results provide critical information on the EphB4·ephrinB2 protein interfaces and their mode of interaction, which will facilitate development of small molecule compounds inhibiting the EphB4·ephrinB2 interaction as novel cancer therapeutics.

The protein-protein interaction between the membrane-bound Eph receptor tyrosine kinases with the membrane-bound ephrin ligands have now been reported in the overexpression/dys-regulation in numerous tumor cell lines (1Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). First reported for their role in axonal guidance, this group of proteins now has defined roles in regulating several cellular processes including developmental patterning, cell attachment, and motility (2Pasquale E.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 3Wilkinson D.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 4Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of these proteins in development is underscored by the fact that deletion of either the EphB4 receptor or the ephrinB2 ligand results in lethality by embryonic day 11 as a result of arrested angiogenesis but not vasculogenesis (5Blits-Huizinga C.T. Nelersa C.M. Malhotra A. Liebl D.J. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Understanding the EphB4·ephrinB2 interaction and exploring the determinants for the unique specificity of this receptor-ligand complex is at the core of modulating this activity and will allow for a deeper understanding into the basic biology behind this interaction and for the development of novel anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumorigenesis therapeutic approaches. The EphB4 receptor and the ephrinB2 ligand are capable of transducing a signal bi-directionally into either the EphB4-expressing cell (forward signaling) or the ephrinB2-expressing cell (reverse signaling) (12Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Mbamalu G. Yancopoulos G.D. Henkemeyer M. Pawson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 13Schmucker D. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 2001; 105: 701-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, a cellular response is conducted only upon cell-cell contact. The Eph receptors are divided into two subclasses, A and B, based on both sequence conservation and binding preferences with the ephrins (6Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1996; 17: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The receptors have a modular domain architecture, extracellularly characterized by an N-terminal ligand binding domain, a cysteine-rich domain, and two fibronectin type III-like repeats. Intracellularly, the receptors consist of a juxtamembrane domain, a conserved tyrosine kinase domain, a C-terminal sterile α-domain, and a PDZ binding motif. The ephrin ligands are also divided into two subclasses, A and B; ephrinA ligands are anchored to the membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linker, whereas members of the B-subclass are tethered to the membrane by a transmembrane region and contain a cytoplasmic PDZ domain binding motif. In general, EphA receptors (EphA1-EphA10) are promiscuously activated by ephrinA ligands (ephrinA1-ephrinA6), whereas EphB receptors (EphB1-EphB6) are promiscuously activated by ephrinB ligands (ephrinB1-ephrinB3) (7Committee E.N. Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Cross-subclass interactions have been identified specifically between EphB2 and ephrinA5 (8Himanen J.P. Chumley M.J. Lackmann M. Li C. Barton W.A. Jeffrey P.D. Vearing C. Geleick D. Feldheim D.A. Boyd A.W. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and between EphA4 and ephrinB2/B3 (9Takemoto M. Fukuda T. Sonoda R. Murakami F. Tanaka H. Yamamoto N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); however, these interactions are rare and appear to be exceptions to the general rule. Unlike the other promiscuous receptors in this family, however, the EphB4 receptor has a distinctive specificity for a single ligand, ephrinB2 while binding only weakly to both ephrinB1 and ephrinB3. EphrinB2, on the other hand, binds to several receptors within the B-subclass (10Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The ligand specificity of the EphB4 receptor is somewhat surprising, since the receptor has the characteristics of a promiscuous receptor, including a large and hydrophobic binding cavity and a flexible “lid” capable of accommodating a range of ligands (11Hopkins A.L. Mason J.S. Overington J.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Here we provide a structural perspective describing the molecular determinants of EphB4 specificity. Crystal structures have been previously determined for ephrin ligands (ephrinB2, ephrinB1) and Eph receptors (EphB2, EphB4) as well as receptor-ligand complexes (EphB2·ephrinB2, EphB2·ephrinA5, EphB4-TNYL-RAW (8Himanen J.P.

Kuhn P. Structure. 2006; 14: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the homodimeric ephrinB2 ligand reveals a β-barrel structure arranged in a deviation of the common Greek Key topology (17Toth J. Cutforth T. Gelinas A.D. Bethoney K.A. Bard J. Harrison C.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Comparison of the crystal structures of both apo and receptor-bound ephrinB2 revealed that the solvent-exposed and high affinity G-H loop is conserved in position between the two structures. This critical loop shares high sequence homology in both A and B subclasses, respectively, and is involved in receptor-ligand heterodimerization as well as in ephrinB2 homodimerization (10Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17Toth J. Cutforth T. Gelinas A.D. Bethoney K.A. Bard J. Harrison C.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structures of the ligand binding domains of EphB2 and EphB4, which share only 44% sequence identity, show a similar jellyroll folding topology, with 13 antiparallel β-sheets connected by loops of varying length (18Himanen J.P. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Recht M.I. Kraus M.L. Koolpe M. Kolatkar A.R. Bruce R.H. Martiny-Baron G. Widmer H. Pasquale E.B. Kuhn P. Structure. 2006; 14: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the EphB4 receptor in complex with the phage display derived TNYL-RAW peptide revealed that the peptide binds to the ephrin binding cavity of the receptor, effectively inhibiting interaction with the ligand (19Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Recht M.I. Kraus M.L. Koolpe M. Kolatkar A.R. Bruce R.H. Martiny-Baron G. Widmer H. Pasquale E.B. Kuhn P. Structure. 2006; 14: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structure of the EphB2·ephrinB2 complex showed that the ligand binding channel of the receptor is located at the upper convex surface of EphB2 and is formed by the flexible J-K, G-H, and D-E loops, which become ordered to accommodate the solvent-exposed ephrin G-H loop (10Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A low affinity tetramerization interface was also identified at the concave surface of the receptor H-I loop, which interacts with the C-D loop of the ephrin. Given that the EphB4·ephrinB2 interaction is important in angiogenesis and that EphB4 is overexpressed in several tumor types (1Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 20Nakamoto M. Bergemann A.D. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 59: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Liu W.

Dreher E. Ziemiecki A. Andres A.C. Ann. Oncol. 2003; 14: 220-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), modulating this protein-protein interaction is a potential approach to slowing tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. In mouse models of breast cancer, high EphB4 expression correlates with increased malignancy and tumor aggressiveness (23Andres A.C. Reid H.H. Zurcher G. Blaschke R.J. Albrecht D. Ziemiecki A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1461-1467PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nikolova Z. Djonov V. Zuercher G. Andres A.C. Ziemiecki A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2741-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Munarini N. Jager R.

EphB4 expression is also increased in human primary infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma and is correlated to increased malignancy (26Berclaz G. Andres A.C. Albrecht D. Dreher E. Ziemiecki A. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the EphB4 ectodomain stimulates endothelial cell migration and proliferation, suggesting that ephrinB2-expressing endothelial cells interact with the EphB4 ectodomain to promote angiogenesis and tumor progression. Furthermore, a kinase-deficient EphB4 mutant has been shown to increase breast cancer cell growth, indicating that downstream forward kinase signaling is not an absolute requirement for tumorigenesis, at least in breast cancer cells (27Noren N.K. Lu M. Freeman A.L. Koolpe M. Pasquale E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5583-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Several groups have more recently demonstrated that the full extracellular domain of EphB4 is indeed a viable therapeutic target. First, the soluble extracellular domain of EphB4 was described to block both forward and reverse signaling, resulting in an inhibition of tumor growth in vivo (28Kertesz N. Krasnoperov V. Reddy R. Leshanski L. Kumar S.R. Zozulya S. Gill P.S. Blood. 2006; 107: 2330-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29Martiny-Baron G. Korff T. Schaffner F. Esser N. Eggstein S. Marme D. Augustin H.G. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 248-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, phage display studies have identified a peptide (TNYL-RAW) that antagonizes the EphB4·ephrinB2 interaction in the high nanomolar range (30Koolpe M. Burgess R. Dail M. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17301-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, a more complete understanding of the biological role of EphB4·ephrinB2 signaling in tumorigenesis and in forms of pathological angiogenesis is now required. To enable anti-EphB4·ephrinB2 therapeutic development and probe EphB4 specificity, we determined the three-dimensional crystal structure of the EphB4·ephrinB2 complex to high resolution. In addition, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis and biophysical analyses to investigate the role of several residues within the ligand binding cavity of EphB4 in contributing to the binding of both ephrinB2 and the antagonistic TNYL-RAW peptide. These results will enable the development of predictive models for structure-based drug design of small molecule compounds for use as therapeutics and to probe the biology of EphB4·ephrinB2 bi-directional signaling. Protein Expression and Purification—The human EphB4 receptor (17-196) was expressed and purified in insect cells as described elsewhere (19Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Recht M.I. Kraus M.L. Koolpe M. Kolatkar A.R. Bruce R.H. Martiny-Baron G. Widmer H. Pasquale E.B. Kuhn P. Structure. 2006; 14: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The wild type EphB4 construct was used as a template for the generation of site-specific mutants. The human ephrinB2 (extracellular domain, residues 25-187) was designed based on the previously published EphB2·ephrinB2 structure and cloned into a modified pFastBac1 vector containing a GP67 leader peptide. Recombinant baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Briefly, large scale expression of ephrinB2 was carried out using Wave Bioreactors on a 5-liter scale at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 48 h, resulting in ∼10 mg of ephrinB2/liter of Hi-5 insect cells (Invitrogen). Media containing secreted ephrinB2 protein was concentrated and buffer was exchanged using a Hydrostart Crossflow Filter (Sartorius Edgewood, NY). The ligand was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and cleaved overnight with tobacco etch virus protease. Material was further re-purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (S2000) to remove the protease and an N-terminal fragment containing the histidine tag. The EphB4·ephrinB2 complex was formed with a 1.5-fold molar excess of ephrinB2 overnight at 4 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Imidazole. The complex was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography to remove trace aggregates (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The final purity of the complex was greater than 95%. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—The EphB4·ephrinB2 complex was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 and crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C against a precipitant of 2.2 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm Tris, pH 7.8. EphB4·ephrinB2 crystals were cryoprotected in 25% glycerol and flash-cooled. Crystals formed in the P41 space group and contained one monomer of receptor and one monomer of ligand in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected at the Advance Photon Source (Argonne, IL) on beamline GM/CA-CAT. Images were processed and reduced using HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology, Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with MolRep (CCP4i), using the EphB2·ephrinB2 structure (Protein Data Bank code 1KGY) as a search model (10Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The structure was refined by a rigid body refinement followed by model building in O and iterative refinements with Refmac (32CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—All mutants and ligands were dialyzed into buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 before use in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 2The abbreviations used are: ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; L, ligand; R, receptor. experiments. All experiments were performed with a Microcal MCS ITC at 25 °C. Titrations were completed as described (19Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Recht M.I. Kraus M.L. Koolpe M. Kolatkar A.R. Bruce R.H. Martiny-Baron G. Widmer H. Pasquale E.B. Kuhn P. Structure. 2006; 14: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). EphB4 (wild type or mutant) was present in the sample cell at a concentration of 12-15 μm, and the injection syringe contained either 127 μm ephrinB2 or 200 μm TNYL-RAW. Titrations of TNYL-RAW with the L95R mutant of EphB4 were performed with 2 mm TNYL-RAW in the injection syringe and 15 μm EphB4 (L95R) in the sample cell. Data for these titrations were fit assuming a stoichiometry of 1, and at least 60% saturation at the final peptide concentration as described (19Chrencik J.E. Brooun A. Recht M.I. Kraus M.L.

Daranas A.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14859-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Polarization Assay—Alexa-532 labeled TNYL-RAW peptide was synthesized by Biopetide (San Diego, CA). A serial dilution of EphB4 was prepared in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CalCl2, 0.1% Pluronic 124). TNYL-RAW-Alexa-532 labeled peptide was prepared as a 100 μm stock solution in the assay buffer, and a 300 nm working solution was made fresh before the measurements by dilution in the assay buffer. 5 μl of serially diluted EphB4 (9-2362 nm concentration range) was combined with 5 μl of labeled peptide (final concentration 75 nm) in the final volume of 20μl in the absence and presence of 200 μm TNYL-RAW as a control for nonspecific binding. The mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at room temperature, and measurements were performed with a Tecan Genios Pro (Tecan Instruments) using 535-nm excitation and 580-nm emission wavelength. All experimental data were analyzed using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), and Kd values were generated by fitting the experimental data using a one-site binding hyperbola nonlinear regression model. The calculated Z-factor for 108 samples, each at 2 different protein concentrations representing upper and lower plateaus of the dose response curve, is 0.715. Overall Structure—EphB4 and ephrinB2 were co-concentrated to 20 mg/ml and crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion against a precipitant of 2.2 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm Tris, pH 7.8, at 20 °C. The co-crystal structure was refined to 2.0-Å resolution with an R-factor of 23% and a free R factor of 29% (Table 1; Fig. 1). Unlike crystals of the of the EphB2·ephrinB2 complex, which consisted of a heterotetramer, crystals of the EphB4·ephrinB2 complex consist of a heterodimer. Previously, formation of EphB2·ephrinB2 heterotetramers was observed for a concentration range around 1 mm using size exclusion chromatography analysis, whereas analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that the EphB2·ephrinB2 complex was a heterodimer at concentrations in the low micromolar range (10Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Our size exclusion chromatography analysis of the EphB4·ephrinB2 complex in a concentration range up to 500 μm indicates that the EphB4·ephrinB2 complex exists as a heterodimer. 3A. Brooun and J. E. Chrencik, manuscript in preparation. The overall structure of the EphB4·ephrinB2 complex is similar to that of the EphB2·ephrinB2 complex, with a root mean square deviation of 5.0 Å over 316 equivalent Cα positions. Significant deviation is mostly evident, however, throughout the structure of the receptor loop regions compared with the EphB4-TNYL-RAW and EphB2·ephrinB2 structures, with root mean square deviations of 1.8 and 5.3 Å, respectively, in the J-K loop. The ephrinB2 ligand deviates minimally between previously described apo and receptor-bound structures, shifting only 0.91 and 0.90 Å, respectively (10Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M.

Hydrophobic contacts drive receptor-ligand binding in this region. Ligand (L) residues Phe-120L, Pro-122L, Trp-125L, and Leu-127L participate in van der Waals interactions with receptor residues lining the receptor binding cavity in the D-E, G-H, and J-K loops (Fig. 2). Phe-120L forms hydrophobic interactions with Leu-95R (R, receptor; see below), Leu-100R, and Pro-101R, whereas Leu-124L interacts with Thr-147R from the receptor J-K loop. Meanwhile, Trp-125L extends to the surface of the receptor in between the J-K and G-H loops, participating in hydrophobic interactions with residues Leu-48R, Glu-50R, Val-159R, Leu-188R, and Ala-186R. In addition, Pro-122L, similar to all previous crystal structures, maintains its position by participating in a direct interaction with the receptor Cys-61R-Cys-184R disulfide bridge. Few polar contacts are formed at the receptor-ligand dimer interface. Ser-121L forms a side chain side-chain hydrogen bond with Glu-59R as well as a main chain-side chain hydrogen bond with Lys-149R, whereas Asn-123L forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of Leu-48R. Additionally, Lys-149R extends to the body of the ephrinB2 G-H loop, forming side chain-side chain hydrogen bonds with Glu-128L, and side chain-main chain hydrogen bonds with Ser-121L and Asn-123L, which are both part of the high affinity ligand FSPN sequence (Fig. 3). The introduction of this new interaction at the EphB4·ephrinB2 interface is certain to contribute to the high affinity of this receptor-ligand complex.FIGURE 3Stereoview of σA weighted 2 Fobs - Fcalc electron density at 2. 0 Å resolution, contoured at 1σ for the EphB4·ephrinB2 interface.

This region of the complex deviates minimally from the corresponding EphB2·ephrinB2 complex, with a maximum deviation of 2.1 Å from furthest atoms, and is predominantly characterized by backbone-backbone, backbone-side chain, and side chain-side chain hydrogen bonds. In particular, side chain-side chain interactions between Glu-59R (Glu-68 in EphB2)-Gln-118L and Ser-121L, Asp-29R (Glu-40 in EphB2)-Lys-112L, and Glu-43 (Glu-52, EphB2)-Lys-116L provide the binding potential characteristic of this low nanomolar interaction. Side chain-main chain interactions between Ser-55 and Lys-116L, and between Glu-44R and Lys-60R complete the binding network in this region. Although the overall shape of the EphB4·ephrinB2 interaction interface is in good agreement with that previously described in the EphB2·ephrinB2 structure, marked differences exist within the receptor loops that frame the ligand binding channel. The EphB4 J-K loop assumes a distinct position compared with previously described crystal structures and is situated directly above the ligand G-H loop and 15 Å from the D-E loop (Fig. 4). The corresponding J-K loop from the EphB2·ephrinB2 structure, on the other hand, is positioned only 6.4 Å from the D-E loop and, therefore, maintains a more compact binding cavity. In fact, the J-K loops differ in position by up to 10 Å from furthest positions between the two ephrinB2-bound complex structures. Not surprisingly, the J-K loop shows remarkable flexibility in each structure described, also shifting in position by up to 20 Å from furthest positions between the EphB4-TNYL-RAW structure. Furthermore, crystallization trials with the apo form of EphB4 failed to produce crystals, likely because of the inherent flexibility of the J-K and D-E loops. A feature unique to EphB4 is a three-residue insert in the J-K loop, which is absent in all other Eph receptors. It has been speculated that this insert contributes to the ligand binding specificity inherent to the EphB4 receptor (35Nikolov D.B. Li C"

In this study, we describe the expression and highly constitutive secretion of serglycin in several MM cell lines. Serglycin messenger RNA was detected in six MM cell lines. PGs were purified from conditioned medium of four MM cell lines, and serglycin substituted with 4-sulfated chondroitin sulfate was identified as the predominant PG. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy showed that serglycin was also present intracellularly and on the cell surface, and attachment to the cell surface was at least in part dependent on intact glycosaminoglycan side chains. Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow biopsies showed the presence of serglycin both in benign and malignant plasma cells. Immunoblotting in bone marrow aspirates from a limited number of patients with newly diagnosed MM revealed highly increased levels of serglycin in 30% of the cases. Serglycin isolated from myeloma plasma cells was found to influence the bone mineralization process through inhibition of the crystal growth rate of hydroxyapatite. This rate reduction was attributed to adsorption and further blocking of the active growth sites on the crystal surface. The apparent order of the crystallization reaction was found to be n = 2, suggesting a surface diffusion-controlled spiral growth mechanism. Our findings suggest that serglycin release is a constitutive process, which may be of fundamental biological importance in the study of MM.

These repeats are found in the central part of the core protein and carry eight glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains. Although serglycin does not contain a transmembrane domain, this PG was initially discovered at the cell membrane of rat L2 yolk sac tumor cells (1Oldberg A. Hayman E.G. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

The function of serglycin has not been well studied, but it is likely involved in the packaging of proteins into secretory granules and/or directing the secretion of these molecules (15Sali A. Matsumoto R. McNeil H.P. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9023-9034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that serglycin plays a key role in the storage of mast cell proteases and granzyme B and the maturation of secretory granules of mast cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (16Abrink M.

It is proposed that serglycin, through its GAG chains, serves as a carrier of other molecules during secretion, directing their binding to other specific ligands with high affinity. A novel mechanism for the role of serglycin in the delivery of granzyme B has been proposed (21Raja S.M. Metkar S.S. Honing S. Wang B. Russin W.A. Pipalia N.H. Menaa C. Belting M. Cao X. Dressel R. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20752-20761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Granzyme B complexed with serglycin is liberated by serglycin at the cell surface of target cells by binding to higher affinity sites on cell surface through electrostatic transfer. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by slow proliferation of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow. The survival of MM cells is dependent on the growth conditions provided by the bone marrow microenvironment. PGs such as syndecan-1, present on myeloma cell surface but also shed in extracellular matrix (22Wijdenes J. Vooijs W.C. Clement C. Post J. Morard F. Vita N. Laurent P. Sun R.X. Klein B. Dore J.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 94: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), are important for myeloma cell biology and bone homeostasis (23Sanderson R.D. Sneed T.B. Young L.A. Sullivan G.L.

Blood. 2002; 100: 3002-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Bone destruction is a common complication of MM and is associated with severe morbidity. Several osteoclast-activating factors are implicated in myeloma bone disease; however, the disruption of the balance between the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin is of major importance (29Heider U. Hofbauer L.C. Zavrski I. Jakob C. Sezer O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The interaction between the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) expressed on the surface of cells of osteoclastic lineage and RANKL expressed on stromal cells plays a key role in the development and activation of osteoclasts, whereas osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor for RANKL secreted from stromal cells, inhibits RANKL-RANK signaling. MM cells stimulate osteoclastogenesis by triggering a coordinated increase in RANKL and a decrease in osteoprotegerin in the bone marrow (29Heider U. Hofbauer L.C. Zavrski I. Jakob C. Sezer O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Radiographic examinations show radiolucent lesions without calcification in many patients, suggesting that along with enhanced bone resorption, mineralization is impaired in MM bone lesions. However, the mechanisms of impaired bone formation in bone lesions of patients with MM are poorly understood (30Oshima T. Abe M. Asano J. Hara T. Kitazoe K. Sekimoto E. Tanaka Y. Shibata H. Hashimoto T. Ozaki S. Kido S. Inoue D. Matsumoto T. Blood. 2005; 106: 3160-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Bone mineralization is the ion deposition in the tissue, which in vertebrates appears as hydroxyapatite (HAP) formation. HAP (Ca5(PO4)3OH), is the most stable calcium phosphate salt under physiological conditions. It has been suggested as the model compound for the study of hard tissue calcification such as bone. The role of various biological molecules as modulators of biomineralization has also been appreciated. PGs are involved in the calcification process acting either as promoters or inhibitors (31Jiang H. Liu X.Y. Zhang G. Li Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42061-42066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Rees S.G. Shellis R.P. Embery G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1993; 1158: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PGs accumulated in the bone marrow in patients with MM may directly influence bone mineralization process. The increasing awareness of the potential biological effects of PGs in MM prompted us to study secreted PGs in this disease. We postulated that, apart from syndecan-1, MM cells secrete additional PGs into the extracellular milieu. Therefore, we isolated and quantified PGs in conditioned medium from MM cells. Interestingly, we found a highly constitutive secretion of serglycin in all MM cells lines studied. We characterized the serglycin secreted from MM cells and found that it is the major PG secreted by these cells. Serglycin was associated to the cell membrane in a GAG-dependent manner but also intracellularly to cytoplasmic vesicles or granules. The expression of serglycin by MM cells was also confirmed in patient material by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Serglycin isolated from MM cell lines was a potent inhibitor of bone mineralization process having an inhibitory effect on HAP crystal growth in vitro. Cell Lines and Cultures—The human myeloma cell line JJN3 was a gift from Jennifer Ball (Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham, UK). The U266 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The OH-2 and IH-1 cell lines were established by us (34Borset M. Waage A. Brekke O.L. Helseth E. Eur. J. Haematol. 1994; 53: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Brenne A.T. Ro T.B. Waage A. Sundan A. Borset M. Hjorth-Hansen H. Blood. 2002; 99: 3756-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As kind gifts we received CAG (J. Epstein, Little Rock, AK) and INA-6 cell lines (M. Gramatzki, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany). All of these cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. IH-1 and OH-2 were supplemented with 10% human serum and 2 ng/ml IL-6. The INA-6 cell line was also supplemented with 2 ng/ml IL-6. All culture media contained 2 mmol/liter glutamine and 40 μg/ml gentamycin. The cell lines were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Preparation of Conditioned Medium—Conditioned medium was prepared from four MM cell lines. The JJN3, U266, CAG, and INA-6 cell lines grown to high density were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected, passed through a sterile filter, and stored frozen until further analysis (-20 °C). Isolation of PGs by DEAE-Sephacel—One liter of cell culture medium prepared as described above was brought to a final concentration of 10 m formamide, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.3, and protease inhibitors (10 mm EDTANa2, 10 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added (36Theocharis A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1588: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Medium was passed through a DEAE-Sephacel column (40-ml bed volume) equilibrated with the above formamide-sodium acetate buffer. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the above buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl to elute the nonproteoglycan components, and PGs were fractionated by gradient elution ranging from 0.2 m to 0.9 m NaCl. Fractions were collected, and aliquots were precipitated in 80% ethanol, 1.3% potassium acetate. Precipitates were dissolved in distilled water and were monitored and quantified by terms of GAG content using the DMB method (37Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar) and a commercial syndecan-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diaclone, Besancon, France). Aliquots of the fractions were also precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis using a 4-16% gradient resolving gel (Bio-Rad). Gels were stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 0.1 m acetic acid followed by silver staining (Pierce). The major PG population eluting with 0.55-0.7 m NaCl was pooled and subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Sephacryl S-400 (GE Healthcare) columns before and after treatment with trypsin. Trypsin digestion (1 mg/ml trypsin, Invitrogen) was performed overnight at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.02% (w/v) EDTANa2. The columns were eluted with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. Fractions were collected and aliquots precipitated as above, and PGs were monitored by the DMB method and by SDS-PAGE analysis. Characterization of Serglycin by N-terminal Sequencing—Samples of the major PG population of the four MM cell lines were treated with chondroitinase ABC in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing the protease inhibitors (10 mm EDTANa2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine hydrochloride). Samples were electrophoresed on 4-16% gradient resolving gel and transferred to Immobilon P membranes at a constant current of 80 mA at 4 °C for 12 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. The membranes were stained with Coomassie R-250, and the first nine amino acids from the N terminus of the protein bands observed were sequenced on an automated sequencer (Protein Analysis Center, Karolinska Institutet). Expression of Serglycin in Six Myeloma Cell Lines by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated with the High Pure total RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). Total RNA was first reverse-transcribed into cDNAs using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare). The expression of serglycin in MM cell lines was examined by using specific primers (5′-AATGCAGTCGGCTTGTCCTG and 3′-GCCTGATCCAGAGTAGTCCT) to generate a 272-base pair fragment that bridged the first intron and included about half of the serine-glycine repeat region (4Schick B.P. Gradowski J.F. San Antonio J.D. Blood. 2001; 97: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Three hundred nanograms of the reverse transcriptase reaction products was then subjected to PCR amplification in a total volume of 50 μl (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 8.3, containing dNTP mix (each at 0.16 mm), both downstream and upstream primers (each at 1 μm), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Tag polymerase. The PCR amplification was carried out for 35 cycles: 94 °C for 1 min, annealing temperature 51 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min (Peltier Thermal Cycler 200, MJ Research, SDS Promega). The PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Bands visible in UV light were cut out and extracted using the Qiax gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequence analysis. Sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method (Cybergene, Stockholm, Sweden). Characterization of Glycosaminoglycan Moiety of Serglycin by SDS-PAGE and Capillary Electrophoresis—The isolated populations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after treatment with chondroitinase ABC and/or chondroitinase AC II or a mixture of heparitinases. Digestion with chondroitinase ABC was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 6 h using 0.01 unit/10 μg of uronic acid. Chondroitinase ACII digestion was performed in the same buffer at pH 6.0 under the same conditions. Treatment with heparin lyases I, II, and III was performed in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 1 μmol of calcium acetate at 37 °C overnight. The gels (4-16%) were stained with toluidine blue followed by silver staining. Aliquots of the digests were also analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using an HP3D CE (Agilent Technologies) (38Karamanos N.K. Hjerpe A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 181-192PubMed Google Scholar). Separation and analysis were carried out on an uncoated fused silica capillary tube (75 μm inner diameter, 55 cm total length, 50 cm effective length to the detector) at 25 °C. The capillary tube was washed for 1 min with 0.1 m NaOH before each run and then with the operating buffer (15 mm orthophosphate, pH 3.0) for 4 min. Samples were introduced by the pressurized mode at the cathode (reverse polarity) and separated at 20 kV. Detection was performed at 232 nm using a diode array detector. Quantification was performed using the HP ChemStation software provided by the manufacturer with the instrument. Polyclonal Antibody Production and Immunoblotting—Polyclonal antibody production was performed by Invitrogen. Briefly, a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated 25-amino acid peptide of serglycin (RLRTDLFPKTRIQDLNRIFPLSEDY), starting immediately before the serine-glycine repeat region, was synthesized. Two rabbits were immunized according to standard protocol. Bleeds from week 8 and 10 were pooled, and affinity purification against the peptide was performed. The antibody was tested on serglycin isolated from MM cell lines and was used for serglycin detection in patients bone marrow biopsies. Serglycin preparations isolated from all four MM cell lines and nonfractionated condition medium as well as bone marrow samples (1 μl of bone marrow plasma) from patients with MM and healthy volunteers were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), electrophoresed on a 4% stacking-10% resolving gel, and transferred to Immobilon P membranes at constant current 80 mA at 4 °C for 12 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. The membranes were washed with 0.15 m NaCl in 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 5% dry defatted milk in PBS-T. They were immersed in polyclonal antibody produced against serglycin peptide diluted 1:10000 in PBS-T and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit) diluted 1:2000 in PBS-T for 60 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed, and bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For semiquantitative analysis, the density of immunoreactive bands was estimated following image analysis of immunoblots with the UNIDocMv program (version 99.03) for Windows (UVI Tech, Cambridge, UK). Flow Cytometry—All six MM cell lines were subjected to flow cytometry to detect the presence of serglycin on the cell surface. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were washed in PBS and incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-serglycin antibody (10 μg/ml) or nonimmune rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After washing, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (DAKO Cytomation, Copenhagen). In a FACSscan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), 10000 cells from each sample were analyzed on a single-cell basis. As a specificity control, anti-serglycin antibody (10 μg/ml) was incubated with the synthetic serglycin peptide (50 μg/ml) or purified serglycin (50 μg/ml) for 10 min prior to labeling of the cells. The cells were also treated with 0.1 unit of chondroitinase ABC for 30 min at 37 °C prior to labeling with anti-serglycin or control antibody. Results were depicted as frequency distribution histograms. Confocal Microscopy—MM cell lines were subjected to confocal microscopy analysis to detect the presence of serglycin. Briefly, for extracellular staining, 105 cells were washed in PBS. Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS supplemented with 5% human serum for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 5% human serum in PBS for 15 min. After washing, cells were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-serglycin antibody (10 μg/ml) or normal rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml) in PBS/serum for 30 min, where after nuclei were counter-stained with 1 mg/liter bisbenzidine (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany). Cells were washed and incubated with Alexa-647-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (5 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were washed, resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and examined in a Petri dish. For intracellular staining, the above protocol was applied, but all incubations and washes were performed in 5% human serum supplemented with 0.3% saponin. Examination of immunocytochemical staining was performed with a Leica TCS NT confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an ArKr laser, permitting the detection of signals from the fluorochromes, with emission wavelengths at 488 nm and 568 nm. For each experiment the excitation and sensitivity of the detector were adjusted so that the corresponding negative controls with normal IgG gave barely detectable signals. Subsequently all settings were kept equal for the analysis of anti-serglycin-labeled cells. As a specificity control, anti-serglycin antibody (10 μg/ml) was incubated with the synthetic serglycin peptide (50 μg/ml) or purified serglycin (50 μg/ml) for 10 min prior to labeling the cells. Immunohistochemistry—Reactivity to the rabbit anti-serglycin antibody and CD138 (syndecan-1) was also studied using parallel sections of routinely fixed (4% buffered formalin) and paraffin-embedded bone marrow. For this purpose five tissues with MM and five tissues with benign proliferation of plasma cells (including one case with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS)) were retrieved from the archives at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge. Sections (3 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, decalcified in formic acid, and subjected to epitope retrieval in a microwave oven using ChemMate target retrieval solution (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) diluted 1:10 according to manufacturer instructions. Endogenous peroxidase quenching was performed with the ChemMate peroxidase-blocking solution (Dako). Blocking was performed with protein block solution (Dako), and sections were incubated with a 28 μg/ml dilution of the primary antibody against serglycin or a 1:200 dilution of CD138/syndecan-1 mouse monoclonal antibody in Tris-buffered saline. The staining to demonstrate serglycin and syndecan-1 was performed using the ChemMate detection kit peroxidase/DAB (Dako) in a DakoCytomation TechMate Autostainer. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Bone Marrow Plasma Samples from Patients and Controls—Sixteen patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were included for the analysis of serglycin in the bone marrow plasma. Before treatment, after informed consent, bone marrow plasma was aspirated from the crista iliaca or sternum. Aspirates were centrifuged and plasma was frozen at -70 °C until analysis. Fourteen healthy volunteers were included as controls. For all controls, bone marrow plasma was collected and stored in an identical manner as described for patients with MM. In Vitro Effect of Serglycin in Hydroxyapatite Crystal Growth—Analytical reagent grade chemicals and calibrated A-grade volumetric glassware were used. Stock solutions of calcium dichloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride were prepared from the respective crystalline solids (Merck) using triply distilled CO2-free water. The pH was measured using a combined glass/Ag/AgCl electrode (Metrohm, 6.0202.100), standardized before and after each experiment with National Bureau of Standards (NBS) standard buffer solutions. The HAP seed crystals were prepared from solutions of Ca(NO3)2, H3PO4, and NH3, aged in the mother liquor for 8 months, filtered, and dried as described previously (39Koutsoukos P.G. Amjad Z. Tomson M.B. Nancollas G.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 1553-1557Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Their specific surface area was found to be 34.6 m2/g as determined by a multiple point Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Sorptometer 212D). The synthetic HAP crystals were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (Jeol GSM 5200, Leo Supra 35VP), x-ray powder diffraction (Philips PW 1830/1840, CuKα radiation, nickel filter), infrared spectroscopy (KBr pellet method, FT-IR PerkinElmer Life Sciences 16-PC), and chemical analysis. The crystals showed the characteristic powder x-ray diffraction pattern and the infrared spectrum of stoichiometric HAP, and from the chemical analysis the molar ratio of calcium to phosphates was found to be 1.67 ± 0.02.

https://openalex.org/W1981576203,"In this report we describe the structure of the polysaccharide released from Bacillus anthracis vegetative cell walls by aqueous hydrogen fluoride (HF). This HF-released polysaccharide (HF-PS) was isolated and structurally characterized from the Ames, Sterne, and Pasteur strains of B. anthracis. The HF-PSs were also isolated from the closely related Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987 strain, and from the B. cereus ATCC 14579 type strain and compared with those of B. anthracis. The structure of the B. anthracis HF-PS was determined by glycosyl composition and linkage analyses, matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry, and one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The HF-PSs from all of the B. anthracis isolates had an identical structure consisting of an amino sugar backbone of →6)-α-GlcNAc-(1→4)-β-ManNAc-(1→4)-β-GlcNAc-(1→, in which the α-GlcNAc residue is substituted with α-Gal and β-Gal at O-3 and O-4, respectively, and the β-GlcNAc substituted with α-Gal at O-3. There is some variability in the presence of two of these three Gal substitutions. Comparison with the HF-PSs from B. cereus ATCC 10987 and B. cereus ATCC 14579 showed that the B. anthracis structure was clearly different from each of these HF-PSs and, furthermore, that the B. cereus ATCC 10987 HF-PS structure was different from that of B. cereus ATCC 14579. The presence of a B. anthracis-specific polysaccharide structure in its vegetative cell wall is discussed with regard to its relationship to those of other Bacillus species.

The presence of a B. anthracis-specific polysaccharide structure in its vegetative cell wall is discussed with regard to its relationship to those of other Bacillus species. Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax (1Mock M. Fouet A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Cell wall carbohydrates such as capsular polysaccharides are well known virulence factors with regard to numerous bacterial pathogens, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. However, relatively little is known about the carbohydrates in the vegetative cell walls of B. anthracis as well as other members of the B. cereus group of bacteria. Whereas there have been some glycosyl composition analyses, there have been no reported structures for carbohydrates from the vegetative cell wall of B. anthracis. Generally, the carbohydrate-containing components of the vegetative cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria consist of the extensive peptidoglycan layer, teichoic acids, lipoteichoic acids, capsular polysaccharides, and crystalline cell surface proteins known as S-layer proteins that are often glycosylated (2Messner P. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the B. anthracis cell wall differs in several aspects from this generalized description. First, B. anthracis cells are surrounded by a poly-γ-d-glutamate capsule and not by a polysaccharide capsule. Second, their cell walls do not contain teichoic acid (3Molnar J. Pragai B. Acta Microbiol. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1971; 18: 105-108PubMed Google Scholar), and last, their S-layer proteins are not glycosylated (1Mock M. Fouet A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 4Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, glycosyl composition comparisons of the cell walls of B. anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis show that they do contain glycosyl residues and that they differ from one another in their glycosyl compositions (5Fox A. Stewart C.G. Waller L.N. Fox K.F. Harley W.M. Price R.L. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2003; 54: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To date, cell wall carbohydrates from the vegetative cells of members of the B. cereus group have been addressed only to a limited extent (6Ekwunife F.S. Singh J. Taylor K.G. Doyle R.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 82: 257-262Google Scholar, 7Fox A. Steward G.C. Fox K. Rostovtseva S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 887-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Amano K. Hazama S. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All of these carbohydrates are rich in amino glycosyl residues but have variations in the type and amounts of these residues. The study of Ekwunife et al. (6Ekwunife F.S. Singh J. Taylor K.G. Doyle R.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 82: 257-262Google Scholar) focused on the glycosyl composition of a carbohydrate polymer released from the cell wall through hydrogen fluoride (HF) treatment (HF treatment releases wall polysaccharides covalently bound via a phosphate bond to the peptidoglycan) of B. anthracis (Δ Sterne) and found that the HF-released polysaccharide (HF-PS) 3The abbreviations used are: PS, polysaccharide; TOCSY, total correlated spectra; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectra; HSQC, quantum coherence experiment; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect. contained Gal, GlcNAc, and ManNAc in an approximate ratio of 3:2:1. This HF-PS was also further investigated by Mesnage et al. (4Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). They reported the importance of a pyruvyl substituent with regard to the function of this polysaccharide in anchoring the S-layer proteins to the cell wall. Fox et al. (7Fox A. Steward G.C. Fox K. Rostovtseva S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 887-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) investigated a number of B. anthracis and B. cereus strains for their total cell glycosyl compositions, which showed interesting differences between the different strains. For example, in contrast to the B. anthracis strains, all B. cereus strains investigated contained GalNAc, suggesting possible differences in cell wall architecture in the different Bacillus species cell walls and, possibly, the occurrence of strain- or species-specific carbohydrates. The possibility of species/strain-specific structures is of interest for at least two reasons: the taxonomy within the B. cereus group has recently become a matter of debate (9Priest F.G. Barker M. Baillie L.W.J. Holmes E.C. Maiden M.C.J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7959-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 10Han C.S. Xie G. Challacombe J.F. Altherr M.R. Bhotika S.S. Bruce D.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3382-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and investigations into cell wall carbohydrates of B. cereus group members may hold additional clues to their phylogenetic relatedness. In addition, the identification of specific cell wall carbohydrate structures could provide valuable leads in the elucidation of their functional importance in pathogenic interactions. The function of one B. anthracis cell wall polysaccharide has been addressed in the literature. This function is its role for anchoring the S-layer proteins to the vegetative cell wall (4Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The S-layer proteins contain a S-layer homology domain, which is found also in other S-layer proteins from Gram-positive bacteria and in cell wall enzymes, such as xylanase and pullanase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermohydrosulfurigenes (Clostridium thermosulfurogenes) (11Brechtel E. Bahl H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5017-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that S-layer homology domains bind to secondary cell wall carbohydrates that are covalently linked to the cell wall peptidoglycan via HF-labile phosphate bridges (4Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and thus anchor the S-layer proteins to the bacterial cell walls. This function has been investigated in greatest detail for B. anthracis (4Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus far only a series of older reports about an isolated strain, namely B. cereus AHU 1356, addressed the question of a Bacillus species cell wall carbohydrate structure directly (8Amano K. Hazama S. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 75: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Kojima N. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Murazumi N. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The structures of neutral and acidic cell wall carbohydrates have been described for that strain. The neutral carbohydrate was composed of GlcNAc, ManNAc, GalNAc, and Glc in ratios of 4:1:1:1 (13Murazumi N. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), whereas the acidic carbohydrate was composed of GlcNAc, Gal, Rha, glycerol, and phosphorus in ratios of 1:1:2:1:1 (12Kojima N. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As a first step in addressing cell wall carbohydrate structure/function relationships within members of the B. cereus group, we here report the structures of the HF-PSs of a number of B. anthracis and B. cereus strains. Structures were determined for these polysaccharides from B. anthracis Ames, B. anthracis Pasteur, and B. anthracis Sterne 34F2. We also compared these structures with those from a closely related B. cereus strain, ATCC 10987, and from the B. cereus type strain, ATCC 14579. The results showed that all three B. anthracis strains contained the same HF-PS structure that differed from that of B. cereus ATCC 10987, which, in turn, differed from that of B. cereus ATCC 14579. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—B. anthracis Ames, B. anthracis Pasteur, B. anthracis Sterne 34F2, and B. cereus strains ATCC 10987, and ATCC 14579 were provided from the Center for Disease Control culture collection. The mutant UT60 (i.e. Sterne 7702 ΔatxA) was provided by Dr. Theresa Kohler, University of Texas, Houston. Cultures were grown overnight (16 h, 37 °C) in 100 ml of brain heart infusion medium (BD BBL, Sparks, MD) containing 0.5% glycerol at 37 °C, 200 rpm. In the morning, 4 × 1.5 ml of the overnight cultures were pelleted (10,000 × g at room temperature for 5 min), the supernatants were discarded, the pellets resuspended in 500 μl of brain heart infusion and these four cell suspensions used to inoculate four 250-ml volumes of brain heart infusion medium in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C (B. anthracis) or 30 °C(B. cereus and B. thuringiensis) on a shaker at 200 rpm. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm. Cells were harvested in mid-log phase by centrifugation (8,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min), washed two times in sterile saline and enumerated by serial dilution and surface spread counts on brain heart infusion agar plates. Cultures were sterilized by autoclaving for 1 h at 121 °C prior to further processing and carbohydrate analysis. Preparation of Cell Wall Extracts—The bacterial cells were grown as described above and cell walls were prepared by modification of a previously described procedure (14Brown W.C. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 25: 295-300Google Scholar). Briefly, the autoclaved bacterial cells (1 × 1010 to 1 × 1011 CFU) were disrupted in 40-ml sterile saline on ice by four 10-min sonication cycles, using a Branson Sonifier (Type 450, Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) with a ½ inch probe, operating at a frequency of 20 kHz. The complete or near complete disruption of cells was checked microscopically. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (8,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). The separated pellet and supernatant fractions were stored at –80 °C. Cell wall materials were sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 h (Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge, Beckman). The resulting cell wall pellets were washed by suspension in cold, deionized water followed by an additional ultracentrifugation as above and lyophilization. Isolation and Purification of the Cell Surface Polysaccharide— Cell wall materials from the B. anthracis Ames, B. anthracis Pasteur, B. anthracis Sterne 34F2 and UT60, the atxA deletion mutant of B. anthracis Sterne 7702, were treated with 48% HF at 4 °C for 48 h. The HF-treated material was neutralized by ice-cold ammonium hydroxide solution (∼30%) in an ice-water bath. The neutralized material was desalted by gel permeation chromatography using fine grade Bio-Gel P2 (Bio-Rad). Water was used as the eluent and an online refractive index detector was used to monitor the sample eluting from the column. The fractions that gave a positive response in the refractive index detector were collected, pooled, lyophilized, and used for further analysis. Composition Analysis—Glycosyl composition analysis was done by the preparation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of trimethylsilyl methylglycosides (15York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The trimethylsilyl methylglycosides were identified and quantified by comparison to authentic standards. In brief, the samples were methanolyzed using methanolic 1 m HCl at 80 °C for 18 h to form the monomeric methylglycosides, followed by N-acetylation using pyridine and acetic anhydride (1:1) in the presence of methanol at 100 °C for 1 h. After removing the reagents by flushing with dry nitrogen, the methylglycosides were treated with Tri-Sil reagent (Pierce) at 80 °C for 30 min to form trimethylsilyl methylglycosides. The TMS methylglycosides were dissolved in hexane and analyzed on a gas chromatography-mass spectrometric using HP-1MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Pyruvic acid content was measured according to the method of Katsuki (16Katsuki H. Yoshida T. Tanegashima C. Tanaka S. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This method can detect less than 2 μg of pyruvic acid, and 200 μg of the isolated polysaccharides were assayed. Glycosyl Linkage Analysis—The linkage analysis was performed according to a modification of the method of Ciucanu and Kerek (17Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were dissolved in dry dimethyl sulfoxide (0.250 μl) overnight with stirring, followed by addition of a Me2SO/sodium hydroxide slurry (0.250 μl) and stirring for 2 h at room temperature. Methyl iodide was added to the sample and stirred for 40 min. Another aliquot of methyl iodide was added and stirred for another 30 min. The reaction was cooled on an ice-bath and the partially methylated polysaccharide was extracted by partitioning between chloroform and water. The partially methylated sample in the chloroform layer was dried and used for the preparation of partially methylated alditol acetates. The partially methylated polysaccharide was methanolyzed to monomers using methanolic 1 m HCl at 80 °C for 16 h followed by hydrolysis with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h. The aldoses were reduced to their corresponding alditols by sodium borodeuteride (NaBD4) overnight at room temperature. The excess borodeuteride was neutralized using 30% acetic acid solution and boric acid was removed as methyl borates by repeated refluxing and evaporation with acidified methanol and methanol, respectively. The partially methylated alditols were then acetylated using a pyridine:acetic anhydride (1:1) solution at 100 °C for 1 h. Pyridine and acetic anhydride were removed by flushing with dry nitrogen and the partially methylated alditol acetates were dissolved in dichloromethane and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometric using a HP-1 MS column. The linkage positions of each monosaccharide were identified from its mass fragmentation pattern and by matching its retention time to that of authentic partially methylated alditol acetate standards. NMR Analysis—The polysaccharide samples (2–3 mg) were dissolved in 0.5 ml of regular grade deuterium oxide (D2O) (99.8% Aldrich), and lyophilized; this process was repeated to exchange the hydroxyl and amide protons with deuterium. The sample was finally dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100% D2O (100% D; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. All one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a 600 MHz Varian Inova instrument using the standard software supplied by Varian. Proton NMR spectra were measured using a spectral width of 8 kHz and the data were processed with HOD signal referenced to δ 4.78 ppm (the chemical shift of HOD relative to that of acetone at 25 °C). Gradient correlated spectra (gCOSY) were measured over a spectral width of 2.25 kHz in both dimensions using a dataset of (t1 × t2) of 256 × 1024 points with 16 scans. Homonuclear total correlated (TOCSY) spectra and through space nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectra (NOESY) were collected using a dataset of (t1 × t2) of 256 × 1024 points and acquired over 32 scans. The mixing time used for TOCSY and NOESY experiments were 80 and 300 ms, respectively. To determine the carbon chemical shift a gradient 1H-13C single quantum coherence experiment (gHSQC) was done. Spectral widths with proton and carbon dimensions of 2.25 and 13.9 kHz, respectively, and a dataset of (t1 × t2) 128 × 512 with 96 scans were used in collecting the gHSQC spectra. All the NMR data were processed and analyzed using NMR processing software Mest-Rec version 4.7.5.0 for Windows. Mass Spectroscopy—A matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer model Voyager-DE BioSpectrometry Work station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to obtain the mass spectrum for each polysaccharide sample. Each sample was dissolved in 1:1 mixture of methanol: water and mixed at equal proportion (v/v) with 0.5 m 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix. About 0.7 μl of this mixture was loaded on each spot on a stainless steel matrix-assisted laser desorption plate and air-dried. The spectra were acquired in delayed, linear and positive mode using a 337-nm N2 laser with acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Isolation and Initial Analysis—Glycosyl composition analysis, as described elsewhere, 4C. Leoff, E. Saile, C. P. Quinn, R. W. Carlson, P. Wilkins, and E. L. Kannenberg, manuscript in preparation. showed that the HF-PSs from B. anthracis strains Ames, B. anthracis Pasteur, B. anthracis Sterne 34F2, and B. anthracis UT60 all had the same composition; namely, galactose (Gal), N-acetylglucosamine (Glc-NAc), and N-acetylmannose (ManNAc) in an approximate 3:2:1 ratio. The composition of the HF-PS from B. cereus ATCC 10987 consisted of Gal, ManNAc, GlcNAc, and Gal-NAc in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, and that of B. cereus ATCC 14579 of Glc, ManNAc, GlcNAc, and GalNAc in approximately a 1:1: 2:1 ratio. None of the B. anthracis HF-PSs contained detectable levels (above 0.5% of the sample mass) of pyruvic acid as determined by the colorimetric method of Katsuki (16Katsuki H. Yoshida T. Tanegashima C. Tanaka S. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Methylation analysis of the B. anthracis HF-PSs showed that all of these polysaccharides contained the same glycosyl linkages; namely, terminally linked Gal, 4-linked GlcNAc, 6-linked GlcNAc, 4,6-linked GlcNAc, 3,4-linked GlcNAc, 3,4,6-linked GlcNAc, and 4-linked ManNAc. The variation in the GlcNAc linkages in these polysaccharides indicated that there is heterogeneity in the substitution of the GlcNAc residues. Mass spectrometric analysis using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer confirmed that the B. anthracis HF-PSs were heterogeneous in the number of hexosyl (in this case, Gal) residues. The mass spectrum of the B. anthracis Ames polysaccharide is shown in Fig. 1 and the proposed compositions for the various ions are given in Table 1. The mass spectrum shows a series of ion clusters. The mass ions observed in each ion cluster differ from those in the adjacent cluster by m/z 1095, a mass that is consistent with a hexasaccharide repeating oligosaccharide comprised of three hexosyl and three N-acetylhexosaminosyl residues; e.g. Gal3GlcNAc2ManNAc1. Each ion cluster contains three major ions that differ from one another by a single hexosyl unit, which, in this case, would be Gal. For example (see Table 1), m/z 2232 is consistent with a composition of Gal6GlcNAc4ManNAc2, 2069 contains one less Gal residue, and m/z 1907 contains two less Gal residues. This heterogeneity in Gal residues, together with the variation in substitution pattern of the GlcNAc residues, suggests that the molecular heterogeneity in these polysaccharides is due to variation in substitution of one or more of the GlcNAc residues by Gal residues. The fact that each ion cluster contains variation in only one or two less Gal residues indicates that these changes may occur in only one of the multiple oligosaccharide repeating units for each ion cluster; e.g. the m/z ions 6612, 6450, and 6288 are due to [Gal3-GlcNAc2ManNAc2]5Gal3GlcNAc2ManNAc1, [Gal3GlcNAc2-ManNAc1]5Gal2GlcNAc2ManNAc1, and [Gal3GlcNAc2Man-NAc1]5Gal1GlcNAc2ManNAc1, respectively.TABLE 1Mass spectral data of de-O-acetylated polysaccharide from B. anthracis AmesObserved massProposed compositionm/z2232Gal6GlcNAc4ManNAc2Na+2069Gal5GlcNAc4ManNAc2 Na+1907Gal4GlcNAc4ManNAc2 Na+3327Gal9GlcNAc6ManNAc3Na+3165Gal8GlcNAc6ManNAc3Na+3003Gal7GlcNAc6ManNAc3Na+4422Gal12GlcNAc8ManNAc4Na+4260Gal11GlcNAc8ManNAc4Na+4098Gal10GlcNAc8ManNAc4Na+5517Gal15GlcNAc10ManNAc5Na+5355Gal14GlcNAc10ManNAc5Na+5193Gal13GlcNAc10ManNAc5Na+6612Gal18GlcNAc12ManNAc6Na+6450Gal17GlcNAc12ManNAc6Na+6288Gal16GlcNAc12ManNAc6Na+ Open table in a new tab NMR Analysis of the B. anthracis Polysaccharides—Glycosyl residue compositions of the HF-PSs from B. anthracis are different from those for B. cereus ATCC 10987, and the B. cereus type strain ATTC 14579.4 The proton NMR spectra comparing HF-PS from B. anthracis Ames with the two B. cereus strains is shown in Fig. 2. Each spectrum clearly differs from the other in the pattern of resonances for their glycosyl anomeric and ring protons. These results show, as is indicated by the composition differences, that the structure of the HF-PS from the B. anthracis is different from those of B. cereus ATCC 10987 and ATCC 14579 and, furthermore, that the B. cereus ATCC 10987 structure differs from that of strain ATCC 14579. The spectra comparing the HF-PSs of B. anthracis Ames, B. anthracis Sterne, and B. anthracis Pasteur are shown in Fig. 3. These spectra are identical to one another and support the conclusion that these polysaccharides all have the same structure. Further NMR analyses (gCOSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and gHSQC) also gave identical spectra for the HF-PSs from the B. anthracis strains. Because of the identical nature of these NMR analyses of the B. anthracis HF-PSs, the structural details are described below for the HF-PS isolated from B. anthracis Ames.FIGURE 3The proton NMR spectra for the HF-PSs from the various B. anthracis strains. The spectra are shown for the HF-PSs from B. anthracis Ames (A), B. anthracis Sterne (B), and B. anthracis Pasteur (C). The spectrum for B. anthracis UT60 was identical to those shown in this figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The proton spectrum given in Fig. 3A for the B. anthracis Ames polysaccharide shows it contains six anomeric signals at δ 5.64, δ 5.53, δ 5.22, δ 4.91, δ 4.67 (J1,2 = 7.2 Hz), and δ 4.44 (J1,2 = 7.8 Hz) supporting the conclusion that this polysaccharide consists of a hexasaccharide repeat unit; a result that is consistent with the composition and mass spectrometric data described above. Furthermore, the chemical shifts and J1,2 coupling constants of these anomeric protons indicate that three of these glycosyl residues are α-anomers, and at least two areβ-anomers, whereas the anomeric configuration of the remaining glycosyl residue (i.e. the glycosyl residue with H1 at δ 4.91) cannot be deduced from the one-dimensional proton spectrum due to its small J1,2 coupling, which indicates that this residue is in the manno configuration. The presence of a repeating unit of six glycosyl residues is also supported by the HSQC spectrum (Fig. 4), which clearly shows six anomeric proton/carbon resonances. We also observed a resonance at δ 1.48 (Fig. 3, arrows) that is consistent with the methyl protons of a pyruvyl substituent as reported by Mesnage et al. (4Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, the relatively low intensity of this resonance indicates that the putative pyruvyl component is present in non-stoichiometric and low amounts. Pyruvate is an acidlabile component and it is very likely that the majority of this component was removed during the aqueous HF treatment of the cell walls. The assignments of the proton and carbon resonances for the polysaccharides were determined by a series of two-dimensional NMR experiments; COSY (not shown), HSQC (Fig. 4), TOCSY (Fig. 5), and NOESY (Fig. 6) analyses. The rationale for these assignments (given in Table 2) is described in the following paragraphs.FIGURE 6The NOESY spectrum of the HF-PS from B. anthracis Ames. The structure and the inter- and intra-residue NOEs are indicated.

The H1 through H4 assignments are readily assigned from the COSY and TOCSY (Fig. 5) data. It is apparent from the TOCSY spectrum that the H4 resonance at δ 4.00 has a small overall coupling to the adjacent H3 and H5 protons (i.e. J3,4 + J4,5 < 9.6 Hz) supporting the conclusion that A has a galacto configuration, and, therefore, is an α-Gal residue. To assign H5 and H6, it was necessary to determine, using the TOCSY data, the resonances of the protons coupled to H4. This analysis showed that H4 is coupled to protons at δ 3.74 (H3), δ 3.82 (H2), and another proton at δ 3.84, which was assigned as H5. The H5 resonance was, in turn coupled to protons in the δ 3.76 range, which are likely the H6 protons. The HSQC spectrum (Fig. 4) shows that protons at δ 3.76 are coupled to a C-6 at δ 62, which supports the presence of H6 protons at this chemical shift. The remaining carbon chemical shifts for this residue, and for the following residues, were also obtained from the HSQC spectrum (Fig. 4). Residue B has an anomeric H1 at δ 5.53. As with residue A, the H1 through H4 resonances are readily assigned from the COSY and TOCSY (Fig. 5) data, an"
https://openalex.org/W2031860444,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) budding from infected cells is a tightly regulated process that requires both core and envelope structures. Here we report that HBV uses cellular γ2-adaptin and Nedd4, possibly in conjunction with ubiquitin, to coordinate its assembly and release. In search of interaction partners of the viral L envelope protein, we previously discovered γ2-adaptin, a putative endosomal sorting and trafficking adaptor of the adaptor protein complex family. We now demonstrate that the viral core interacts with the same γ2-adaptor and that disruption of the HBV/γ2-adaptin interactions inhibits virus production. Mutational analyses revealed a hitherto unknown ubiquitin-binding activity of γ2-adaptin, specified by a ubiquitin-interacting motif, which contributes to its interaction with core. For core, the lysine residue at position 96, a potential target for ubiquitination, was identified to be essential for both γ2-adaptin-recognition and virus production. The participation of the cellular ubiquitin system in HBV assembly was further suggested by our finding that core interacts with the endosomal ubiquitin ligase Nedd4, partly via its late domain-like PPAY sequence. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive Nedd4 mutant diminished HBV egress, indicating that protein ubiquitination is functionally involved in virus production. Additional evidence for a link of HBV assembly to the endosomal machinery was provided by immunolabeling studies that demonstrated colocalization of core and L with γ2-adaptin in compartments positive for the late endosomal marker CD63. Together, these data indicate that an enveloped DNA virus exploits a new ubiquitin receptor together with endosomal pathway functions for egress from hepatocytes.

Together, these data indicate that an enveloped DNA virus exploits a new ubiquitin receptor together with endosomal pathway functions for egress from hepatocytes. The production of enveloped virus particles requires the spatially and temporally coordinated interactions of the components that make up an infectious virion. For many viruses, the assembling particle then buds through a cellular membrane, away from the cytoplasm, to acquire its own membrane. Intense research has begun to uncover that enveloped RNA viruses like retro-, rhabdo-, and filoviruses use components of endocytic trafficking, ubiquitination, and vacuolar protein-sorting pathways to coordinate their assembly and release (1Perez O.D.

In most cases, the cellular functions co-opted by these viruses are activated by so-called late domains of their Gag and matrix proteins (4Bieniasz P.D. Virology. 2006; 344: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To date, three prototype late domains have been identified that act to recruit the cellular machinery necessary for viral budding and membrane fission. The PTAP late motif interacts with Tsg101, an ubiquitin-binding protein that is an essential component of the endosomal sorting complex-I required for transport, which is responsible for multivesicular body (MVB) 3The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular body; HBV, hepatitis B virus; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AP, adaptor protein; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild-type; siRNA, small interfering RNA; EPR, endogenous polymerase reaction; Hxp, hemopexin; UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; MLV, murine leukemia virus; dn, dominant-negative; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GGA, Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear domain homology, ADP ribosylation factor-binding proteins; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; CMV, cytomegalovirus; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; RNAi, RNA interference. formation (5Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W.

Chem. 2005; 280: 40474-40480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By means of such interactions, late domain-containing RNA viruses gain access to the inward MVB budding machinery of the host. By contrast, assembly and budding mechanisms in families of enveloped DNA viruses, like the hepadnavirus family, are still poorly understood. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the prototype member of this virus family, comprising small enveloped DNA viruses that replicate via reverse transcription and supposedly bud at intracellular membranes (14Huovila A.P. Eder A.M. Fuller S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Bruss V. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similar to retroviruses, hepadnavirus assembly begins with the formation of icosahedral nucleocapsids that package the viral pregenomic RNA together with the viral polymerase. Inside the capsids, formed by 120 dimers of the single 21-kDa core protein, the partially double-stranded 3.2-kb DNA genome is synthesized through reverse transcription of the pregenomic RNA (16Nassal M. Intervirology. 1999; 42: 100-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mature nucleocapsids, formed in the cytoplasm, can then be enclosed by the viral envelope composed of cellular lipids and three viral glycoproteins, the small S, middle M, and large L envelope proteins. The envelope proteins originate at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and share the transmembrane region of S. The M and L proteins differ from S by their N-terminal extensions, termed preS, which contribute to their functional differences. Virus assembly strictly depends on the L protein, whereas the S protein is required but not sufficient, and the M protein is dispensable (15Bruss V. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast to retroviruses, HBV budding and egress are dependent on both envelope and core structural proteins. Genetic approaches led to the identification of two short envelope regions within L and S that are essential for virus formation (17Bruss V. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9350-9357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Loffler-Mary H. Dumortier J. Klentsch-Zimmer C. Prange R. Virology. 2000; 270: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), possibly by providing scaffolding function for the interaction with the nucleocapsid. For core, mutational analyses have mapped eleven single amino acids that cluster at the capsid surface and are required for nucleocapsid envelopment (19Ponsel D. Bruss V. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It has been unclear, however, whether a direct envelope-core interaction initiates and drives the assembly process. Similarly, the cellular membrane compartments used during HBV budding remain largely undefined. Because solitary expression of the S protein leads to the assembly of empty subviral particles that bud at post-ER/pre-medial-Golgi membranes and leave the cell via the constitutive secretory pathway, it is hypothesized that viral particles may take the same export route (14Huovila A.P. Eder A.M. Fuller S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Despite the previously reported investigation of the role of chaperones (20Lambert C. Prange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Hu J. Flores D. Toft D. Wang X. Nguyen D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13122-13131Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), little is known about the general network of host proteins needed for HBV morphogenesis. One candidate molecule involved in viral trafficking and budding may be γ2-adaptin that we discovered as an L-specific interaction partner in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the assembly-promoting region of L as bait (22Hartmann-Stuhler C. Prange R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5343-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Adaptins are subunits of adaptor protein complexes involved in the sorting of cargo proteins to specific membrane compartments within the cell. Four heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes have been described in mammalian cells, designated AP-1 through AP-4. They concentrate the appropriate cargo into the nascent vesicle, generate membrane curvature, and allow vesicles to pinch off the donor membrane toward the cytoplasm (23Boehm M. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2907-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). γ2-Adaptin has similarities to γ1-adaptin, one large subunit of the trans-Golgi network/endosome adaptor AP-1, in both primary sequence and domain structure consisting of a N-terminal head and a C-terminal ear domain that are linked by a hinge region (24Lewin D.A. Sheff D. Ooi C.E. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E. Chicione L.M. Webster P. Bonifacino J.S. Mellman I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24693-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Despite their relatedness, γ2-adaptin appears to serve a separate, yet unknown function distinct from that of AP-1 (26Zizioli D. Meyer C. Guhde G. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5385-5390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we previously demonstrated that L recruits γ2-adaptin but not γ1-adaptin in vivo (22Hartmann-Stuhler C. Prange R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5343-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the potential role of γ2-adaptin played during virus production in HBV-replicating liver cells. By analyzing its mode of action in virus morphogenesis, we were expecting to elucidate one or more physiological functions of γ2-adaptin. In parallel, we searched for intracellular compartments and additional host factors participating in HBV maturation with special emphasis on the viral core particle that contains a surface-exposed sequence matching the known PPXY late domain. DNA Constructs—For replication of HBV in permissive liver cell lines, plasmid pHBV was used, which carries an 1.1-mer of the HBV DNA genome under the transcriptional control of the human metallothionein IIa promoter (27Radziwill G. Tucker W. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vector pNI2.S contains the HBV S envelope gene with a C-terminally tagged influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope driven by the human metallothionein IIa promoter (28Lambert C. Prange R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22265-22272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For expression of the HBV core gene in mammalian cells (pC), the S-encoding region was excised from pNI2.S and replaced by the core gene. Plasmid pHBV.C- is identical to pHBV with the exception that a stop codon was created at triplet 38 of the core gene to ablate core expression from the HBV replicon. For trans-complementation, pHBV.C- was coexpressed with vectors encoding either the wild-type (wt) or mutant core genes. All mutations were introduced with the QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and verified by sequencing. The expression vector for γ2-adaptin containing the human γ2-adaptin cDNA derived from hepatoma HepG2 cells with an N-terminal HA tag (25Takatsu H. Sakurai M. Shin H.W. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24693-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was a gift from K. Nakayama, Tsukuba University, Japan. The deletion mutant γ2HAΔEar lacking the C-terminal ear domain and parts of the hinge domain (amino acids 528-785) has been described previously (22Hartmann-Stuhler C. Prange R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5343-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An oppositional mutant (γ2HAΔHead) devoid of the N-terminal head domain (amino acids 2-522) was constructed by cloning, and γ2-adaptin mutants with lesions in the ubiquitin-interacting motif were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. For expression in Escherichia coli, plasmid pGEX-γ2.14-533 was constructed, which carries the amino acid sequence 14-533 of γ2-adaptin fused in-frame to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) encoded by plasmid pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). The human hemopexin gene was PCR-amplified and cloned from a liver cDNA library into the vector pCMV-HA (BD Biosciences, cloning details will be available on request). The plasmid pGADNOT carrying the human Nedd4.1 gene (8Bouamr F. Melillo J.A. Wang M.Q. Nagashima K. de Los Santosqq M. Rein A. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11882-11895Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by F. Bouamr (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, NY). For ectopic expression in N-terminally, FLAG-tagged form, the Nedd4 gene was subcloned into the expression vector p3xFLAG (a gift from E. Gottwein, University of Heidelberg, Germany). Antibodies—For immunoprecipitation of enveloped HBV particles, a mixture of L- and S-specific rabbit antibodies was used as described previously (18Loffler-Mary H. Dumortier J. Klentsch-Zimmer C. Prange R. Virology. 2000; 270: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The L-specific monoclonal mouse antibody MA18/7 was generously provided by K.-H. Heermann (University of Göttingen, Germany). To generate core-specific antibodies, a C-terminally truncated core gene encoded by ptacVR4 (a gift from H. Meisel, Charité, Berlin, Germany) was expressed in E. coli, and capsids were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation, according to a protocol of Maassen et al. (29Maassen A. Rehfeldt A. Kiessig S. Ladhoff A. Hohne W.E. Meisel H. Arch. Virol. 1994; 135: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera against recombinant core particles (αK45) were raised in rabbits and proved to be suitable for immunoprecipitation of capsids. In parallel, rabbits were immunized with core particles that were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS/100 mm dithiothreitol. This antiserum (αK46) recognized core in Western blotting analyses. For detection of γ2-adaptin, a rabbit antiserum (αK8330) generated against its C-terminal 19 amino acids was used (22Hartmann-Stuhler C. Prange R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5343-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GST-specific antibodies were raised in rabbits by immunization of animals with recombinant purified GST. Mouse or rat monoclonal antibodies against the HA epitope were purchased from BabCO or Roche Applied Science, respectively. An anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma, a mouse antibody recognizing human heat shock protein Hsc70 was obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies, and a mouse antibody against human CD63 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Peroxidase-labeled, secondary antibodies were obtained from Dianova and used in dilutions recommended by the supplier. The fluorophor-labeled antibodies AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G, AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin G, and AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture, Transfection, and RNA Interference—The human hepatoma cell line HuH-7 was used throughout. Transfections with plasmid DNAs were performed with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The amounts of plasmids used in cotransfection experiments are indicated in the figure legends. Unless otherwise indicated, the cells were analyzed 72 h after transfection. For (co)transfection of cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or siRNA plus plasmid DNA, the TransMessenger™ transfection reagent from Qiagen was used. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate were transfected with 250 ng of siRNA either alone or in combination with 500 ng of RNase-free plasmid DNA according to the protocol of the supplier. For silencing in HBV-replicating HuH-7 cells, the cells were first transfected with siRNAs and pHBV for 2 days, and the transfection with siRNAs was repeated for another 2 days. Four siRNAs directed against γ2-adaptin were designed by and obtained from Qiagen (4-for-Silencing kit) with the following sequences: #121 corresponds to the γ2-adaptin target at nucleotide positions 359-379 (AAGGCCTGGCCTTGTGCACTT), #287 is directed against positions 832-852 (AACACGGACACCAGCCGAAAT), #689 corresponds to positions 2064-2084 (AAAACCCTGCTTTGCTGTTAA), and #690 targets nucleotide positions 2065-2085 (AAACCCTGCTTTGCTGTTAAT). A nonsense control siRNA (Qiagen) with no known homology to mammalian genes was used for control transfection experiments. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation Procedures—To probe for protein expression and release into the extracellular medium, transfected cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 20 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g and 4 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using standard procedures. Where indicated, the culture supernatants of transfected cells were analyzed in addition. For γ2-adaptin-specific coimmunoprecipitation studies, cells were lysed with a 2% solution of the non-denaturating detergent CHAPS-Hepes-buffered saline (50 mm Hepes-KCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl), supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Serva) for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation, lysates were precleared with a 10% suspension of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. The lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using 50 μl of a 10% protein A-Sepharose slurry that had been precoated with 10 μl of the core particle-specific αK45 antiserum. After incubation for 4 h at 4°C, immune complexes were washed three times with 0.5% CHAPS-Hepes-buffered saline and once with 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Total protein extracts were included on the gels as controls. To probe for Nedd4/core-complex formation, cells were broken by Dounce homogenization (30 strokes) in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, plus protease inhibitors). Extracts were adjusted to 50 mm NaCl and subjected to centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to sediment nuclei, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was then precleared with protein A-Sepharose and subjected to a core-specific immunoprecipitation exactly as described above. Detection of Intracellular HBV Nucleocapsids and Extracellular Virions—For replication of HBV in HuH-7 cells, plasmid pHBV was used. 3-4 days after transfection, intracellular nucleocapsids and extracellular virions were isolated by capsid- or envelope-specific immunoprecipitations, respectively, prior to detection of the encapsidated viral progeny DNA by radioactive labeling of the partially double-stranded genome with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by the endogenous polymerase as described previously (18Loffler-Mary H. Dumortier J. Klentsch-Zimmer C. Prange R. Virology. 2000; 270: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After extraction of the labeled DNA genomes from the immunoprecipitated samples, they were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Images were quantitated with ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, the viral progeny DNA was detected on dot blots. To this aim, an EcoRI-linearized unit-length HBV genome was labeled with digoxygenin-dUTP by random priming as instructed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). After extraction of the DNA genomes from the immunoprecipitated samples as described above, they were denatured by boiling in 0.4 m NaOH, 10 mm EDTA and filtered with a dot-blot manifold (Schleicher & Schüll) onto nylon membranes. The membrane was baked at 120 °C for 30 min and hybridized with the labeled probe according to the Roche Applied Science DIG DNA labeling and detection kit. Pull-down Assays—For ubiquitin pull-down assays, HuH-7 cells were lysed in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes-KCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture) 3 days post-transfection. Cleared lysates were immediately incubated with 50-μl aliquots of protein A-agarose (Sigma) or ubiquitin-agarose (Sigma) that had been prewashed 3× with assay buffer. Samples were reacted for 4 h at 4 °C with rocking in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Precipitates were then washed 3× with 25 mm Hepes-KCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, once with 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and subjected to HA-specific immunoblotting. For GST pull-down experiments, wild-type GST and the GST fusion of γ2-adaptin.14-533 (GST-γ2.14-533) plasmids were expressed in transformed E. coli DH5α cells. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30°C, and cells were lysed by sonification in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The GST proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Beads loaded with 20 μg of recombinant proteins were equilibrated in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes-KCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate) and incubated with 20 μg of recombinant core particles that were produced in E. coli as described above (see “Antibodies”). After rotation at 4 °C for 4 h, the beads were washed 3× with 25 mm Hepes-KCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, once with 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and subjected to core-specific immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells grown on coverslips were fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol containing 2 mm EGTA for 15 min at -20 °C. After washing and blocking for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% goat serum, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-L or anti-core particle rabbit antiserum, anti-HA rat antibody, or anti-CD63 mouse antibody) for 1 h at 37°C, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with AlexaFluor-tagged secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Following washing and mounting of the cells, images were captured on a Zeiss deconvolution microscopy system operated by AxioVision software (Zeiss) using a 100× (numerical aperture 1.25) oil immersion objective. The system included an AxioCamHR digital camera mounted on an Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope. Seven optical sections along the Z axis were acquired with increments of 0.35 μm. The fluorescent data sets were processed by three-dimensional deconvolution with the InverseFilter method to generate optical sections of the data sets. Adobe Photoshop CS software was used for additional processing of the images. Depletion of γ2-Adaptin Inhibits HBV Viral Particle Release—Previous experiments in our laboratory demonstrated that the HBV L envelope protein specifically interacts with γ2-adaptin by complex formation depending on the ear domain of γ2-adaptin and a preS-specific subdomain of L, known to be essential for capsid envelopment (22Hartmann-Stuhler C. Prange R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5343-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To probe whether γ2-adaptin actually plays a role in virus replication, we sought to deplete it from HBV-producing cells. By testing four different small interfering RNAs (RNAi) for their capacity to reduce the expression of γ2-adaptin, two molecules directed against C-terminal sequences of γ2-adaptin (#689 and #690) proved to be effective, while the two other siRNAs with targets in the N-terminal protein domain (#121 and #287) did not deplete γ2-adaptin (Supplemental Fig. S1). Because the #690 molecule turned out to be the most effective siRNA, it was chosen for the silencing analyses. Human hepatoma HuH-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with an expression vector carrying a cloned, replication-competent HBV genome (pHBV, HBV replicon) together with the siRNA #690 or a nonsense control siRNA (control). Of note, transfected liver cell lines support the production of infectious virions, but are refractory to the uptake of progeny HBV particles (30Cooper A. Paran N. Shaul Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of the cells showed that the 90-kDa γ2-adaptin protein had been down-regulated >70% in siRNA #690-transfected cells as compared with mock treated cells (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, neither the intracellular level of the viral L envelope protein nor that of the core protein was affected (Fig. 1A). This indicated that the synthesis, stability, and/or half-lives of the viral envelope and capsid substructures were independent of γ2-adaptin function. We next assayed the depleted cells for the production and release of virions using immunoprecipitation of cellular supernatants with envelope-specific antisera, radioactive labeling of the partially double-stranded HBV genome by the viral endogenous polymerase, and detection of the genome by gel electrophoresis. In parallel, intracellular nucleocapsid assembly was investigated using core particle-specific antibodies for immunoprecipitation of cellular lysates prior to the endogenous polymerase reaction (EPR). As shown in Fig. 1A, nucleocapsid assembly within the cells was virtually unaffected, irrespective of whether γ2-adaptin was knocked down or not. By contrast, the degree of virion release into the medium of silenced cells was significantly reduced. Triplicate analyses and quantification determinations revealed a close correlation between the level of γ2-adaptin inhibition (74 ± 3.4%) and the suppression of HBV export (49 ± 5.2%) in such that an enhanced depletion of γ2-adaptin corresponded to a progressive depletion of virus release. The analysis of the two non-silencing siRNAs #121 and #287 and the other silencing molecule #689 supported this notion, because it established an excellent correlation between depletion of γ2-adaptin and HBV production (Supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that γ2-adaptin mediates one or more productive steps in the late stages of HBV assembly and/or egress. Depletion of γ2-Adaptin Does Not Inhibit Protein Secretion—The route of HBV egress is unclear as yet but has been suggested to involve the constitutive pathway of secretion (14Huovila A.P. Eder A.M. Fuller S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Be"
https://openalex.org/W2087612672,"ATP-binding cassette transporters G5 and G8 are half-transporters expressed on the apical membranes of enterocytes and hepatocytes that limit intestinal uptake and promote secretion of neutral sterols. Genetic defects that inactivate either half-transporter cause accumulation of cholesterol and plant sterols, resulting in premature coronary atherosclerosis. These observations suggest that G5 and G8 promote the translocation of sterols across membranes, but the primary transport substrate of the G5G8 complex has not been directly determined. Here we report the development of a sterol transfer assay using “inside-out” membrane vesicles from Sf9 cells expressing recombinant mouse G5 and G8. Radiolabeled cholesterol or sitosterol was transferred from donor liposomes to G5- and G8-containing membrane vesicles in an ATP-dependent and vanadate-sensitive manner; net transfer of cholesterol was associated with an increase in vesicular cholesterol mass. CTP, GTP, and UTP, as well as ATP, supported transfer but with lesser efficiency (ATP ≫ CTP > GTP > UTP). Transfer was specific for sterols and was stereoselective; minimal ATP-dependent and vanadate-sensitive transfer of cholesteryl oleate, phosphatidylcholine, or enantiomeric cholesterol was observed. These studies indicate that G5 and G8 are sufficient for reconstitution of sterol transfer activity in vitro and provide the first demonstration that sterols are direct transport substrates of the G5 and G8 heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W2044626994,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) belongs to the SLC6 family of sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporters responsible for uptake of amino acids and biogenic amines from extracellular spaces. Their activities and subcellular distributions are regulated by various cellular mechanisms, including interactions with other proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid approach we screened a human brain cDNA library and identified secretory carrier membrane protein 2 (SCAMP2) as a novel SERT-interacting protein. GST-pulldown assays confirmed the physical interaction between SCAMP2 and the N-terminal domain of SERT. In addition, SERT was found to form a complex with SCAMP2 as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation from a heterologous expression system and from rat brain homogenate. Co-expression of SERT and SCAMP2 in mammalian cells results in the subcellular redistribution of SERT with a decrease in cell surface SERT and a concomitant reduction in 5-HT uptake activity. Using confocal microscopy we show that in neuronal cells endogenous SERT co-localizes with SCAMP2 in discrete structures also containing the lipid raft marker flotillin-1 and the SNARE protein syntaxin 1A. In contrast, SERT immunoreactivity is clearly segregated from transferrin receptor-containing endosomes. A single amino acid mutation, cysteine-201 to alanine, within the conserved cytoplasmic E peptide of SCAMP2, abolished SCAMP2-mediated down-regulation of SERT, although this mutation had no effect on the physical interaction between SERT and SCAMP2. Taken together, our results suggest that SCAMP2 plays an important role in the regulation of the subcellular distribution of SERT.

The serotonin transporter (SERT) 2The abbreviations used are: SERT, serotonin transporter; SCAMP, secretory carrier membrane protein; 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine; DAT, dopamine transporter; NET, norepinephrine transporter; GAT, γ-aminobutyric acid transporter; GLYT, glycine transporter; PKC, protein kinase C; TfR, transferrin receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney. is an integral plasma membrane glycoprotein that regulates serotoninergic neurotransmission through the reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) from the synapse. SERT is of particular clinical and pharmacological interest as it has been implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as several dysfunctions in the periphery (1Murphy D.L. Lerner A. Rudnick G. Lesch K.P. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). It is the primary target for a number of widely prescribed antidepressants and is also the site of action for drugs of abuse (2Schloss P. Williams D.C. J. Psychopharmacol. 1998; 12: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 3Iversen L. Mol. Psychiatry. 2000; 5: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), including methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) and cocaine (4Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1817-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 5Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 421-426PubMed Google Scholar). SERT belongs to the SLC6 family of sodium- and chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, which also include for example transporters for dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), γ-aminobutyric acid (GAT), and glycine (GLYT1 and GLYT2) (6Chen N.H. Reith M.E. Quick M.W. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These transporters share a number of structural features, such as 12 membrane-spanning domains, a large extracellular loop containing multiple glycosylation sites and cytoplasmic N and C termini. The transport capacity of neurotransmitter transporters is influenced both by the number of transporter molecules present at the cell surface and by the intrinsic activity of individual transporter molecules (7Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 8Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For instance, SERT is known to undergo acute down-regulation in response to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (9Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This down-regulation involves the redistribution of the transporter from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments. In contrast, protein kinase G (PKG) activation has been shown to cause an up-regulation of both SERT activity and SERT cell surface abundance (10Zhu C.B. Hewlett W.A. Feoktistov I. Biaggioni I. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1462-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggest that the subcellular distribution of neurotransmitter transporters is also regulated through direct interaction with specific proteins. For example, the t-SNARE protein syntaxin 1A is involved in the trafficking and PKC-dependent regulation of SERT and related transporters (11Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6103-6112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Quick M.W. Neuron. 2003; 40: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Geerlings A. Nunez E.

Schroeter S. Quick M.W. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the monoamine transporters SERT, DAT, and NET exist in signaling complexes containing the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, an interaction that is destabilized by activation of PKC (15Bauman A.L. Apparsundaram S. Ramamoorthy S. Wadzinski B.E. Vaughan R.A. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid approach has been used to identify several proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domains of the monoamine transporters. For instance, the PKC substrate MacMARCKS was isolated as a binding partner of the C terminus of SERT (16Jess U. El Far O. Kirsch J. Betz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Another PKC substrate, the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1 was found to interact with the C terminus of monoamine transporters and seems to enhance their cell surface expression (17Torres G.E. Yao W.D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid approach to search for novel serotonin transporter interacting proteins we have identified several proteins that appear to affect the subcellular distribution of SERT. Here we report the identification and characterization of SCAMP2 as a novel SERT-binding protein. SCAMP2 belongs to a family of proteins that function as carriers to the cell surface in post-Golgi recycling pathways (18Brand S.H. Castle J.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3753-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Brand S.H. Laurie S.M. Mixon M.B. Castle J.D. J. Biol.

SCAMPs are integral membrane proteins containing four transmembrane helices. Highly conserved regions include a small segment between transmembrane helices 2 and 3, the so-called E peptide, which has been shown to play a critical role for the function of SCAMP2 (21Hubbard C. Singleton D. Rauch M. Jayasinghe S. Cafiso D. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2933-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with a role for SCAMP2 in the regulation of the subcellular distribution of SERT. Reagents—The polyclonal goat C-20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), recognizing the C-terminal domain of SERT was used for the detection of SERT by Western blotting as well as for co-immunoprecipitation from transfected HEK-293 cells. For co-immunoprecipitation from rat brain homogenates a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the fourth extracellular loop of SERT, denoted anti-SERT(EL4), 3C. G. Tate, S. Wynne, and F. Magnani, unpublished data. was found to be most suitable. This antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Christopher Tate, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, UK). For multilabeling confocal microscopy experiments the EL4 anti-serum or a commercial monoclonal mouse anti-SERT antibody (AB-N09, Advanced Targeting Systems), which was raised against a similar epitope, were used depending on the compatibility with other antibodies used in a particular experiment. Additional antibodies used here were goat anti-SCAMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-transferrin receptor (TfR, Zymed Laboratories), mouse anti-flotillin-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-TGN38 (Affinity BioReagents), as well as mouse anti-syntaxin 1A and mouse anti-β-actin, both from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Genetic screens using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system were performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech). cDNA fragments encoding N-terminal and C-terminal domains of hSERT were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in pGBKT7-BD and transformed into the yeast strain AH109. AH109 expressing the bait was then mated with the Y187 yeast strain pre-transformed with a human brain cDNA library constructed in the pACT2-AD vector. Mated yeast cells were first grown on low stringency selection plates (-Leu, -Trp, -His) and then on high stringency selection plates (-Leu, -Trp, -His, -Ade). Colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity and DNA from positive clones encoding putative interacting proteins were rescued from yeast cells and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells. The identities of the clones were analyzed by automated DNA sequencing and compared against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data base using the BLAST search program. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 international units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RN46A-B14 cells (22Eaton M.J. Whittemore S.R. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 140: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (provided by Prof. Scott Whittemore, Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY) were cultured at 33 °C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 250 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Transient transfections were performed using Genejuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were processed 30-72 h after transfection. For all transfection experiments, pcDNA3 vector was used to equalize total DNA input. RT-PCR—The cells were cultured to confluency in a 10-cm dish and total RNA was isolated using TRI-reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA was treated with DNase (Invitrogen) prior to cDNA synthesis. cDNA was synthesized from 1.0 μg of total RNA using Reverse Transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers (Promega) and subsequently amplified by PCR using specific primers and DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Constructs—The coding region of hSERT was previously cloned from human placenta and inserted into the pcDNA3 vector, denoted hSERT (23Mortensen O.V. Thomassen M. Larsen M.B. Whittemore S.R. Wiborg O. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 68: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To obtain the full-length cDNA encoding SCAMP2, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA isolated from HEK-293 cells and subjected to PCR using appropriate primer pairs containing HindIII or NotI restriction sites. The PCR fragment was digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) resulting in the construct pcDNA3:hSCAMP2. Alanine substitutions were introduced into pcDNA3:hSCAMP2 at cysteine 201 (C201A) and tryptophan 202 (W202A) using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequence of all constructs was verified by automated sequencing. Western Blotting—Protein samples were prepared by incubating transfected HEK-293 cells with lysis buffer (5 mm CHAPS or 1% Triton X-100 in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 125 mm dithiothreitol), resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) or nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma). Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20) and probed with the primary antibodies: goat anti-SERT (C-20) (1:1,000), goat anti-SCAMP2 (1:1,000), mouse anti-β-actin (1:5,000), mouse-anti flotillin-1 (1:2,000), mouse anti-TfR (1:500), or mouse anti-syntaxin 1A (1:2,000), followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody: anti-goat antibody (1:20,000) or anti-mouse antibody (1:2,500). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL Western blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal west femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). When needed, blots were stripped (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C, washed twice with TBS-T, reblocked in 5% dry milk, and probed with antibody. Preparation of Rat Brain Extract—One adult rat brain was homogenized in 10% (w/v) of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) to which a protease inhibitor mixture (1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture) was added. Total homogenate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer containing 5 mm CHAPS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered and used for immunoprecipitation experiments. GST Pulldown and Immunoprecipitation—For GST pulldown assays PCR fragments corresponding to the N-terminal domain of hSERT (residues 1-108, N-SERT), the C-terminal domain of hSERT (residues 577-630, C-SERT), and the N-terminal domain of hDAT (residues 1-89, N-DAT) were fused to GST by subcloning into the pGEX-KG bacterial expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. Fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography, using glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 20 μg of GST or GST fusion protein, immobilized to glutathione-agarose, were incubated with 500 μg of total protein (prepared in 5 mm CHAPS lysis buffer) from transfected HEK-293 cells. The agarose was washed three times in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer. For co-immunoprecipitation assays on transfected HEK-293 cells, 500 μg of total protein (prepared in 5 mm CHAPS lysis buffer) was incubated with 1 μg of control goat IgG or 1 μg of anti-SERT (C-20). Co-immunoprecipitation on rat brain extract was performed by incubating 1 mg of total protein with 10 μl of anti-SERT (EL4) antiserum or 10 μl of rabbit non-immune serum for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured by incubating with protein G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed three times with 5 mm CHAPS lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted in SDS-sample buffer. 5-[3H]HT Uptake Assay—HEK-293 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected 20 h before they were trypsinized and seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated (0.1 mg/ml) 24-well plates. The cells were grown for a further 48 h before uptake assay was performed. Medium was removed from the cells by aspiration, and the cells were washed once with TB buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) and further incubated in TB buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. The uptake assay was performed at room temperature and started by the addition of 5-[3H]HT and terminated 6 min later by three washes of ice-cold TB containing 1 μm paroxetine. Cells were solubilized with OptiPhase scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 5-[3H]HT accumulation was quantified using a 1450 Microbeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specific 5-[3H]HT uptake was determined by subtracting the amount of 5-[3H]HT accumulated in the presence of 10 μm paroxetine. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0 software package using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear regression analysis. Cell Surface Biotinylation—The cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS2+ (PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2) and incubated in 1.0 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS2+ on ice for 30 min with gentle agitation. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold quench buffer (100 mm glycine in PBS2+) and incubated for a further 30 min in quench buffer on ice. The cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS2+, lysed in 1% Triton X-100 prepared in PBS2+, and incubated with NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, and bound (biotinylated) proteins were eluted in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting and quantified with Gene Tools Image Analysis Software (Syngene). Lipid Raft Isolation by Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation— One adult rat brain was homogenized to 10% (w/v) in TNE buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors (1× Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture) by 15 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer containing 2% Brij-58 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The sample was then homogenized again before centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatant (0.5 ml) was mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose in TNE, transferred into an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid successively with 1 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose and 0.5 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged for 17 h at 134,400 × g in a Beckman Coulter Optimal L-100 XP ultracentrifuge using a SW55Ti swing-out rotor. Eight fractions of 312 μl each were collected from the top of the gradient and processed for Western blotting. Confocal Microscopy—RN46A-B14 cells or transfected HEK-293 cells were grown on glass coverslips to 60-70% confluence. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.5, for 10 min at room temperature. Residual fixative was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. Cells were incubated with blocking solution (0.2% Triton X-100, 5% donkey serum in PBS) at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed extensively in PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were mounted onto microscope slides in 2 μg/μl p-phenylenediamine in 1:1 glycerol:PBS. Samples were imaged on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope. HEK-293 cells were incubated with goat anti-SCAMP2 (1:250) and either mouse anti-SERT (AB-N09) (1:100) or rabbit anti-SERT(EL4) (1:250). RN46A cells were incubated with rabbit anti-SERT (EL4) (1:100) and goat anti-SCAMP2 (1:100). Organelle markers were all used at a dilution of 1:100. Secondary antibodies were used as follows: for SERT, anti-rabbit-FITC or anti-mouse-Texas Red; for SCAMP2, anti-goat-FITC or anti-goat-Cy™5. Anti-mouse-Texas Red was used for all organelle marker antibodies. All fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:2,000. Identification of SCAMP2 as a SERT-binding Protein—To search for novel SERT-interacting proteins, we performed several yeast two-hybrid screens with a human brain cDNA library using the cytoplasmic domains of human SERT as bait. A number of clones encoding SCAMP2 were isolated. The physical interaction between SCAMP2 and the N-terminal domain of SERT was confirmed by GST pulldown assay in which a fusion protein of GST and the N-terminal domain of SERT (N-SERT), but neither GST alone nor a C-terminal construct of SERT (C-SERT), were able to bind SCAMP2 from transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1A). In addition, we found that SCAMP2 also interacts with the N-terminal domain of DAT (N-DAT) (Fig. 1A). We subsequently carried out immunoprecipitation experiments to confirm the interaction between SCAMP2 and SERT. Initial experiments were performed in transfected HEK-293 cells using the anti-SERT (C-20) antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, SCAMP2 co-immunoprecipitated with SERT in lysates prepared from cells expressing both SERT and SCAMP2, but was not detected in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing SCAMP2 alone, or when using control IgG. Further investigation showed that endogenous SCAMP2 and SERT also associate in rat brain tissue. Membrane fractions from rat brain were solubilized, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-SERT (EL4) antiserum or control non-immune serum. As shown in Fig. 1C, SCAMP2 co-immunoprecipitated with SERT when using anti-SERT (EL4), whereas no proteins were precipitated using control serum. Overexpression of SCAMP2 Causes a Reduction of SERT-mediated 5-HT Uptake in HEK-293 Resulting from a Cellular Redistribution of SERT—The effect of SCAMP2 on SERT-mediated 5-HT uptake was assessed in HEK-293 cells. SCAMP2 is expressed endogenously at low levels in HEK-293 cells, and RNA from this cell line was in fact used in our laboratory to clone the full-length cDNA for SCAMP2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using RT-PCR we have shown that these cells also express small amounts of SCAMP3, but not SCAMP1 endogenously (data not shown). When increasing amounts of SCAMP2 (0-1 μg/well in a 6-well plate) were co-expressed with SERT (0.5 μg/well) 5-HT uptake activity was reduced by SCAMP2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The increasing expression of SCAMP2 did not affect the total levels of SERT as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). In cells transfected with SCAMP2 and SERT (in a ratio of 1:1), total 5-HT uptake activity was decreased by an average of 30% when compared with cells expressing SERT alone (Vmax values are 7.7 ± 0.4 pmol/min/106 cells in cells expressing SERT alone versus 5.4 ± 0.5 pmol/min/106 cells in cells expressing SERT and SCAMP2) (Fig. 2C). No significant changes in the Km values for 5-HT transport were observed (Km 814 ± 107 nm in cells expressing SERT alone versus 783 ± 193 nm in cells expressing SERT and SCAMP2). To establish whether the observed decrease in Vmax in the presence of SCAMP2 is paralleled by changes in the number of transporter molecules expressed on the cell surface, we performed cell surface biotinylation experiments on transfected HEK-293 cells. Surface proteins of cells transfected with SERT alone or in combination with SCAMP2 were biotinylated with the membrane impermeant biotinylation reagent sulfo-NHS-biotin. Cells were then solubilized and biotinylated proteins were collected with avidin beads. Equal volumes of total protein lysates and non-biotinylated (intracellular) protein and two to three times the volume of biotinylated (cell surface) protein were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-SERT (C-20) antibody (Fig. 3A). Blots were analyzed by densitometry, and the relative amounts of SERT were quantified taking into account the volumes used for each fraction. When SERT alone was transfected, cell surface and intracellular protein was distributed on average in a ratio of 30%:70%. When co-transfected with SCAMP2, the distribution of SERT changed to a ratio of 20%:80% cell surface versus intracellular protein. Thus, cell surface (biotinylated) SERT protein was decreases by approximately one third under conditions where total levels of transporter molecules remain unchanged. We also observed an increase in intracellular (non-biotinylated) protein equivalent to the expected values of ∼15% (Fig. 3B). Although this increase was consistently observed, it did not reach statistical significance, which is most likely caused by the small fractional difference to control values. Immunoblots were re-probed for β-actin, confirming that no intracellular proteins were labeled with biotin. Although SCAMPs were shown to localize at least to a certain extend to the plasma membrane (24Guo Z. Liu L. Cafiso D. Castle D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35357-35363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Liu L. Guo Z. Tieu Q. Castle A. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4266-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we were unable to biotinylate SCAMP2 under the conditions used (data not shown). This may be because of the fact that either the potential extracellular domains are very small, rendering them inaccessible for the biotinylation reagent, or because exposure of SCAMP2 to the cell surface is limited and/or transient (26Castle A. Castle D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3769-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Laurie S.M. Cain C.C. Lienhard G.E. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19110-19117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduction in SERT levels on the cell surface corresponds well with the changes in SERT uptake activity, suggesting that SCAMP2 exerts its effect by causing a redistribution of SERT. SERT and SCAMP2 Co-localize in HEK-293 Cells—Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to examine the subcellular steady-state localization of SERT and SCAMP2 in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 4A). In cells transfected with SERT alone, the transporter partially co-localized with endogenous SCAMP2 both at the cell surface in well-defined punctuate structures and in intracellular compartments. When overexpressing SCAMP2 in the absence of SERT, SCAMP2 exhibited an overall distribution similar to the endogenously expressed protein. In cells overexpressing both SERT and SCAMP2, SERT co-localized extensively with SCAMP2 in intracellular structures. Under these conditions it appears that the amount of SERT at the cell surface is diminished, but this apparent change in distribution cannot be easily quantified from confocal microscopy images, and is much better assessed by cell surface biotinylation as demonstrated in the previous paragraph. However, the extensive co-localization between SERT and SCAMP2 supports a direct role for SCAMP2 in regulating the subcellular distribution of SERT. The predominant intracellular accumulation of SERT and SCAMP2 led us to compare the staining pattern with the transferrin receptor (TfR), a marker of the general endocytic recycling pathway. We conducted triple labeling on cells overexpressing SERT and SCAMP2 (Fig. 4B) and while SERT almost completely co-localized with SCAMP2, there was very little overlap with the TfR immunoreactivity, which exhibited a punctuate staining throughout the cell. In summary, SERT appears to co-localize with SCAMP2 in discrete intracellular structures that are largely distinct from TfR-positive endosomes. Endogenous SERT Co-localizes with SCAMP2 in RN46A Cells—To further characterize the co-localization between SERT and SCAMP2 we examined the endogenous distribution of SER"
https://openalex.org/W2122640362,"Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), a member of the relaxin peptide family, is produced in testicular Leydig cells and ovarian thecal cells. Gene knock-out experiments have identified a key biological role in initiating testes descent during fetal development. Additionally, INSL3 has an important function in mediating male and female germ cell function. These actions are elicited via its recently identified receptor, LGR8, a member of the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor family. To identify the structural features that are responsible for the interaction of INSL3 with its receptor, its solution structure was determined by NMR spectroscopy together with in vitro assays of a series of B-chain alanine-substituted analogs. Synthetic human INSL3 was found to adopt a characteristic relaxin/insulin-like fold in solution but is a highly dynamic molecule. The four termini of this two-chain peptide are disordered, and additional conformational exchange is evident in the molecular core. Alanine-substituted analogs were used to identify the key residues of INSL3 that are responsible for the interaction with the ectodomain of LGR8. These include ArgB16 and ValB19, with HisB12 and ArgB20 playing a secondary role, as evident from the synergistic effect on the activity in double and triple mutants involving these residues. Together, these amino acids combine with the previously identified critical residue, TrpB27, to form the receptor binding surface.

Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3 4The abbreviations used are: INSL3, insulin-like peptide 3; LGR, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight; LH, luteinizing hormone; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy.; also known as relaxin-like factor and Leydig cell insulin-like peptide) was originally discovered and isolated as a cDNA clone from a boar testis cDNA library (1Burkhardt E. Adham I.M. Brosig B. Gastmann A. Mattei M.G. Engel W. Genomics. 1994; 20: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is primarily produced by prenatal and postnatal mature Leydig cells of the testis and the thecal cells of the ovary. Its primary structure showed it to be a bona fide member of the insulin-insulin-like growth factor-relaxin superfamily, which is now known to have a total of ten members in the human. Like insulin, INSL3 is firstly synthesized as a pre-prohormone precursor containing a signal peptide linked to B-C-A domains. It undergoes processing by hitherto unidentified proprotein convertases, resulting in the production of mature INSL3 consisting of a A-B heterodimer that is covalently linked by two interchain disulfide bonds and one intrachain disulfide bond (Fig. 1) (2Nef S. Parada L.F. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3075-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These disulfide bonds are essential for maintaining its expected characteristic insulin-like conformation and its unique biological activities (3Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16011-16015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The receptor for INSL3, LGR8, is a member of the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor family (4Kumagai J. Hsu S.Y. Matsumi H. Roh J.S. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31283-31286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It is closely related to the relaxin receptor, LGR7, and has been recently classified as relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptor, RXFP2 (5Bathgate R.A.D. Ivell R. Sanborn B.M. Sherwood O.D. Summers R.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 58: 7-31Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Importantly, relaxin peptides from some species can also bind to and activate LGR8, albeit with a lower affinity than INSL3 (5Bathgate R.A.D. Ivell R. Sanborn B.M. Sherwood O.D. Summers R.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 58: 7-31Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Male mice homozygous with targeted disruption of either the Insl3 or LGR8 gene exhibit bilateral cryptorchidism (6Nef S. Parada L.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 2: 295-299Crossref Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 7Zimmermann S. Steding G. Emmen J.M. Brinkmann A.O. Nayernia K. Holstein A.F. Engel W. Adham I.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 681-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a defect in testicular descent due to an abnormality in gubernacular development. In humans this is the most common congenital disorder during sexual differentiation, affecting ∼3-5% of newborn male infants (8Ivell R. Hartung S. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2003; 9: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It results in defective spermatogenesis, infertility, and an associated high risk for testicular malignancy. Female homozygous mice show impaired fertility associated with abnormal estrus cycle length (6Nef S. Parada L.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 2: 295-299Crossref Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the INSL3 protein in female mice causes the ovaries to descend into the inguinal region due to an overdeveloped gubernaculum (9Adham I.M. Steding G. Thamm T. Bullesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Paprotta I. Engel W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Synthetic INSL3 will induce the growth of the gubernaculum in whole organ cultures (10Smith K.J. Wade J.D. Claasz A.A. Otvos Jr., L. Temelcos C. Kubota Y. Hutson J.M. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A. J. Peptide Sci. 2001; 7: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hence the peptide is essential for the transabdominal phase of testicular descent where the gubernaculum proliferates and results in the migration of the testis to the inguinal region. More recent studies have uncovered prominent new roles for INSL3 in modulating both male and female germ cell function (11Kawamura K. Kumagai J. Sudo S. Chun S.Y. Pisarska M. Morita H. Toppari J. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In mammals it is well recognized that germ cell maturation is controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH). Oocyte maturation is induced by the pre-ovulatory surge of LH, and, in the testis, the survival of male germ cells is also controlled by LH. However, because LH acts on the follicular cells in the female and the Leydig cells of the male, and not on the germ cells directly, local paracrine factors are likely involved in direct regulation of germ cell maturation. It has now been demonstrated that LH acts on the ovarian theca and testicular Leydig cells to produce INSL3 (11Kawamura K. Kumagai J. Sudo S. Chun S.Y. Pisarska M. Morita H. Toppari J. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This INSL3 can then bind to the LGR8 receptor, which is present on the germ cells to activate the inhibitory G-protein (Gi) leading to decreased cAMP production. Hence, treatment with INSL3 initiated meiotic progression (as measured by germinal vesicle breakdown) in arrested oocytes in vitro and reversed the decrease in testis weight (caused by increased germ cell apoptosis), which is induced by a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist in vivo (11Kawamura K. Kumagai J. Sudo S. Chun S.Y. Pisarska M. Morita H. Toppari J. Fu P. Wade J.D. Bathgate R.A. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This significant finding demonstrates that INSL3 has a potential clinical application as a highly specific regulator of fertility. Furthermore, LGR8 antagonists have the potential to be highly specific contraceptives. Indeed, we recently demonstrated that LGR8 antagonists based on cyclic peptide mimetics of the INSL3 B-chain can mimic the effect of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist treatment in prepubertal rats, suggesting that direct antagonism of LGR8 function may be an effective contraceptive treatment (12Del Borgo M.P. Hughes R.A. Bathgate R.A. Lin F. Kawamura K. Wade J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13068-13074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The results of recent structure-function studies of INSL3 have shown that the primary receptor binding region resides within its B-chain. Analogs of INSL3 with modifications in the B-chain at positions 25 and 27 have shown that Trp27 is essential for characteristic INSL3 activity (13Büllesbach E.E. Schwabe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). More recently, our demonstration, that B-chain-only INSL3 peptides can bind to the primary ligand binding site in the ectodomain of LGR8 and act as antagonists (12Del Borgo M.P. Hughes R.A. Bathgate R.A. Lin F. Kawamura K. Wade J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13068-13074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), has highlighted that the B-chain contains the essential residues for primary binding. It has also enabled a detailed structure-activity relationship study of analogs of the linear peptide to be undertaken. The results showed that the minimum length required for binding was residues 11-27 and confirmed the critical importance of the Trp27 residue (12Del Borgo M.P. Hughes R.A. Bathgate R.A. Lin F. Kawamura K. Wade J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13068-13074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the basis of this information and to more precisely map the primary LGR8 receptor binding domain of human INSL3, we undertook its solution structure determination and correlated this with the LGR8 binding activation of INSL3 analogs with selected alanine substitutions in the B-chain. Solid-phase Peptide Synthesis—Human INSL3 and its analogs were synthesized using continuous flow Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-solid phase methodology together with regioselective disulfide bond formation as previously described (14Bathgate R.A.D. Ferraro T. Ma S. Zhao C. Gundlach A.L. Samuel C.S. Tregear G.W. Wade J.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Following sequential formation of the three disulfide bonds by oxidation, thiolysis, and iodolysis, respectively, the crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a gradient of CH3CN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The eight B-chain Ala-substituted INSL3 analogs that were prepared were: B12(His → Ala), B13(His → Ala), B16(Arg → Ala), B19(Val → Ala), B20(Arg → Ala), B12,16, B16,20, B12,16,20, and B12,16,19,20,27. Additionally, an INSL3 analog was prepared in which the B-chain was truncated by five residues from the C terminus; i.e. B1-26. Peptide Characterization—The purity of each synthetic peptide was assessed by analytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Bruker Autoflex II instrument (Bremen, Germany) in the linear mode at 19.5 kV. Peptides were quantitated by amino acid analysis of a 24-h acid hydrolyzate using a GBC Ltd. analyzer (Melbourne, Australia). Ligand Binding Assays—The method to study the binding of 125I-INSL3 to HEK-293T cells stably transfected with human LGR8 has been described previously (15Muda M. He C. Martini P.G. Ferraro T. Layfield S. Taylor D. Chevrier C. Schweickhardt R. Kelton C. Ryan P.L. Bathgate R.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2005; 11: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 125I-INSL3 was kindly provided by Prof. Pierre DeMeyts (Hegedorn Research Institute, Denmark). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of percent specific binding of triplicate determinations made from at least three independent experiments. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA), and a nonlinear regression one-site binding model was used to plot curves and calculate pKi values. Final pooled pKi data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance coupled with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test for multiple group comparison. Functional cAMP Assays—Receptor cAMP signaling was assessed using a cAMP reporter gene assay (16Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). 293T cells in 96-well plates were co-transfected with LGR8 and a pCRE-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (16Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) (courtesy of Dr. R. Cone) to assess the cAMP signaling response to INSL3 and INSL3 analogs. Co-transfected cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of INSL3 analogs for 6 h, after which the medium was aspirated and the cells were frozen at -80 °C overnight. The amount of cAMP-driven β-galactosidase expression in each well was determined by incubating the cells in 25 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm MgSO4, 0.01 mm MnCl2) for 10 min, 100 μl of assay buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for a further 10 min before 25 μl of enzyme substrate solution (1 mg/ml chlorophenol red β-d galactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science) in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm MnCl2) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 30 min. The absorbance of each well was determined at 570 nm using a Ceres UV900C plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). All experiments were repeated at least three times with triplicate determinations within each assay. Results are plotted as mean ± S.E. of percent normalized response compared with 1 nm INSL3. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance coupled with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test for multiple group comparison. NMR Spectroscopy—Pulsed-field gradient NMR diffusion experiments were performed with a two-dimensional sequence using stimulated echo longitudinal encode-decode (17Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar) as described previously (18Rosengren J. Lin F. Bathgate R.A.D. Tregear G.W. Daly N. Wade J.D. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5845-5851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Dioxane (0.2 mm) was used as the internal standard (19Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Samples prepared for structure determination contained ∼1mm of peptide dissolved in either 90% H2O and 10% D2O (v/v) or 100% (v/v) D2O at pH 4.0. Spectra were recorded at 290, 298, and 303 K on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer or on a Bruker DMX 750-MHz spectrometer. Two-dimensional experiments recorded included double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY), TOCSY (using an MLEV-17 spin lock sequence with a mixing time of 80 ms), and NOESY with mixing times of 100, 150, or 200 ms. Slowly exchanging NH protons were detected by acquiring a series of one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra immediately after dissolution in D2O. As most amides disappeared within the first 1 h, resonances still visible after 1 h were considered to be protected from the solvent by hydrogen bonding. These included LeuA12, SerA13, CysA15, LeuA20, LeuA21, ThrA22, LeuA23, CysA24, GluB7, LeuB9, ArgB16, AlaB17, LeuB18, ValB19, ArgB20, ValB21, and CysB24. Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker). Structure Calculations—Distance restraints were derived primarily from 150-ms NOESY spectra recorded at 298 K and 600 MHz in H2OorD2O. Cross-peaks were assigned and integrated in XEASY and converted to distance restraints using CYANA. Due to the generally broad lines of many amide protons, the 3JNH-Hα coupling constants were ambiguous. Thus, in most cases, broad φ angle restraints of -100 ± 80° were included, and then only for residues where a positive φ angle could be excluded based on a strong sequential Hαi-1-HNi NOE compared with the intra residual Hαi-HNi NOE. Side-chain χ1 angles and stereospecific assignments were determined on the basis of observed NOE and 3JHα-Hβ coupling patterns. Hydrogen bonds were included into the structure calculations for all amide protons concluded to be slow exchanging once a suitable acceptor could be identified in the preliminary structures. Three-dimensional structures were calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols from ARIA (20Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol.

Briefly the protocol involves a high temperature phase comprising 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics, a cooling phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature is lowered to 0 K, and finally an energy minimization phase comprising 5000 steps of Powell minimization. The subsequent refinement in explicit water involves heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics followed by 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K, before a cooling phase where the temperature is lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Finally, the structures were minimized with 2000 steps of Powell minimization. The coordinates representing the solution structure of INSL3 have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank and given the accession number 2H8B. Synthesis of Human INSL3 and Analogs—Human INSL3 has previously been successfully prepared in our laboratories by random combination of each of the A- and B-chains at high pH (22Fu P. Layfield S. Ferraro T. Tomiyama H. Hutson J. Otvos Jr., L. Tregear G.W. Bathgate R.A.D. Wade J.D. J. Peptide Res. 2004; 63: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Although overall yields were good, equivalent yields but with an easier scale-up were obtained by a regioselective disulfide bond formation approach. The nine B-chain Ala-substituted INSL3 analogs were also made by the same method and in good yield. Each peptide was comprehensively chemically characterized including by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (see supplementary material) and its high purity confirmed. NMR Diffusion Measurements—Translational diffusion measurements using pulsed-field gradient experiments with dioxane (hydrodynamic radius 2.12 Å) as an internal standard were used to assess the aggregation state of INSL3 in solution. On the basis of the equation derived by Wilkins et al. (19Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) (Rh = (4.75 ± 1.11)N0.29±0.02, where N is the number of residues in the protein and Rh is the hydrodynamic radius in Angstroms) the expected hydrodynamic radii for a monomer (57 amino acids) and a dimer (114 amino acids) of INSL3 are 15.3 and 18.8 Å, respectively. The experimental hydrodynamic radius of INSL3 was found to be 16.7 Å at both 0.1 and 1 mm, confirming that there is no concentration-dependent aggregation. Although this value is a little higher than expected for a monomer, given the identical diffusion coefficients at the two concentrations this likely reflects a less compact structure rather than any aggregation. NMR Assignments and Structure Determination of INSL3—For the structure determination of INSL3, extensive two-dimensional NMR data were recorded at 600 and 750 MHz. Although the signals were well dispersed indicative of a folded structure a large number of residues had significantly broadened resonances. Despite this broadening it was possible to achieve resonance assignments using two-dimensional sequential assignment strategies. For the amide protons of residues AlaA7, ArgA8, CysA11, SerA13, GlyA14, and PheB14, the broadening of the amide signals was so severe that they could not be detected. However, the side-chain resonances from these residues were assigned based on their patterns in the aliphatic region of the TOCSY spectrum, and the assignments were confirmed by sequential as well as medium and long range NOEs. A number of other residues had broadened signals, including CysA10, CysA15, ThrA16, GluB7, LysB8, LeuB9, CysB10, GlyB11, and HisB12, confirming that INSL3 undergoes considerable conformational exchange in solution. Furthermore, minor conformations appeared to be present for several residues, as evident from “brothering” of signals. This is in agreement with what has previously been seen for H3 relaxin in solution, confirming that peptides of the relaxin family are quite flexible. To assess whether the structure or dynamic processes in INSL3 were affected by solution conditions, spectra were recorded in the pH range 2.7-7.4 (supplementary data). Although in general resonance broadening was increased at higher pH as a result of faster solvent exchange, no significant changes in Hα chemical shifts or changes in the prevalence of minor conformations were observed as a function of pH. INSL3 contains five Pro residues of which one is the N-terminal residue of the B-chain. The other four are all in the trans conformation, as evident from strong sequential Hαi-1-Hδi NOEs, respectively. Structural restraints in the form of distance restraints based on NOE cross-peak intensities, backbone and side-chain dihedral angle restraints derived from coupling constants and NOE patterns, and hydrogen bonds derived from amide-exchange data were used to calculate the structure of INSL3. Structures were calculated by simulated annealing followed by refinement and energy minimization in a water shell. Ambiguous cross-peaks were subsequently assigned based on preliminary structures. Although most amides exchanged within minutes a number were still visible after 1 h. Because these were all found to be consistent with the hydrogen bond patterns of the elements of secondary structure in preliminary structures, they were included as restraints in the calculations. Description of the Three-dimensional Structure of Human INSL3—Fig. 2 shows a superimposition of the family of 20 structures representing the solution structure of INSL3. It is clear that INSL3 adopts a typical relaxin/insulin fold with a well defined core but with several distorted regions. The structural statistics (summarized in Table 1) show that the structures are in good agreement with the experimental data and have favorable covalent geometry. The A-chain comprises two parallel α-helical regions (residues A5-A12 and A17-A24) separated by an extended segment (residues A14-A16). The latter forms a small β-sheet by hydrogen bonding to the B-chain segment B6-B8. The B-chain contains a longer helical segment, which spans residues B12-B22 and is oriented across the face of the two A-chain helices. The fold is cross-braced by the A10-A15, A11-B10, and A24-B22 disulfide bonds, which hold the peptide chains together around a hydrophobic core comprising the side chains of ProA6, CysA10, CysA15, LeuA20, LeuA23, CysA24, LeuB9, CysB10, PheB14, IleB15, AlaB17, LeuB18, and CysB22.As evident from the overlay of the family of INSL3 structures, both N termini (A1-A4 and B1-B5) are disordered and appear to be flexible in solution, consistent with a lack of medium and long range NOEs as well as chemical shifts close to random coil values. The orientations of the C-terminal tails of both chains, which extend away from the helical segments, are also poorly defined. Interestingly, although in the B-chain C-terminal tail there are few NOEs associated with the peptide backbone and only small deviations from random coil chemical shifts, a number of NOEs can be seen between the TrpB27 side chain and LeuB18, ValB19, and the CysA24-CysB22 disulfide bond, suggesting that the tail can wrap around and interact with this part of the molecule. We recently reported such an interaction for H3 relaxin, but in that case the tail appeared to have a well defined conformation. In INSL3 these interactions appear to be transient, with the Trp and the rest of the tail being mobile in solution. Further evidence for this proposal is the presence of a minor conformation observed for TyrA26 whose aromatic side chain displays similar NOEs to LeuB18 and ValB19. This interaction would not be possible if the Trp B27 side chain permanently interacted with and thus prevented the interaction of LeuB18 and ValB19 with other residues.TABLE 1NMR and refinement statistics for the NMR structure of INSL3NMR distance & dihedral constraintsDistance constraintsTotal inter-residue NOE430Sequential (|i - j| = 1)200Medium range (|i - j| ≤ 4)140Long range (|i - j| ≥ 5)90Hydrogen bonds28 (for 14 H-bonds)Total dihedral angle restraintsphi16chi-111Structure statisticsViolationsDistance constraints (>0.3 Å)0.3 ± 0.6Dihedral angle constraints (>3°)0Maximum distance constraint violation (Å)0.33Maximum dihedral angle constraint violation (°)2.9Deviations from idealized geometryBond lengths (Å)0.00412 ± 0.00022Bond angles (°)0.66 ± 0.18Impropers (°)0.49 ± 0.03Average pairwise root mean square deviationaPairwise root mean square deviation was calculated among 20 refined structures over residues A6-24 and B6-B22.

Open table in a new tab Effects of B-chain Alanine Substitutions on LGR8 Binding and Activation—Alanine substituted INSL3 analogs were tested for their ability to compete with 125I-INSL3 binding to HEK-293T cells stably transfected with LGR8. Additionally, selected INSL3 analogs were tested for their ability to stimulate cAMP accumulation in LGR8-transfected cells. INSL3 bound to LGR8 with high affinity (pKi = 9.34 ± 0.02) and activated cAMP accumulation with high efficacy (pEC50 = 10.24 ± 0.12) (Table 2)in a similar manner to that previously described (12Del Borgo M.P.

INSL3 analogs with single Ala substitutions at HisB12, HisB13, or ArgB20 did not change LGR8 binding affinity. In contrast, analogs with single Ala substitutions at either ArgB16 (pKi = 8.49 ± 0.09; p < 0.001) or ValB19 (pKi = 8.36 ± 0.11; p < 0.001) did exhibit decreased binding affinity relative to INSL3 (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Interestingly, analogs with pairs of Ala substitutions (HisB12 plus ArgB16,pKi = 7.81 ± 0.04; ArgB16 plus ArgB20, pKi = 7.82 ± 0.14) resulted in a decreased affinity compared with the single ArgB16 Ala-substituted analog (p < 0.001). An analog with three Ala substitutions (HisB12, ArgB16, and ArgB20) resulted in a further decrease in affinity (pKi = 7.33 ± 0.07) (p < 0.001) compared with the double Ala-substituted analog (Fig. 3B and Table 2). Hence, although substitution of either HisB12 or ArgB20 alone for Ala does not affect LGR8 binding, it appears that they somehow cooperate with ArgB16 for optimal binding of INSL3 to LGR8. We also examined a B1-26 truncated INSL3 analog in our binding assays and found"

Although the molecular and cellular bases of PrPSc-induced neuropathogenesis are not yet fully understood, increasing evidence supports the view that PrPSc accumulation interferes with PrPC normal function(s) in neurons. In the present work, we exploit the properties of PrP-(106-126), a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 106-126 of PrP, to investigate into the mechanisms sustaining prion-associated neuronal damage. This peptide shares many physicochemical properties with PrPSc and is neurotoxic in vitro and in vivo. We examined the impact of PrP-(106-126) exposure on 1C11 neuroepithelial cells, their neuronal progenies, and GT1-7 hypothalamic cells. This peptide triggers reactive oxygen species overflow, mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2), and SAPK (p38 and JNK1/2) sustained activation, and apoptotic signals in 1C11-derived serotonergic and noradrenergic neuronal cells, while having no effect on 1C11 precursor and GT1-7 cells. The neurotoxic action of PrP-(106-126) relies on cell surface expression of PrPC, recruitment of a PrPC-Caveolin-Fyn signaling platform, and overstimulation of NADPH-oxidase activity. Altogether, these findings provide actual evidence that PrP-(106-126)-induced neuronal injury is caused by an amplification of PrPC-associated signaling responses, which notably promotes oxidative stress conditions. Distorsion of PrPC signaling in neuronal cells could hence represent a causal event in transmissible spongiform encephalopathy pathogenesis.

All of these fatal affections are characterized by widespread neuronal dysfunction and loss, spongiosis, and accumulation of PrPSc, the pathological isoform of a host-encoded prion protein (PrPC).PrPC is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein mainly expressed at the cell surface of neurons. Conformational conversion of PrPC into PrPSc lies at the root of prion diseases (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5088) Google Scholar). However, the causal link between TSE neuropathology and PrPSc accumulation remains enigmatic. Expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored PrPC at the cell surface of neurons appears to be an essential requirement for PrPSc to exert its toxicity (3Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A.

Indeed, neuronal depletion of PrPC in infected mice hinders TSE-associated neuronal injury, whereas abundant PrPSc accumulation still occurs in glial cells (5Mallucci G. Dickinson A. Linehan J. Klohn P.C. Brandner S. Collinge J. Science. 2003; 302: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In addition, neurons from transgenic mice expressing a prion protein lacking the glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety are not vulnerable to PrPSc (4Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar).It is currently suspected that prion pathology involves alterations of normal PrPC function(s) as a result of the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc. Observations that PrP null (PrP-/-) mice exhibit only minor phenotypic abnormalities and that PrPC depletion in neurons of adult mice results in healthy animals, with no evidence of neuronal loss (6Mallucci G. Collinge J. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2004; 17: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), argue against the idea that PrPC loss of function would be a major cause of prion-induced neurodegeneration (7Hetz C. Maundrell K. Soto C. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 237-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Instead, in a gain of function hypothesis, prion pathology could arise from a PrPSc-induced overflow of PrPC-coupled signals that normally take part in neuron homeostasis.Evidence supporting a role for PrPC in cell signaling has come from our previous studies showing that, in fully differentiated 1C115-HT serotonergic or 1C11NE noradrenergic neuronal cells derived from the 1C11 neuroectodermal cell line, antibodymediated cross-linking of PrPC triggers a caveolin-1-dependent activation of Fyn (8Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). PrPC ligation with specific antibodies was further shown to elicit a NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cells of either neuronal or non-neuronal origin, including 1C11 precursor cells, 1C115-HT and 1C11NE neuronal cells, GT1-7 neurohypothalamic cells, and BW5147 T lymphocytes (9Schneider B.

ROS synthesized in response to PrPC ligation then act as “second message” signals and trigger rapid phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2. In 1C11-derived bioaminergic neuronal cells, these targets are under the control of the PrPC-Caveolin-Fyn platform that confers neurospecificity to PrPC signaling (9Schneider B. Mutel V. Pietri M.

Altogether, these observations allow consideration of PrPC as a regulator of the cellular redox equilibrium and of cell homeostasis.Oxidative stress, which results from an imbalance of cell redox equilibrium, i.e. high levels of ROS and dramatic reduction in the activities of antioxidant systems (10Contestabile A.

To challenge this idea, 1C11 neuroepithelial cells and their neuronal progenies, as well as GT1-7 hypothalamic cells, were exposed to the amyloidogenic prion peptide 106-126 (PrP-(106-126)). This peptide represents a suitable model to study the deleterious effect of PrPSc because it shares several physicochemical properties with entire PrPSc and is neurotoxic in vitro as well as in vivo (15Forloni G.

The pathogenic peptide mobilizes apoptotic pathways in neuronal cells while having no effect on cells of non-neuronal origin including 1C11 precursor and GT1-7 hypothalamic cells. We establish that the PrP-(106-126)-associated neurotoxic effect observed depends on cell surface expression of PrPC and relates to a deviation of PrPC-associated signaling function. Exposure to the peptide promotes NADPH oxidase overstimulation, ROS accumulation, oxidative stress injury, and recruitment of apoptotic signals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptides—PrP-(106-126) (KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG) and PrP-(106-126) scrambled (PrP-(Scr); AVHTGLGAMAALNMVVGGAAGL) were synthesized and purified by NEOSYSTEM (Strasbourg, France).

The rabbit polyclonal PrP-targeted 1A8 antibody was from C. Farquhar (Institute for Animal Health, Edinburgh, UK). Rat anti-tetraspanin CD9 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Eric Rubinstein (Inserm, Villejuif, France).Cell Culture, Enzyme Inhibition, and Small Interfering RNA Transfection—1C11 cells were grown and differentiated along the serotonergic (1C115-HT) or the catecholaminergic (1C11NE) pathway as previously described (24Mouillet-Richard S.

Enzyme inhibitions were performed by pretreating cells at 37 °C for 30 min in their culture medium with the appropriate inhibitor prior to exposure to PrP-(106-126) or PrP-(Scr).For small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection, siRNAs corresponding to the mouse Prnp gene sequence (codon 167-173) were synthesized by Proligo. Typically, siRNAs were designed such as to be constituted of 19 ribonucleotides followed by two extra thymidine bases at the 3′ end overhang on both strands. Specific siRNA sequences used were: 5′-CAGUACAGCAACCAGAACATT-3′ (sense) and scramble 5′-AACGAUGACACGAACACACTT-3′ (sense). Annealing for duplex siRNA formation was performed by incubation at 90 °C for 1 min in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm kalium acetate, and 2 mm magnesium acetate, followed by a 60-min incubation at 37 °C. siRNA duplexes (10 μm) were stored at -20 °C until use. 1C11 precursor cells and their neuronal progenies, left to grow to 30-40% confluence, were transfected with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cells were exposed to PrP-(106-126) 36 h after transfection.Cell Contour Immunostaining with Anti-CD9 Antibody—PrP-(106-126)-treated and mock treated cells for 24 h were washed with cold buffer A (PBS supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+, 1mm Mg2+, and 0.1% azide), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rat anti-tetraspanin CD9 antibody (2.5 μg/ml) in blocking buffer (buffer A enriched with 2% fetal calf serum) and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulins (5 μg/ml) (Jackson Laboratories). The cells were fixed with 3.6% formaldehyde in PBS-glycine (1.5 mg/ml). Immunolabeling was observed with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Leica).Cell Surface Detection of PrPC and PrP-(106-126) by Confocal Microscopy—1C115-HT and 1C11NE neuronal cells grown on glass coverslips and exposed to PrP-(106-126) were washed with cold buffer A and incubated simultaneously with antibodies staining either PrP-(106-126) (3F4, 5 μg/ml) or PrPC (1A8, 10 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse (Jackson Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit (Jackson Laboratories) immunoglobulins (5 μg/ml) were used as secondary antibodies. The cells were then fixed with 3.6% formaldehyde in PBS-glycine (1.5 mg/ml). Immunolabeling was observed with a Leica TCS-NT/SP inverted confocal laser scanning microscope using an Apochromat ×63/1.32 oil immersion objective (Zeiss Leica).Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was evaluated by measuring the cellular reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan product, as described (25Thellung S. Villa V. Corsaro A. Arena S. Millo E. Damonte G. Benatti U. Tagliavini F. Florio T. Schettini G. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 9: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In a typical assay, 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells were cultured in 96-well plates. After exposure to PrP-(106-126) (25 μm), the cells were then incubated with 0.25 mg/ml MTT in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for 1 h. MTT crystals were dissolved with 0.01 m HCl in SDS 10%. MTT reduction was followed at 570 nm with an automatic microplate reader (Bio-Rad).Cell Extract Preparation and Western Blot Analyses—Extracts of 1C11 precursor cells, their 1C115-HT and 1C11NE neuronal progenies, and GT1-7 hypothalamic cells were prepared as described in Ref. 9Schneider B.

Protein concentrations in the lysates were measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce), and Western blots were performed as previously described (9Schneider B. Mutel V. Pietri M.

A. 2003; 100: 13326-13331Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of Cell Surface PrPC—1C11 precursor cells and their neuronal progenies were labeled in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+,1mm Mg2+ (buffer B) containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-link™ sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 1 h. The cells were lysed on ice after three washes in ice-cold buffer B as described in Ref. 9Schneider B. Mutel V. Pietri M. Ermonval M. Mouillet-Richard S. Kellermann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13326-13331Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar. Immunoprecipitation was carried out on 200 μg of protein lysate using protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to monoclonal SAF32 antibody. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C under gentle mixing. Biotin-labeled PrPC was eluted from protein A-Sepharose beads with gel loading buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting, and biotin-labeled PrPC was revealed using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Vector Laboratories, Inc.).Immunoprecipitation of PrP-(106-126)—PrP-(106-126) was immunoprecipitated by using protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to 3F4 antibody (30 μg/ml). Aliquots corresponding to 100 μg of proteins of cell extracts were incubated with 50 μl of beads coupled to 3F4 antibodies overnight at 4 °C under gentle mixing. The beads were then washed in high salt buffer (0.5 m NaCl) and heated to 100 °C in loading buffer without reducing agent. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot.ROS Detection by Fluorescence—Production of ROS in 1C11 precursor cells, their neuronal progenies (1C115-HT and 1C11NE), or GT1-7 cells was followed using the intracellular fluorogenic reagent CM-H2DCFDA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes). Following cell exposure to PrP-(106-126) or PrP-(Scr) (25 μm each), the fluorescence was continuously recorded at λ = 528 nm (slit width = 10 nm) with excitation at λ = 507 nm (slit width = 10 nm) using a Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian Inc.).Fluorescence Measurement of Intracellular Reduced Glutathione—The level of GSH was determined using the GSH-sensitive probe Celltracker® Green CMFDA (Molecular Probes). Adherent 1C11, 1C115-HT, 1C11NE, and GT1-7 cells were exposed to 25 μm PrP-(106-126) or PrP-(Scr) up to 24 h. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer (Invitrogen) and further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution in the presence of 1 μm fluorogenic reagent. Hanks' balanced salt solution was removed, and the cells were left to reconstitute in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C before lysis in NET buffer. Fluorescence intensity of cell lysates was recorded at λ = 517 nm (slit width = 5 nm) with excitation at λ = 492 nm (slit width = 5 nm) using a Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian Inc.). The reference level of intracellular reduced GSH (100%) was obtained using mock treated cells.RESULTSPrP-(106-126) Alters the Morphology of 1C11-derived Serotonergic and Noradrenergic Cells—The 1C11 clone behaves as a committed neuroepithelial progenitor. It lacks neuron-associated functions and acquires, upon exposure to appropriate inducers, the overall neuronal functions of serotonergic (1C115-HT) or noradrenergic (1C11NE) neurons, within 4 or 12 days, respectively (24Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the time course of differentiation, 1C115-HT cells develop thin bipolar extensions that are 5-10-fold the length of the small and ovoid cell body. 1C11NE cells display a morphology with shorter and thicker neurites than those of 1C115-HT cells, which are widely branched on a pyramidal cell body (24Mouillet-Richard S. Mutel V. Loric S. Tournois C. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9186-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Upon PrP-(106-126) (25 μm) treatment, 90% of 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells exhibited morphological changes affecting both neurite extensions and cell bodies. Alterations could be observed as early as 4 h after PrP-(106-126) treatment. In contrast, 1C11 precursor (Fig. 1c) or GT1-7 (Fig. 1f) cells were not sensitive to PrP-(106-126) up to 24 h of treatment. PrP-(106-126)-induced morphological changes were analyzed in depth using CD9 tetraspanin as a marker of cell contour. As shown in Fig. 1, the transmembrane CD9 protein is homogeneously distributed throughout the surface of 1C11 precursor cells (Fig. 1a), 1C115-HT (Fig. 1g) or 1C11NE (Fig. 1j) neuronal progenies, and hypothalamic GT1-7 cells (Fig. 1d). In 1C115-HT (Fig. 1i) and 1C11NE (Fig. 1l) cells exposed to PrP-(106-126), neurites became contorted (arrows 1), with marked swellings (arrows 2) that come into budding (arrows 3). In addition, neurite extensions have disrupted (arrows 4), fragmented (arrows 5) or were less extended as compared with control cells (Fig. 1, g and j). Cell bodies of PrP-(106-126)-treated 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells were also swollen out (arrows 6) and displayed budding vesicles (arrows 7). In control experiments, using the scrambled prion peptide PrP-(Scr) (25 μm), the morphology of neurites and cell bodies of 1C11 bioaminergic neurons remained intact (Fig. 1, h and k). We therefore conclude that the effect of PrP-(106-126) on cell morphology is restricted to 1C11-derived neuronal cells expressing a complete bioaminergic phenotype.PrP-(106-126) Triggers Apoptotic Signals in 1C11-derived Bioaminergic Neuronal Cells—In scrapie-infected mice, dendritic atrophy and synaptic alteration of hippocampal pyramidal neurons have been reported to be associated with cell death through apoptotic mechanisms (26Belichenko P.V. Brown D. Jeffrey M. Fraser J.R. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2000; 26: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Jamieson E. Jeffrey M. Ironside J.W. Fraser J.R.

A. 2005; 102: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Accordingly, PrP-(106-126) treatment of 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells caused a reduction in cell viability. By 6 h, nearly 40% of 1C11-derived neuronal cells died, as estimated by following MTT reduction to formazan. On another hand, PrP-(106-126) had no effect on the viability of 1C11 undifferentiated cells or GT1-7 cells. To investigate whether the toxic effect of PrP-(106-126) on 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells was related to an activation of apoptotic signaling pathways, mitochondrial membrane depolarization-dependent cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation were followed. As depicted in Fig. 2A, cytochrome c release in 1C11NE and 1C115-HT cells could be detected as soon as 60 and 120 min, respectively, after PrP-(106-126) exposure (25 μm). Subsequent caspase-3 activation was observed in PrP-(106-126)-treated 1C11NE and 1C115-HT cells by 240 and 360 min, respectively (Fig. 2B). Again, the latter effects were restricted to fully differentiated neuronal 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells, with no trace of cytochrome c release or caspase-3 activation in 1C11 precursor and GT1-7 hyptothalamic cells up to 24 h of exposure to PrP-(106-126). The activation of such apoptotic markers in 1C115-HT serotonergic and 1C11NE noradrenergic neuronal cells exposed to the prion peptide followed a dose-response relationship (Fig. 2C). Cytochrome c release (not shown) and caspase-3 activation (Fig. 2C) became detectable when neuronal cells were treated with 5 μm PrP-(106-126). The effect was maximal when PrP-(106-126) concentration reached 25 μm up to 50 μm. As expected, PrP-(Scr), used as control, had no impact on the two above apoptotic hallmarks up to 24 h of exposure whatever the cell type examined (Fig. 2, A and B). Altogether, our results demonstrate that PrP-(106-126) elicits apoptotic signals in 1C11-derived cells harboring a neuronal phenotype only.FIGURE 2PrP-(106-126) induces apoptotic signals in 1C11-derived bioaminergic neurons. 1C11 precursor, GT1-7, 1C115-HT, and 1C11NE cells were exposed up to 24 h with 25 μm PrP-(106-126) or PrP-(Scr). Western blots show cytochrome c (Cyt c) release from mitochondria and caspase-3 activation. A, cytochrome c release became detectable at 60 min in 1C11NE and at 120 min in 1C115-HT. B, caspase-3 activation could be monitored as soon as 240 min in 1C11NE and 360 min in 1C115-HT cells. No apoptotic signal was detected in 1C11 or GT1-7 cells treated up to 24 h with PrP-(106-126). C, dose-response effect of PrP-(106-126) (0-50 μm) on caspase-3 activation in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells. Caspase-3 activation was quantified using the densitometric analysis tool of the QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). The data shown are representative of a set of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PrP-(106-126)-induced Apoptotic Reponses in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE Cells Depend on Cell Surface Expression of PrPC—To investigate whether the expression of PrPC at the neuronal cell surface was required to mediate PrP-(106-126)-dependent apoptotic pathways in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells, we designed a mouse Prnp gene-specific siRNA (PrP-siRNA) with the aim to down-regulate the expression of the PrPC protein. As shown by Western blot analysis and cell surface immunostaining, expression of PrPC was specifically reduced by ∼95% upon 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cell transfection with this PrP-siRNA (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the PrP-siRNA had no impact on the expression of unrelated proteins such as ERK1/2. A scrambled siRNA unrelated to any known gene was used as control. It did not change the level of PrPC expression in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3PrPC mediates PrP-(106-126)-associated neurotoxic effect in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells. Wild type 1C115-HT, 1C11NE, and PrPC-depleted neuronal (PrP-siRNA) cells were exposed up to 24 h with 25 μm PrP-(106-126).

We show that unpalmitoylated R7BP undergoes nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling and that a C-terminal polybasic motif proximal to the palmitoylation acceptor sites of R7BP mediates nuclear localization, palmitoylation, and plasma membrane targeting. These results suggest a novel mechanism whereby palmitoyltransferases and nuclear import receptors both utilize the C-terminal domain of R7BP to determine the trafficking fate of R7G5R7BP heterotrimers. Analogous mechanisms may regulate other signaling proteins whose distribution between the plasma membrane and nucleus is controlled by palmitoylation. Lastly, we show that cytoplasmic RGS7G5R7BP heterotrimers and RGS7G5 heterodimers are equivalently inefficient regulators of G proteincoupled receptor signaling relative to plasma membrane-bound heterotrimers bearing palmitoylated R7BP. Therefore, R7BP augments the function of the complex by a palmitoylation-regulated plasma membrane-targeting mechanism."

Although the Smad pathway is critical for many of these responses, recent evidence indicates that Smad-independent pathways may also have a critical role. One such protein previously shown to regulate TGF-β action independent of the Smad proteins is the c-Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. In the current study we determined that TGF-β receptor signaling activates c-Abl kinase activity in a subset of fibroblast but not epithelial cultures. This cell type-specific response occurs in a membrane-proximal locale independent of receptor internalization and upstream of dynamin action. Although c-Abl activation by TGF-β is independent of Smad2 or Smad3, it is prevented by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or PAK2. Thus, c-Abl represents a target downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-activated PAK2, which differentiates TGF-β signaling in fibroblasts and epithelial cell lines and integrates serine/threonine receptor kinases with tyrosine kinase pathways.

With such a wide variety of biologies, it is not surprising that signaling targets downstream of the TGF-β receptor have been difficult to define.Signaling pathways for TGF-β are routinely classified as being either Smad-dependent or Smad-independent.

Binding of ligand to the type II TGF-β receptor results in the recruitment of the type I receptor into a heterotetrameric complex. The constitutively active type II receptor then transphosphorylates the type I receptor, which activates the receptor kinase and promotes R-Smad (i.e. Smad2 or Smad3) binding. Although the cellular locale where the type I receptor phosphorylates the associated R-Smad(s) may differ in various cell types (9Di Guglielmo G.M. Leroy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat.

More recently, components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family have been observed to control various apoptotic responses stimulated by TGF-β, and a direct link between the TGF-β receptor complex and Rho-mediated dissolution of tight junctions during epithelial-mesenchymal transitions has been reported (8Moustakas A. Heldin C.-H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 15Javelaud D. Mauviel A.

Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Of note, although these responses can be defined as Smad-independent, there is often cross-talk with the Smad pathway to obtain the full biologic response. An additional complexity to the concept of “Smad-independent” signaling is indicated by the recent work of Levy and Hill (20Levy L. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8108-8125Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These investigators documented two functional categories of TGF-β target genes dependent (or not) upon Smad4. As the canonical model for Smad signaling (discussed above) requires Smad4 to promote R-Smad nuclear translocation, this manuscript illustrates both the importance and difficulty in defining a Smad from a non-Smad response.A fundamental question in understanding TGF-β action is how similar pathways can be activated in various cell types with completely different biological outcomes. For instance, although epithelial and mesenchymal cells are routinely growth-inhibited or growth-stimulated, respectively, by TGF-β, Smad phosphorylation, translocation, and transcriptional modulation of numerous genes occur in both. Although a number of models can be proposed to account for this apparent inconsistency (7Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar), we have been investigating the hypothesis that activation of cell type-specific signaling pathways might be one means to address this paradox. In that regard, recent studies have shown that p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are activated by TGF-β independent of Smad2 or Smad3 in a subset of mesenchymal but not epithelial cultures (14Wilkes M.C. Mitchell H. Gulati-Penheiter S. Doré J.J. Suzuki K. Edens M. Sharma D.K. Pagano R.E. Leof E.B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10431-10440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Wilkes M.C. Murphy S.J. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8878-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PI3K was found to function upstream of PAK2 and represent a branch point in the TGF-β response. For instance, although PI3K was required for both PAK2 and Akt activation, TGF-β morphologic transformation and monolayer proliferation resulted from signals emanating downstream of PAK2. Of note, although each pathway is necessary, functional integration with the Smad pathway is required as none are sufficient to induce these responses (14Wilkes M.C. Mitchell H. Gulati-Penheiter S.

Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). As it was subsequently determined that (i) activation of PAK2 by the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 induced c-Abl activity (27Roig J. Huang Z. Lytle C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16933-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and (ii) TGF-β activated PAK2 independent of Smad2 and Smad3 (21Wilkes M.C. Murphy S.J. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8878-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we extended these observations and investigated whether TGF-β might also regulate c-Abl. The data demonstrated not only that TGF-β induced c-Abl kinase activity but also that inhibition of that response with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec®) prevented in vivo lung and kidney fibrosis due to bleomycin instillation or ureter ligation, respectively (28Daniels C.E.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that c-Abl might represent an important component of the mesenchymal cell response to TGF-β. As such, because c-Abl regulates many similar phenotypes as TGF-β (23Pendergast A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 85PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zhu J.K. Wang Y.J. Curr. Topics Dev.

In the present study we report that TGF-β activation of c-Abl was not prevented by inhibitors of clathrin- or raft-mediated internalization, displayed a distinct cell tropism, and occurred downstream of PAK2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and grown in high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). Unless otherwise stated, 2.5 × 106 cells were seeded on 100-mm culture dishes, grown to confluence, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and serum-starved in 0.1% FBS/DMEM or serum-free DMEM for 24 h prior to use. LY294002, PD098059, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma, whereas Akt IV was obtained from Calbiochem.Western Blotting—Total c-Abl or Smad3 protein and phospho-Smad3 expression was determined as described previously (14Wilkes M.C.

Briefly, cultures were treated overnight in serum-free DMEM prior to stimulation with the indicated reagents. Lysates were prepared (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1× Complete protease inhibitor; Roche Applied Science), and equivalent protein (∼100 μg determined by Pierce BCA protein assay kit) was separated by SDS-PAGE. Western antibody for c-Abl was purchased from BD Biosciences (catalog no. 554148 used at 1:200 dilution) whereas total Smad3 antibody was from Zymed Laboratories (catalog no. 51-1500). A rabbit anti-phosphorylated Smad3 antibody (used at 1:3000 dilution) to the peptide COOH-GSPSIRCSpSVpS was generated in our laboratory (14Wilkes M.C. Mitchell H. Gulati-Penheiter S. Doré J.J.

Secondary goat anti-mouse (1:2000 dilution) or donkey anti-rabbit (1:2000 dilution) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. sc-2005) and Amersham Biosciences (catalog no.

Briefly, cells were lysed in 750 μl of kinase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 trypsin inhibitory unit/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate), and equivalent protein (∼500–700 μg) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antibody to c-Abl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-13076 used at 1:150 dilution). Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed twice in kinase lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) prior to incubation in 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 5 μm ATP, 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Crk, and 0.5 μCi of Rxn/[γ-32P]ATP. Following incubation at 37 °C for 5 min the reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer.Adenovirus Constructs—Dominant negative PAK2 (PAK2K299R) or Ras (RasN17) adenovirus was generated by transfection of pAdCMV into 293Cre cells. Recombinant clones were determined by cytopathic effects, plaque-purified in 293Cre cells, and titered by limiting dilution in 293 cells. Cell lines were infected by incubation for 24 h in serum-free DMEM with virus at multiplicity of infection 200. Control GFP-expressing adenovirus was purchased from Riken GenBank™ (Japan). Ad-Empty was provided by Dr. Richard Pagano (Mayo Clinic), and adenovirus-expressing dominant negative dynamin 1 (Ad-Dyn(K44A)) was from Dr. Jeffrey Pessin (Stony Brook).Transfections—Cells were seeded in six-well dishes at 2.5 × 105 per dish for 24 h prior to 4 h of transfection (TransIT-LT1; Mirrus Bio, Madison, WI) with 2 μg of luciferase vector plus 0.5 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase. The medium was replaced with 10% FBS/DMEM, and the cultures were allowed to recover overnight. Following incubation in serum-free DMEM for 12–18 h, the cells were left untreated or stimulated with the indicated reagents for 24 h. Normalized luciferase activity was assayed as described (10Penheiter S.G. Mitchell H. Garamszegi N. Edens M. Doré Jr., J.J.E. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell.

Similarly, PAK2 expression was prevented by transfecting antisense oligonucleotides to nucleotides –1 to +24 of mouse PAK2 (5′-TTCTAGCTCTCCGTTATCAGACATG-3′) (Gene Tools, Philomath, OR). Scrambled (5′-GTACAGACTATTGCCTCTCGATCTT-3′) control oligonucleotides were used for p85 and PAK2. Cos7 cells were plated in six-well dishes at a density of 1.0 × 105 per well in 10% DMEM and incubated at 37 °C for 25 h. Confluent cells were transfected with the indicated oligonucleotide (6 μm) along with plasmids expressing the type I (1 μg) and II (3 μg) TGF-β receptors with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 6 h. The medium was replaced with 2% FBS/DMEM for 48 h, and following a 24-h incubation in 0.1% FBS/DMEM cultures were stimulated in 2 ml of serum-free DMEM alone or containing 10 ng/ml TGF-β for the indicated times.Soft Agar Colony Formation—Cells were suspended in 1.0 ml of 10% FBS/DMEM containing 0.4% Sea Plaque-agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) in the presence or absence of TGF-β and/or imatinib mesylate. The soft agar was added to 35-mm plates containing a 0.8% agarose, 10% FBS/DMEM bottom plug, and the number of colonies greater than 25–50 μmin diameter that developed after 10–12 days was determined by microscopy using a 1.0-cm grid. Approximately 3 independent regions on each of 4 plates were counted. Imatinib was prepared as described previously (28Daniels C.E. Wilkes M.C. Edens M. Kottom T.J. Murphy S.J. Limper A.H. Leof E.B.

Invest. 2004; 114: 1303-1316Crossref Scopus (516) Google Scholar).RESULTSTGF-β Activation of c-Abl Distinguishes Mesenchymal from Epithelial Cell Lines and Requires TGF-β Receptor Kinase Activity—A fundamental question in understanding TGF-β action is how one growth factor, binding to the same set of receptors in mesenchymal and epithelial cells, can lead to such diverse phenotypes as growth stimulation (i.e. mesenchymal cells) and growth inhibition (i.e. epithelial cells). Although there are numerous means by which this might be addressed, we have investigated the hypothesis that TGF-β induces cell type-specific signaling to regulate these outcomes. Specifically, our previous studies have shown that PI3K and PAK2 are two downstream targets activated by TGF-β in mesenchymal but not epithelial cultures (14Wilkes M.C. Mitchell H. Gulati-Penheiter S. Doré J.J. Suzuki K. Edens M. Sharma D.K. Pagano R.E. Leof E.B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10431-10440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Wilkes M.C. Murphy S.J. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8878-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because we have also shown that TGF-β stimulation of c-Abl is a potential mediator of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (28Daniels C.E. Wilkes M.C. Edens M. Kottom T.J. Murphy S.J. Limper A.H. Leof E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1303-1316Crossref Scopus (516) Google Scholar), we wished to extend that analysis by determining (i) whether c-Abl was an additional Smad-independent TGF-β signaling target that reflected a specific cell tropism of activation and (ii) whether c-Abl was activated in a similar and/or parallel pathway to PI3K and PAK2.As c-Abl reflects an integration of Ser/Thr kinase signaling with tyrosine kinase activation, we first determined if this took place in a cell type-specific manner. Accordingly, AKR-2B fibroblasts and Mv1Lu epithelial cells were stimulated with TGF-β and assayed for c-Abl kinase activity and Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Although c-Abl activity was detectable within 15 min of TGF-β treatment of AKR-2B cells, peaking at 30 min, no induction was observed in Mv1Lu cells. However, c-Abl protein was similarly expressed, and Smad3 phosphorylation occurred in both cell types. To determine whether the response observed for AKR-2B and Mv1Lu cells reflected a more generalized distinction of mesenchymal and epithelial cells, respectively, three representative fibroblast (i.e. AKR-2B, NIH-3T3, and IMR90) and epithelial (i.e. Mv1Lu, MDCK, and HeLa) cultures were stimulated with TGF-β and examined for effects on c-Abl activity. As shown in Fig. 1B, although there was no significant difference in the level of c-Abl protein expressed among the cell types, c-Abl activation by TGF-β only occurred in murine (AKR-2B and NIH-3T3) and human (IMR90) fibroblasts; no effect was observed in mink (Mv1Lu), canine (MDCK), or human (HeLa) epithelial cultures. This cell tropism is identical to what we have reported for PI3K and PAK2 activation (14Wilkes M.C. Mitchell H. Gulati-Penheiter S. Doré J.J. Suzuki K. Edens M. Sharma D.K. Pagano R.E. Leof E.B.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8878-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and suggests that PI3K, PAK2, and c-Abl might be targets within the same TGF-β signaling pathway (see below).TGF-β signaling is dependent upon the kinase activity of the type I and type II receptors and has been reported to be initiated in both membrane-proximal and -distal locales (10Penheiter S.G.

First, what is the role of receptor kinase activity in c-Abl activation, and second, does c-Abl activation require protein or mRNA synthesis? To address the first of these questions we took advantage of the chimeric TGF-β receptor model we developed (32Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21758-21766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Anders R.A. Doré J.J.E. Arline S.A. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23118-23125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This system utilizes the ligand binding domain of the GM-CSF α and β receptors and fuses them to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the type I or type II TGF-β receptors. Because high affinity GM-CSF binding only occurs via an α/β heteromer, defined cytoplasmic interactions can be specifically induced. As the chimeric system has been previously shown to faithfully recapitulate native TGF-β receptor signaling, we examined c-Abl activation in AKR-2B clones expressing wild-type type I and II chimeric receptors (A105), wild-type type I and kinase-impaired type II chimeric receptors (A615), and wild-type type II and kinase-impaired type I chimeric TGF-β receptors (A708). Although activation of wild-type chimeric receptors with GM-CSF or native receptors with TGF-β similarly induce c-Abl kinase activity (Fig. 2A), the absence of type I or type II kinase activity prevents c-Abl activation (Fig. 2A, left panel). As expected, Smad3 phosphorylation similarly required chimeric receptor kinase activity (Fig. 2A, left panel) and occurred normally in the A615 and A708 cells when the endogenous receptors were stimulated with TGF-β (Fig. 2A, right panel). Moreover, inhibition of protein or mRNA synthesis by greater than 90% (data not shown) had no discernable effect on c-Abl activation by TGF-β (Fig. 2B). Thus, the c-Abl kinase is a primary TGF-β signaling target downstream of the TGF-β receptor complex.FIGURE 2Activation of c-Abl requires TGF-β receptor kinase activity and is independent of transcription. A, AKR-2B lines stably expressing chimeric wild-type (A105) or kinase-impaired (A615, TβR2K277R); A708, TβR1K232R) chimeric TGF-β receptors (33Anders R.A. Doré J.J.E. Arline S.A. Garamszegi N.

B, AKR-2B fibroblasts were grown to confluence, placed in serum-free DMEM overnight, and pretreated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide or 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for 30 min.

Here, we show that mTOR forms a multimer via its N-terminal HEAT repeat region in mammalian cells. mTOR multimerization is promoted by amino acid sufficiency, although the state of multimerization does not directly correlate with the phosphorylation state of S6K1. mTOR multimerization was insensitive to rapamycin treatment but hindered by butanol treatment, which inhibits phosphatidic acid production by phospholipase D. We also found that mTOR forms a multimer in both mTORC1 and mTORC2. In addition, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TOR proteins Tor1p and Tor2p also exist as homomultimers.

This protein was originally identified by the analysis of mutants that show resistance to rapamycin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Although two highly homologous genes (TOR1 and TOR2) exist in yeast, only one TOR gene is known in higher eukaryotes (1Harris T.E. Lawrence J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 212: RE15Google Scholar, 2Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Mammalian TOR (mTOR) is a large protein with a molecular mass of 289 kDa and belongs to the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, which includes ATM, ATR, and DNA-dependent protein kinase (1Harris T.E. Lawrence J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 212: RE15Google Scholar). PIKK family proteins have characteristic domains: at their N-terminal halves, tandem HEAT (Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, and TOR1) repeats (4Andrade M.A. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar); and at their C-terminal regions, FAT, kinase catalytic, and FATC domains (5Bosotti R. Isacchi A. Sonnhammer E.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 225-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the case of mTOR, there are ∼20 tandem HEAT repeats, which are believed to mediate protein-protein interaction. Indeed, several proteins that interact with this region have been identified (6Sabatini D.M. Barrow R.K. Blackshaw S. Burnett P.E. Lai M.M. Field M.E. Bahr B.A. Kirsch J. Betz H. Snyder S.H.

Between FAT and kinase catalytic domains, mTOR has the FRB domain, to which rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, binds in complex with FKBP12 (FK506-binding protein 12) (1Harris T.E. Lawrence J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 212: RE15Google Scholar).To date, both in yeast and mammalian cells, TOR is known to form two distinct complexes (TORC1 and TORC2), each of which has different roles (10Loewith R.

In mammalian cells, mTORC1, which consists of mTOR, mLST8 (also named GβL), and raptor, is sensitive to rapamycin and regulates the phosphorylation of two well established effectors, S6K1 (p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1) and 4E-BP1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1), leading to the promotion of protein synthesis (7Kim D.H.

In the other complex known as mTORC2, mTOR is associated with mLST8 and rictor (also named mAVO3). This complex is insensitive to rapamycin and appears to regulate actin organization (12Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported recently that mTORC2 is responsible for the phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B at Ser473 (16Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5157) Google Scholar). Although rapamycin has been used as a specific inhibitor of mTOR activity, it has been revealed that rapamycin binds to mTOR in mTORC1 but not in mTORC2 (12Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), suggesting that mTOR may contribute to more cellular functions than previously thought.The activity of mTORC1 is regulated by a variety of signals such as amino acid availability, growth factors, and energy status. Recently, it was revealed that tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor proteins TSC1 and TSC2 act as upstream negative regulators of mTORC1 in signaling from growth factors and energy status (1Harris T.E. Lawrence J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 212: RE15Google Scholar, 2Martin D.E. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). TSC2 exerts its negative regulation on mTOR through activity as a GTPase-activating protein on the small GTP-binding protein Rheb (17Garami A. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M.

Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 702-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation leads to Akt/protein kinase B activation, which is thought to inactivate the GTPase-activating protein activity of TSC2 by undefined mechanisms. Under energy starvation conditions, AMP-activated protein kinase is activated and then enhances TSC2 activity (21Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2945) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mechanism by which amino acid availability leads to mTOR activation is less understood. Although the regulation of mTOR by amino acid availability is unlikely to require TSC2 (22Smith E.M. Finn S.G. Tee A.R. Browne G.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18717-18727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), Rheb overexpression could prevent S6K1 dephosphorylation caused by amino acid withdrawal (17Garami A. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Stocker H. Kozma S.C. Hafen E. Bos J.L. Thomas G. Mol.

Recent studies also indicated the involvement of human VPS34 in amino acid-mediated signaling to mTOR independently of the TSC-Rheb pathway (23Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Dann S.G. Kim S.Y. Gulati P. Byfield M.P. Backer J.M. Natt F. Bos J.L. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14238-14243Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 24Byfield M.P.

In contrast to mTORC1, no signal leading to mTORC2 activation has been identified.Multimerization is a well documented general mechanism for the activation of protein kinases. ATM, a member of the PIKK family, forms a dimer, and dimerization is important for its regulation (25Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2652) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that mTOR exists as a multimer via its N-terminal HEAT repeat region in mammalian cells and that this multimerization is promoted by amino acid sufficiency but hindered by butanol treatment, which inhibits phosphatidic acid (PA) production by phospholipase D (26Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The state of mTOR multimerization does, however, not directly correlate with the phosphorylation state of S6K1. mTOR is likely to multimerize within both mTORC1 and mTORC2. We also show that S. cerevisiae TOR proteins Tor1p and Tor2p also exist as homomultimers. These results indicate that TOR multimerization is conserved through evolution and might be important for TOR functioning.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-hemagglutinin (HA; 12CA5) ascites fluids were kind gifts from Dr. Yutaka Hoshikawa.

Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Maeda, unpublished data. respectively. Expression plasmids for mTOR deletion mutants were produced by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzymes, blunt ending, and self-ligation of pcDNA3.1-Myc-mTOR or pcDNA3.1-FLAG-mTOR. To generate the expression plasmid for Xpress-tagged raptor (pcDNA3.1-Xpress-raptor), a PCR fragment of human raptor cDNA obtained using primers Kpn-raptor-F (AAGGTACCAATGGAGTCCGAAATGCTGCAATCGC) and raptor-Sph-R (CACATTTCTGCATGCAAAACCAGCGCAG) was digested with KpnI and SphI and then inserted into the KpnI and NotI sites of the pcDNA3.1/His plasmid (Invitrogen) together with an SphI-NotI fragment derived from the KIAA1303 cDNA clone (a generous gift from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute) (28Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ishikawa K.I. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3.1/His plasmid possesses both the His6 sequence and the Xpress epitope. Plasmids for HA-mTOR(N2343K) (pcDNA1-HA-mTOR(N2343K)) and FLAG-mTOR(N2343K) (pCMV-FLAG-mTOR(N2343K)) were described previously (27Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.P.

The expression plasmids for HA-S6K1 (pRK5-HA-S6K1) and FLAG-ATR (pBJ-FLAG-ATR) were kindly provided by Dr. Akio Yamakawa and Karlene Cimprichs, respectively.To generate a plasmid used to construct the triple HA epitope (HA3)-tagged version of TOR1 or TOR2 (pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR1–3HA or pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR2–3HA, respectively), the GAL1 promoter region in pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PGAL1–3HA (29Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4108) Google Scholar) was replaced with a region upstream of TOR1 (–600 to +3 relative to the translational start site of TOR1) or TOR2 (–600 to +3 relative to the translational start site of TOR2). To generate a plasmid used to construct triple FLAG epitope (FLAG3)-tagged TOR1 or TOR2 (pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR1–3FLAG or pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR2–3FLAG, respectively), a fragment encoding the HA3 epitope tag in pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR1–3HA or pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR2–3HA was replaced with a sequence encoding the FLAG3 tag. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, HEK293T, and HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 1000 or 4500 mg/liter glucose (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfection of the indicated plasmids was performed with PolyFect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In these assays, the transfection efficiencies were estimated to 30–40%, and the total expression levels of recombinant mTOR proteins were usually <3-fold compared with those of endogenous mTOR. For amino acid starvation, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) containing 100 mg/liter each CaCl2 and MgCl2 and 1000 or 4500 mg/liter glucose (according to DMEM used for cell cultures) and incubated in the same saline for the indicated times. In experiments for the re-addition of amino acids, an amino acid mixture was added at the following final concentrations: l-Arg, 84 mg/liter; l-Cys, 48 mg/liter; l-His, 84 mg/liter; l-Ile, 105 mg/liter; l-Leu, 105 mg/liter; l-Lys, 145 mg/liter; l-Met, 30 mg/liter; l-Phe, 66 mg/liter; l-Thr, 95 mg/liter; l-Trp, 20 mg/liter; l-Tyr, 72 mg/liter; l-Val, 94 mg/liter; and l-Gln, 584 mg/liter.Cell Lysate Preparation and Immunoprecipitation—After 24–48 h of transfection, cells grown on 6-well plates were washed once with ice-cold D-PBS and lysed with 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% CHAPS, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, 1% Triton X-100 was substituted for 0.3% CHAPS. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads for 2 h. Immune complexes captured on the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. For sequential immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was prepared from a 100-mm dish using 1.0 ml of lysis buffer as described above. Cleared cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 beads for 2 h; the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer; and immune complexes were eluted with lysis buffer containing the 3X FLAG peptide (150 ng/ml). The elute was further immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc beads (Sigma) for 2 h, and the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer.Gel Filtration Chromatography—About 4.0 × 107 HEK293T or HeLa cells were lysed with 0.3 ml of lysis buffer on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). About 1.5–2.0 mg of proteins in <0.3-ml volume were loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted at 0.2 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Sixteen microliters of each fraction were then analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.Yeast Strains—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. To construct a strain (KS014) expressing N-terminally HA3-tagged Tor1p, PCR was performed with primers oTB188 (ATAGTAGCTTCACGAGAGAGTCATTGGTAAAGTGAAACATACATCAACCGGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC) and oTB189 (TTAGCCGCTTTCAAAAGTTTACTCTTCCAAATCTGCTCCTCATGCGGTTCGCACTGAGCAGCGTAATCTG) using pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR1–3HA as a template, and the resultant PCR product was introduced into TM141 according to a lithium acetate method (30Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). A strain (KS015) expressing HA3-Tor2p was similarly constructed using a PCR product amplified with primers oTB190 (AAAGGGAAAATATACCGGGTGCATAAAGAGCATAGTCATTAAGATCAAATGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC) and oTB191 (CGTAAAGACAATAAGTTAGGTGGCGTGGTGTATTTGTTAATGTATTTATTGCACTGAGCAGCGTAATCTG) and pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR2–3HA. Strains expressing FLAG3-Tor1p (T1-005) and FLAG3-Tor2p (T1-001) were similarly constructed using pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR1–3FLAG and pFA6a-HIS3MX6-PTOR2–3FLAG, respectively, in the TM225 strain background. All strains were confirmed by DNA sequencing of their genomic DNA for correct insertion of the intended tag into TOR1 or TOR2. Diploid strains were constructed by mating appropriate strains.TABLE 1S. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeTM141MATa ura3 leu2 his3 trp1TM225MATα ura3 leu2 his3 lys2KS014MATa ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 His3MX6:PTOR1-3HA-TOR1KS015MATa ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 His3MX6:PTOR2-3HA-TOR2T1-001MATα ura3 leu2 his3 lys2 His3MX6:PTOR2-3FLAG-TOR2T1-005MATα ura3 leu2 his3 lys2 His3MX6:PTOR1-3FLAG-TOR1T2-004MATa/MATα ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 his3/his3 trp1/+ lys2/+ His3MX6:PTOR2-3HA-TOR2/His3MX6:PTOR2-3FLAG-TOR2T2-007MATa/MATα ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 his3/his3 trp1/+ lys2/+ His3MX6:PTOR1-3HA-TOR1/+ His3MX6:PTOR2-3FLAG-TOR2/+T2-012MATa/MATα ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 his3/his3 trp1/+ lys2/+ His3MX6:PTOR1-3FLAG-TOR1/+ His3MX6:PTOR2-3HA-TOR2/+T2-013MATa/MATα ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 his3/his3 trp1/+ lys2/+ His3MX6:PTOR1-3HA-TOR1/His3MX6:PTOR1-3FLAG-TOR1 Open table in a new tab Yeast Cell Culture and Immunoprecipitation—Yeast strains were grown to A600 = 1.0 at 30 °C in YPD medium (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose). For nitrogen or carbon starvation, cells were washed once with water and cultured in synthetic dextrose medium without ammonium sulfate and supplemented with leucine and uracil or in synthetic complete medium without glucose, respectively. For other treatments, each reagent was added directly to YPD medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min and disrupted in yeast lysis buffer (D-PBS, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween 20, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using ceramics beads and a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai Corp., Osaka) 10 times for each 30-s pulse. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times with yeast lysis buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE.RESULTSmTOR Exists as a Multimer—To examine whether mTOR exists as a multimer, Myc epitope-tagged mTOR and FLAG epitope-tagged mTOR were transiently coexpressed in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, Myc-mTOR was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-mTOR, indicating that mTOR forms a multimer in the cell. The endogenous mTOR-associated proteins raptor, rictor, and mLST8 (7Kim D.H.

To determine the region involved in the multimerization of mTOR, a series of truncation mutants of mTOR with a FLAG epitope tag were coexpressed with Myc-mTOR in mammalian cells, and their ability to interact with Myc-mTOR was examined by co-immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 1, B and C). A FLAG-tagged N-terminal region (fragment 1–1484) of mTOR was able to interact with Myc-tagged full-length mTOR. The remaining region (fragment 1484–2549) of mTOR tagged with FLAG only marginally interacted with Myc-tagged full-length mTOR, and shorter deletion mutants (fragments 1879–2549 and 2106–2549) were not able to interact with Myc-mTOR (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, shorter deletion mutants of the N-terminal region (fragments 1–1380, 1–670, and 575–1380) still interacted with recombinant full-length mTOR (Fig. 1C). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation with Myc-mTOR showed similar results (Fig. 1D). Another PIKK protein containing the HEAT repeat region, ATR (31Perry J. Klechner N. Cell. 2003; 112: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), did not interact with Myc-mTOR (Fig. 1E), indicating that the interaction is specific. These results suggest that mTOR is able to multimerize through its N-terminal HEAT repeat region.mTOR Multimerization Is Affected by Amino Acid Sufficiency and Butanol Treatment—We next investigated whether mTOR multimerization is affected by amino acid starvation. Cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids for both Myc-mTOR and FLAG-mTOR were first maintained in DMEM containing 10% serum, and then the medium was replaced with D-PBS for 150 min before harvesting. The amount of Myc-mTOR co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-mTOR was greatly reduced by this treatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 6). The addition of amino acids to D-PBS restored the interaction (lane 2). These results suggest that mTOR multimerization is modulated by extracellular amino acid sufficiency. Insulin is another known input leading to S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr389 through the activation of mTORC1 signaling, although this action of insulin requires extracellular amino acids (32Hara K.

Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Consistent with the action of insulin for S6K1 phosphorylation, insulin alone did not enhance mTOR multimerization (lane 3). Rapamycin treatment was found to have no effect on mTOR multimerization at the concentration inhibiting S6K1 phosphorylation (lanes 4 and 5).FIGURE 2mTOR multimerization is modulated by amino acid sufficiency. A, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the expression plasmids for Myc-mTOR and FLAG-mTOR. After 40 h, the cells were transferred into D-PBS and incubated for 90 min (lanes 1–5) or left in DMEM containing 10% serum (DMEM+S; lane 6). Cells treated with D-PBS were then left in D-PBS (lane 1) or transferred into D-PBS containing amino acids (AA; lane 2), 100 nm insulin (Ins; lane 3), or both amino acids and 100 nm insulin alone (AA+Ins; lane 3) or with 200 nm rapamycin (AA+Ins+Rap; lane 5) for 60 min prior to harvest. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG M2 beads and then analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. anti-S6K-P (Thr389), anti-phospho-S6K1 Thr389 antibody. B, HEK293T cells transiently expressing Myc-mTOR-(1–1380) and FLAG-mTOR-(1–1380) were transferred into D-PBS for 90 min. Cells were then left in D-PBS (lane 1); transferred into D-PBS containing amino acids (lane 2), 100 nm insulin (lane 3), or both amino acids and 100 nm insulin alone (lane 4) or with 200 nm rapamycin (lane 5); or transferred into DMEM containing 10% serum (lane 6) for 60 min prior to harvesting. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described for A. C, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged kinase-dead mTOR (FLAG-mTOR(N2343K)(lane 1), HA-tagged kinase-dead mTOR (HA-mTOR(N2343K)(lane 2), or both (lanes 3–5). After 40 h, the cells were left in DMEM containing 10% serum (lanes 1–3) or transferred into D-PBS (lanes 4 and 5). After 90 min, the cells treated with D-PBS were left in D-PBS (lane 5) or transferred into D-PBS containing amino acids (lane 4). Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described for A. D, FLAG-tagged mTOR fragments were transiently expressed together with Myc-mTOR-(1–1380) in COS-7 cells. After 40 h, the cells were transferred into D-PBS for 90 min and then left in D-PBS (lanes 1, 4, and 7), treated with amino acids in D-PBS (lanes 2, 5, and 8), or transferred into DMEM containing 10% serum (lanes 3, 6, and 9)"
https://openalex.org/W2080964628,The Mdm2 protein is the major regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53. We show that the p53 protein associates both with the N-terminal and with the central domain of Mdm2. The central p53-binding site of Mdm2 encompasses amino acids 235-300. Binding of p53 to the central domain is significantly enhanced after phosphorylation of the central domain of Mdm2. The N-terminal and central domains of Mdm2 act synergistically in binding to p53. p53 mutants that have mutations in the tetramerization domain and that fail to oligomerize do not show such an enhancement of binding in the presence of the other binding site.
https://openalex.org/W1980968246,"In neurons, the second messengers Ca(2+) and cAMP are mediators of transcriptional responses that are important for the development and function of the nervous system. The pro-survival neuronal transcription factors cAMP-response elementbinding protein (CREB) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) both stimulate gene expression in response to activity-dependent increases in the concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) ions. CREB is also activated by increases in intracellular cAMP. Here we have investigated whether the MEF2 family member MEF2D, similar to CREB, is also activated by cAMP in hippocampal neurons. We have shown that, unlike CREB, MEF2D is not activated by agents that increase intracellular cAMP. Moreover, increases in cAMP inhibit Ca(2+)-activated MEF2D-mediated gene expression. We have also shown that cAMP inhibits Ca(2+)-induced nuclear export of the MEF2 co-repressor HDAC5 and prevents Ca(2+)-stimulated nuclear import of the MEF2 co-activator NFAT3/c4. Our results suggest that cAMP interferes with MEF2D-mediated gene expression at multiple levels by antagonizing the derepression of MEF2D by HDAC5 and by inhibiting recruitment of the co-activator NFAT."
https://openalex.org/W2047258020,"In chlorophyll biosynthesis protochlorophyllide reductase (POR) catalyzes the light-driven reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide, providing a rare opportunity to trap and characterize catalytic intermediates at low temperatures. Moreover, the presence of a chlorophyll-like molecule allows the use of EPR, electron nuclear double resonance, and Stark spectroscopies, previously used for the analysis of photosynthetic systems, to follow catalytic events in the active site of POR. Different models involving the formation of either radical species or charge transfer complexes have been proposed for the initial photochemical step, which forms a nonfluorescent intermediate absorbing at 696 nm (A696). Our EPR data show that the concentration of the radical species formed in the initial photochemical step is not stoichiometric with conversion of substrate. Instead, a large Stark effect, indicative of charge transfer character, is associated with A696. Two components were required to fit the Stark data, providing clear evidence that charge transfer complexes are formed during the initial photochemistry. The temperature dependences of both A696 formation and NADPH oxidation are identical, and we propose that formation of the A696 state involves hydride transfer from NADPH to form a charge transfer complex. A catalytic mechanism of POR is suggested in which Pchlide absorbs a photon, creating a transient charge separation across the C-17–C-18 double bond, which promotes ultrafast hydride transfer from the pro-S face of NADPH to the C-17 of Pchlide. The resulting A696 charge transfer intermediate facilitates transfer of a proton to the C-18 of Pchlide during the subsequent first “dark” reaction.

The light-driven enzyme NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR; EC 1.3.1.33) 2The abbreviations used are: POR, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase; Pchlide, protochlorophyllide; Chlide, chlorophyllide; ENDOR, electron nuclear double resonance; hfc, hyperfine coupling constant. catalyzes the reduction of the C-17–C-18 double bond of the D-ring of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to produce chlorophyllide (Chlide), a key regulatory step in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway (1Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 642-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). POR is a member of the “RED” superfamily of enzymes (reductases, epimerases, dehydrogenases) (2Wilks H.M. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Baker M.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which catalyze NADP(H)- or NAD(H)-dependent reactions involving hydride and proton transfers (4Jörnvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). They have many structural features in common, and a three-dimensional homology model of the POR-Pchlide-NADPH ternary complex has been constructed using a member of this superfamily as a template (5Townley H.E. Sessions R.B. Clarke A.R. Dafforn T.R. Griffiths W.T. Proteins. 2001; 44: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The hydride is transferred from the pro-S face of the nicotinamide ring to the C-17 position of the Pchlide molecule (6Valera V. Fung M. Wessler A.N. Richards W.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Begley T.P. Young H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3095-3096Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and a conserved Tyr residue has been proposed to donate a proton to the C-18 position. The close proximity of a conserved Lys residue is thought to be necessary to lower the apparent pKa of the phenolic group of the Tyr, allowing deprotonation to occur (2Wilks H.M. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, changes to the central magnesium atom (8Griffiths W.T. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and to the structure of the isocyclic ring of the Pchlide molecule lead to POR inactivity (9Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rudiger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), suggesting that these structural elements are also important for the interaction of the pigment with the enzyme. Because POR is light-driven, the enzyme-substrate complex can be formed in the dark, prior to catalysis, thus removing the diffusive components from the kinetic analyses. Catalysis can then be triggered by illumination, using low temperatures to slow down Pchlide reduction and trap intermediates in the reaction pathway. These experimental advantages make POR an attractive model for mechanistic studies of RED enzymes and more generally for investigating biological proton and hydride transfers. Consequently, a number of steps have been identified in the reaction pathway that can occur over a range of different temperatures (10Lebedev N. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In POR from Synechocystis,an initial light-driven step, occurring below 200 K (11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), is followed by two “dark” steps, which can only occur close to or above the “glass transition” temperature of proteins (12Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This implies a role for domain movements and/or reorganization of the protein for these stages of the catalytic mechanism. Subsequently, a thermophilic form of the enzyme has been used to identify two additional dark steps, which were shown to represent a series of ordered product release and cofactor binding events. First, NADP+ is released from the enzyme and then replaced by NADPH, before release of the Chlide product and subsequent binding of Pchlide has taken place (13Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by POR has also been followed in real time at room temperature after initiating catalysis with a 50-fs laser pulse. The study revealed that the reaction, and hence the associated protein motions, can proceed on a picosecond time scale (14Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Grondelle R. Groot M.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The determination of the chemical nature of the intermediates formed during the catalytic cycle offers an exciting opportunity to solve the entire reaction mechanism. Although it has been shown that the POR-NADP+-Chlide product complex is only produced after the first dark step (13Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the exact molecular nature of the intermediate formed after the initial photochemistry, which is essential to our understanding of the overall catalytic mechanism, remains unclear. The product of this light-driven step is a nonfluorescent intermediate with a broad absorbance band at 696 nm (A696) (11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EPR measurements using etioplast membranes and heterologously expressed protein have suggested that this intermediate is a radical species (10Lebedev N. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Belyaeva O.B. Timofeev K.N. Litvin F.F. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 15: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, other studies have not detected any free radicals (16Townley H.E. Griffiths W.T. Nugent J.P. FEBS Letts. 1998; 422: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), leading to an alternative model in which the A696 intermediate is thought to represent charge transfer states between the Pchlide and NADPH substrates (17Raskin V.I. Schwartz A. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 74: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The unique presence of a chlorophyll-like molecule in the active site of POR allows techniques such as EPR (18Un S. Dorlet P. Rutherford A.W. App. Magn. Reson. 2001; 21: 341-361Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Lubitz W. Lendzian F. Bittl Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) (20Rigby S.E.J. Evans M.C.W. Heathcote P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and Stark spectroscopies (21Lockhart D.J. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 48: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), which have proven to be invaluable for the analysis of photosynthetic systems, to be used to follow catalytic events in an enzyme reaction for the first time. Consequently, in the present work we have used a combination of these approaches in conjunction with low temperature absorbance spectroscopy to characterize the A696 intermediate and show that the photochemical step involves hydride transfer from the NADPH molecule to form a charge transfer complex. Although illumination of the enzyme-substrate complex at 180 K does give rise to two distinct EPR signals, indicating the formation of radical species, these are likely to be by-products of charge transfer complex formation or not relevant to the enzyme mechanism. Stark spectroscopy, which monitors the spectral changes induced by an electric field on the optical absorbance or emission spectra of a molecule, has confirmed that A696 has a significant amount of charge transfer character. In addition, low temperature absorbance measurements have revealed that the NADPH is oxidized during the photochemistry, which has allowed us to propose a mechanism for this stage of catalysis. Sample Preparation and Formation of A696 Intermediate—Recombinant POR from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was over-produced and purified as previously described (12Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Pchlide was isolated from Rhodobacter capsulatus ZY5 cultures as previously described (11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Samples for the EPR and ENDOR experiments initially contained 600 μm Pchlide, 5 mm NADPH/NADP+, and 750 μm POR in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% (v/v) Genapol X-080, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol in the absence of iodine and were not prepared on a vacuum line. The samples were illuminated in an ethanol bath at 180 K by a Schott KL1500 electronic cold light source (1500 μmol m–2 s–1 white light) for 10 min and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Subsequent experiments were also carried out at lower concentrations of 200 μm Pchlide, 4 mm NADPH, and 750 μm POR. Samples for the Stark experiments contained 1 mm Pchlide, 1.5 mm NADPH, and 700 μm POR in 44% glycerol, 20% sucrose, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% (v/v) Genapol X-080, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The A696 intermediate was formed by illuminating samples at 180 K with a 150-W Tungsten halogen lamp (Oriel; 1500 μmol m–2 s–1 white light) for 10 min. The temperature of the sample was monitored directly with a thermocouple sensor (Comark). Preparation of Cation Radicals in Vitro—Pchlide and Chlide cation radicals were formed by oxidation of solutions in dry 10:1 dichloromethane:tetrahydrofuran, using a 5-fold excess of resublimed iodine, on a high vacuum line. The samples were transferred anaerobically to quartz EPR tubes and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. EPR and ENDOR Spectroscopy—EPR and ENDOR spectra were obtained at X-band using a Bruker ESP 300 EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 liquid helium cryostat. Conditions of measurement were as indicated in the figure legends. Spin intensities of EPR spectra were quantified by double-integration and calibrated against a sample of known concentration of photo-oxidized P700 in Photosystem I particles from spinach, prepared using Triton X-100 as described previously (24Williams-Smith D.L. Heathcote P. Sihra C.K. Evans M.C.W. Biochem. J. 1978; 170: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The concentration of P700 was determined optically from an ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectrum using an extinction coefficient of 64 mm–1 cm–1 at 703 nm. P700•+ was generated by illuminating the sample in the EPR tube for 60 s and freezing in liquid nitrogen under illumination. Stark Spectroscopy—Stark measurements were carried out as previously described (25Beekman L.M.P. Steffen M. van Stokkum I.H.M. Olsen J.D. Hunter C.N. Boxer S.G. van Grondelle R. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 7284-7292Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Palacios M.A. Frese R.N. Gradinaru C.C. van Stokkum I.H.M. Premvardhan L.L. Horton P. Ruban A.V. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H.

Acta Bioenerg. 2004; 1656: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The optical path length of the Stark cell was 100 μm, and measurements were carried out at 77 K (Oxford cryostat, DN1704) with the sample immersed in liquid nitrogen. The Stark effect was detected by lock-in amplification at 2ω, where ω is the frequency of the modulated electric field applied to the sample, which was set to 312 Hz. The angle between the electric vector of the linearly polarized probe light and the direction of the applied field, χ, was set to the magic angle of 54.7°. The excitation source was a 150-W Xenon lamp (Oriel). The magnitude of the shift in the optical transition energy observed when an electric field is applied is directly correlated with the change in dipole moment and polarizability, Δμ and Δα, between the ground and excited states. The spectral changes caused by the presence of an electric field can be described quantitatively in terms of the zero, first, and second derivatives of the ground state absorbance spectrum (23Bublitz G.U. Boxer S.G Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1997; 48: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To estimate the magnitude of Δμ and Δα, a simultaneous fit of the absorption and Stark spectra was performed based on a nonlinear least squares fitting program, as previously reported (26Palacios M.A. Frese R.N. Gradinaru C.C. van Stokkum I.H.M. Premvardhan L.L. Horton P. Ruban A.V. van Grondelle R. van Amerongen H. Biochim. Biophys.

Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 2002; 1554: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two types of analysis were performed on the spectra. First, the absorbance and Stark spectra were fitted simultaneously with Gaussian (skewed) absorbance bands for the absorbance and their first and second derivatives for the Stark spectrum, providing estimates of Δμ and Tr(Δα) for each Gaussian function. Second, a simultaneous fit of the absorbance and Stark spectra with a polynomial function (Bspline) (29Frese R.N. Oberheide U. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Grondelle R. Foidl M. Oelze J. van Amerongen H. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 54: 115-126Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and its first and second derivatives was attempted. In both analyses, no contribution of the zero derivative was needed to explain the observed Stark signals. Because f, the local field correction factor, which takes into account the enhancement of the electric field at the site of the molecule because of the environment, is not known, estimated values of Δμ and Tr(Δα) are given in terms of D/f and Å3/f 2, respectively, where D = 3.34 × 10–36 C·m and Å3 = 1.113 × 10–40 C·m2/V. Low Temperature Absorbance Spectroscopy—Samples containing 9 μm Pchlide, 11 μm NADPH, and 40 μm POR in 44% glycerol, 20% sucrose, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% (v/v) Genapol X-080, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol were maintained at the required temperature using an OpstistatDN nitrogen bath cryostat (Oxford Instruments). The temperature of the sample was monitored directly with a thermocouple sensor (Comark). The first light-dependent step in the reaction was initiated by illuminating samples for 10 min at a range of temperatures up to 190 K with a Schott KL1500 electronic cold light source (1500 μmol m–2 s–1 white light). The samples were then warmed and maintained for 10 min at gradually higher temperatures in the dark. Absorbance spectra were recorded with a Cary 500 Scan UV-visible near infrared (Varian) spectrophotometer at 77 K. Normalization of the spectra and difference spectra were calculated using the Galactics software. Detection of Radical Species Using EPR Spectroscopy—Illumination at 180 K of samples containing 750 μm POR, 600 μm Pchlide, and either NADP+ or NADPH generated radical species that are detectable by EPR (Fig. 1). The signals are characteristic of radical cations of porphyrins and chlorins, with linewidths of between 0.875 and 1.05 millitesla and g values ranging between g = 2.0025 and g = 2.0030 (30Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991Google Scholar). However, slightly different EPR signals were observed depending on whether the NADP+ or NADPH cofactor was present. In the presence of NADP+ a radical at g = 2.0030 with a linewidth (ΔHptp; linewidth peak-to-peak of first derivative EPR spectrum) of 0.82 millitesla was observed (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in the presence of NADPH, the EPR spectrum clearly shows two overlapped spectra (Fig. 1D), one appearing to be identical to the POR-NADP+-Pchlide spectrum in Fig. 1A, the other a new, broader species with a linewidth of 0.89 millitesla at g = 2.0024 (Fig. 1E). A comparison of these EPR signals with those from Pchlide and Chlide cations generated in vitro (Fig. 1, C and F) suggests that the species generated by illumination of POR in the presence of NADP+ resembles a Pchlide cation, whereas the radical generated in the presence of NADPH may contain features associated with the Chlide cation. As a control, samples of Pchlide in the absence of POR and cofactor were illuminated at 180 K. This also generated radical species (Fig. 1B), which were identical to the radical generated by illumination of the POR-NADP+-Pchlide complex. Characterization of Radical Species by ENDOR Spectroscopy—To further characterize and more unambiguously assign the various radical species generated following illumination, we carried out the first reported ENDOR spectroscopy of enzyme-bound Pchlide complexes and of the cation radicals of Pchlide and Chlide formed in vitro (Fig. 2). In an ENDOR spectrum each nucleus gives rise to a pair of lines separated by a frequency difference, called the hyperfine coupling constant, (hfc), corresponding to the energy of interaction between the unpaired electron and the nucleus divided by Planck's constant. The hfcs obtained for each sample are shown in Table 1. Frozen solution ENDOR spectra of chlorophyll radicals and the radical states of related compounds are known to show only features arising from hyperfine coupling to methyl groups and some CH2 groups at positions β to the π orbital containing the unpaired electron (the singly occupied molecular orbital) (31Kurreck H.

The POR-NADP+-Pchlide spectrum and the Pchlide cation radical in vitro both exhibit four apparent methyl group features corresponding to hfcs smaller than 6.5 MHz (Fig. 2). Such a pattern of hfcs is unknown for any previously characterized chlorophyll-like radical, and differences in hfcs between the two spectra strongly suggest that a Pchlide cation radical is bound to POR. However, the ENDOR spectrum arising from the POR-NADPH-Pchlide sample is complex and contains additional features similar to those measured from the in vitro Chlide cation radical.TABLE 1hfcs obtained using ENDOR spectroscopyFeatureHyperfine couplingPOR + Pchlide + NADP+Pchlide cation in vitroPOR + Pchlide + NADPHChlide cation in vitroAssignmentMHz14.23.35.45.42-Methyl24.84.06.06.27-Methyl35.44.6NANA18-Methyl46.25.77.57.512-Methyl57.57.89.08.517-β-H Open table in a new tab Quantification of Radicals by EPR—To evaluate the role played by these light-generated radicals in the catalytic mechanism EPR samples (200 μm Pchlide, 4 mm NADPH and 750 μm POR) were illuminated at 180 K, and the spin intensities of EPR spectra were quantified by double-integration. The EPR radicals generated were equivalent to 9.7 μm spins. Absorbance spectra taken before after illumination of the EPR samples showed that almost all of the Pchlide (200 μm) had been converted (data not shown) so the concentration of the radical species is not stoichiometric (less than 5%) with formation of the A696 state. The A696 Intermediate Has a Stark Signal—The absorbance spectrum, its second derivative and the Stark spectrum of the POR-NADPH-Pchlide complex were recorded at 77 K after illumination at 180 K (Fig. 3). The applied electric field was F = 1.9 × 105 V/cm–1. The broad absorbance band of the nonfluorescent catalytic intermediate in Fig. 3A is similar to those previously reported (11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and is highly asymmetric, extending as far as 800 nm. The second derivative of this spectrum (Fig. 3B) exhibits minima at 632 and 643 nm, which correlate with the absorbance maximum at 630 nm and the shoulder at 642 nm, and a very broad and shallow minimum located at 699 nm (Fig. 3B, inset). The 77 K Stark signal of the POR-NADPH-Pchlide complex illuminated at 180 K (Fig. 3C) also shows minima at 632 and 644 nm, which strongly resemble the second derivative of the absorbance spectrum. The red-most Stark signal is characterized by a minimum at 727 nm and a maximum at 704 nm (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, there is no minimum at 699 nm, which would have been expected if the Stark signal from the A696 intermediate was dominated by a difference in dipole moment. There is also no zero crossing at ∼695–699 nm, which would have been characteristic of a change in polarizability between the ground and excited states. Furthermore, a combination of a change in dipole moment and polarizability cannot explain the observed Stark effect, because the signal appears to be significantly red-shifted with respect to the observed absorbance maximum at 696 nm. Hence, it would appear that there must be more than one state contributing to the absorbance band at 696 nm. To characterize the observed Stark signals and provide estimates of the magnitude of the electro-optic parameters of each of the species contributing to the absorbance spectrum, a simultaneous fit of the absorbance and Stark spectra was performed, to test whether the 696 nm absorbing intermediate(s) exhibit some charge transfer character. If this is the case, large values of Δμ and/or of Tr(Δα) are expected (23Bublitz G.U. Boxer S.G Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1997; 48: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), similar to those observed for bacterial reaction center (21Lockhart D.J. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta Bioenerg. 2004; 1656: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). An analysis performed with a Bspline function for the absorbance and the first and second derivatives of the Stark spectrum (data not shown) shows that the 632and 644-nm signals can be well described by a combination of both Δμ and Tr(Δα), giving values of Δμ = 2.2 D/f and Tr(Δα) = 30 Å3/f 2. No reliable fits were achieved for a simultaneous fit of the absorbance and second derivatives of this function for the Stark spectrum in the 700–800-nm region (data not shown), suggesting that the broad absorbance band at 696-nm may arise from more than one species. However, a simultaneous fit of the 665–800-nm region for the absorbance spectrum with (skewed) Gaussian functions, and their first and second derivatives for the Stark spectrum (Fig. 4) yielded two components, one peaking at 730 nm (full width at half-maximum, 868 cm–1), and the other one peaking at 694 nm (full width at half-maximum, 856 cm–1). Estimates for the Δμ and Tr(Δα) parameters associated with each of the Gaussian bands are shown in Table 2. Both bands exhibited large Δμ values, which are characteristic of optical transitions involving states with charge transfer character (21Lockhart D.J. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The difference spectra in Fig. 5A show that upon illumination between 120 K and 190 K, there is the disappearance of an absorbance band at ∼338 nm, which correlates with the absorbance maximum of NADPH. This is associated with the decrease of the photoactive enzyme-bound Pchlide band at 642 nm and the formation of the A696 intermediate. The temperature dependence of the absorbance decrease at 338 nm mirrors both the disappearance of A642 and the increase in the A696 band (Fig. 5B). The maximum decrease in absorbance at 338 nm corresponds to an NADPH concentration of 8.8 μm, which correlates with the Pchlide concentration used in the experiment. No additional changes to the absorbance spectra at 338 nm were observed for later stages in the catalytic cycle (12Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) when preilluminated samples were warmed to progressively higher temperatures between 190 K and room temperature in the dark (data not shown). POR is a biologically important enzyme in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway (1Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 642-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), as well as a useful model system for studying hydride and proton transfer mechanisms. The ability to freeze in various catalytic intermediates at low temperatures, in this case the first identifiable intermediate, A696, is a crucial step in our understanding of the enzyme mechanism (10Lebedev N. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previous work has provided contradicting reports on the nature of the catalytic intermediate formed after the initial photochemistry, which can occur below 200 K. This nonfluorescent intermediate has a broad absorbance band at 696 nm (11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and has been suggested to represent either a radical species (10Lebedev N. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Belyaeva O.B. Timofeev K.N. Litvin F.F. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 15: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or a charge transfer complex (17Raskin V.I. Schwartz A. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 74: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have now used a combination of EPR, ENDOR, Stark, and low temperature absorbance spectroscopy to show that this intermediate is a charge transfer complex formed by hydride transfer from NADPH. Although EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy studies show that radical states can be formed after illumination at 180 K, these species are not quantitatively significant and do not appear to be intermediates in the catalytic mechanism. The EPR and ENDOR spectra clearly show the formation of two radical species, which are dependent on the oxidation state of the nicotinamide cofactor employed. In the presence of NADP+, a Pchlide cation radical is formed, although this species exhibits features that differ from that of the Pchlide cation radical formed in vitro. In the presence of NADPH, an additional radical is formed that appears to contain features that are also found in the Chlide cation. It is possible that these differences result from structural distortions in the Pchlide molecule created by binding to the enzyme. However, the concentration of the radical species formed was calculated to be less than 5% of the total Pchlide concentration. In addition, Pchlide radicals are also formed in the absence of protein and when NADP+ is present, which are conditions that do not give rise to the A696 nonfluorescent intermediate upon illumination at 180 K (11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can conclude that the radical species formed in this study are not associated with the formation of the nonfluorescent A696 intermediate and are unlikely to be part of the reaction mechanism. It is tempting to speculate that such radicals may form by excess light causing the removal of an electron from the Pchlide molecule. Hence, it is important that great caution is taken in the interpretation of previous reports of radical species (10Lebedev N. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Belyaeva O.B. Timofeev K.N. Litvin F.F. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 15: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), because no reference spectra of Pchlide and Chlide radicals were recorded, and the signals were not quantified. To gain further insights into the A696 state, we have now applied Stark spectroscopy, which has previously been used to study the effects of charge separation in many photosynthetic systems. This first application of the technique to POR has probed the effect of an externally applied electric field on the spectroscopic properties of the enzyme-bound catalytic intermediate. A large Stark effect, indicative of charge transfer character, is associated with the broad absorbance band at 696 nm and provides clear evidence that charge-separated states are formed during the initial photochemistry. However, the Stark spectrum could not be resolved into a single state, and two bands with similar full width at half-maximum values (∼860 cm–1) were required to fit the signal accurately. This would appear to suggest that more than one charge transfer state is associated with the nonfluorescent A696 intermediate. It is likely that the differences in the Stark properties of the two bands of the A696 intermediate arise from differences in the coupling of the proposed charge transfer states within the enzyme complex. In addition, negative polarizablity values were obtained, which implies that the charge transfer states are in the ground state. Our experimental data are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial photochemistry gives rise to more than one intermediate state with different charge transfer characteristics in the ground state (17Raskin V.I. Schwartz A. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 74: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that charge transfer complexes are formed between Pchlide, POR, and NADPH upon illumination at 180 K. Previous studies on POR have relied on spectroscopic signals from Pchlide to report on catalytic events in the active site of the enzyme. We have now extended this approach to follow the oxidation state of the NADPH cofactor during the catalytic cycle and show that the conversion of NADPH to NADP+ occurs during the initial light-driven step. This is accompanied by the disappearance of the POR-NADPH-Pchlide absorbance band at 642 nm and the formation of the A696 intermediate. The identical temperature dependence of these three processes provides thermodynamic evidence that they represent the same chemical event. There are no further absorbance changes at 340 nm during any of the subsequent steps, which confirms that the hydride is transferred from the NADPH molecule to the C-17 position of Pchlide during the initial photochemistry rather than one of the dark steps in the reaction pathway. This is strongly supported by our previous findings that the initial photochemical step does not occur when NADP+ is included in place of NADPH and only proceeds when Pchlide is in a ternary complex with POR and NADPH. Because the reaction has previously been shown to occur on a picosecond time scale (14Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Grondelle R. Groot M.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we conclude that the hydride must be transferred on a similar ultrafast time scale. Therefore, by using a combination of spectroscopic techniques, we are now able to propose a detailed mechanism for the initial photochemistry of the reaction (Fig. 6). The absorbance of a photon by Pchlide creates a charge separation across the C-17–C-18 double bond causing the negatively charged hydride ion to be transferred from the pro-S face of NADPH to the C-17 position of Pchlide, thereby creating charged regions on the cofactor and pigment molecules. This newly formed intermediate has no “free,” unpaired electrons and is not a radical species but has a considerable amount of charge transfer character, which is detectable by Stark spectroscopy. This would then facilitate the transfer of a proton from the protein to the C-18 position of Pchlide during the subsequent first dark reaction. We thank Prof. J. H. A. Nugent (University College, London), who was involved in preliminary EPR characterizations of illuminated POR samples."

We recently discovered that Ca2+ influx alone can activate conventional protein kinase C (PKC) as well as novel PKC in insulin-secreting (INS-1) cells. Building on this earlier finding, here we examined whether GLP-1-evoked Ca2+ signaling can activate PKCα and PKCϵ at a substimulatory concentration of glucose (3 mm) in INS-1 cells. We first showed that GLP-1 translocated endogenous PKCα and PKCϵ from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Next, we assessed the phosphorylation state of the PKC substrate, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), by using MARCKS-GFP. GLP-1 translocated MARCKS-GFP to the cytosol in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and the GLP-1-evoked translocation of MARCKS-GFP was blocked by PKC inhibitors, either a broad PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I, or a PKCϵ inhibitor peptide, antennapedia peptide-fused pseudosubstrate PKCϵ-(149–164) (antp-PKCϵ) and a conventional PKC inhibitor, Gö-6976. Furthermore, forskolin-induced translocation of MARCKS-GFP was almost completely inhibited by U73122, a putative inhibitor of phospholipase C. These observations were verified in two different ways by demonstrating 1) forskolin-induced translocation of the GFP-tagged C1 domain of PKCγ and 2) translocation of PKCα-DsRed and PKCϵ-GFP. In addition, PKC inhibitors reduced forskolin-induced insulin secretion in both INS-1 cells and rat islets. Thus, GLP-1 can activate PKCα and PKCϵ, and these GLP-1-activated PKCs may contribute considerably to insulin secretion at a substimulatory concentration of glucose.

Upon binding to its receptor, GLP-1 increases cAMP levels via G-protein-coupled activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (1MacDonald P.E. El-Kholy W.

Pflugers Arch. 1998; 435: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms by which GLP-1 potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cells is to modulate Ca2+ signaling in several ways: 1) GLP-1 induces membrane depolarization by the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) and/or by the opening of cAMP-operated nonselective cation channels, eliciting Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) (3Holz IV, G.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); 2) PKA-dependent phosphorylation of L-type VDCCs increases the integrated Ca2+ current by slowing the time course of inactivation and augmenting the Ca2+ current (2Gromada J.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) GLP-1 promotes Ca2+ mobilization from Ca2+ stores (5Gromada J. Dissing S. Bokvist K. Renstrom E. Frokjaer-Jensen J. Wulff B.S. Rorsman P. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to the processes mentioned above, which increase the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), other roles of GLP-1 as a Ca2+ modulator are gradually being elucidated. Protein kinase C (PKC) plays a role in insulin secretion that is equally important as that of cAMP/PKA signaling. Among 10 identified PKCs, conventional PKC (cPKC; PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ) is activated by Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG), and novel PKC (nPKC; PKCδ, PKCϵ, PKCη, and PKCθ) is activated by DAG in a Ca2+-independent manner (6Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 7Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 8Toker A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, DAG is thought to be a product of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis. This hydrolysis is caused by activation of phospholipase C (PLC) following agonist binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor. We have recently demonstrated a new mechanism by which Ca2+ influx alone, via VDCCs, can generate DAG (9Mogami H. Zhang H. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Saito N. Kojima I. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9896-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This occurs through Ca2+-dependent PLC activation, leading to activation of PKCα and PKCθ as representatives of cPKC and nPKC in INS-1 cells, which are an insulin-secreting cell line. An additional line of evidence shows that GLP-1 increases not only levels of cAMP but also levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), the other product of PIP2 hydrolysis (2Gromada J. Holst J.J.

These observations prompted us to investigate whether GLP-1 can activate both cPKC and nPKC in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Recent advances in the use of fluorescent proteins, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (DsRed), have allowed us to investigate PKC activity in intact living cells by monitoring translocation of GFP-tagged PKCs and related proteins (11Almholt K.

Using this approach, we have established the following fusion proteins as markers of PKC activity in INS-1 cells: 1) fluorescent protein-tagged PKCs, PKCα-GFP (DsRed), and PKCϵ-GFP; 2) the C1 domain of PKCγ-GFP (C12-GFP) for DAG binding as a DAG biosensor; and 3) myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS)-GFP as a substrate of PKC. These markers enable us to probe many aspects of the mechanisms of GLP-1-evoked PKC activation using epifluorescence microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The present study was conducted to examine whether GLP-1 activates PKCα and PKCϵ at a substimulatory concentration of glucose.

The roles of PKCα and PKCϵ in forskolin-induced insulin secretion were also evaluated in INS-1 cells and rat islets. Here we provide fresh evidence that GLP-1 can activate PKCα and PKCϵ through Ca2+-dependent activation of PLC, suggesting that GLP-1-evoked PKC activation contributes significantly to basal insulin secretion. PKCα-pEGFP and pDsRed1-N1 were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). pEGFP of PKCα-pEGFP was replaced with pDsRed1-N1. The plasmids encoding PKCϵ-GFP, MARCKS-GFP, and C12-GFP were prepared as described previously (9Mogami H. Zhang H. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Saito N. Kojima I. Petersen O.H. J. Biol.

Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. The culture medium was RPMI 1640 (Sigma) with 10 mm glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μm mercaptoethanol. For fluorescence imaging, the cells were cultivated on a 35-mm glass bottom dish (Asahi Techno Glass, Japan) at 50% confluence 2 days before transfection. A plasmid encoding the GFP or DsRed-tagged proteins was transfected into the cells by lipofection using TransIT™-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI). Experiments were performed within 2 days of transient transfection. We established six stable transfectants from parental INS-1 cells expressing MARCKS-GFP by G418 selection and cloning. Two of these, referred to as M5 and M6, were employed for translocation experiments. The standard extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3). The solution for membrane depolarization contained 105 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 3 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3). In some experiments, CaCl2 was not included (the Ca2+-free solution contained 0.2 mm EGTA). The cells placed on a glass bottom dish were perfused continuously from a gravity-fed system. Experiments were performed in the standard extracellular solution at room temperature, unless otherwise noted. Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) contained 119 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.15 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3). Ionomycin, 1,2-dioctyl-sn-glycerol (DiC8), 8-bromo-cAMP, and forskolin were purchased from Sigma. Fura2-AM (hereafter termed Fura2) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Glucagon-like peptide 1 (human, 7–36 amide) was obtained from the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Anti-cPKCα (H-7) and anti-nPKCϵ (C-15) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). PKC inhibitors, bisindolylmaleimide I (BIS) and Gö-6976, U73122, U73433, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) were from Calbiochem. All other chemicals were from Sigma. A PKC-ϵ inhibitor peptide, antennapedia-PKC-(149–164) (antp-PKCϵ) (RRMKW KKERM RPRKR QGAVR RRV), was synthesized by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). It is a tandemly synthesized peptide comprising peptides from the third α-helix of the homeodomain of antennapedia (residues 52–58, known as penetratin) (19Derossi D. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A.

Physiol. 1997; 272: C263-C269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antennapedia (antp), used as a control, was also synthesized by Takara Shuzo. Epifluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence images were captured at 5-s intervals using an Olympus inverted microscope (numerical aperture = 1.35, ×40, oil immersion objective) equipped with a cooled (–20 °C) coupled charge device digital camera (ORCA-ER, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and recorded and analyzed on an Aquacosmos imaging station (Hamamatsu Photonics). The excitation light source was a 150-watt xenon lamp with a high speed scanning polychromatic light source (C7773; Hamamatsu Photonics). GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm, whereas Fura2 for [Ca2+]i measurement was excited at wavelengths alternating between 340 and 380 nm. The emitted light was collected through a 535/45-nm band pass filter with a 505-nm dichroic mirror, and a short pass filter of 330–495 nm was used to reduce background fluorescence between the dichroic mirror and the emission filter, allowing simultaneous measurement of GFP and Fura2 fluorescence. We measured the fluorescence intensity of the GFP-tagged proteins in the cytosol of the cell, excluding the nucleus as a marker of translocation. These values (F) were normalized to each initial value (F0) so that the relative fluorescence change was referred to as F/F0. The cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged proteins were loaded with 2 μm Fura2 in the standard extracellular solution for 30 min at room temperature. We previously confirmed that we can distinguish between GFP and Ca2+ signals under this experimental condition (9Mogami H. Zhang H. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Saito N. Kojima I. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9896-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice and used within 2 h. The Fura2 ratio was calibrated by exposure to 10 μm ionomycin and 10 mm Ca2+ or 10 mm EGTA in the Fura2-loaded cells that were not transfected with the GFP-tagged proteins (Fmax = 4.75, Fmin = 0.47, β = 9). A dissociation constant of 150 nm for Ca2+ and Fura2 at room temperature was used (23Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). TIRFM or Evanescent Wave Microscopy—To obtain a high signal-to-noise ratio as compared with conventional epifluorescence microscopy, we installed a TIRFM unit (Olympus) into the same imaging system described above. The incidental light was introduced from the objective lens for TIRFM (Olympus; numerical aperture = 1.45, ×60) to generate the electromagnetic zone or so-called “evanescent field.” The evanescent wave selectively excites fluorophores within 100 nm of the glass-water interface, which enabled us to monitor fluorescent proteins at and/or beneath the plasma membrane of a cell. GFP and DsRed were excited by a 488-nm laser, and the light emitted was collected through 535/45- and 605/50-nm emission filters, respectively. For simultaneous measurement of the relative fluorescence intensity changes of PKCα-DsRed and PKCϵ-GFP, the signals from GFP and DsRed excited by a 488-nm laser were collected simultaneously through an emission splitter (W-view; Hamamatsu Photonics) equipped with a 550-nm dichroic mirror and two emission band pass filters, 535/45 and 605/50 nm. INS-1 cells cultured on a coverslip at about 80% confluence were preincubated with KRB containing 3 mm glucose for 1–2 h and then either not treated (as a control) or treated with GLP-1 in buffer for 10 min. They were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and stained with anti-PKCα or anti-PKCϵ (1:100) for 1 h. After three washes in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, cells were labeled with fluorescein isothiocynate isomer 1-conjugated immunoglobulins (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) (1:50–200) for 1 h. After three washes, cells were mounted on a glass microscope slide with Dako fluorescent mounting medium and observed under an epifluorescence microscope. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were obtained from Imai Animal Company (Saitama, Japan). Pancreatic islets were isolated by digestion with collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan) (24Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Islets were detected by inspection under a microscope. Insulin secretion from pancreatic islets was measured in a static incubation system as described previously (25Yamada S. Komatsu M. Sato Y. Yamauchi K. Kojima I. Aizawa T. Hashizume K. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4203-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Insulin secretion in INS-1 cells was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay insulin kit (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). INS-1 cells were subcultured in 35-mm dishes and grown up to 80–90% confluence for 3–4 days. INS-1 cells and freshly isolated islets for each experimental group (5 size-matched islets/group) were preincubated in KRB buffer containing 3 mm glucose at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. The solution was then replaced with KRB alone or KRB containing various test agents. BIS and Gö-6976 were added directly with secretion solution, whereas antp-PKCϵ was added 1 h prior to the insulin secretion experiment. The stimulation time was carefully adjusted to standardize the times for solution changing and sample collection. The experiments were terminated by withdrawal of the supernatant solution after 1 h of incubation. The supernatant was then placed on an ice bath. Samples were kept at –20 °C until the insulin assay was performed. All samples were assayed in duplicate. Insulin concentration in rat islets was determined using a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay system as described previously (26Mashima H. Ohnishi H. Wakabayashi K. Mine T. Miyagawa J. Hanafusa T. Seno M. Yamada H. Kojima I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Data are given as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using Student's t test for paired observations. GLP-1 Triggers as Well as Amplifies Ca2+ Oscillation at a Substimulatory Concentration of Glucose—We first examined the temporal profile of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in response to GLP-1 (100 nm) in Fura2-loaded INS-1 cells. To reduce the effect of glucose on GLP-1 receptor-mediated signal transduction as much as possible, we used a standard extracellular solution containing 2.5 mm Ca2+ and 3 mm glucose, which is a substimulatory concentration for electrical activity and insulin secretion. In this condition, GLP-1 (100 nm) triggered and amplified [Ca2+]i oscillations in, respectively, more than 20 and 50% of the Fura2-loaded INS-1 cells (n = 107) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This result is consistent with observations that GLP-1 alone can generate a Ca2+ signal at a substimulatory concentration of glucose in βTC cells and MIN6 cells (3Holz IV, G.G. Leech C.A.

Kanno T. Nakano K. Takeo T. Dobashi Y. Wakui M. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Application of 10 μm forskolin (n = 122) and 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP (n = 150) yielded similar results (data not shown), confirming that GLP-1-initiated Ca2+ signaling occurs downstream of adenylate cyclase in INS-1 cells.TABLE 1Effect of GLP-1, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMP on [Ca2+]i at a substimulatory concentration of glucoseAgonistFraction of INS-1 cells responding to GLP-1, forskolin, and 8-bromo-cAMPTriggerAmplificationGLP-1 (100 nm)24 of 107 (20.5%)57 of 107 (54%)Forskolin (10 μm)21 of 122 (17.2%)80 of 122 (65.6%)Br-cAMP (1 mm)21 of 150 (14%)114 of 150 (76%) Open table in a new tab Translocation of Endogenous PKCα and PKCϵ from the Cytosol to the Plasma Membrane in Response to GLP-1—We have recently demonstrated that depolarization-evoked Ca2+ influx via VDCCs can activate cPKC and nPKC through Ca2+-dependent PLC in INS-1 cells (9Mogami H. Zhang H. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Saito N. Kojima I. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9896-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether GLP-1-induced Ca2+ signaling activates cPKC as well as nPKC. Thus, we examined translocation of endogenous PKCα and PKCϵ as representatives of cPKC and nPKC. Among the multiple PKC isoforms expressed in pancreatic β cells, PKCα and PKCϵ are likely to play a dominant role in glucose-induced insulin secretion (15Mendez C.F. Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Hoy M.

An immunocytochemical assay clearly showed that 100 nm GLP-1 in the presence of 3 mm glucose induced translocation of endogenous PKCα and PKCϵ from the cytosol to the plasma membrane; this translocation is a marker of PKC activation (Fig. 2), indicating that GLP-1 can activate the two PKCs at a substimulatory concentration of glucose. GLP-1 Translocates MARCKS-GFP from the Plasma Membrane to the Cytosol—We next employed GFP-tagged MARCKS (MARCKS-GFP), a putative substrate for PKC (29Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as another temporal marker of PKC activation in order to substantiate our above finding of GLP-1-induced activation of PKC in a living cell. When activated PKC phosphorylates plasma membrane-anchored MARCKS, the phosphorylated form of MARCKS translocates from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (30Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26449-26457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This translocation is accompanied by reciprocal changes in the fluorescence intensities of MARCKS-GFP in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane (9Mogami H. Zhang H. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Saito N. Kojima I. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9896-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured the relative fluorescence change of MARCKS-GFP in the cytosol as a marker of translocation. Simultaneous monitoring of MARCKS translocation and [Ca2+]i in INS-1 cells transiently expressing MARCKS-GFP was performed. As seen in Fig. 3A, the application of 100 nm GLP-1 resulted in repetitive translocation of MARCKS-GFP to the cytosol following [Ca2+]i oscillations, and this translocation was synchronous with [Ca2+]i oscillations, indicating that a GLP-1-evoked Ca2+ signal can induce activation of PKC. We observed similar responses to forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP (data not shown). PKC Inhibitors Block GLP-1-evoked MARCKS Translocation—The above observation prompted us to test whether PKC inhibitors block GLP-1-evoked translocation of MARCKS. In order to evaluate more precisely the effect of a PKC inhibitor on a GLP-1-mediated PKC signaling pathway, we established two clonal lines of INS-1 cells stably expressing MARCKS-GFP (referred to as either M5 or M6 cells), more than 80% of which responded to GLP-1. Fig. 3B shows that the amplitude of MARCKS translocation induced by GLP-1 was comparable with that elicited by either acetylcholine (ACh; 100 μm) or a depolarizing concentration of potassium (40 mm K+) (n = 28), both of which might produce sufficient DAG to activate PKC (9Mogami H. Zhang H. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Saito N. Kojima I. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9896-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). First, we tested whether a broad PKC inhibitor, BIS (1 μm), blocks GLP-1-evoked MARCKS translocation. In contrast to the data in Fig. 3B, neither GLP-1 nor ACh induced MARCKS translocation, despite the [Ca2+]i elevation in the BIS-treated M5 cells (n = 20; control n = 24) (Fig. 3C). We then plotted the GLP-1-evoked increases in the relative fluorescence intensities from MARCKS-GFP in the cytosol (dFMAR) against the peak values of [Ca2+]i in the absence or presence of BIS. Fig. 3D clearly shows that GLP-1-evoked dFMAR increased with the peak [Ca2+]i elevation, whereas there was little change in GLP-1-evoked dFMAR, irrespective of the peak [Ca2+]i elevation in the BIS-treated M5 cells. We further examined the effect of two isoform-specific PKC inhibitors, Gö-6976 (31Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an inhibitor of conventional PKC, and antp-PKCϵ (14Zhang H. Nagasawa M. Yamada S. Mogami H. Suzuki Y. Kojima I. J. Physiol. 2004; 561: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of PKCϵ, on GLP-1-evoked dFMAR. antp-PKCϵ enables the pseudosubstrate to be loaded into intact cells. These two inhibitors, Gö-6976 and antp-PKCϵ, have been previously shown to inhibit phosphorylation of MARCKS at 1 and 75 μm, respectively (14Zhang H. Nagasawa M. Yamada S. Mogami H. Suzuki Y. Kojima I. J. Physiol. 2004; 561: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 3E shows that neither 1 μm Gö-6976 alone (n = 20; control n = 39) nor 75 μm antp-PKCϵ alone (n = 24) inhibited translocation of MARCKS induced by GLP-1. However, their combined treatment (n = 14) blocked it. These observations suggest that a GLP-1-mediated PKC signaling pathway exists. GLP-1-mediated Ca2+ Influx and Ca2+ Mobilization from Intracellular Ca2+ Stores Contribute to MARCKS Translocation—It is well established that GLP-1 elicits an increase in [Ca2+]i, which is derived from Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ mobilization from the intracellular Ca2+ store (5Gromada J. Dissing S. Bokvist K. Renstrom E. Frokjaer-Jensen J. Wulff B.S. Rorsman P. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We evaluated the relative contributions of these Ca2+ sources to GLP-1-mediated PKC signaling. Fig. 4A shows a representative experiment of this type (n = 45; control, n = 44). Upon removal of extracellular Ca2+, inhibition of the GLP-1-mediated Ca2+ influx led to a decrease in the two values: dFMAR and peak Ca2+ ratio (Fig. 4B). In addition to removal of the extracellular Ca2+, Ca2+ buffering in the cytosol by loading 20 μm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (n = 18) resulted in the marked suppression of these two parameters as compared with control cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that GLP-1 induces Ca2+-signal-dependent translocation of MARCKS. We also examined the mechanism by which GLP-1 elicits Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ stores in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Simultaneous monitoring of MARCKS translocation and [Ca2+]i revealed that GLP-1-evoked MARCKS translocation and [Ca2+]i elevation took place in 40% of the Fura2-loaded M5 cells examined (Fig. 4A), whereas none of these cells responded to GLP-1 in"

CB1 receptor stimulation did not activate either JNK or p38 MAPK pathways or the pro-proliferation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. However, serum removal or blockade of PI3K signaling by LY294002 transiently stimulated basal Krox-24 expression and increased CB1-mediated induction of Krox-24. This was consistent with a transient increase in pMEK, pERK, and pCREB levels following PI3K blockade. These data demonstrate that CB1-mediated activation of the Krox-24 transcription factor is negatively regulated through the PI3K-Akt pathway and reveals several points of signaling cross-talk between these two important kinase pathways.

The CB1 activation of the ERK pathway, c-Fos, and Krox-24 were strongly implicated by the authors in the protection against glutamate toxicity (10Marsicano G. Goodenough S. Monory K. Hermann H.

As described above Krox-24 and c-Fos are physiologically regulated by CB1 in specific neuronal cells and are likely involved in the long term neuronal changes induced by cannabinoids. Krox-24 has been associated with important biological functions such as the stabilization of long lasting long-term potentiation (14Dragunow M. Behav.

Although a wealth of research has been conducted into CB1 receptor signaling, there is very little known about the precise molecular pathways involved in the coupling of CB1 to Krox-24 in neuronal cells. We are particularly interested in delineating the signaling systems recruited by the CB1 receptor in neurons as we hypothesis that these are major areas of dysfunction in various neurological diseases (23van der Stelt M. Veldhuis W.B. Maccarrone M. Bar P.R. Nicolay K. Veldink G.A. Di Marzo V. Vliegenthart J.F. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 317-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), such as Huntington disease where loss of CB1 receptors is one of the earliest known molecular markers of the human disease (24Glass M. Dragunow M. Faull R.L. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to prise apart the complex diversity of signaling pathways capable of coupling to CB1 in various cellular contexts (25McAllister S.D. Glass M. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2002; 66: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Demuth D.G. Molleman A. Life Sci. 2006; 78: 549-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), we have used mouse Neuro2a neuronal cells. In these studies we investigated the involvement of the MAPK pathways in Krox-24 induction following CB1 receptor activation. We have demonstrated that CB1 can selectively activate the ERK pathway, which is crucially required for CB1-mediated Krox-24 induction. In addition, we have demonstrated that Krox-24 induction was not dependent upon PI3K/PKB signaling, and we discovered that this pathway can negatively regulate Krox-24 expression through intricate cross-talk signaling between the ERK and PI3K pathways. Neuro2a Cell Culture—Neuro2a cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), buffered with 25 mm Hepes (referred to as complete media), and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For harvesting, media were rinsed from cells with PBS, and cells were incubated with trypsin for 30-60 s. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 700 × g for 3 min and washed with complete media several times. For the experiments, Neuro2a cells were prepared in complete media and seeded at 5-10,000 cells/well for 96-well plates or 0.5 × 106 cells in 30-mm Petri dishes. Cells were allowed to recover overnight in complete media before undergoing treatments. All experimental treatments were prepared in complete media unless otherwise stated. HU210 (Tocris) and SR141716A (Tocris) stocks were prepared in ethanol and diluted in media to the appropriate concentration. The vehicle contained the equivalent concentration of ethanol (maximum of 0.1% ethanol). For the MEK inhibitor studies (UO126, Cell Signaling Technology), Neuro2a cells were pretreated with 10 μm UO126 or 0.1% Me2SO vehicle in complete media for 45 min. UO126 was present for the entire stimulation period for Krox-24 assays in order to prevent recovery of MEK activity. Neuro2a cells were differentiated by serum reduction (2% FBS/DMEM) or with 20 μm retinoic acid (RA; Sigma) in 2% FBS DMEM for 3 days. PCR and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from each sample using the Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction method and, following DNase I (Invitrogen) treatment, reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) each according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR primers were as follows: CB1 forward, 5′-atgaagtcgatcctagatggccttgcaga-3′, and CB1 reverse, 5′-tcacagagcctcggcagacgtg-3′ (27Helliwell R.J. Chamley L.W. Blake-Palmer K. Mitchell M.D. Wu J. Kearn C.S. Glass M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 5168-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CB1 primers amplify the 1.5-kb coding region of the CB1 receptor. krox-24 PCR primer sequences were as follows: forward, 5′-tgagaaggcgatggtggaga-3′, and reverse, 5′-ccaggctcaggtctccctgt-3′. These primers were designed to amplify a 467-bp amplicon. The PCR cycling parameters for CB1 and krox-24 were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, with final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR amplicons were gel-purified (HighPure extraction kit; Roche Applied Science) and cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) using routine methods and sequenced (Centre for Genomics and Proteomics, University of Auckland). DNA probes were prepared using Ready-to-Go labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blots were prepared as described previously using 20 μg of total RNA per sample (28Graham E.S. Hazlerigg D.G. Morgan P.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 156: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Membranes were pre-hybridized with Rapid-Hyb buffer (RPN 1636; Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min at 65 °C and then hybridized with denatured labeled probe at 65 °C for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was removed by serial washes in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS with the final stringent wash conducted at 60-65 °C using 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min. Blots were placed against autoradiographic Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) for an appropriate period of time (6 h to 5 days) to obtain sharp signals. Films were developed manually using Kodak D19 developer and Hypam fixer (Ilford Imaging UK Ltd.). Immunocytochemistry for CB1, Krox-24, Phospho-MEK (pMEK), and pERK—Immunocytochemistry was conducted on cells grown in 96-well plates or on glass coverslips for confocal fluorescent microscopy. The C-terminal anti-CB1 primary antibody (L14) was generously gifted by Dr. Ken Mackie and has been characterized previously (5Nyiri G. Cserep C. Szabadits E. Mackie K. Freund T.F. Neuroscience. 2005; 136: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this study L14 was used at 1:1000. The N-terminal anti-CB1 antibody (CB1-NT catalog number 44-310; Biosource International) was used at 1:400. Both CB1 receptor antibodies were validated by Western analysis with Neuro2a cell lysates, which detected a prominent product of ∼60 kDa (data not shown). Anti-Krox-24 (catalog number SC 189; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:2000. The pMEK antibody (catalog number 9121; Cell Signaling Technology,) was used at 1:500 and pERK (catalog number 9106; Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1000. Anti-rabbit Alexafluor 488 and 594 (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence at 1:400 dilution. For quantified immunocytochemistry experiments, biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (B7389; Sigma) secondary antibody was used in conjunction with extravidin peroxidase (Sigma) followed by diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as substrate. Each antibody was diluted in immunobuffer consisting of PBS with 1% goat serum and 0.4 mg/ml merthiolate and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. For intracellular targets, the immunobuffer was supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100. Nuclei were stained using 0.8 μg/ml Hoechst-33258 in PBS for 15 min. Quantification of Expression Using the Discovery 1 System— The high content Discovery 1 system was used to quantify the expression of Krox-24. Images of four adjacent sites within the center of each well were acquired at ×100 magnification, using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole UV light (405/465) and bright field on the Discovery-1 automated fluorescence microscope and image analysis system (Molecular Devices). Images were analyzed using Metamorph (version 6.2.6) image analysis software (Molecular Devices). 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole UV images (representing Hoechst-positive cell nuclei) were used to quantify total cell number within each image, whereas bright field images were used to quantify Krox-24 positive cells. The algorithm Find Spots identified positive cells based on region size (number of adjacent pixels within a specified radius) and staining intensity (contrast within immediate vicinity of stained objects). Time-lapsed Imaging—Time-lapsed microscopy was conducted using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope housed in a CO2 environmental chamber to maintain samples at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Images were captured using an AxioCam digital camera. Western Analysis—For Western analysis cells were stimulated for the appropriate time then dishes were placed on ice and cells washed two times with ice-cold HBS (10 mm Hepes buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8). Cells were harvested in 150 μl of HBS and 150 μlof SDS loading buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and then denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were stored at -85 °C until required. 10 μl of each sample was separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 100 V for 2-3 h using the Bio-Rad mini Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp), pre-wetted with methanol, using the Bio-Rad transfer system. Blots were probed with pAkt (1:2000; catalog number 9271, Cell Signaling Technology), pCREB (1:2000; catalog number 06-519 Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), pELK-1 (1:1000; catalog number SC-8406; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pERK (1:1000; catalog number 9101; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-JNK (1:1000; catalog number 9251; Cell Signaling Technology), pMEK (1:1000; catalog number 9128; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-p38 (1:1000; catalog number 9211; Cell Signaling Technology), pSEK-1 (1:1000; catalog number 9151; Cell Signaling Technology), and β-actin (1:30,000; catalog number AB6276; Abcam). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used in conjunction with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Blots were probed withβ-actin to assess loading and transfer efficacy. Expression of CB1 Receptors by Neuro2a Cells—cDNA from a number of neuronal cell lines was screened by PCR for the expression of the CB1 receptor gene. CB1-specific PCR primers amplified strongly from mouse Neuro2a cells and weakly from mouse P19 cells and human teratocarcinoma NT2 cells (data not shown). We did not detect endogenous CB1 receptors in human SK-N-SH cells or PC12 cells (negative control). These results were confirmed by Northern analysis, which demonstrated the existence of three abundant CB1 mRNA transcripts of 9.0, 6.0, and 1.5 kb. Fig. 1a shows the mRNA transcripts detected in two different preparations of untreated Neuro2a cultures. The location and relative abundance of CB1 in Neuro2a cells was studied by immunocytochemistry. Cell surface or intracellular CB1 localization was determined using the CB1-NT antibody under nonpermeabilized or permeabilized conditions (Fig. 1b). This revealed that most Neuro2a cells expressed moderate levels of receptor; however, based on fluorescence intensity, the majority of receptors was localized to the cytoplasm rather than the cell membrane. We and others have observed a similar pattern of localization in cell lines transfected with the CB1 receptor (29Leterrier C. Bonnard D. Carrel D. Rossier J. Lenkei Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36013-36021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) regardless of the expression level. The L14 antibody was used to validate total receptor localization as observed with the CB1-NT antibody. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the CB1 receptor was stored throughout the cytoplasm and also along the entire length of neuritic processes in Neuro2a cells (Fig. 1c). CB1 Receptor Activation of MAPK Pathways—We investigated the activation of the ERK, p38, and JNK MAPK pathways following activation of CB1 in Neuro2a cells by immunocytochemistry and Western analysis. The levels of pERK1/2 were increased by stimulation with the CB1 receptor agonist HU210 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2a). Both MEK and ERK were phosphorylated rapidly, and this pathway remained in an activated state throughout the time course. In some experiments there was a moderate increase in pERK levels in control cells following media replenishment, which contains fresh serum; however, there were no detectable changes in the levels of pMEK following media change (Fig. 2b). Antibodies specific to phospho-p38, phospho-JNK (data not shown), and phospho-SEK-1 (pSEK-1) failed to detect activation of these pathways in the Neuro2a cells by immunocytochemistry (data not shown) or Western blotting over 5-40 min. Time course of CB1-mediated Krox-24 Induction in Neuro2a Cells—Krox-24 is a member of the inducible transcription factor family. The CB1 agonist HU210 was tested across a range of concentrations from 10 pm to 10 μm inclusive with maximal increases in Krox-24 mRNA/protein observed at 100 nm HU210 (data not shown). We found krox-24 mRNA levels to be elevated in Neuro2a cells 40-60 min after CB1 stimulation with 100 nm HU210 by Northern analysis (Fig. 3a). We subsequently investigated the nuclear accumulation of the Krox-24 protein following cannabinoid stimulation over a similar time course. Basal Krox-24 staining was observed in ∼3-5% of cells under these culture conditions. In HU210-treated cells, the number of Krox-24 positive cells was increased from 60 min onward with expression peaking around 90-120 min and remaining elevated for the remainder of the 24-h study (Fig. 3b). The Krox-24 response showed considerable heterogeneity with typically 15-25% of cells strongly stained 90-120 min after initiation of cannabinoid agonist treatment (Fig. 3c). Following 24 h of agonist stimulation, total cell number was not significantly different from control wells. Nor did we observe any significant changes in cell morphology such as neurite sprouting when compared with controls. The expression levels of c-Fos and activation of CREB and ELK-1 were also measured as they are known downstream effectors of the ERK pathway. Surprisingly, there were no cannabinoid-mediated changes in fos mRNA or protein levels, although both were increased by forskolin stimulation of Neuro2a cells (data not shown). Weak stimulation of both pCREB and pELK-1 was observed (Fig. 3d). CB1 Receptor-mediated Krox-24 Activation Is pERK MAPK-dependent—We then investigated how CB1 signaling pathways were coupled to the up-regulation of Krox-24 levels in Neuro2a cells. We used the MEK inhibitor UO126 to block the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by pMEK, and we measured pERK levels and Krox-24 induction following treatment with 100 nm HU210. UO126 drastically reduced basal pERK levels and prevented the increase in pERK levels stimulated by HU210 (Fig. 4a). The blockade of pMEK activity with UO126 resulted in a reduction of basal Krox-24 nuclear staining and complete suppression of the HU210-mediated Krox-24 response (Fig. 4b). The effect of UO126 on basal and CB1-mediated Krox-24 induction was consistent with the MAPK-ERK pathway playing an important role in the activation of this inducible transcription factor. To confirm that the observed effects of HU210 on Krox-24 were CB1-mediated, we treated the cells with the CB1 inverse agonist SR141716A. As expected the HU210-induced increase in Krox-24 levels was blocked completely in the presence of 1 μm SR141716A (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction (p < 0.01) in basal Krox-24 levels in the cells that received SR141617A only (Fig. 4c), indicating that some of the basal Krox-24 activity in the Neuro2a cells may be through constitutive activation of CB1. Alternatively, SR141716A may have blocked cannabinoids present in the serum or produced by the Neuro2a cells, in either case demonstrating the involvement of CB1 in the Krox-24 response. Analysis of Cannabinoid-responsive Neuro2a Cells—From the Krox-24 time course (Fig. 3), it was evident that the majority of cells did not produce a Krox-24 response. Analysis of pMEK and pERK immunocytochemistry revealed that there were few strongly positive cells in the presence of serum following vehicle treatment (Fig. 5a). Upon stimulation with HU210 (5 min), pMEK staining was observed in cells indicated with the long arrows in Fig. 5a. These cells were generally large, typically with a diameter of 20-30 μm, and some clearly had the morphology of dividing cells, with evidence of telomeric separation. These cells were not abundant and only accounted for 6-10% of all cells. Consistent with our Western analysis, media replenishment in the absence of agonist increased the number of cells with low levels of pERK. Following HU210 stimulation strong pERK staining was observed in large cells that were morphologically similar to pMEK positive cells. In addition, cytoplasmic staining was also present in a number of the smaller Neuro2a cells, albeit at a lower level (Fig. 5a, short arrows). Approximately 50-60% showed specific pERK staining 5 min after HU210 administration. This pattern of staining was verified by pretreatment with UO126, which reduced pERK to below detectable levels in both the vehicle and HU210 conditions (Fig. 5a). In the absence of primary antibodies, the secondary antibody binding was negligible (data not shown). Changes in cellular morphology were studied using time-lapsed microscopy. As the Neuro2a cells began dividing, neuritic projections were withdrawn and cells began to appear spherical. During division, the cells maintained this spherical morphology for ∼50-60 min before membrane pinching occurred and two small daughter cells were born (Fig. 5b). The process from expansion to separation took ∼60-90 min, consistent with the time delay between pMEK and Krox-24 induction. Krox-24 positive cells were predominantly small in size and often present as pairs of positive cells (Fig. 3c and Fig. 5). Our observation that the pMEK/pERK positive cells appeared morphologically to be mitotic suggested that the Krox-24 positive cells had recently divided. To test this hypothesis, we reduced the rate of cell proliferation by serum reduction (2% FBS) and differentiation with retinoic acid (20 μm RA in 2% FBS). The RA induces pronounced morphological changes and appears to further reduce the rate of proliferation imposed by the serum reduction (Fig. 5c). Following 3 days of differentiation, the basal level of Krox-24 is very low in these cells (<2% positive cells). Following HU210 stimulation, Krox-24 induction was observed in ∼9% of cells cultured in 2% FBS and less than 5% of cells differentiated with RA. The reduction in Krox-24 induction under these differentiating conditions suggests that Krox-24-responsive cells may be derived primarily from mitotic Neuro2a cells. Presence of Serum Abrogates CB1 Receptor Activation of Krox-24—MAPK and Krox-24 assays revealed that greater numbers of cells responded to cannabinoid stimulation at the MAPK level than the Krox-24 level. This suggested suppression of the CB1 pathway downstream of MAPK. One possibility is that factors present in serum may drive activity through a distinct pathway, such as the PI3K-Akt pathway, which suppresses signaling via the MEK-ERK cascade. We therefore investigated whether removal of serum had any impact on the expression of Krox-24 and CB1 activation of Krox-24. Complete removal of serum resulted in the transient stimulation of Krox-24 expression with a peak around 2 h, supporting the idea of an inhibitory input conferred by serum factors. Stimulation of Krox-24 levels with 100 nm HU210 was also enhanced in the absence of serum, more so than the additive effects of either treatment alone (Fig. 6a). We then conducted a time course study of pMEK and pERK levels following serum withdrawal to determine the level in the signaling cascade at which the suppression was occurring. To our surprise there was little difference in pMEK or pERK levels within the first 20 min of serum removal, although a small increase was observed in pMEK levels at 40-60 min after serum removal (data not shown). These data would suggest that the serum-mediated suppression of the MEK-ERK cascade is primarily occurring downstream of ERK. Direct Blockade of PI3K-Akt Pathway Stimulates Krox-24 Expression—Factors present in serum are known to activate the PI3K pathway (30van der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Biessels G.J. Gispen W.H. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and in the presence of serum Neuro2a cells have abundant levels of Akt, a key substrate of the PI3K pathway. We therefore investigated the consequence of inhibition of the PI3K pathway on Krox-24 induction. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Sigma) stimulated Krox-24 expression in the presence of serum in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). 10 μm LY294002 produced optimal stimulation of Krox-24 without inducing cell death, whereas 50 μm LY294002 induced death in some cells (data not shown). LY294002 induction of Krox-24 occurred in >60% of the cells within 2 h (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, when the PI3K pathway was blocked, stimulation of CB1 by HU210 induced Krox-24 induction in close to 100% of the cells. A second PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (Sigma), also stimulated Krox-24 expression in a concentration-dependent manner with peak expression occurring around 2-3 h (data not shown). These data indicated that in the presence of serum the active PI3K pathway is capable of suppressing stimulatory inputs that would otherwise"
https://openalex.org/W1972700394,"Oxidative folding of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and single-chain insulin analogs proceeds via one- and two-disulfide intermediates. A predominant one-disulfide intermediate in each case contains the canonical A20–B19 disulfide bridge (cystines 18–61 in IGF-I and 19–85 in human proinsulin). Here, we describe a disulfide-linked peptide model of this on-pathway intermediate. One peptide fragment (19 amino acids) spans IGF-I residues 7–25 (canonical positions B8-B26 in the insulin superfamily); the other (18 amino acids) spans IGF-I residues 53–70 (positions A12–A21 and D1–D8). Containing only half of the IGF-I sequence, the disulfide-linked polypeptide (designated IGF-p) is not well ordered. Nascent helical elements corresponding to native α-helices are nonetheless observed at 4 °C. Furthermore, <sup>13</sup>C-edited nuclear Overhauser effects establish transient formation of a native-like partial core; no non-native nuclear Overhauser effects are observed. Together, these observations suggest that early events in the folding of insulin-related polypeptides are nucleated by a native-like molten subdomain containing Cys<sup>A20</sup> and Cys<sup>B19</sup>. We propose that nascent interactions within this subdomain orient the A20 and B19 thiolates for disulfide bond formation and stabilize the one-disulfide intermediate once formed. Substitutions in the corresponding region of insulin are associated with inefficient chain combination and impaired biosynthetic expression. The intrinsic conformational propensities of a flexible disulfide-linked peptide thus define a folding nucleus, foreshadowing the structure of the native state."
https://openalex.org/W1970746458,"In Escherichia coli, the ammonia channel AmtB and the PII signal transduction protein GlnK constitute an ammonium sensory system that effectively couples the intracellular nitrogen regulation system to external changes in ammonium availability. Binding of GlnK to AmtB apparently inactivates the channel, thereby controlling ammonium influx in response to the intracellular nitrogen status. We designed an N-terminally histidine-tagged version of AmtB with a native C-terminal region in order to purify the AmtB-GlnK complex. Purification revealed a stable and direct interaction between AmtB and GlnK, thereby showing for the first time that stability of the complex does not require other proteins. The stoichiometry of the complex was determined by two independent approaches, both of which indicated a 1:1 ratio of AmtB to GlnK. We also showed by mass spectrometry that only the fully deuridylylated form of GlnK co-purifies with AmtB. The purified complex allowed in vitro studies of dissociation and association of AmtB and GlnK. The interaction of GlnK with AmtB is dependent on ATP and is also sensitive to 2-oxoglutarate. Our in vitro data suggest that in vivo association and dissociation of the complex might not only be dependent on the uridylylation status of GlnK but may also be influenced by intracellular pools of ATP and 2-oxoglutarate.

Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, the uptake of ammonium into the cells of many organisms is mediated by a class of ubiquitous membrane proteins, designated Amt (ammonium transporter) proteins (1von Wirén N.

They are present in bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants, whereas in animals, from nematodes to humans, they are represented by the closely related Rh (Rhesus) proteins. The most studied Amt protein is Escherichia coli AmtB, which is a stable homotrimer in the cytoplasmic membrane and retains this structure when purified and reconstituted in two-dimensional crystals (2Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Conroy M.J. Jamieson S.J. Blakey D. Kaufmann T. Engel A. Fotiadis D. Merrick M. Bullough P.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The first 22 residues of E. coli AmtB encode a signal peptide (1von Wirén N. Merrick M. Trends Curr.

They are both trimers in which each subunit is formed by 11 transmembrane helices (TMH). 2The abbreviations used are: TMH, transmembrane helix; LDAO, n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide; 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; WT, wild-type. The structure has a pseudo-2-fold symmetry with the 2-fold axis in the middle plane of the membrane, relating helices TMH1 to TMH5 and TMH6 to TMH10, with TMH11 across the lipid-accessible face of each monomer. In the E. coli AmtB structures, the last 20 amino acids, which are predicted to constitute a cytoplasmic region, are disordered. However, the equivalent region of A. fulgidus Amt-1 was resolved, and it folds into two short α-helices (7Andrade S.L. Dickmanns A. Ficner R. Einsle O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14994-14999Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The Amt structures revealed that transport occurs through a narrow mainly hydrophobic pore located at the center of each monomer. Computer simulations and structural and energetic data, together with in vivo and in vitro assays, indicate that ammonium is the substrate recognized by AmtB but that ammonia is the translocated species (5Khademi S.

Therefore, the Amt proteins have been described as ammonia gas channels, as previously proposed (11Soupene E. He L. Yan D. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7030-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Almost all bacteria and archaea encode at least one Amt protein, and, with very few exceptions, the structural gene (amtB) is genetically linked to a second gene (glnK) that encodes a small cytosolic signal transduction protein (12Thomas G. Coutts G. Merrick M. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GlnK is a member of the PII protein family, of which E. coli encodes two members, GlnK and GlnB. These proteins act as sensors of the cellular nitrogen status in prokaryotes, and they have also been identified in plants (13Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In a variety of organisms, PII proteins have been shown to regulate the activities of other proteins by protein-protein interaction (13Arcondéguy T. Jack R. Merrick M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 14Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15Forchhammer K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). PII targets are diverse and have different functions (including enzymes and transcription factors), different structures, and different cellular localizations (cytosol and membrane). Among the PII crystal structures determined so far, those of E. coli GlnB and GlnK have both been solved, and they are very similar (16Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V.

D. 1996; 52: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both proteins are homotrimers of 112 amino acids that form a compact barrel of ∼50 Å in diameter and 30 Å high. Each monomer consists of a four-stranded β-sheet that packs against two helices. A relatively unstructured loop (the T-loop), connecting strands β2 and β3, protrudes from the upper surface. Two other notable loops are present in the structure: the B-loop connecting helix α2 and strand β4, and the C-loop regrouping the C-terminal residues. A lateral cleft between each subunit is formed between the T- and B-loops of one subunit and the C-loop of another subunit. Biochemical analysis of E. coli PII revealed that the T-loops are involved in the interaction with PII target proteins (19Jiang P. Zucker P. Atkinson M.R. Kamberov E.S. Tirasophon W. Chandran P.

Contreras A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3746-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and more precisely, T-loops interact directly with GlnD (uridylyltransferase) (20Jaggi R. Ybarlucea W.

Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the histidine protein kinase (nitrogen regulation protein; NtrB) (23Pioszak A.A. Jiang P. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13450-13461Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In proteobacteria, including E. coli, PII activity is regulated by covalent modification. This is catalyzed by uridylyltransferase, the activity of which is regulated by the intracellular glutamine pool, a signal of cellular nitrogen status (24Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12782-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The conserved residue, Tyr-51, at the apex of the T-loop is uridylylated in cells that are subjected to nitrogen starvation, and this modification is reversed in nitrogen sufficiency (21Atkinson M. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Son H.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1996; 21: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) binds noncovalently to both GlnB and GlnK and regulates their activity (21Atkinson M. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.R. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12802-12810Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To date, there is no crystal structure of PII complexed with 2-OG. However, GlnK, like GlnB, appears to bind one molecule of 2-OG with a high affinity and is apparently allosterically regulated by 2-OG (21Atkinson M. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of additional effector molecules at high 2-OG concentrations may cause a change of GlnK conformation that would explain its inability to interact with NtrB or GlnE (adenylyltransferase) (21Atkinson M. Ninfa A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PII proteins also bind ATP, and the crystal structure of the E. coli GlnK-ATP complex revealed three ATP-binding sites per trimer, located in the lateral clefts between the subunits (16Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), with residues of B- and C-loops interacting with ATP. ATP could potentially influence the interactions of GlnK with its receptors by affecting the structure and mobility of the T-loop but also because ATP changes the charge distribution of GlnK (16Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The conserved transcriptional linkage between glnK and amtB suggested an interaction between the GlnK and AmtB proteins (12Thomas G. Coutts G. Merrick M. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Subsequent in vivo experiments in E. coli supported this concept and indicated that formation of the AmtB-GlnK complex is controlled by the uridylylation state of GlnK, which is in turn dependent on the nitrogen status of the cell (31Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In response to an increase in the cellular nitrogen status, GlnK is deuridylylated and binds to AmtB, thereby apparently inactivating the channel. This association is sensitive, rapid, and reversible (31Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of E. coli AmtB prevents the interaction with GlnK (32Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Membrane sequestration of GlnK in an AmtB-dependent fashion is not unique to E. coli and has also been shown in Azotobacter vinelandii (32Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), Bacillus subtilis (33Detsch C. Stulke J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), Coryne-bacterium glutamicum (34Strosser J. Ludke A. Schaffer S. Kramer R. Burkovski A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 132-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Azospirillum brasilense (35Huergo L.F. Souza E.M. Araujo M.S. Pedrosa F.O. Chubatsu L.S. Steffens M.B. Merrick M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The ubiquity of this process led to the suggestion that AmtB and GlnK constitute an ancestral prokaryotic nitrogen control system (36Javelle A. Merrick M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 174-176Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To date, there has been no biochemical analysis of the mechanism of interaction between AmtB and GlnK. A docking model of a potential complex between A. fulgidus Amt-1 and a modeled structure of A. fulgidus GlnB-1 (the PII protein encoded adjacent to amt-1) was recently reported, although there is presently no direct biological evidence of an interaction between those two proteins (7Andrade S.L. Dickmanns A. Ficner R. Einsle O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14994-14999Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the purification of the intact E. coli AmtB-GlnK complex from ammonium-shocked cells, thereby allowing us to characterize the complex biochemically. Strains and Plasmids—The bacterial host strain used throughout this work was E. coli strain GT1000 (rbs lacZ::IS gyrA hutCK ΔglnKamtB) (32Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We also used E. coli B strain C43 for production of AmtB from plasmid pMM285 (2Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The plasmids used are listed in Table 1. E. coli strains were routinely grown in Luria medium, and for nitrogen-limited growth, an M9 medium (M9Gln) was used in which ammonium was replaced by 200 μg/ml glutamine. The carbon source was 0.2% glucose or 0.4% glycerol plus 0.05% arabinose when working with pBAD-based plasmids, pAD5 and pAD6. Cells were harvested before or after an ammonium shock achieved by the addition to the medium of 30 mm NH4Cl for 15 min at 30 °C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 15 μg/ml.TABLE 1Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidProtein phenotypeaModifications to proteins are shown in boldface type.GenotypeReference/SourcepAD2GlnK APAVAH6-AmtBglnK amtB33 in pMODULES3This workpAD4ΔGlnK APAVAH6-AmtBamtB33 in pESV2 (ΔglnK)This workpAD5GlnK AmtBglnK amtB in pBAD18This workpAD6GlnK(Y51F) AmtBglnK12 amtB in pBAD18This workpAJ1002GlnK AmtB-DLglnK amtB1 in pBAD18Ref. 31Javelle A.

Open table in a new tab Plasmid pAD2 encodes GlnK APAVAH6-AmtB (modifications to proteins are shown in boldface type throughout), where AmtB has a wild-type (WT) C terminus and an AVAH6 sequence inserted in the N-terminal region, two residues downstream from the natural signal peptide cleavage site and before TMH1. To construct pAD2, the NdeI/DraIII fragment from pESV4E was cloned into NdeI/DraIII-cut pMODULES3. To construct pESV4E, a His6-encoding linker with PstI-compatible ends (made by annealing oligonucleotides 5′-GTGGCCCATCACCACCATCACCATTGCA-3′ and 5′-TGGTGATGGTGGTGATGGGCCACTGCA-3′) was inserted into PstI-cut pJT6E. pMODULES3 was constructed by replacing the PvuI-SalI fragment of pMODULES1 with the equivalent PvuI-SalI fragment of pSTUART1. pAD4 was derived by cloning the NdeI/BamHI fragment of pESV2 (31Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) into NdeI/BamHI-cut pAD2. To construct pAD5 (WT GlnK) and pAD6 (Y51F GlnK), the BstXI/BamHI PCR fragment of pAD2 was amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-ACGGCGTTTGTGGCATTGTCGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGATCCTTACGCGTTATAGGCATTCTCGC-3′ (reverse; BamHI site underlined). The PCR product was inserted into the BstXI/BglII sites of pAJ1002 (31Javelle A. Severi E. Thornton J. Merrick M. J. Biol.

Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8530-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) by reversing an unexpected point mutation found in pAJ1004 that causes a Phe-55 to Ser-55 substitution. The QuikChange™ multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used with the oligonucleotide 5′-CGGAATTCAGCGTCAATTTCCTGCCAAA-3′ so that pAJ1023 now encodes GlnK Y51F and not Y51F,F55S. Protein Purification—To purify the AmtB-GlnK complex, we used GT1000 as the host strain (32Coutts G. Thomas G. Blakey D. Merrick M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) to avoid any contamination with the host-derived AmtB. GT1000(pAD2) cells were grown aerobically overnight at 30 °C in M9Gln containing 15 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Before harvesting the cells, a 30 mm ammonium chloride shock of 15 min was performed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl and lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell, 15,000 psi at 4 °C. The extract was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 43,000 × g in a SS-34 Sorvall rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant (whole cell extract) was centrifuged at 210,000 × g in a Kontron TFT 65-13 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended to 1.5 mg/ml protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and frozen overnight at –80 °C. The membranes were thawed on ice and solubilized with 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide or LDAO (Anatrace) at 4 °C for 2 h. The complex was also purified using the nonionic detergents n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, but the complete characterization of the complex utilized material solubilized in LDAO. The solubilized membranes were centrifuged at 210,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was applied to a Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) prepared by saturation with 100 mm NiCl2 and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) LDAO (buffer A) containing 5 mm imidazole at 1 ml min–1. The elution was performed after a two-step gradient with buffer A containing 80 mm imidazole and 300 mm imidazole. For Superose 12 10/300 GL (Amersham Biosciences) size exclusion chromatography, the AmtB-GlnK fraction eluting from the Ni2+ column was concentrated with a 50,000 cut-off Centricon filter (Millipore). A 500-μl sample was then loaded onto the S12 column preequilibrated with buffer A and run at 0.2 ml min–1. APAVAH6-AmtB was purified from GT1000(pAD4) as described for the complex purification, except that no ammonium shock was performed before harvesting the cells, and the protein was eluted from the Ni2+ column after a step gradient with buffer A containing 300 mm imidazole. APAVAH6-AmtB was quantified by amino acid composition analysis and used as standard for titration gels. AmtB-DH6 was purified from C43(pMM285) as described previously (2Blakey D. Leech A. Thomas G.H. Coutts G. Findlay K. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Native E. coli GlnK was purified as described previously (26van Heeswijk W.C. Hoving S. Molenaar D. Stegeman B. Kahn D. Westerhoff H.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It was used as a standard for titration gels and as a control for mass spectrometry analysis. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—The molecular mass markers (100 μl) and samples (usually 500 μl) were eluted at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 or 250 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) LDAO at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min–1, on a Superose 12 10/300 GL column. The molecular mass standards (Sigma and Amersham Biosciences) used for the calibration were as follows: β-amylase, 200 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa. Effect of Small Effectors on the AmtB-GlnK Complex—To study the influence of small effectors on stability of the AmtB-GlnK complex, we immobilized the purified complex (100 μg) on HIS-Select spin columns (Sigma) previously equilibrated with buffer A containing 5 mm imidazole. The flow-through was collected, and unbound proteins were removed by three washes with the same buffer. Three additional washes were carried out in buffer A with 5 mm imidazole in the absence or presence of effectors: 0.1, 1, or 2 mm 2-OG; 3.5 mm ATP; 5 mm MgCl2. As a control, the immobilized complex was dissociated by treating with 600 mm NaCl. For each condition tested, a single column was used. Elution of APAVAH6-AmtB or APAVAH6-AmtB-GlnK complex was performed by the addition of buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. The washed fractions, collected after applying effectors, and the eluted fraction were loaded on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. For in vitro reconstitution of the complex, AmtB and GlnK were obtained by purifying the complex, as described previously, and then dissociating the proteins from a Ni2+ column in the presence of 600 mm NaCl. In those conditions, GlnK was in the unbound fraction, and AmtB was subsequently eluted using increasing concentrations of imidazole. The two proteins were then loaded independently on a size exclusion chromatography column (Superose 12 10/300) in buffer A. Pure AmtB and GlnK were preincubated in a molar ratio of 1:2 in buffer A with 5 mm imidazole in the absence or presence of effectors (0.1, 1, or 2 mm 2-OG; 3.5 mm ATP; 5 mm MgCl2) for 15 min at 30 °C. The mixture was then loaded onto a HIS-Select spin column (Sigma) previously equilibrated with 5 mm imidazole in buffer A containing the same effectors as in the initial reaction mixture. For each condition tested, one column was used. The flow-through was collected, and unbound proteins were removed after three washes with the same buffer containing the effectors present in the reaction mixture. Elution was performed with 500 mm imidazole in buffer A, and the eluted fractions were analyzed for the presence of AmtB and GlnK by Western blotting. Protein Quantification—Pure proteins, cell extracts, and subcellular fractions were assayed with Bradford reagent (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Concentrations of proteins used as standards for Coomassie-stained gels were determined by quantitative amino acid composition at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry (PNAC) Facility in Cambridge. Amino Acid Composition—The amino acid compositions of the purified AmtB-GlnK complex, of GlnK, and of AmtB were determined after a 22-h acid hydrolysis at 115 °C, according to the method described previously (37Spackman D. Stein W. Moore S. Anal. Chem. 1958; 30: 1190-1206Crossref Scopus (6603) Google Scholar). The free amino acids were separated on an ion exchange resin (sodium system) eluting with a series of buffers over the pH range 3.20–6.45 on an amino acid analyzer (Amersham Biosciences Alpha Plus Series II). Peak detection was achieved by mixing the eluate with ninhydrin at 135 °C and measuring the absorbance (at 570 and 440 nm). Quantitation was performed using Chromeleon software and calibration curves for each amino acid of interest. Quantitative Coomassie Gels—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10 and 15% for AmtB and GlnK analysis, respectively) and stained with Coomassie Blue. The intensity of bands was converted to a protein concentration by using a calibration curve of pure protein present on each gel. Each Coomassiestained gel was loaded with seven different dilutions of a protein standard (AmtB (27.6, 23.6, 19.7, 15.8, 11.8, 7.9, and 3.9 pmol of trimer) and GlnK (163.2, 122.3, 81.6, 40.8, 20.4, 10.2, and 5 pmol of monomer)) and six different dilutions of the pure complex (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 μg). Accurate concentrations of AmtB and GlnK used as standards were determined by amino acid composition. The signal was scanned and quantified with Gene-Tools software (Syngene). Data Analysis—To calculate the AmtB/GlnK stoichiometry, we used a mathematical model in which we compared the values of the experimental amino acid composition of the complex with the respective amino acid compositions of AmtB and GlnK. Asparagine and glutamine are converted to aspartate and glutamate, respectively; therefore, Asx and Glx correspond to the amount of Asp + Asn and Glu + Gln, because Asn and Gln are deamidated following the acid treatment. Norleucine was used as an internal standard but is not reported. We used the data from two different amino acid composition estimations to calculate the stoichiometry (s) of the AmtB-GlnK complex, with s representing the number of GlnK mol for 1 mol of AmtB (AmtB/s GlnK). The value of s was calculated by using the Solver tool in Microsoft Excel to minimize the mean square deviation between the calculated fractions of each ami"

After the transfer of a GlcNAc residue to Asn-bound Man5GlcNAc2 by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I, an α-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.114) removes one α1,3-linked and one α1,6-linked mannose residue. In this study, we have identified the relevant α-mannosidase II gene (aman-2; F58H1.1) from Caenorhabditis elegans and have detected its activity in both native and recombinant forms. For comparative studies, the two other cDNAs encoding class II mannosidases aman-1 (F55D10.1) and aman-3 (F48C1.1) were cloned; the corresponding enzymes are, respectively, a putative lysosomal α-mannosidase and a Co(II)-activated α-mannosidase. The analysis of the N-glycan structures of an aman-2 mutant strain demonstrates that the absence of α-mannosidase II activity results in a shift to structures not seen in wild-type worms (e.g. N-glycans with the composition Hex5-7HexNAc2-3Fuc2Me) and an accumulation of hybrid oligosaccharides. Paucimannosidic glycans are almost absent from aman-2 worms, indicative also of a general lack of α-mannosidase III activity. We hypothesize that there is a tremendous flexibility in the glycosylation pathway of C. elegans that does not impinge, under standard laboratory conditions, on the viability of worms with glycotypes very unlike the wild-type pattern.

We hypothesize that there is a tremendous flexibility in the glycosylation pathway of C. elegans that does not impinge, under standard laboratory conditions, on the viability of worms with glycotypes very unlike the wild-type pattern. During the biosynthesis of N-glycans in eukaryotes a number of trimming and extension steps occur, and the relative contributions of these steps then determine the final nature of the oligosaccharides present on a glycoprotein. As part of this process, a number of α-mannosidases are required to remove first a number of α1,2-linked mannose residues (1Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 2Herscovics A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); after attainment of the Man5GlcNAc2 structure, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcNAc-TI, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; RP-HPLC, reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. (EC 2.4.1.101) may, depending on the species, the cell, or the glycoprotein, act to facilitate the formation of hybrid, paucimannosidic, and complex N-glycans (3Schachter H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Thereafter, according to the “classical” pathway, a Golgi α1,3/6-mannosidase (α-mannosidase II) will, dependent on the action of GlcNAc-TI, remove two mannose residues, with the result being so-called MGn (GlcNAc1Man3GlcNAc2), which is a substrate for other enzymes such as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (EC 2.4.1.143), core fucosyltransferases, and a processing Golgi hexosaminidase in insects and nematodes (4Altmann F.

Staudacher E. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect on the glycan structure of “knocking out” α-mannosidase II genes in invertebrates has been previously unknown, but an α-mannosidase III has been characterized in insects (6Kawar Z. Karaveg K. Moremen K.W. Jarvis D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16335-16340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which could in theory act in an alternative route of N-glycan processing. However, even though GlcNAc-TI-independent Golgi α1,2/3/6-mannosidases similar to mannosidase III have also been found by assaying crude mammalian extracts (7Monis E. Bonay P. Hughes R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), recent data indicate that mammals have two GlcNAc-TI-dependent α-mannosidases (mannosidases II and IIx); knocking out both these genes is necessary and sufficient to abolish complex N-glycan biosynthesis in embryos (8Akama T.O. Nakagawa H. Wong N.K. Sutton-Smith M. Dell A. Morris H.R. Nakayama J. Nishimura S.-I. Pai A. Moremen K.W. Marth J.D. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8983-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to its demonstrated presence in a number of mammalian cell extracts, α-mannosidase II activity has been reported recently in Caenorhabditis elegans microsomes (5Zhang W. Cao P. Chen S. Spence A.M. Zhu S. Staudacher E. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but otherwise no data exist about this enzyme in the nematode. Considering that the complete genome of C. elegans has been sequenced, an obvious aid in identifying any α-mannosidase II gene is that various cDNA sequences encoding this enzyme have been cloned from insects (9Foster J.M. Yudkin B. Lockyer A.E. Roberts D.B. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and mammals (10Moremen K.W. Robbins P.W. J.

A. 1995; 92: 11766-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); phylogenetic and biochemical comparisons indicate that these are members of the class II mannosidase family. As such, their sequences display similarity to those of lysosomal mannosidase (12Liao Y.-F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28348-28358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), α-mannosidase III (6Kawar Z. Karaveg K. Moremen K.W. Jarvis D.L. J. Biol.

On the other hand, mannosidase II is unlike the classical endoplasmic reticulum α-mannosidase (15Gonzalez D.S. Karaveg K. Vandersall-Nairn A.S. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21375-21386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and Golgi α-mannosidases IA, IB, and IC (16Tremblay L.O. Hersovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31655-31660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that are class I mannosidases. Most recently, the Drosophila α-mannosidase II has been crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure has been determined (17van den Elsen J.M. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified three class II mannosidase genes from C. elegans, cloned the corresponding cDNAs, expressed these in Pichia pastoris, and compared the properties of the encoded proteins; on the basis of the various analyses, we conclude that we have identified the α-mannosidase II (aman-2) gene from the nematode. Furthermore, examination of a relevant mutant indicated that this enzyme has a major role in “normal” N-glycan biosynthesis in the worm. Cloning of the Nematode Class II Mannosidase cDNAs—Open reading frames for putative C. elegans class II mannosidases were identified by BLAST searching, and cDNA fragments encoding truncated forms of these enzymes (lacking the cytosolic and transmembrane regions) were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using Trizol-purified RNA from N2 worms, Expand polymerase, and the primer pairs Ce_ManI/1/ClaI (ccatcgatccaagattgtgcatggaata) and Ce_ManI/2/SacII (tccccgcggttataattttgacattttgcgttc), Ce_ManII/1 (ggaattgaaaccggagctg) and Ce_ManII/2/SacII (tccccgcggttaaaatgatacaagaatact), and Ce_ManIII/1/AclI (ccggaacgtttcatcaaagattaggacagca) and Ce_ManIII/2/SacII (tccccgcggtcatcgataaagaatcaaagtc) with an annealing temperature of 58 °C and an extension time of 4 min, 30 s. The fragments were purified using a GFX DNA purification kit (GE Healthcare), cut with ClaI (a site that is naturally present in the aman-2 cDNA and in the primer for the aman-1 cDNA) or with AclI (for the aman-3 cDNA fragment) and SacII, prior to ligation into the pPICZαC vector (Invitrogen), cut with ClaI and SacII. Positive clones were sequenced, linearized, and transformed into the P. pastoris GS115 strain. Characterization of Recombinant α-Mannosidases—Transformed Pichia were grown at 16 or 30 °C in the presence of 1% methanol, and culture supernatants were collected on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th days after commencement of induction. Supernatants were initially screened using p-nitrophenyl-α-mannopyranoside as a substrate in assays containing a final concentration of 5 mm substrate (stock 100 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide), McIlvaine buffers of varying pH values (18McIlvaine T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1921; 49: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and 20 μl of culture supernatant; tests with cations were performed at 10 mm final concentration of the chloride salts, whereas swainsonine (Sigma) and deoxymannojirimycin (Industrial Research Ltd., New Zealand) were employed at concentrations of 0.01-1 μm and 0.1-10 mm, respectively. Incubations (50-μl total volume) were allowed to proceed for 2-16 h at various temperatures prior to termination with 250 μl of 0.4 m glycine-NaOH, pH 10.4; absorbances were measured using a 96-well plate reader at 405 nm and corrected by subtracting the values of control incubations lacking substrate in order to calculate ΔA405. Furthermore, other controls with substrate and either no supernatant or a supernatant of yeast not expressing recombinant mannosidase were also performed. For assays with pyridylaminated GlcNAc1Man5GlcNAc2 (Man5Gn-PA; see Scheme 1 for an explanation of glycan nomenclature) or Man5GlcNAc2 (Man5-PA), 0.1 nmol of substrate was incubated with 1 μl of unconcentrated yeast culture supernatant and 2 μl of 0.4 m MES buffer, pH 6, in a final volume of 5 μl for 14 h in a PCR tube at 30 °C, prior to RP-HPLC (Hypersil ODS) using a gradient of 4.2-5.7% MeOH (95.8-94.3% 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4); and the pyridylamino-labeled glycans were detected by fluorescence (320:400 nm). Control assays were performed using the supernatant of yeast transformed with the pPICZαC vector lacking an insert. Fractions were collected, dried, and subjected to either MALDI-TOF MS using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix or normal phase HPLC using a Palpak type N column (4.6 × 250 mm; Takara). In the latter case, mixtures of 25 (buffer A) or 50 parts (buffer B) of 3% acetic acid (adjusted to pH 7.3 with triethylamine) and 10% acetonitrile with 75 or 50 parts 100% acetonitrile, respectively, were prepared. The gradient was then applied as follows: 0-5 min, 10% B; 5-45 min, 10-100% B; 45-55 min, 100%, 55-56 min, 10% (total run time, 65 min; flow rate, 1 ml/min). Samples were taken up in 80% acetonitrile prior to injection, and peaks were detected by fluorescence (310 nm excitation, 380 nm emission). Mannosidase Assays of Wild-type and Mutant Worms—Extracts of worms grown in liquid culture with Escherichia coli OP50 were prepared as described previously (19Paschinger K. Rendic D. Lochnit G. Jantsch V. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49588-49598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The tm1078 strain (displaying a 304-bp deletion, including parts of the fifth and sixth exons of the F58H1.1 gene) was acquired from the National Bioresource Project for the Experimental Animal Nematode C. elegans (Tokyo Women's Medical University, Japan). The yield of tm1078 worms (9 g wet weight from 500 ml of culture) was comparable with that of the wild-type N2. α-Mannosidase II activity in worm extracts was determined using Man5Gn-PA as substrate and analyzed by RP-HPLC as described above. Western Blotting—Crude whole extracts of worms were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-horseradish peroxidase and anti-phosphorylcholine (TEPC-15) antibodies after separation by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels and transfer to nitrocellulose. After blocking with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, membranes were incubated with either rabbit anti-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma; 1:12,500) or mouse TEPC-15 (1:170). To detect the bound primary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgA (1:200) was used together with the relevant chromogenic substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium or chloronaphthol/hydrogen peroxide). Glycan Analysis of Wild-type and Mutant Worms—According to our previously published procedures, N-glycans were prepared from worms by peptide:N-glycosidase A digestion of peptic peptides, prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis in both linear and reflectron modes on, respectively, a ThermoBioanalysis Dynamo or a Bruker Ultraflex instrument (19Paschinger K. Rendic D. Lochnit G. Jantsch V. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49588-49598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, portions of N-glycans of wild-type and mutant strains were subject to pyridylamination and RP-HPLC also as described previously (20Hase S. Ibuki T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 21Wilson I.B.H. Altmann F. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 1055-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); collected fractions were analyzed further by MALDI-TOF MS on a Perspective Biosystems Voyager DE using either 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid or 6-aza-2-thiothymine as matrix. Selected fractions were analyzed further after treatment overnight either with jack bean β-hexosaminidase (5 milliunits; in the presence or absence of 5 milliunits of bovine α-fucosidase) in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5, buffer at 37 °C (22Fabini G. Freilinger A. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28058-28067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or with 48% aqueous hydrofluoric acid at 0 °C (23Haslam S.M. Khoo K.H. Houston K.M. Harnett W. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the reagent was removed by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen. Phosphorylcholine-substituted glycans were also analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Ultraflex Tof/Tof, BrukerDaltonics, Bremen) using a dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (10 mg/ml dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% aqueous acetonitrile, 1% phosphoric acid) either in the MS or MS/MS mode. Normally 100-500 shots were summed. For external calibration, a peptide standard mixture (Bruker) was used, whereas for MS/MS calibration, the theoretical monoisotopic masses of the phosphorylcholine-substituted glycans were applied. Tissue-specific Promoter Analysis—The reporter plasmid used was a form of the pPD95.67 (L2459) promoterless gfp vector 3A. Fire, S. Xu, J. Ahnn, and G. Seydoux, personal communication. which was the kind gift of Dr. Andrew Fire. This vector was then modified by insertion of a HindIII/XbaI fragment carrying the unc-119 gene into its multiple cloning site to generate pPD95.67/unc-119. Then, a genomic fragment corresponding to the 2000 bp upstream of the aman-2 gene was isolated by PCR using the primers ManII_prom/1/XbaI gctctagacggacgagaagtacaaat and ManII_prom/2/XbaI gctctagacccatgctttatcttgccat. Both the fragment and the pPD95.67/unc-119 vector were cut with XbaI and ligated. A selected clone was sequenced and verified to contain the expected aman-2 upstream region and was used to transform unc-119 (ed3) mutants with a particle gun (24Praitis V. Casey E. Collar D. Austin J. Genetics. 1998; 157: 1217-1226Crossref Google Scholar). Individuals from integrated lines were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP2) with argon laser excitation at 488 nm and emission at 500-540 nm using an HC Plans 10×/25 ocular and HC PL Fluotar 10×/0.30 objective. Identification of the Nematode Class II Mannosidase Genes—Data bank searches using the BLAST program, as well as examination of the CaZy data base, indicate that the C. elegans genome encodes three class II mannosidases, which are members of glycohydrolase family 38 (25Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). These have the Wormbase designations F48C1.1, F55D10.1, and F58H1.1. The predicted F48C1.1 cDNA encodes a protein of 1064 amino acids with 30% identity to the human α-mannosidase II (MAN2A1) (11Misago M. Liao Y.F. Kudo S. Eto S. Mattei M.G. Moremen K.W. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11766-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and 28% to insect (Sf9) α-mannosidase III (6Kawar Z. Karaveg K. Moremen K.W. Jarvis D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16335-16340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas F55D10.1 encodes a protein of 955 residues with 38% identity to human lysosomal mannosidase (MAN2B1) (12Liao Y.-F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28348-28358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and F58H1.1 encodes a protein of 1143 residues with 36% identity to human α-mannosidase II, 38% to human α-mannosidase IIx (MAN2A2) (11Misago M. Liao Y.F. Kudo S. Eto S. Mattei M.G. Moremen K.W. Fukuda M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11766-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), 29% to C. elegans F55D10.1, and 25% to the human lysosomal mannosidase. A recent phylogenetic analysis (14Park C. Meng L. Stanton L.H. Collins R.E. Mast S.W. Yi X. Strachan H. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37204-37216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also suggests that F55D10.1 and F58H1.1 are, respectively, within the lysosomal and Golgi clades of the class II mannosidase family, whereas F48C1.1 is not closely associated with any other mannosidase sequence. All worm class II mannosidase homologues contain an Asp-Pro-Phe motif, conserved in comparison to mammalian lysosomal and Golgi mannosidases; the aspartate residue of this motif has been predicted to be the catalytic nucleophile of the Drosophila Golgi α-mannosidase II (17van den Elsen J.M. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), jack bean α-mannosidase (26Howard S. He S. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2067-2072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and bovine lysosomal α-mannosidase (27Numao S. He S. Evjen G. Howard S. Tollersrud O.-K. Withers S.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The predicted F58H1.1 protein sequence contains three predicted N-glycosylation sites, one of which (Asn-320) has been confirmed to be occupied in vivo (28Kaji H. Saito H. Yamauchi Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K.-I. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar); the F48C1.1 sequence also contains three predicted N-glycosylation sites, whereas the F55D10.1 sequence possesses seven. On the basis of the in silico analysis and its length, we postulated that F58H1.1 is the closest relative to Golgi α-mannosidase II. Thus, this gene, which we designate aman-2, and the corresponding mutant were the major focus of our later studies. The aman-1 (F55D10.1) and aman-3 (F48C1.1) cDNAs were also cloned so as to facilitate a comparative enzymatic characterization to verify that the AMAN-2 protein is the sole Golgi α-mannosidase II in the worm. Characterization of Nematode Class II Mannosidases—The cloned partial cDNAs encoding AMAN-2 and the two other class II mannosidases were engineered into vectors suitable for expression in P. pastoris. In the case of aman-2, an expression vector was constructed containing nucleotides 366-3432 (corresponding to residues 123-1143 of the predicted protein) inframe with the yeast α-mating factor secretion signal. Truncation of the first 122 residues was performed on the basis of two criteria. First, because of the relative lack of suitable restriction sites, use was made of the natural ClaI site within the F58H1.1 sequence, which was fortuitously suitable for in-frame ligation into the pPICZαC vector. Second, the first 106 amino acids of mammalian α-mannosidase II were shown previously to be absent from an active chymotrypsin-released form of the enzyme (10Moremen K.W. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed residue 124 of the worm enzyme corresponds to residue 113 of the murine enzyme and is prior to the first significant region of homology displayed by a DXQM-LDXY sequence conserved between the mammalian, fruit fly, and worm sequences. The aman-1 and aman-3 constructs, generated so as to facilitate comparative characterization, merely lacked the regions encoding the putative cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. Initial screening of supernatants of yeast transfected with the aman-2 cDNA construct indeed showed that a mannosidase activity, not present in control yeast supernatants, hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl-α-mannoside at a pH value of 6, but not at pH 4.5, regardless of whether the expression was performed at 16 or 30 °C. On the other hand, yeast transformed with aman-1 expressed a secreted α-mannosidase with activity at pH 4.5, which corresponds to the optimum found for the recombinant human lysosomal α-mannosidase (12Liao Y.-F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28348-28358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the case of yeast transformed with the aman-3 construct, we considered the possibility that the encoded enzyme may be similar to the Sf9 Co(II)-activated mannosidase III (6Kawar Z. Karaveg K. Moremen K.W. Jarvis D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16335-16340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); therefore, initial assays were performed in the absence and presence of Co(II), and indeed a mannosidase activity not found in control supernatants was detected overnight only in the presence of the cation at pH 6. Furthermore, control incubations of supernatants of mannosidase-transformed yeast with no substrate yielded results comparable with incubations of supernatants of yeast transformed with empty vector (data not shown). A fuller analysis with p-nitrophenyl-α-mannoside as substrate verified that the pH optimum of AMAN-2 was indeed at pH 5.5-6, compatible with other studies on Golgi α-mannosidase II from other species. Based on a method described by Dixon (29Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), extrapolation of the linear regions of the plot of pH against log10ΔA405 (as a measure of log V) suggests the presence of titratable side chains with pKa values of 5.3 and 6.0 (Fig. 1A) and so is potentially consistent with the putative roles of Asp-204 and Asp-341 as being, respectively, the catalytic nucleophile and the catalytic acid base in the Drosophila α-mannosidase II (17van den Elsen J.M. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The optima of AMAN-1 and AMAN-3 were pH 4-4.5 and pH 6.5, respectively (Fig. 1A), and buffers of these pH values were used in the subsequent assays. The temperature optima for AMAN-1 and AMAN-2 were in the region of 30-37 °C; AMAN-3, on the other hand, displayed optimal activity at 23 °C (Fig. 1B). Taking the ΔA405 as a measure of V, an Arrhenius plot (not shown) suggested an activation energy for the AMAN-2 reaction of 28-30 kJ/mol (7 kcal/mol; data not shown), as compared with the 46 kJ/mol (11 kcal/mol) determined, also using V rather than an actual kcat, for the native rat liver α-mannosidase II (30Tulsiani D.R.P. Opheim D.J. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3227-3233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the various cations tested, only Cu(II) was observed to completely inhibit AMAN-2, such a result has been shown previously with the Drosophila and murine forms of α-mannosidase II (31Rabouille C. Kuntz D.A. Lockyer A. Watson R. Signorelli T. Rose D.R. van den Heuvel M. Roberts D.B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Co(II), Mg(II), Mn(II), and EDTA had either no effect or only a minor effect on the activity of AMAN-2 in comparison to incubations performed in the absence of these reagents (Fig. 1C); this is again consistent with previous data on mannosidase II from other species. The EDTA insensitivity of AMAN-2 would indicate that, if the Caenorhabditis enzyme is also a zinc-containing protein like the Drosophila form, the Zn(II) is tightly bound. The Co(II) insensitivity of both AMAN-1 and AMAN-2 is in stark contrast to the properties of AMAN-3 (Fig. 1C), which, like its presumed “orthologue” from Sf9 cells (6Kawar Z. Karaveg K. Moremen K.W. Jarvis D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16335-16340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), only showed significant activity in the presence of Co(II) and, to a lesser extent, Mn(II). Indeed, for all other tests shown, AMAN-3 was assayed in the presence of 10 mm CoCl2. The inhibitors swainsonine and deoxymannojirimycin were also tested; ∼45% inhibition of AMAN-2 was achieved at 10 nm of the former and 1 mm of the latter (Fig. 1D). These results are in line with the respective IC50 values of 20 nm and 0.4 mm determined for inhibition of Drosophila Golgi mannosidase II (17van den Elsen J.M. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). AMAN-1 and AMAN-3 were also similarly sensitive to these reagents, although AMAN-3 appeared to be somewhat more sensitive to deoxymannojirimycin. To confirm the specificity of the enzymes, assays were performed using pyridylaminated forms of Man5Gn (referred to by others sometimes as M5Gn3 or M5Gn) and Man5 as substrates. The subsequent RP-HPLC for AMAN-2 showed, after 14 h, the conversion of around 80% of the Man5Gn substrate to a peak co-eluting with an MGn standard; this activity is absent from a control supernatant (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, no digestion of Man5 was observed as judged by RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS (data not shown), demonstrating the requirement of the enzyme for the prior action of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. Furthermore, no digestion of Man5Gn was observed when using supernatants of yeast expressing AMAN-1 and AMAN-3, whereas with AMAN-3 some degradation of Man5 was observed as expected (data not shown). The product peak from the 14-h incubation of AMAN-2 with Man5Gn was collected and subject to MALDI-TOF MS; this analysis showed the presence of both MGn (m/z 1194; [M + H]+) and Man4Gn (m/z 1356) as products. The purified incubation products were also analyzed by normal phase HPLC, which more easily differentiates MGn, Man4Gn, and Man5Gn; this verified that the vast majority of product at this time point co-eluted with an MGn standard (Fig. 2C). A time course analysis was also performed (data not shown); samples were removed after 1, 2, 4, and 12 h, subject to HPLC as well as MALDI-TOF MS of the combined substrate and product peaks. These data confirmed Man4Gn as being an intermediate product of the enzyme reaction throughout the time course. Biochemical Analysis of a Golgi α-Mannosidase II Mutant—To test the in vivo function of the aman-2 gene, we made use of a publicly available mutant C. elegans strain (tm1078), which has a deletion within the F58H1.1 gene. First enzyme assays were performed on extracts of the mutant, and these tests, using pyridylaminated Man5Gn, indicated that there was no α-mannosidase II activity in the tm1078 worms, in contrast to the wild type (Fig. 3). The wild-type extract indeed also digested the MGn α-mannosidase II product partly to MM, presumably because of the presence of a putative Golgi hexosaminidase (5Zhang W. Cao P. Chen S. Spence A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2128570795,"Succinate dehydrogenase is an indispensable enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle as well as energy coupling in the mitochondria and certain prokaryotes. During catalysis, succinate oxidation is coupled to ubiquinone reduction by an electron transfer relay comprising a flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor, three iron-sulfur clusters, and possibly a heme b556. At the heart of the electron transport chain is a [4Fe-4S] cluster with a low midpoint potential that acts as an energy barrier against electron transfer. Hydrophobic residues around the [4Fe-4S] cluster were mutated to determine their effects on the midpoint potential of the cluster as well as electron transfer rates. SdhB-I150E and SdhB-I150H mutants lowered the midpoint potential of this cluster; surprisingly, the His variant had a lower midpoint potential than the Glu mutant. Mutation of SdhB-Leu-220 to Ser did not alter the redox behavior of the cluster but instead lowered the midpoint potential of the [3Fe-4S] cluster. To correlate the midpoint potential changes in these mutants to enzyme function, we monitored aerobic growth in succinate minimal medium, anaerobic growth in glycerol-fumarate minimal medium, non-physiological and physiological enzyme activities, and heme reduction. It was discovered that a decrease in midpoint potential of either the [4Fe-4S] cluster or the [3Fe-4S] cluster is accompanied by a decrease in the rate of enzyme turnover. We hypothesize that this occurs because the midpoint potentials of the [Fe-S] clusters in the native enzyme are poised such that direction of electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone is favored.

Cofactors such as iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) clusters, hemes, and flavins comprise the ET relays of respiratory chain enzymes and mediate electron transfer from a powerful reductant with a relatively low midpoint potential (Em) to a final oxidant with a relatively high Em. The ET chain usually involves cofactors from multiple enzymes and the membrane-soluble ubiquinone or menaquinone pool, and the energetics of individual ET steps are not always downhill. In many redox enzymes, the exception often occurs in the form of an [Fe-S] cluster with an unusually low Em located at an intermediate position in the ET relay (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R.

Thus during catalysis, electrons must surmount the energy barrier imposed by the low potential cluster despite the overall downhill reaction between the reductant and oxidant. Controversy continues to surround the issue as to whether Em values of cofactors play a role in determining the rate of electron transfer through redox enzymes, especially that of the low potential cluster (5Page C.C.

It would thus be of great interest to use a genetically modifiable model system to study the effects of Em modulation on observed catalytic rates of electron transfer. Succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh, Complex II in eukaryotes) is an indispensable enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle and aerobic respiration. The Escherichia coli Sdh is a heterotetramer comprising a soluble succinate-oxidizing catalytic dimer (SdhAB) that is anchored to the membrane by a hydrophobic ubiquinone-reducing dimer (SdhCD). Succinate is oxidized to fumarate at the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) active site in SdhA. Electrons from this oxidation are then shuttled through an ET relay comprising three [Fe-S] clusters in SdhB to the membrane anchor domain (SdhCD) where ubiquinone (UQ) is reduced to ubiquinol (UQH2). A b-type heme (b556) is sandwiched between SdhC and SdhD and has been proposed to play a role in the suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during enzyme turnover (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Tornroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Leger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The reduction couple for the succinate → fumarate reaction is +15 mV and that for UQ → UQ2 is +100 mV. The cofactors of the Sdh ET relay have Em values of -80 mV (FAD), +10 mV ([2Fe-2S], FS1), -175 mV ([4Fe-4S], FS2), +65 mV ([3Fe-4S], FS3) and +35 mV (heme b556) (11Condon C. Cammack R. Patil D.S.

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments that alter the cysteinyl ligands of [Fe-S] clusters have been performed on the E. coli fumarate reductase (23Manodori A. Cecchini G. Schroder I. Gunsalus R.P.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8296-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In most cases, alteration of the [Fe-S] cluster ligands resulted in enzymes that were not assembled or targeted correctly. These mutated enzymes often had undetectable enzyme activity; thus, changes in midpoint potential could not be consistently correlated with changes in catalysis. In this study, emphasis was placed on hydrophobic residues around the [4Fe-4S] cluster (FS2) of Sdh. Using the recently published high resolution x-ray crystallography structure of Sdh (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Tornroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Leger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), we generated site-directed mutants of SdhB-Ile-150 and SdhB-Leu-220 and determined their effects on Em values of all three [Fe-S] clusters and the resultant changes in enzyme activity and rates of heme reduction. Because Sdh has been shown to produce ROS (27Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we also addressed whether changes in enzyme turnover are consistent with changes in ROS production. Based on results obtained in this study, we propose a novel role for [Fe-S] clusters in ET relays whereby their midpoint potentials dictate the direction of electron transfer. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain DW35 (Δfrd-ABCD, sdhC::kan) (28Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for all enzyme expression and growth studies. Expression of wild-type and mutant Sdh was anaerobically induced by using the plasmid pFAS, which encodes the sdh operon under the control of the fumarate reductase promoter (29Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Laboratory strain TG1 (supE hsdΔ5 thi Δ(lac-proAB) F′[traD36 proAB+ lacIq lacZΔM15]; GE Healthcare) and plasmid pTZ18R (AmpRlacZ′; GE Healthcare) were used for molecular cloning and mutagenesis. Cloning—The 3.7-kb KpnI-SphI fragment of pFAS was subcloned into pTZ18R, and this recombinant plasmid was used for site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed with the addition/deletion of restriction sites in the DNA sequence to facilitate the screening process and were purchased from Sigma. Mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. DpnI was purchased from Invitrogen, and DNA purification kits were purchased from Qiagen. Mutants were verified by DNA sequencing (DNA core facility, Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta), and the smaller 1.3-kb XhoI-SphI fragment cloned back into the pFAS expression vector. The mutant plasmids were then transformed into DW35 for biochemical studies. Preparation of competent cells and transformations of plasmids into competent cells were carried out as described (30Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1.32-1.170Google Scholar). Enzyme Expression and Preparation—Wild-type and mutant SdhCDAB were expressed in DW35 cells. A 20-ml starter culture of Terrific Broth grown at 37 °C for 8 h was used to inoculate 2 liters of Terrific Broth in a 4-liter flask. The culture was grown at 37 °C for ∼18 h with shaking (160 rpm). All media contained 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin, 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin, and 40 μg ml-1 kanamycin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation followed by resuspension in 50 mm MOPS/5 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.0. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and cells were lysed using a French press. Membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation as previously described (7Cheng V.W. Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8068-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Enriched membranes were prepared by centrifugation on a 55% sucrose cushion at 150,000 × g for 90 min and were diluted to 25 ml. Malonate was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and membranes were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min to activate the Sdh enzyme. Two subsequent spins at 150,000 × g for 90 min were carried out to wash the membranes using 50 mm MOPS/5 mm EDTA/1 mm malonate buffer. The final membrane preparations were resuspended in 4 ml of the above buffer and flash frozen with liquid N2. All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. Growth Assays—Anaerobic growth in minimal medium was carried out as described (31Sambasivarao D. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5935-5943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 50 mm fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor and a Klett-Summerson colorimeter equipped with a number 6 filter to monitor growth. Aerobic growth in succinate minimal medium was carried out as the anaerobic growth experiment with the following exceptions: final volume decreased to 25 ml, glycerol and fumarate were omitted, and succinate was added to a final concentration of 25 mm. SDS-PAGE—Protein concentrations were estimated by the Lowry method (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the inclusion of 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate in the mixture (33Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). 30 μg of protein was incubated at 100 °C for 5 min before separation by SDS-PAGE (30Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1.32-1.170Google Scholar) and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Low molecular mass markers from Bio-Rad included phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45.0 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31.0 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and lysozyme (14.4 kDa). Flavin Quantification—Fluorometric quantification of the covalent flavin of Sdh was carried out as described (34Singer T.P. Edmondson D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), using 5 mg of protein as starting material. Redox Titration and EPR Spectroscopy—Redox titrations were carried out anaerobically under argon at 25 °C on Sdhenriched membranes at a total protein concentration of ∼30 mg ml-1 in 50 mm MOPS/5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The following redox mediators were used at a concentration of 25 μm: quinhydrone, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, 1,2-naphthoquinone, toluylene blue, phenazine methosulfate, thionine, duroquinone, methylene blue, resorufin, indigotrisulfonate, indigodisulfonate, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, phenosafranine, benzyl viologen, and methyl viologen. All samples were prepared in 3-mm internal diameter quartz EPR tubes and were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen-chilled ethanol before storing in liquid nitrogen. EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Elexsys E500 EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 flowing helium cryostat. Em values for FS1 and FS3 were determined at 12 K and 20 milliwatt while that of FS2 were determined at 40 K and 2 milliwatt, all at a frequency of 9.38 GHz. All spectra were corrected for internal EPR tube diameters. Presented data are representative of two independent potentiometric titrations for each Sdh mutant. Samples for spin quantitation measurements were prepared by oxidizing with 160 μm potassium ferricyanide or reducing with 8 mm sodium dithionite. Calculations were done using 1 mm copper-EDTA as standard. Enzyme Assays—Succinate-dependent reduction of MTT (ϵ = 17 mm-1 cm-1) was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm in the presence of 750 μm phenazine methosulfate (PMS) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (12Kita K. Vibat C.R. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anaerobic succinate-dependent reduction of Q0 (ϵ = 0.73 mm-1 cm-1) was monitored at 410 nm; anaerobicity was achieved by saturating the assay buffer with N2 and the addition of glucose (20 mm) and glucose oxidase (8.8 units ml-1) to the reaction cuvette. Anaerobic oxidation of plumbagin (ϵ = 3.95 mm-1 cm-1) in the presence of fumarate was measured at 419 nm as described (35Rothery R.A. Chatterjee I. Kiema G. McDermott M.T. Weiner J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in N2-saturated buffer. Turnover numbers were calculated based on covalent flavin concentrations. Heme Reduction Assays—Stopped flow experiments were carried out using a Sequential Bio SX-17MV stopped flow spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) with a 1-cm path length at 25 °C. Pre-steady state heme reduction was monitored by subtracting A575 from A560. Sdh-enriched membranes at a total concentration of 1 mg ml-1 in N2-saturated 100 mm MOPS/5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, buffer were used. The assay was performed anaerobically in the presence of 50 mm KCN to eliminate overlapping heme absorbances from cytochromes bd and bo. Heme reduction was achieved by addition of 10 mm succinate, and a time window of 10 s was monitored. Temporal changes in absorbance were averaged and fitted to the double exponential equation ΔAbs = A1 e-k1t + A2 e-k2t + b where A1 and A2 are amplitudes, k1 and k2 are rate constants, t is time, and b is the end point of the data trace. ROS Assay—Generation of ROS was monitored at A550 using the superoxide-dependent cytochrome c reduction assay (ϵ(Fe2+ cytochrome c) -ϵ(Fe3+ cytochrome c) = 21 mm-1 cm-1) as described (27Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 36Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Essentially, Sdh enzyme, cytochrome c,Q0, KCN, superoxide dismutase, and succinate were added in the order listed to final concentrations of 1 μg ml-1,10 μm,50 μm, 10 mm, 30 units ml-1, and 10 mm, respectively. Using the published Sdh structure (Protein Data Bank file 1NEN) (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Tornroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Leger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), we elected to study two conserved hydrophobic residues located within 4 Å of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in SdhB, Ile-150 and Leu-220 (Fig. 1). These two residues were chosen based on their proximity to FS2 with the objective of examining the role of the low potential [4Fe-4S] cluster in Sdh. Three mutants, I150E, I150H, and L220S, were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and were analyzed by EPR spectroscopy and enzymatic assays. We first examined whether mutation of a hydrophobic residue to a charged or polar residue in the middle of the electron transfer subunit had an impact on the proper assembly and targeting of Sdh. Membrane preparations containing Sdh were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the covalent flavin content was determined. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel is depicted in Fig. 2 and shows that although the SdhB subunits of mutant enzymes run anomalously compared with the wild-type (WT), mutant enzymes are assembled and correctly targeted to the cytoplasmic membrane. Table 1 shows the flavin content determined for each membrane preparation, indicating virtually no difference between the amount of mutant and WT Sdh enzymes targeted to the cytoplasmic membrane. DW35 membranes were not included in the flavin assay as no covalently bound flavin was expected to be present. The concentrations of FS1 and FS3 as determined by spin quantitation are also shown in Table 1. The concentrations of FS2 are not shown due to the high intrinsic error in its determination (37Cammack R. Patil D.S. Weiner J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Quantitation of cofactors and midpoint potentials (mV) of [Fe-S] clusters in SdhMembranesQuantitation of SdhMidpoint PotentialsFlavinFS1FS3FS1FS2FS3nmol/mg proteinmVWT3.24.74.0−15 ± 15−213 ± 355 ± 15I150E3.24.24.2−33 ± 13−285 ± 1055 ± 10I150H3.33.94.2−30 ± 5−338 ± 1735 ± 0L220S2.65.33.6−18 ± 8−223 ± 3−20 ± 10 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3A shows the ability of the SdhB mutants to grow aerobically on succinate minimal medium at 37 °C. Clearly, the SdhB mutants were able to complement E. coli DW35 and support growth on succinate, with neither the growth rate nor the maximum growth density affected. It is well documented that Sdh can function as a fumarate reductase under anaerobic conditions (29Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we tested the ability of the mutants to support anaerobic growth on fumarate. E. coli DW35 did not grow on glycerol-fumarate medium (Fig. 3B) but grew well when complemented with the pFAS plasmid containing the WT Sdh. Both SdhB-Ile-150 mutants did not support growth on glycerol-fumarate minimal medium, whereas the SdhB-L220S mutant showed growth similar to DW35/pFAS. Potentiometric titrations and EPR spectroscopy were performed on the WT and mutant Sdh enzymes to determine the Em values of the [Fe-S] clusters in SdhB. Em values of the FAD and heme were not determined as the mutations in SdhB were not expected to alter their redox behaviors. Individual spectra and redox titration data are shown in supplemental information. Table 1 lists the average Em values determined for the WT and mutant enzymes in two independent experiments. Redox titration of the WT enzyme yielded Em values of -15, -213, and +55 mV for FS1-FS3, respectively, which are in reasonable agreement with previously published values (11Condon C. Cammack R. Patil D.S. Owen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9427-9434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the SdhB-I150E mutant, the Em value of FS2 was decreased by ∼70 mV to -285 mV with no major changes in the Em values of FS1 and FS3. A similar case was observed with the SdhB-I150H mutant, where Em values of FS1 and FS3 were unchanged while an average Em value of -338 mV was recorded for FS2, a decrease of 125 mV compared with the WT enzyme. The SdhB-L220S mutant did not alter Em values of FS1 or FS2 but, surprisingly, did alter the Em value of FS3 by lowering it to -20 mV. Steady state activity assays using the non-physiological acceptor PMS/MTT to measure the assembly and quantity of enzyme in the membrane showed that the Ile-150 mutants and the WT had comparable succinate:PMS/MTT activity and so were assembled to similar levels (Fig. 4). The L220S mutant showed a 50% decrease in PMS/MTT activity after taking into account the covalent flavin contents. Using the succinate:Q0 assay as a measure of physiological Sdh activity, all three mutants showed a decrease in activity. The turnover rate decreased ∼65% for the Ile-150 mutants and almost 80% for the L220S mutant. When plumbagin was used to measure the fumarate reductase activity of the mutant enzymes, we found the I150E mutant to have the smallest effect and the L220S mutant the largest decrease in activity. The ability of the heme b to be reduced by succinate was measured using the stopped flow technique (Fig. 5). Activated enzyme was reduced by addition of succinate, and the A560 was monitored on a 10-s time window. Triplicate traces were averaged and fitted to a double exponential equation from which we found k1 to be significantly decreased in the Ile-150 mutants while k1 and k2 were ∼0 in the L220S mutant. k1 was decreased from 6.44 s-1 (WT enzyme) to 1.05 and 1.35 s-1 in the I150E and I150H mutants, respectively. A1 for the WT, I150E, and I150H enzymes were -4.82 × 10-3, -5.12 × 10-3, and -3.09 × 10-3, respectively. No changes in K2 and A2 were observed in the Ile-150 mutants. Finally, we examined the ability of the SdhB mutants to produce ROS during enzyme turnover. Because it has been demonstrated that both Sdh and E. coli fumarate reductase can produce ROS, the former enzyme at the Q site and the latter enzyme at the FAD site (27Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 38Guo J. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47629-47635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we inquired whether a bottleneck in the electron transfer rate in Sdh affects ROS production. Also, we wanted to confirm whether the decrease in enzyme turnover in the SdhB mutants is indeed due to slower electron transfer rate or whether it is a side effect of short-circuiting the electron pathway by increased solvent exposure when the hydrophobic residues were replaced by hydrophilic amino acids. Fig. 6 shows that in all the SdhB mutants, ROS generation during physiological turnover was decreased compared with the WT enzyme, which correlates with the decreased rates of succinate:Q0 turnover. In this study, we examined the role of hydrophobic residues around the low potential [4Fe-4S] cluster of Sdh, as well as the intimate relationship between enzyme turnover, electron transfer rate, and cofactor midpoint potential. Extensive studies on bacterial ferredoxins have yielded insights into how the Em of [Fe-S] clusters are generally controlled by the surrounding amino acids and degree of solvent exposure (14Adman E.

Specifically, it was found that in the Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxin I protein, mutation of Phe residues to His can increase Em values of nearby [Fe-S] clusters by 100 - 200 mV (21Chen K. Bonagura C.A. Tilley G.J. McEvoy J.P. Jung Y.S. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Burgess B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 188-192PubMed Google Scholar). We found that conversion of SdhB-Ile-150 to Glu lowered the Em value of FS2 from -213 to -285 mV; when the same residue was altered to His, the Em value of FS2 surprisingly showed an additional decrease in Em value to -338 mV. This is the opposite effect to that observed in the ferredoxin I protein by Chen et al. (21Chen K. Bonagura C.A. Tilley G.J. McEvoy J.P. Jung Y.S. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Burgess B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 188-192PubMed Google Scholar). We strongly believe that there is a functional relationship between Ile/Glu/His and a nearby [Fe-S] cluster as we have also observed similar decreases in Em values of a [Fe-S] cluster in Me2SO reductase when a nearby Ile residue is mutated to Glu and His. 4V. W. T. Cheng, R. A. Rothery, and J. H. Weiner, unpublished data. An alternative explanation may be offered by residue SdhB-Cys-154, which has been proposed to H-bond to FS2 such that it raises the apparent Em value of the cluster in Sdh (6Hudson J.M. Heffron K. Kotlyar V. Sher Y. Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6977-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the x-ray crystallography structure (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Tornroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Leger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), Cys-154 is a possible H-bond donor to one of the cysteine ligands of FS2, but is 7.5 Å from Ile-150. Glu and His mutants of Ile-150 may cause local perturbations in the structure such that it H-bonds to Cys-154, thus eliminating the C154-Sγ H-bond to FS2 and thereby decreasing the Em of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. H-bonds to [Fe-S] clusters have been shown to contribute between 50 and 200 mV to the overall Em of [Fe-S] clusters (9Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Chen K. Bonagura C.A. Tilley G.J. McEvoy J.P. Jung Y.S. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D.

The observation that the L220S mutant has no significant effect on FS2 but instead decreased the Em value of FS3 is much harder to rationalize. In the published Sdh structure, the Leu-220 residue is close to FS3 but is also pointing away from FS3. It is possible that the L220S mutant induces some conformational change in the electron transfer subunit that affects the redox behavior of FS3, but not that of FS1 or FS2. An x-ray crystallography structure of the L220S mutant would be needed to completely understand why FS3 was unexpectedly affected in this mutant. When we examined the enzymatic activities of the SdhB-Ile-150 mutants, it was found that both had decreased succinate:Q0 and plumbagin:fumarate activities despite having similar succinate:PMS/MTT activities. In terms of FS2 Em values, the WT enzyme had the highest midpoint potential, followed by I150E and I150H. This trend can be correlated to succinate:Q0 and plumbagin:fumarate activities, where the WT enzyme has the highest turnover followed by the I150E and I150H mutants. Thus if we raise the energetic barrier against ET, we slow down the rate of electron flux or steady state turnover of the enzyme in both the forward and reverse directions. Thus far, we have been unable to raise the Em value of FS2 to verify whether the converse is true. Although we have observed a direct relationship between Em values of FS2 and turnover rates in Sdh, it is interesting to point out that an inverse relationship was recently observed between Em values of FS2 and turnover in E. coli fumarate reductase (6Hudson J.M. Heffron K. Kotlyar V. Sher Y. Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6977-6989Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Increases in cofactor Em values that result in increases in enzymatic activity have also been observed in the Rieske protein (9Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C.H. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and recently in the Blastochloris viridis reaction center (10Alric J. Lavergne J. Rappaport F. Vermeglio A. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Nagashima K.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 4136-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The turnover rates observed in the L220S mutant were also decreased compared with the wild-type enzyme. We believe that the decreased activities are the result of altering the Em value of FS3, which is adjacent to and may exchange electrons directly with the Q site. Experiments done on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae bc1 complex, E. coli Me2SO reductase, and E. coli fumarate reductase have shown that alteration of the Em value of the [Fe-S] cluster adjacent to the Q site can cause major changes in enzyme activity (9Denke E.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The trend seen in the in vitro enzyme assays for the three SdhB mutants was not reflected in the aerobic or anaerobic growth in minimal medium. The mutant enzymes were able to complement E. coli DW35 for aerobic growth on succinate minimal medium, presumably because the overexpressed level of Sdh overcomes their decreased succinate:Q0 activities (29Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is intriguing to note that, despite having the lowest plumbagin: fumarate turnover, the L220S mutant was able to support growth on glycerol-fumarate minimal medium whereas the Ile-150 mutants could not. We propose that this phenomenon arises from the energetic restrictions in electron transfer. In the WT enzyme, the ΔEm for the FS3 → FS2 transition is -268 mV. In the I150E and I150H mutants, this ΔEm value increases to -340 and -383 mV, respectively. Thus, the electrons have a higher energy barrier to surmount when the I150E and I150H mutants are functioning as a fumarate reductase and are apparently unable to do so in vivo. In the L220S mutant, however, the ΔEm for the FS3 → FS2 transition is now only -203 mV, less than the value calculated for the WT Sdh. We propose that the Em values of the [Fe-S] clusters in Sdh are poised such that in vivo the forward reaction of succinate oxidation is favored compared with that of fumarate reduction reaction. Because the active sites of Sdh are already biased toward succinate oxidation and ubiquinone reduction (3Cecchini G. Schroder I. Gunsalus R.P. Maklashina E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Maklashina E. Iverson T.M. Sher Y. Kotlyar V. Andrell J. Mirza O. Hudson J.M. Armstrong F.A. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the [Fe-S] clusters exert an additional level of control over the directionality of electron transfer such that the succinate:UQ reaction is preferred in Sdh. This hypothesis can also be applied to the homologous E. coli fumarate reductase enzyme, wherein FS1-FS3 have Em values of -35, -310, and -65 mV, respectively (37Cammack R. Patil D.S. Weiner J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the ET relay in E. coli fumarate reductase would favor electron transfer from FS3 to FS1. The effects of Em values in relation to electron transfer have also been previously examined in Me2SO reductase (7Cheng V.W. Rothery R.A. Bertero M.G. Strynadka N.C. Weiner J.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8068-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In terms of ROS production, we did not see any significant change relative to the succinate:Q0 activity in the SdhB mutants. The imposition of a higher energy barrier in the Ile-150 mutants slows down electron transfer, meaning that cofactors upstream of FS2 such as the FAD are more likely to be reduced. Because Sdh produces ROS at the Q site (27Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 38Guo J. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47629-47635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we might expect less ROS to be produced from the I150E and I150H mutants. Indeed, we saw decreases in ROS production in all three mutants that correlate with the decreases in physiological turnover rates. This suggests that ROS production only occurs during the UQ → UQH2 reduction step, rather than a simple leakage of electrons to molecular oxygen from the ET chain. In this study, the midpoint potentials of the [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters of Sdh were individually lowered by point mutations of hydrophobic residues to charged and polar residues. Lowering the Em values of these [Fe-S] clusters led to decreases in in vitro enzyme turnover rates. Based on results obtained in this study, we propose that the Em values of the [Fe-S] clusters in Sdh act as a checkpoint such that the forward reaction of succinate oxidation is the preferred reaction over the fumarate reduction reaction.

https://openalex.org/W1998771922,"A water-soluble aldose sugar dehydrogenase (Asd) has been purified for the first time from Escherichia coli. The enzyme is able to act upon a broad range of aldose sugars, encompassing hexoses, pentoses, disaccharides, and trisaccharides, and is able to oxidize glucose to gluconolactone with subsequent hydrolysis to gluconic acid. The enzyme shows the ability to bind pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) in the presence of Ca2+ in a manner that is proportional to its catalytic activity. The x-ray structure has been determined in the apo-form and as the PQQ-bound active holoenzyme. The beta-propeller fold of this protein is conserved between E. coli Asd and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus soluble glucose dehydrogenase (sGdh), with major structural differences lying in loop and surface-exposed regions. Many of the residues involved in binding the cofactor are conserved between the two enzymes, but significant differences exist in residues likely to contact substrates. PQQ is bound in a large cleft in the protein surface and is uniquely solvent-accessible compared with other PQQ enzymes. The exposed and charged nature of the active site and the activity profile of this enzyme indicate possible factors that underlie a low affinity for glucose but generic broad substrate specificity for aldose sugars. These structural and catalytic properties of the enzymes have led us to propose that E. coli Asd provides a prototype structure for a new subgroup of PQQ-dependent soluble dehydrogenases that is distinct from the A. calcoaceticus sGdh subgroup."

Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 151-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). In the periphery, serotonin constricts large blood vessels and regulates platelet adhesion (5Craig D.A. Martin G.R. Br. J.

Serotonin, produced by the enterochromaffin cells of the intestinal system, initiates peristaltic and secretory reflexes (8Grider J.R. Kuemmerle J.F. Jin J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G778-G782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altered activity of serotonin is associated with various disorders such as depression, impulsive behaviors, aggression, suicide, drug abuse and alcoholism, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal diseases (such as irritable bowel syndrome), and cardiovascular dysfunction leading to heart failure (9Jacobs B.L. Azmitia E.C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 165-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar). Recently, Walther et al. (10Walther D.J. Peter J.U. Bashammakh S. Hortnagl H. Voits M. Fink H. Bader M. Science. 2003; 299: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) discovered the gene responsible for nervous system TPH (TPH2). Unlike TPH1 now known to be the peripheral enzyme (11Walther D.J. Bader M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1673-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), TPH2 is neuron-specific and expressed predominantly in serotonergic neurons of the raphe nuclei (10Walther D.J. Peter J.U.

A. 2003; 100: 13525-13530Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Human TPH1 and TPH2 display 72% sequence homology and have high sequence identity within the COOH-terminal catalytic domain. The chromosomal location of these sister enzymes differ; human TPH1 is located on chromosome 11, while TPH2 is on chromosome 12. Full-length human TPH1 has been expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris (14Kowlessur D. Kaufman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, TPH1 is a notoriously unstable enzyme (15D'Sa C.M. Arthur Jr., R.E. States J.C. Kuhn D.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and formation of insoluble inclusion bodies has limited its purification in large quantities from E. coli (14Kowlessur D.

Martinez A. Haavik J. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While there are a number of important and informative crystal structures for the related enzymes phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, there is single reported structure for TPH1 from Stevens and colleagues (17Wang L. Erlandsen H. Haavik J. Knappskog P.M. Stevens R.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12569-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This crystal structure, hypothetical models based on other hydroxylase structures (18Jiang G.C. Yohrling G.J. Schmitt J.D. Vrana K.E. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15591-15601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) provide insight into the active site of TPH1 and the respective binding sites for substrates. The recent discovery and cloning of TPH2 offers new opportunities for understanding serotonin physiology. TPH2 has a divergent NH2-terminal regulatory domain, which shows more homology to that of TH (16McKinney J. Knappskog P.M. Pereira J. Ekern T. Toska K. Kuitert B.B. Levine D. Gronenborn A.M. Martinez A. Haavik J. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 33: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Chimerical tyrosine/tryptophan hydroxylase constructs have suggested that the tyrosine hydroxylase regulatory domain serves to stabilize the enzyme (21Mockus S.M. Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); therefore, recombinant TPH2 may exhibit more stability compared with TPH1. Additionally, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms have already been identified in the TPH2 gene that are associated with mental health disorders (22Zill P. Baghai T.C. Zwanzger P. Schule C.

Therefore, it is a priority to characterize structure/function relationships within this enzyme to better understand its regulation and role in human health and disease. Indeed, a report from the Haavik laboratory describes expression of human TPH2 (27McKinney J. Knappskog P.M. Haavik J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), while a recent report from Kuhn and colleagues describes the expression of recombinant mouse TPH2 (mTPH2) and the functional characterization of a naturally occurring coding region polymorphism (28Sakowski S.A. Geddes T.J. Kuhn D.M. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant hTPH2 and truncation mutants from E. coli using a novel autoinduction procedure (29Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Bacterial Expression and Purification of hTPH2—The bacterial expression construct for hTPH2 was constructed in two steps. First the internal NdeI and BamHI sites were removed through the introduction of silent mutations (using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To remove the internal BamHI site the following primers were used: 5′-CATGTTCCACTACTTGCGGGTCCTAAGTTTGCTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AACTGAGCAAACTTAGGACCCGCAAGTAGTGGAACATG-3′ (reverse). To remove the internal NdeI site, the following primers were used: 5′-GCAACTGCGGGCACATGGAGCAGGACTCCTTTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAAGGAGTCCTGCTCCATGTGCCCGCAGTTGCCCTTC-3′ (reverse). These changes were constructed through mutagenesis using the QuikChange side-directed mutagenesis kit. Second, an NdeI site was introduced at the start codon and a BamHI site after the TAA stop codon. (The primers were 5′-AAGCGACTGGACATATGCAGCCAGC-3′ and 5′-GCAACGGATCCTCAAATCCCCAGATATTGG-3′). The resultant PCR product was cut with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the equivalent sites in pET28-tev (a generous gift from Dr. W. Studier) (29Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). All primers were provided by the DNA Synthesis Core Laboratory of the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. PCR conditions were are follows: denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 55 °C, extension at 68 °C, and 20 cycles (QuikChange) or 35 cycles (amplification). This recombinant vector contains an NH2-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a cleavage recognition site for tobacco etch virus (TEV) nuclear inclusion la protease. The recombinant construct was then expressed in BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (E. coli) cells (Stratagene) in ZYP-5052 autoinduction medium plus 50 μm l-tryptophan. Grown at low temperatures (15 °C), these cells divide until they exhaust their glucose source and then reliably induce recombinant protein expression at very high titers (see Figs. 2 and 3) (29Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3A, the wild type hTPH2 was truncated at the amino terminus (NΔ150) or both amino and carboxyl termini (NΔ150/CΔ24) to delete the regulatory (R) or the subunit assembly (tetramerization) domains, respectively. C, catalytic domain. B, solubility of wild type hTPH2, its amino (NΔ150) and amino/carboxyl (NΔ150/CΔ24) deletion mutants expressed in ZYP5052-autoinduction medium. Upon lysis of the host bacteria, total homogenate protein (H) and high speed supernatant protein (S) samples were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were then resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and were Coommassie-stained. BenchMark PreStain (Invitrogen) was used as a molecular weight (MW) marker. C, the predicted structure of hTPH2 and its deletion mutation forms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TPH2-positive colonies were grown in ZYP-5052 autoinduction medium at 15 °C in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm. The cultures were sampled every 3 h between 33 and 51 h of culture, and their optical densities were measured at 600 nm. In parallel, hTPH2 enzyme activity was monitored from aliquots removed during the time course of enzyme induction. Following induction, E. coli were harvested by low speed centrifugation. The cell pellet was lysed with BugBuster® amine-free with benzonase and rLysozyme (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI) in the presence of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The lysate was then centrifuged at high speed (40,000 × g) to obtain soluble proteins. The clarified lysate was subjected to a rapid one-step metal chelate affinity chromatography procedure using either a 5- or 1-ml prepacked HiTrap nickel column (Amersham Biosciences) and an Akta FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) work station at 4 °C. Columns were first equilibrated with 25 mm imidazole and His-tagged protein bound. Recombinant protein was then eluted with a phosphate buffer containing 500 mm imidazole and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Eluted proteins were then dialyzed using a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (Pierce) while undergoing buffer exchange into storage buffer containing 10% glycerol at 4 °C. Attempts to cleave the hexa-His fusion peptide (26 amino acids) were unsuccessful as (a) the enzyme is highly unstable and lost activity during the digestion, and (b) the recombinant hTPH2 fusion is a poor substrate for TEV protease resulting in incomplete digestion even when digestion was carried out with 1:20 ratio of TEV to hTPH2. In these preliminary experiments, treatment of the soluble protein with TEV protease produced less than 50% cleavage. More importantly, the full-length enzyme was inactive following the incubation. Therefore, the experiments in this report were conducted with the intact fusion protein. The activity of the fusion enzyme is comparable with the wild type TPH1 (30Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and TPH2 (28Sakowski S.A. Geddes T.J. Kuhn D.M. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) enzymes (both fusion and native versions) as characterized previously. Enzyme Activity Assay—TPH2 activity was assayed by using a radioenzymatic 3H2O release assay as previously described by Reinhard et al. (31Reinhard Jr., J.F. Smith G.K. Nichol C.A. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and modified by Vrana et al. (32Vrana S.L. Dworkin S.I. Vrana K.E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Activity values derived from each assay were normalized to total protein present in the homogenates, as determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and were expressed as nmol/h/mg. All materials for activity assays were obtained from Sigma with the exception of activated charcoal (Darco G-60 from Fisher Scientific). Michaelis-Menten kinetic analyses were conducted by varying substrate (tryptophan or BH4) concentrations at a fixed concentration of the other substrate (50 μm BH4 and 50 μm tryptophan, respectively) and a fixed and ambient concentration of oxygen. Resulting data were converted to specific enzyme activities (correcting for varying radioactive amino acid concentrations, as necessary) and analyzed by Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to determine kinetic constants (Km, Vmax). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Expression of recombinant proteins and confirmation of molecular weights were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Proteins were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) run in MOPS buffer at 200 V, 115 A for 50 min. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Pierce) to visualize total protein and to assess purity. In addition, gels were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using a semidry electroblot apparatus (Owl Scientific, Cambridge, MA). Human TPH2 was detected by probing with a 1:1500 dilution of an affinity-purified sheep anti-TPH monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), which recognizes both TPH1 and TPH2. A 1:3000 dilution of donkey anti-sheep IgG secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Upstate Biotechnology) was used to detect recombinant protein following chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme Mutations by Deletion Analysis—As described in Fig. 3, two different deletion mutations were constructed. For the NΔ150 mutation, an NdeI restriction sequence was inserted into the wild type hTPH2 between amino acids 150 and 151 using the following primers: 5′-GAAGAAGAGCTAGAGGATCATATGGTGCCCTGGTTCCCTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGAGGGAACCAGGGCACCATATGATCCTCTAGCTCTTCTTC-3′ (reverse). Then this mutated plasmid was digested with NdeI and religated (elimination the first 150 codons). The NΔ150/CΔ24 deletion construct was created by inserting a stop codon (TGA) into the NΔ150 mutation from the COOH terminus between amino acids 24 and 25 (residues 151–476). This was accomplished with the following primers: 5′-AGTATTGAAAATGTGTGATAGGTGCAGGACCTTCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′GCGAAGGTCCTGCACCTATCACACATTTTCAATACT-3′ (reverse). Deletion mutagenesis for each construct was carried out, in a termocycler, under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 55 °C, extension at 68 °C, and 20 cycles using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. The hTPH2 sequences were determined to confirm the desired deletions and to eliminate unexpected mutations. To delete the regulatory and/or subunit assembly domains, hTPH2 was truncated at the amino terminus (NΔ150) and both the amino and carboxyl termini (NΔ150/CΔ24). Each construct was subjected to the same procedures as described for the wild type construct throughout the study. Enzyme Solubility—Aliquots of E. coli (5 ml) expressing wild type hTPH2 and deletion mutants (10 OD units/ml) were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min. After discarding the supernatant, each pellet was lysed in 1 ml of lysis solution (described above) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Aliquots (3 μl) were taken from each lysate sample and designated as total protein homogenate. The remaining lysate materials were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min, and aliquots (3 μl) of the supernatants were taken from each sample and designated as high speed supernatant. Both total and corresponding high speed supernatants were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the protein. The band corresponding to hTPH2 was scanned, the local background subtracted (as determined in a bacterial control), and the amount of soluble hTPH2 expressed as a percentage of that present in the homogenate. Enzyme Stability—Purified wild type hTPH2 and deletion mutants were incubated at 37 °C, and samples were removed and placed on ice every 15 min from initiation to 180 min. Enzyme activity was then determined as described above and analyzed as a function of activity decay (on a logarithmic plot). Analysis of hTPH2 Quaternary Structure—Purified wild type hTPH2, NΔ150 and NΔ150/CΔ24 were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA. A standard curve was constructed using apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) in the same buffer. In addition to monitoring absorbance at 280 nm, where noted, enzyme activity was determined, or Western immunoblots were conducted on fractions collected during the chromatography. Statistical Analysis—The TPH activity determinations were analyzed using GraphPad-4 one-way analysis of variance followed by an unpaired Student's t tests. Statistical significance was associated with values of p < 0.05. Active TPH2 Expression following Autoinduction—The expression system in the present study takes advantage of a recent report by Dr. W. Studier (Bookhaven National Laboratories) that permits the induction of expression from pET-based expression plasmids in an IPTG-free medium (29Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). We compared autoinduction and IPTG expression systems at two different incubation temperatures: 15 and 25 °C. In both cases, significantly more soluble protein was obtained at 15 °C compared with 25 °C. For the autoinduction system, this corresponded to a 15-fold increase in active protein, and for IPTG induction it was a 3.5-fold increase. Comparison of the relative yields of the two induction systems at 15 °C showed that autoinduction resulted in 11.8-fold more active hTPH2 protein compared with IPTG induction of mid-log growth cells (data not shown). The onset of the autoinduction of the expression of the wild type hTPH2 construct was determined to be 33 h after the initiation of the culture (Fig. 2). Activity increased dramatically for the subsequent 7 h and reached a plateau. Cell growth continued for an additional 10 h reaching a maximum optical density at 600 nm of ∼14; however, the specific enzyme activity per unit of optical density of the culture declined. This is consistent with the observations reported by McKinney et al. (27McKinney J. Knappskog P.M. Haavik J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Based upon our growth/activity measurements, E. coli cultures expressing TPH2 and TPH2 variants were harvested 45 h after the initiation of the culture for the following purification and activity studies. The onset of the autoinduction was observed to be similar in other E. coli cultures that express hTPH2 deletion constructs (data not shown). Although the expression of active enzyme was found to be high, this system was limited in its production of large quantities of soluble hTPH2 as determined by the SDS-gel electrophoresis of the lysate (crude sample) and high speed supernatant (soluble proteins) (Fig. 3B). This is similar to what we have seen with other aromatic amino acid hydroxylases such as TH and TPH1. A number of attempts to increase solubility by harvesting cells at earlier time points or growing the cells at lower temperatures did not further improve solubility (data not shown). Based on our previous studies and published reports by others, it is our belief that the limited solubility of full-length hTPH2 is due the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of the enzyme. Therefore, the next series of the studies tested this hypothesis by deleting regions of the enzyme. Deletion of Both Regulatory and Tetramerization Domains Results in Higher Solubility—In concordance with the notion that the NH2-terminal regulatory domain decreases solubility, deletion studies showed an increase in TPH1 solubility. The highest solubility was achieved when both regulatory and tetramerization domains were truncated. Deletion of the regulatory domain resulted in dramatically increased solubility, while deletion of the amino and carboxyl termini generated nearly completely soluble enzyme (Fig. 3B). Solubilities of the three recombinant proteins were estimated to be 6.9, 62, and 97.5% for full-length hTPH2, NΔ150, and NΔ150/CΔ24, respectively. Interestingly, deletion of just the COOH-terminal tetramerization domain did not increase the solubility or stability (data not shown). A major advantage of the pET28-tev expression system is the ability to conduct a rapid purification following a single-step Ni2+ affinity column. Both NΔ150 and NΔ150/CΔ24 deletion products were purified with high efficiency as detected by Coomassie staining (Fig. 4, A and B). By contrast, the full-length, wild type hTPH2 purifies as a minor component (Fig. 4, A and B) that can then be enriched by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4C). Unfortunately, based on the instability of the wild type hTPH2 (see Fig. 5), even this relatively rapid, two-step approach produces inactive enzyme (data not shown). The enhanced purity of the NH2-terminal truncation mutants stems largely from their greater solubility and consequently they represent a higher fraction of the soluble protein in extracts compared with constructs containing the NH2-terminal domain.FIGURE 5The stability of hTPH2 and deletion mutations was measured during a 3-h incubation at 37 °C. The activity for each enzyme was measured every 15 min. Half-lives were found to be 30, 203, and 147 min for hTPH2, NΔ150, and NΔ150/CΔ24, respectively. The wild type hTPH2 activity (solid triangles) rapidly decreased. In contrast, the activity of NΔ150 (open circles) and NΔ150/CΔ24 (solid circles) remained stable.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stability Analysis—Inactivation time courses were conducted for the recombinant enzymes (Fig. 5). Half-lives for inactivation at 37 °C were found to be 30, 203, and 147 min for hTPH2, NΔ150, and NΔ150/CΔ24, respectively (Fig. 5). Although not shown, the CΔ24 truncation mutant was also found to be very unstable with a half-life of less than 30 min. Analysis of hTPH2 Quaternary Structure—Based on size-exclusion chromatography, both wild type hTPH2 and NΔ150 were determined to be tetramers with a size of 236 and 168 kDa, respectively, reflecting their differential subunit size (hTPH2 = 59 kDa; NΔ150 = 42 kDa). On the other hand, NΔ150/CΔ24 was determined to be monomer with a size of 39 kDa (the size of the monomeric protein; Fig. 6). Kinetic Analysis—Given the caveat that the three recombinant enzymes have very different stabilities, we performed enzyme kinetic analysis to determine Michaelis-Menten constants (Table 1). To summarize, removal of the NH2-terminal regulatory domain (NΔ150) produced no significant change in either the Km for BH4 or tryptophan. Ironically, deletion of both the NH2-terminal regulatory and COOH-terminal tetramerization domains (NΔ150/CΔ24) produced opposite effects in Km values. That is, the Km,BH4 was increased 2-fold, while the Km,Trp was decreased almost 3-fold. For both deletion constructs, there were apparent increases in Vmax values that we believe reflect their increased stability and differences in purity. Finally, attempts to extend these findings to the CΔ24 deletion of just the COOH-terminal tetramerization domain produced an insoluble enzyme of such limited stability that it failed to provide reliable kinetic values (data not shown).TABLE 1The steady-state kinetic parameters of wild type hTPH2 and its deletion mutations (n = 3-8)Km,l-TrpVmax,l-TrpKm,BH4Vmax,BH4μMnmol/min/mgμMnmol/min/mgWild type hTPH224.26 ± 5.126.35 ± 4.2617.89 ± 3.021.7 ± 2.6NΔ15020.1 ± 3.457.33 ± 6.2516.88 ± 3.9123.6 ± 22.3NΔ150/CΔ2441.79 ± 3.12242 ± 21.96.22 ± 1.4137.6 ± 3.2 Open table in a new tab In 2003, the central nervous system tryptophan hydroxylase isoform, TPH2, was discovered (10Walther D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2069292251,"PDZK1 is a multi-PDZ domain-containing adaptor protein that binds to the C terminus of the high density lipoprotein receptor, scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI), and controls the posttranscriptional, tissue-specific expression of this lipoprotein receptor. In the absence of PDZK1 (PDZK1(-/-) mice), murine hepatic SR-BI protein levels are very low (<5% of control). As a consequence, abnormal plasma lipoprotein metabolism (∼1.5-1.7-fold increased total plasma cholesterol carried in both normal size and abnormally large high density lipoprotein particles) resembles, but is not as severely defective as, that in SR-BI(-/-) mice. Here we show that the total plasma cholesterol levels and size distribution of lipoproteins are virtually identical in SR-BI(-/-) and SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-) mice, indicating that most, if not all of the effects of PDZK1 on lipoprotein metabolism are likely because of the effects of PDZK1 on SR-BI. Hepatic overexpression of wild-type SR-BI in PDZK1(-/-) mice restored near or greater than normal levels of cell surface-expressed, functional SR-BI protein levels in the livers of SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-) mice and consequently restored apparently normal lipoprotein metabolism in the absence of PDZK1. Thus, PDZK1 is important for maintaining adequate steady state levels of SR-BI in the liver but is not essential for cell surface expression or function of hepatic SR-BI.

Hepatic overexpression of wild-type SR-BI in PDZK1(-/-) mice restored near or greater than normal levels of cell surface-expressed, functional SR-BI protein levels in the livers of SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-) mice and consequently restored apparently normal lipoprotein metabolism in the absence of PDZK1. Thus, PDZK1 is important for maintaining adequate steady state levels of SR-BI in the liver but is not essential for cell surface expression or function of hepatic SR-BI.

The multiple PDZ domains in PDZK1 presumably mediate its simultaneous interaction with several target proteins, thus permitting it to orchestrate complex biological functions by acting as a scaffolding protein (42Kocher O.

Shibata N. Nishimoto-Shibata T. Feng D. Ikemoto M. Motojima K. Iso O.N. Tsukamoto K. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13404-13409Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser509 of PDZK1 modulates its ability to regulate SR-BI. Other studies have established the importance of both PDZK1 and the C terminus of SR-BI for the hepatic activity of SR-BI in vivo and its influence on lipoprotein metabolism (26Kocher O.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For example, in PDZK1 knock-out (KO) mice hepatic SR-BI levels are only ∼5% of that in wild-type mice, and this is accompanied by a 1.5-1.7-fold increase in plasma total cholesterol carried in abnormally large HDL particles (a phenotype reminiscent of, but not identical to, that in SR-BI(-/-) mice) (26Kocher O.

The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of PDZK1 on SR-BI, including the tissue specificity of this effect, have not yet been elucidated. In the current study, we have used PDZK1(-/-) and SR-BI(-/-) mice together with hepatic overexpression of stable SR-BI transgenes to explore the mechanism by which PDZK1 influences lipoprotein metabolism and SR-BI activity. We found that essentially all of the consequences of PDZK1 deficiency on lipoprotein metabolism appear to be due to its effects on SR-BI. Hepatic overexpression of wild-type SR-BI could restore near or greater than normal levels of functional, cell surface SR-BI protein levels in the livers of SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-) double knock-out mice and consequently could also restore apparently normal lipoprotein metabolism in the absence of PDZK1. Thus, PDZK1 is important for maintaining adequate steady state levels of SR-BI in the liver but is not essential for cell surface expression or function of hepatic SR-BI, provided that sufficient amounts of SR-BI are generated in these cells. Animals—All mice were fed a regular chow diet (Harlan Teklad (RMH 3000)) with water supplied ad libitum. SR-BI(-/-) mice on a mixed 50:50 C57BL/6:129-S4 background (19Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L.

Two new strains of SR-BI transgenic mice on a SR-BI(-/-) background were generated as described previously (17Yesilaltay A. Morales M.G. Amigo L. Zanlungo S. Rigotti A. Karackattu S.L. Donahee M.H. Kozarsky K.F. Krieger M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1.5-kilobase fragment spanning the wild-type murine SR-BI cDNA was amplified by PCR from a plasmid (pDT188) that contains the cloned murine SR-BI cDNA (4Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 17Yesilaltay A. Morales M.G. Amigo L. Zanlungo S. Rigotti A. Karackattu S.L. Donahee M.H. Kozarsky K.F. Krieger M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 1.5-kilobase cDNA fragment encoding the gene in its entirety was subcloned between the MunI and XhoI sites in the pLIV-LE6 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. John M. Taylor, Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, University of California, San Francisco). The SR-BI-coding region was confirmed by DNA sequencing using four primers spanning the gene. The pLiv-LE6 plasmid contains the promoter, first exon, first intron, and part of the second exon of the human apoE gene and the polyadenylation sequence and a part of the hepatic expression control region of the apoE/apoC-I gene locus (44Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The new constructs harboring the SR-BI gene as well as the above-mentioned apoE/apoC-I control locus elements were linearized by NotI/SpeI digestion, and the resulting 6.5-kilobase fragments were used to generate, by standard procedures (45Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 465-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), two new transgenic mouse lines in a 50:50 mixed C57BL/6 × 129 murine background. These mice stably overexpress hepatic SR-BI transgenes at levels ∼6-fold (SR-BI-Tg (med)) and ∼60-fold (SR-BI-Tg (hi)) greater than in wild-type mice. As noted previously (17Yesilaltay A. Morales M.G. Amigo L. Zanlungo S. Rigotti A. Karackattu S.L. Donahee M.H. Kozarsky K.F. Krieger M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), these transgenes are expressed mainly in the liver. There is very low level expression of the transgene in the kidney on the apical surfaces of the epithelial cells in the proximal tubules facing the tubular lumen rather than the plasma, and thus this minor renal expression of SR-BI does not appear to influence substantially plasma lipoprotein metabolism (17Yesilaltay A.

All of these mice were used to generate the new strains used in this study, all on a mixed 75:25 129:C57BL/6 background, with the following genotypes: SR-BI(+/+)/PDZK1(+/+) (wild type); SR-BI(+/+)/PDZK1(-/-); SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(+/+); SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-); SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-)[SR-BI-Tg (med)]; and SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-)[SR-BI-Tg (hi)]. Genotypes were determined by PCR as described previously (17Yesilaltay A. Morales M.G. Amigo L. Zanlungo S. Rigotti A. Karackattu S.L. Donahee M.H. Kozarsky K.F. Krieger M.

Immunoblotting was performed using either 2.5 or 50 μg of protein samples of liver lysates. The detection of ϵ-COP using a polyclonal antibody was used as a loading control (17Yesilaltay A.

Immunohistochemical Localization of Hepatic SR-BI—Livers were harvested, fixed, and frozen, and 5-μm sections were prepared and stained with primary anti-SR-BI and secondary biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. SR-BI was visualized by immunoperoxidase staining, and the sections were counterstained with Harris modified hematoxylin as described previously (17Yesilaltay A. Morales M.G. Amigo L. Zanlungo S. Rigotti A. Karackattu S.L. Donahee M.H. Kozarsky K.F. Krieger M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of differences was determined by one-way analysis of variance Tukey's post hoc test. Differences were considered significant when p was <0.05. Both SR-BI(-/-) and PDZK1(-/-) mice exhibit hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol ∼2.3-fold or ∼1.5-1.7-fold above wild-type, respectively) and abnormally large HDL particles (Refs. 19Rigotti A.

Although the dramatic (∼95%) reduction in hepatic SR-BI levels in PDZK1(-/-) mice seems likely to have been the principal cause of the dyslipidemia found in PDZK1(-/-) mice, some of the effects of the loss of PDZK1 may be the consequence of SR-BI-independent mechanisms. To examine this issue directly, we compared the plasma cholesterol levels and lipoprotein profiles of single knock-out mice (PDZK1(-/-) or SR-BI(-/-)) with those of double knock-out mice (SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-)) generated by crossing the single KO mice. The plasma cholesterol levels (272 ± 13 mg/dl in SR-BI(-/-) versus 252 ± 13 mg/dl in SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-); Table 1, no transgene), plasma unesterified cholesterol levels (results not shown), and plasma lipoprotein size distributions (as determined by FPLC size exclusion chromatography; Fig. 1) showed that the plasma lipoproteins of SR-BI(-/-)/PDZK1(-/-) double KO and SR-BI(-/-) single KO animals were essentially indistinguishable. Given that PDZK1 deficiency does not exert any additional effects on plasma lipoprotein cholesterol in SR-BI(-/-) mice, it appears that the effects of PDZK1 on plasma lipoprotein metabolism are primarily because of its effects on SR-BI.TABLE 1Plasma total cholesterol levels in nontransgenic and SR-BI transgenic animalsTransgenePDZK1 genotypeSR-BI genotypeTotal plasma cholesterolmg/dlaValues (mg/dl) are represented as means ± S.E.,bp < 0.0001 by one-way analysis of variance for all values, and p < 0.05 by Tukey's post hoc test for all pairwise comparisons except those pairs marked as c, d, e, or fNone+/++/+117 ± 8 (n = 6)cNot statistically significantly different from each otherNone–/–+/+170 ± 9 (n = 10)dNot statistically significantly different from each otherNone+/+–/–272 ± 13 (n = 9)eNot statistically significantly different from each otherNone–/––/–252 ± 13 (n = 8)eNot statistically significantly different from each otherSR-BI-Tg (med)+/+–/–60 ± 7 (n = 8)SR-BI-Tg (med)–/––/–144 ± 10 (n = 10)cNot statistically significantly different from each other,dNot statistically significantly different from each otherSR-BI-Tg (hi)+/+–/–3 ± 1 (n = 5)fNot statistically significantly different from each otherSR-BI-Tg (hi)–/––/–4 ± 1 (n = 7)fNot statistically significantly different from each othera Values (mg/dl) are represented as means ± S.E.b p < 0.0001 by one-way analysis of variance for all values, and p < 0.05 by Tukey's post hoc test for all pairwise comparisons except those pairs marked as c, d, e, or fc Not statistically significantly different from each otherd Not statistically significantly different from each othere Not statistically significantly different from each otherf Not statistically significantly different from each other Open table in a new tab There are several potential, yet not mutually exclusive, mechanisms by which PDZK1 could influence hepatic SR-BI activity. For example, PDZK1 may be essential for the proper delivery of SR-BI from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the sinusoidal plasma membranes. In that case, in PDZK1(-/-) mice SR-BI may never reach the plasma membrane of hepatocytes, and its missorting may result in its rapid degradation and thus low steady state levels. Thus, even if the steady state levels of SR-BI in PDZK1(-/-) mice could be raised artificially to wild-type levels, SR-BI would not be functional because it could not be delivered properly to the cell surface. Independently of its effects on the steady state levels of SR-BI or its intracellular transport, PDZK1 might be essential for the normal function of SR-BI molecules that reach the cell surface, including their lipoprotein binding and lipid transport activities. Indeed, there is precedence in cell culture studies for an effect"

ADPKD cyst-lining cells have an increased proliferation rate and are surrounded by an abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM). We have previously shown that Laminin 5 (Ln-5, a α3β3γ2 trimer) is aberrantly expressed in the pericystic ECM of ADPKD kidneys. We report that ADPKD cells in primary cultures produce and secrete Ln-5 that is incorporated to the pericystic ECM in an in vitro model of cystogenesis. In monolayers, purified Ln-5 induces ERK activation and proliferation of ADPKD cells, whereas upon epidermal growth factor stimulation blocking endogenously produced Ln-5 with anti-γ2 chain antibody reduces the sustained ERK activation and inhibits proliferation. In three-dimensional gel culture, addition of purified Ln-5 stimulates cell proliferation and cyst formation, whereas blocking endogenous Ln-5 strongly inhibits cyst formation. Ligation of α6β4 integrin, a major Ln-5 receptor aberrantly expressed by ADPKD cells, induces β4 integrin phosphorylation, ERK activation, cell proliferation, and cyst formation. These findings indicate that Ln-5 is an important regulator of ADPKD cell proliferation and cystogenesis and suggest that Ln-5 γ2 chain and Ln-5-α6β4 integrin interaction both contribute to these phenotypic changes.

ADPKD is a systemic disorder characterized by the development of multiple renal cysts and variably associated with liver, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and genital abnormalities. In Western countries, ADPKD accounts for 5-10% of end stage renal disease (1Wilson P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). ∼85% of families with ADPKD are linked to the PKD1 locus on chromosome 16 (2Hughes J. Ward C.J. Peral B. Aspinwall R. Clark K. San Millan J.L. Gamble V. Harris P.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). In the remaining families, the genetic defect is linked to the PKD2 locus on chromosome 4 (3Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by PKD1 and PKD2, polycystins 1 (Pc-1) and 2 (Pc-2), are transmembrane proteins that are able to interact, function together as a non-selective cation channel (4Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), and also induce several distinct transduction pathways. The “polycystin complex” may have three different subcellular localizations and associated putative functions (5Boletta A. Germino G.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 484-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar): at lateral membranes of the cells (with a role in cell-cell interaction) (6Streets A.J. Newby L.J. O'Hare M.J. Bukanov N.O. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ong A.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1804-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); at the basal pole of the cell (with a role in cell-extracellular matrix interaction) (7Wilson P.D. Geng L. Li X. Burrow C.R. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 1311-1323PubMed Google Scholar); and at the apical primary cilia of the cells (with a putative role in the mechanotransduction of the urinary flux) (8Yoder B.K. Hou X.

Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). In ADPKD renal cysts, somatic mutations of the wild-type allele of PKD1 and PKD2 and subsequent loss of the functional polycystin complex presumably trigger a cascade of signaling and gene expression events, ultimately leading to cyst formation. ADPKD renal cysts originate from the epithelia of the nephrons and collecting ducts. Cyst-lining cells are distinguished by increased proliferation, poor differentiation, and abnormalities in cell polarity, fluid secretion, and extracellular matrix production (1Wilson P.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Expanding cysts must remodel their environment as they enlarge. Morphological anomalies of the cyst-surrounding ECM have been described in human and animal models of polycystic kidney disease. Pericystic ECM appears thickened and multilaminated in the earliest detectable cysts (10Cuppage F.E. Huseman R.A. Chapman A. Grantham J.J. Kidney Int. 1980; 17: 372-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Cowley Jr., B.D. Gudapaty S. Kraybill A.L. Barash B.D. Harding M.A. Calvet J.P. Gattone II, V.H. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 522-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cystic epithelial cells produce an abnormal basement membrane and have an abnormal proliferative response to ECM proteins (12Taub M. Laurie G.W. Martin G.R. Kleinman H.K. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 1090-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Beavan L.A. Carone F.A. Nakamura S. Jones J.K. Reindel J.F. Price R.G. Arch. Biochem.

Thus, altered extracellular matrix has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of ADPKD. However, the contribution of specific ECM proteins to the development of renal cysts is ill defined. We have previously shown that Laminin 5 is strongly expressed by ADPKD cells and by the pericystic ECM of ADPKD kidneys, whereas no Laminin 5 expression could be detected in adult control kidneys (15Joly D. Morel V. Hummel A. Ruello A. Nusbaum P. Patey N. Noel L.H. Rousselle P. Knebelmann B. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Laminins are a family of at least 15 multifunctional αβγ heterotrimeric proteins commonly found in basement membranes of epithelia (16Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The various isoforms have a cell- and tissue-specific expression and are differentially recognized by integrins. Laminins undergo a sequential series of extracellular proteolytic cleavages that might successively turn on and off one or several of their biological and mechanical functions through interaction with integrins and other cell surface receptors (17Ghosh S. Stack M.S. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 51: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 (Ln-5) is a heterotrimer of α3, β3, and γ2 chains. Its cell surface receptors are integrins α6β4, α2β1, α3β1, and α6β1. Mature Ln-5 plays a fundamental role in keratinocyte adherence by promoting through its interaction with α6β4 integrin the assembly of strong and stable adhesion structures called hemidesmosomes (18Nievers M.G. Schaapveld R.Q. Sonnenberg A. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In peritumoral ECM, Ln-5 is frequently overexpressed, and the proteolytic-driven modulation of its biological activity could trigger tumor progression (19Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) and migration properties with subsequent invasion and metastasis (20Dajee M. Lazarov M. Zhang J.Y. Cai T. Green C.L. Russell A.J. Marinkovich M.P. Tao S. Lin Q. Kubo Y. Khavari P.A. Nature. 2003; 421: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Based on our recent discovery of Ln-5 aberrant expression in the pericystic ECM in ADPKD, we hypothesized that this molecule could promote cystogenesis. In the present study, we characterize the Ln-5 γ2 chain isoforms produced and secreted by ADPKD cyst-lining cells and provide evidence for a crucial role for Ln-5 in proliferation, signaling, and in vitro cystogenesis. Antibodies, Matrix Molecules, and Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies were obtained as follows: anti-integrin α2 (clone P1E6), anti-integrin α3 (clone P1B5), anti-integrin α6 (clone GoH3), anti-integrin β1 (clone 6S6), anti-integrin β4 (clone 3E1), and anti-Laminin 5 γ2 chain (clone D4B5) were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); anti-PCNA (clone PC10) was from Novocastra (Newcastle, UK); anti-phosphotyrosine was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal antibodies were anti-Laminin 5 L132 raised against purified native Laminin 5, a gift from Dr. Patricia Rousselle (Lyon, France), anti-β4 (clone H-101) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) from New England BioLabs, and total ERK1/2 from Sigma. Secondary antibodies and nonspecific mouse IgGs were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse antibody, Alexa Fluor, was from Molecular Probes. Purified human ECM molecules used in this study were Laminin 5 (Ln-5; α3β3γ2, purified from SCC25 cells), a kind gift from Dr. Patricia Rousselle (21Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and collagen I and collagen IV purchased from Sigma. Culture plates were coated for 3 h at 37 °C with 1-50 μg/ml Laminin 5, collagen I, or collagen IV in PBS; unbound sites were blocked with 1% albumin in PBS at 37° for 2 h. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, HEPES, and cell dissociation buffer were from Invitrogen. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel® was from BD Biosciences. All other reagents were from Sigma unless specified. Cell Culture—Primary cell cultures of cystic epithelium (“ADPKD cells”) and non-cystic epithelium (“control cells”) were established as previously described (15Joly D. Morel V. Hummel A. Ruello A. Nusbaum P. Patey N. Noel L.H. Rousselle P. Knebelmann B. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), subcultured, and exclusively used between passages 2 and 4. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-based medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 6.5 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 1% HEPES (Invitrogen), referred to as “defined medium”. For functional studies (cell proliferation, see below), cells were cultivated for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% HEPES (referred to as “starvation”) to obtain quiescence, harvested with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), washed, and resuspended in basal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (referred to as “basal medium”) containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and 1% HEPES, supplemented with EGF and various antibodies when indicated. In Vitro Cyst Formation—Gel mix was made of a mixture of ice-cold liquefied growth factors, reduced Matrigel®, and isotonic saline (80/20%). 1.5 104 cells were incorporated to 100 μl of gel mix, dispensed into flat bottomed 96-well culture plate wells, and incubated at 37 °C. After solidifying, gel mix was overlaid with 100 μl of defined medium. Plates were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and observed daily. Cysts were visualized using a ×20 objective and counted under a light microscope at day 7. Six optic fields in triplicate wells were counted for each condition. For functional experiments, purified Ln-5 was added to the gel mix to reach the final concentration of 2-20 μg/ml. Anti-Laminin 5 D4B5-blocking Ab (final concentration 10 μg/ml), anti-α2,-α3,-α6,-β1 integrin antibodies (final concentration 10 μg/ml) and anti-β4 integrin 3E1-stimulating Ab (final concentration 2 μg/ml) were added to the defined medium every other day. Cell Proliferation—In monolayer culture, when ADPKD or control cells reached 70% confluence the defined medium was replaced by basal medium to induce quiescence. After 24 h, cells were harvested with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), washed, and seeded in a 96-well plate at the concentration of 2500 cells/100 μl/individual chamber in basal medium to maintain cell viability during the experimental period. The wells had been previously left uncoated or coated with ECM molecules (as described above). After 12 h of adhesion, the basal medium was replaced by basal medium containing the indicated concentrations of EGF or antibodies. The Promega Cell titer 96 MTT assay method was used to assess number of cells before medium replacement (T0) and the relative rate of cell proliferation after 3 days of culture (T72). This colorimetric assay system measures the reduction of a tetrazolium component (MTT) into an insoluble formazan product by the mitochondria of viable cells, and the relative absorbance at 595 nm measured after incorporation of MTT is linearly correlated to the number of viable cells counted by a classical hema-cytometer technique. In inhibition of proliferation experiments, apoptosis and anoikis were ruled out by daily microscopic analysis of the monolayers and terminal differentiation was ruled out by the ability of cells to proliferate after addition of fresh defined medium (results not shown). In three-dimensional gel culture, defined medium was removed at day 6, and gel mixes were submitted to Promega Cell titer 96 MTT assay to assess the rate of cell proliferation as above. A well containing the gel mix without cells was used as reference for absorbance measurement at 595 nm. Immunoblot Analysis—In monolayer cultures, cells were harvested with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA, lysed in buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)) for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants from cells cultured for 48 h were collected and concentrated 40 times using Microcon membranes (Amicon®). Cyst fluids retrieved from ADPKD patients were similarly concentrated 10 times. In three-dimensional gel cultures, the culture medium was discarded and the gel mix was liquefied in ice-cold lysis buffer to retrieve proteins. Equal amounts of protein were denatured in the sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% mercaptoethanol, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA), and detected with the appropriate antibodies using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL plus; Amersham Biosciences) and Biomax films (Kodak). When monolayer experiments were conducted in 96-well plates, cells were directly harvested, lysed, and denatured using 95 °C heated sample buffer and processed as above. β4 Integrin Phosphorylation—To obtain selective ligation of α6β4 in the absence of any co-stimulus, cells were serum starved, detached with cell dissociation buffer, resuspended at 5·106 cells/200-μl aliquots, and incubated at 37 °C in suspension with the 3E1 monoclonal antibody (50 μg/ml) coupled with protein-Sepharose A/G beads for the indicated times. After cell lysis at 4 °C in lysis buffer, beads were pelleted, washed three times with lysis buffer, and eluted with 1 × sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (as described above) with anti-phospho-tyrosine mAb. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-β4 polyclonal Ab. Immunofluorescence—Gel mixes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature followed by 100% methanol at -20 °C for 20 min and saturated for 30 min with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, with intermediate washes in PBS. Gel mixes were immunostained with either anti-Laminin 5 D4B5 mAb (1 h at 4 °C, 1:100) or anti-Laminin 5 L132 pAb (1 h at room temperature, 1:100) and anti-β1 6S6 mAb (1 h at room temperature, 1:100) or anti-PCNA PC10 mAb (2 h at room temperature, 1:50), and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse antibody and then probed for 60 min at room temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI (Sigma). For Laminin 5 and β1 integrin stainings, gel mixes were observed with an inverted fluorescence microscope. For PCNA staining, semi-liquefied gels were transferred and spread on coverslips, mounted with Aquapolymount antifading solution (Agar) onto glass slides, and observed under a Leica fluorescence microscope. For each culture condition, PCNA-positive nuclei were counted in at least 150 multicellular structures and results were expressed as a percentage of nuclei identified by DAPI counterstaining. Statistical and Density Scanning Analyses—Experiments were performed at least three times with primary cultures originating from different ADPKD kidneys. Density scanning was performed with NIH image 6.02 software. Data are presented as means ± S.E. or S.D. and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with the unpaired t test. Values considered as significant were p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), or p < 0.001 (***). Ln-5 Expression and Secretion by ADPKD Cystic Epithelia—In a previous study, we reported that Ln-5 is strongly expressed by the pericystic ECM of ADPKD kidneys, whereas no Ln-5 expression could be detected in non-cystic adult control kidneys. Ln-5 aberrant expression was similarly observed in primary cultures of epithelial cells derived from ADPKD cysts when compared with control renal tubular epithelial cells (15Joly D. Morel V. Hummel A. Ruello A. Nusbaum P. Patey N. Noel L.H. Rousselle P. Knebelmann B. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To study Ln-5 production during in vitro cyst formation, ADPKD cells were incorporated in three-dimensional Matrigel-based gels and incubated at 37 °C for 7-10 days. Multicellular cystic structures became apparent at day 3-4 and were allowed to grow until day 6 (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescent costaining with anti-Ln-5 L132 pAb and integrin β1 showed exclusive basal staining around cysts, suggesting that Ln-5 is incorporated in the ECM (Fig. 1A, panels a and b). A similar pattern was observed with the anti-Ln-5 γ2 chain D4B5 mAb, suggesting that Ln-5 chains are assembled together in the pericystic ECM (Fig. 1A, panel f). To further assess Ln-5 production by ADPKD cells, we performed immunoblotting with the anti-Ln-5 γ2 chain D4B5 mAb in various two- and three-dimensional cell culture conditions. Known proteolytic fragments of the γ2 chain are depicted in Fig. 1B. Ln-5 γ2 chain was detected in cell lysates of quiescent and EGF-stimulated ADPKD cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2), both in its mature form (155 kDa) and in its processed isoform γ2′(domains I-III, 100 kDa). Ln-5 γ2 chains were also found in the supernatant of ADPKD cells cultured for 48 h, suggesting a cellular secretion (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). Of note, mature γ2 was not detectable, and in addition to the γ2′ isoforms, we identified a 60-kDa fragment that was dramatically overexpressed after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1C, lane 4). These results suggest an overall increased production and secretion of Ln-5 after EGF stimulation. In three-dimensional culture conditions, although our gel mix contained very little Ln-5 (Fig. 1C, lane 5), ADPKD cells undergoing cystogenic growth produced significant amounts of Ln-5 with major bands at 100, 60, and 30 kDa and a faint band at 150 kDa corresponding to unprocessed γ2 chain (Fig. 1C, lane 6). Interestingly, the Ln-5 γ2 chain isoform profiles differed when ADPKD cells were grown in two-dimensional and in cystogenic three-dimensional conditions and the 30-kDa band appearance was restricted to three-dimensional culture conditions, suggesting that a specific proteolytic cleavage of the γ2 chain occurs in this setting. In cyst fluid retrieved from ADPKD patients, 60- and 30-kDa Ln-5 γ2 chain bands were detected (Fig. 1D), indicating that Ln-5 secretion and proteolysis also occurred during in vivo cystogenesis. Ln-5 Induces ADPKD Cell Proliferation—One key feature associated with cyst formation in ADPKD is enhanced cell proliferation. ADPKD cells displayed a higher proliferation rate compared with control cells when grown in defined medium (Fig. 2A) or in basal medium supplemented with 10 or 20 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 2B). Conversely, in basal medium, ADPKD cells did not display any significant proliferation advantage over control cells (Fig. 2A). To selectively assess the effects of Ln-5 on proliferation in the absence of any co-stimulus, quiescent cells were plated on plastic or dishes coated with purified ECM components (purified Ln-5, collagen I, collagen IV) and cultured in basal medium for 3 days. Ln-5, but not collagen I or IV, stimulated cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with a more pronounced effect on ADPKD cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, a dose-dependent effect was observed with increasing concentrations of Ln-5-coated dishes from1to50 μg/ml (Fig. 2C). Upon EGF stimulation, ADPKD cells both produce Ln-5 and proliferate. To investigate whether endogenously produced Ln-5 could participate in ADPKD cell proliferation, quiescent ADPKD cells were stimulated by EGF and incubated with the anti-Ln-5 D4B5-blocking antibody for 3 days. As shown in Fig. 2D, D4B5 did not reduce cell number at T0 (12 h after plating), ruling out a major effect on cell adhesion. By contrast, D4B5 blunted the proproliferative effects of EGF stimulation. No cellular apoptosis or necrosis was detected in D4B5-treated ADPKD cells. Additionally, D4B5 decreased EGF-stimulated proliferation dose dependently, with a maximal effect (-75%) obtained at 10 μg/ml (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data suggest that aberrant expression of Ln-5 confers a proliferative advantage to ADPKD cells, with a specific role for the γ2 chain of Ln-5. Ln-5-induced ERK Activation in ADPKD Cells—Upon ligation to their ECM ligands and subsequent activation, integrins induce signaling events and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase ERK1 and ERK2 activity (22Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in turn leads to transcriptional control of genes important for cell proliferation (23Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). We examined whether Ln-5 could activate ERK in quiescent ADPKD cells. After 30 min of adhesion, ERK1,2 phosphorylation was barely detectable on a plastic support, significant on collagens I and IV and more robust on Ln-5-coated dishes (Fig. 3A). In addition, a dose-dependent effect of Ln-5-induced ERK activation was observed (5 and 10 μg/ml). Time course experiments revealed that the level of ERK activation peaked at 30 min of adhesion and declined thereafter (not shown). We next examined the ability of the anti-Ln-5 D4B5 antibody to disrupt EGF-mediated ERK activation. Time course experiments revealed that quiescent ADPKD cells grown on plastic and stimulated by EGF displayed a more sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation (up to 16 h) when compared with control cells (Fig. 3, B and C). As shown on Fig. 3, Ln-5 blocking by D4B5 antibody reduced EGF-induced prolonged ERK activation, whereas no effect was observed on early ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, D and E). Taken together, these results suggest that endogenously produced Ln-5 may contribute to a sustained ERK activation and therefore increase proliferation of ADPKD cyst-lining cells. Ln-5 Regulates in Vitro Cyst Formation—To address the role of Ln-5 in cyst formation and cyst enlargement, we used the in vitro system described above in which ADPKD cells incorporated in three-dimensional Matrigel®-based gels progressively form multicellular cystic structures. Incorporation of various amounts of purified Ln-5 to the gel mix enhanced cystic formation, as assessed by the number of cysts per optic field at day 7 (Fig. 4A). Ln-5 incorporation to the gel mix was also associated with an increased number of viable cells, as assessed by MTT test (Fig. 4B). Inversely, addition of anti-Ln-5 D4B5 mAb (10 μg/ml every other day) to the gel mix supernatant drastically reduced the number of cysts formed at day 7 by 73 ± 9% (Fig. 4C). In three-dimensional gel cultures, initially isolated ADPKD cells treated with D4B5 proliferated and ultimately formed predominately non-cystic multicellular structures (Fig. 4D). In this setting, the number of viable cells determined by MTT test was reduced by 19 ± 28% (non-significant) when compared with cells treated with isotypic IgG (Fig. 4E), with no morphologic signs of apoptosis or necrosis. To further delineate the role of Ln-5 in proliferation of three-dimensional cultured cells, we studied PCNA staining of nuclei in multicellular (either cystic or non-cystic) structures. As shown in Fig. 4F, D4B5 significantly reduced the percentage of PCNA-positive nuclei in gel mixes stimulated by EGF. Overall, these results suggest that Ln-5 not only maintains its proproliferative effects in three dimensions but also is a mandatory ECM component to maintain cystic architecture of ADPKD cells. Among Ln-5 Integrin Receptors, α6β4 Is an Important Mediator of ADPKD Cell Proliferation and Cystogenesis—We have previously shown that integrin chains α2, α3, α6, and β1 are strongly expressed by both ADPKD and control kidneys; conversely, β4 integrin is not detectable in adult tubular epithelial cells, although strongly expressed by ADPKD cyst-lining cells along with an α6 chain. β4 immunoblots also suggested that α6β4 integrin aberrant expression was maintained in vitro in both quiescent and growing primary cultures of ADPKD cells (15Joly D. Morel V. Hummel A. Ruello A. Nusbaum P. Patey N. Noel L.H. Rousselle P. Knebelmann B. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We thus elected to focus on the role of Ln-5-α6β4 integrin interaction, which is likely to be a distinctive feature of ADPKD cyst-lining cells compared with normal tubular epithelial cells. To mimic Ln-5-α6β4 interaction, we used the stimulating anti-β4 antibody 3E1 (24Daemi N. Thomasset N. Lissitzky J.C. Dumortier J. Jacquier M.F. Pourreyron C. Rousselle P. Chayvialle J.A. Remy L. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Incubation of 3E1-coupled beads with ADPKD cells in suspension, which ligates and clusters β4 at the cell surface, induced β4 integrin tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). To confirm that α6β4 integrin receptor was involved in Ln-5-induced ERK activation, quiescent ADPKD cells were plated on dishes precoated with anti-β4 3E1 mAb. As shown in Fig. 5B, β4 integrin ligation by 3E1 strongly induced ERK1,2 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that among Ln-5 receptors integrin α6β4 is able to activate ERK signaling pathway. Incubation of 3E1-soluble antibody in basal medium induced proliferation of quiescent ADPKD cells with a dose response between 0.125 and 2 μg/ml (Fig. 5C). We then assessed the role of α6β4 integrin and other Ln-5 integrin receptors in cyst formation. In three-dimensional culture conditions, incorporation of stimulating anti-β4 mAb 3E1 to the gel supernatant increased the number of cysts formed (+34 ± 31%), whereas cyst formation was reduced by anti-α6 (-23 ± 20%) and anti-β1 (-32 ± 6%) and not statistically modified by anti-α2- and anti-α3-blocking antibodies (Fig. 5D). Overall, these results indicate that overexpressed Ln-5 and α6β4 form a functional axis that contributes to proliferation and cystogenesis of ADPKD cells and that among other LN-5 receptors α6β1 integrin also participates in cyst formation.

Golgin-160 has a large coiled-coil C-terminal domain and a non-coiled-coil N-terminal (“head”) domain. The head domain contains important motifs, including a nuclear localization signal, a Golgi targeting domain, and three aspartates that are recognized by caspases during apoptosis. Some of the caspase cleavage products accumulate in the nucleus when overexpressed. Expression of a non-cleavable form of golgin-160 impairs apoptosis induced by some pro-apoptotic stimuli; thus cleavage of golgin-160 appears to play a role in apoptotic signaling. We used a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen for interactors of the golgin-160 head and identified GCP60 (Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa). Further analysis demonstrated that GCP60 interacts preferentially with one of the golgin-160 caspase cleavage fragments (residues 140–311). This strong interaction prevented the golgin-160 fragment from accumulating in the nucleus when this fragment and GCP60 were overexpressed. In addition, cells overexpressing GCP60 were more sensitive to apoptosis induced by staurosporine, suggesting that nuclear-localized golgin-160-(140–311) might promote cell survival. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for regulating the nuclear translocation and potential functions of golgin-160 fragments.

Our results suggest a potential mechanism for regulating the nuclear translocation and potential functions of golgin-160 fragments. The Golgi complex is an essential organelle of the secretory pathway. In higher eukaryotic cells, it is composed of polarized stacks of cisternal membranes (reviewed in Ref. 1Marsh B.J. Howell K.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, these stacks are organized into a larger ribbon structure located next to the nucleus at the microtubule organizing center (2Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 2-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This highly organized Golgi ribbon is not required for cargo processing and sorting but may have other functions, including a role in signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 3Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The structure of the Golgi is very dynamic. During mitosis the Golgi reversibly disassembles into small vesicular and tubular compartments, which contain some structural components of the Golgi. This process is regulated by mitotically active kinases (reviewed in Ref. 4Short B. Haas A. Barr F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Golgi complex also undergoes irreversible disassembly during apoptosis. This process is controlled by caspase cleavage of Golgi structural proteins rather than by phosphorylation. Some caspase substrates with a role in establishment and maintenance of the Golgi complex are GRASP65 (5Lane J.D. Lucocq J. Pryde J. Barr F.A. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. Lowe M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), GM130 (6Nozawa K. Casiano C.A. Hamel J.C. Molinaro C. Fritzler M.J. Chan E.K. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), giantin (7Lowe M. Lane J.D. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), p115 (8Chiu R. Novikov L. Mukherjee S. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and golgin-160 (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 10Maag R.S. Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cleavage of these proteins is necessary for efficient apoptotic disassembly of the Golgi. When a caspase-resistant form of GRASP65, p115, or golgin-160 is expressed, Golgi disassembly during apoptosis is delayed. Interestingly, when overexpressed, a potential C-terminal caspase cleavage product of p115 translocates to the nucleus and can induce apoptosis (8Chiu R. Novikov L. Mukherjee S. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This suggests that the cleavage of Golgi proteins during apoptosis is important not only for Golgi disassembly but might also play a role in apoptotic signaling. Golgin-160, like GM130 and giantin, is a member of the golgin family. Golgins were initially identified by antibodies from patients with autoimmune disease (reviewed in Ref. 11Nozawa K. Fritzler M.J. Chan E.K. Autoimmun. Rev. 2005; 4: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This diverse family is characterized by localization to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi and a large coiled-coil region that can form a rodlike structure (reviewed in Ref. 12Barr F.A. Short B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Golgin-160 is composed of a large C-terminal coiled-coil region and an N-terminal non-coiled-coil (“head”) domain (13Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N-terminal head of golgin-160 can be cleaved by caspases at aspartates 59 (caspase-2), 139 (caspase-3), and 311 (caspase-2, -3, or -7) (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Additionally, the golgin-160 head contains a Golgi targeting domain and a cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS) 3The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; GCP60, Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GOLD, Golgi dynamics domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PARP, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.3The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; GCP60, Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 kDa; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GOLD, Golgi dynamics domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PARP, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. (14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The NLS is cryptic because the full-length molecule is not localized to the nucleus, but fragments corresponding to caspase cleavage products that contain the NLS are translocated and accumulate in the nucleus. Thus, it is possible that caspase cleavage exposes the NLS that is otherwise hidden in the full-length protein (14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The function of these golgin-160 fragments is still not known, but cells expressing a non-cleavable mutant of golgin-160 are resistant to a subset of pro-apoptotic stimuli (15Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results support the idea of a signaling function for the Golgi complex during apoptosis. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the golgin-160 N-terminal head domain. We found that the Golgi complex-associated protein of 60 amino acids (GCP60) binds golgin-160 and, interestingly, shows preferential binding for a fragment of golgin-160 that is generated by caspase cleavage. This binding can prevent nuclear accumulation of the golgin-160 fragment when GCP60 is overexpressed and alter apoptosis in response to staurosporine. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A Matchmaker pretransfomed HeLa cDNA library (Clontech) was screened using the Matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 and the golgin-160 head (amino acids 1–393) as bait, as previously described (16Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28944-28951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding amino acids 18–528 from GCP60 was isolated. The full-length GCP60 cDNA was constructed by using the 5′-end from a commercial IMAGE EST clone (number 4813993, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and the two-hybrid cDNA. Expression Constructs—The Myc-tagged constructs of the different golgin-160 fragments have been previously described (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). pEGFP-GCP60 was generated using the SacI/KpnI sites of the modified pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech), T7-EGFP-C3 (14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The untagged version of GCP60 used for in vitro transcription and translation was made by insertion of the GCP60 sequence into the SacI and KpnI sites of pBS-KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pEGFP-GCP60 N- and C-terminal regions (1–175 and 328–528) were generated by PCR amplification followed by insertion of the fragments into the BglII and EcoRI sites of the modified pEGFP-C1 vector, T7-EGFP-C1 (14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GCP60(1–175)D15E and GFP-GCP60(1–175)D22E constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene), and base changes were confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy sequencing method. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of golgin-160 have been previously described (16Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28944-28951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The GST-golgin-160-(60–311) construct was made by PCR amplification and cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Cells and Antibodies—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA) and 0.1 mg/ml normocin-O (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-golgin-160 have previously been described (15Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-GCP60 were selected after transient transfection (described below) in normal growth medium containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Colonies were screened for GCP60 expression by fluorescence. The anti-N-terminal golgin-160 antibody has been previously described (14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and anti-GFP mouse antibodies were from Roche Applied Science as were the monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies. The anti-human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibodies were from BD Biosciences (Pharmingen). The Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA), and the Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Molecular Probes. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips (70–80% confluent) and transfected with 1 μg of DNA per 35-mm dish using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. At 18 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, rinsed in PBS containing 10 mm glycine (Gly/PBS) for 5 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in Gly/PBS for 3 min, and rinsed in Gly/PBS. The coverslips were then incubated in primary antibodies for 20 min, washed twice with Gly/PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies. After washing, the cells were incubated with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 3 min, washed, and mounted in glycerol containing 0.1 m N-propyl gallate. The images were collected on an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence and a Sensys CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using IP Lab software (Signal Analytic, Vienna, VA). The scoring of cells for Fig. 3B was as follows. The nuclear classification was used for cells with exclusively nuclear staining or nuclear staining that was equal or stronger than Golgi staining. The Golgi classification was used when the Golgi staining was stronger than nuclear staining (see insets in Fig. 3B). Approximately 150 cells were counted for each transfection condition in four independent experiments. Binding Assays—The GST constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-codon plus (Stratagene) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For the binding assays, 10 μg of purified GST and GST fusion proteins were rebound to glutathione beads and incubated overnight with either transfected HeLacell lysates or [35S]methionine-labeled protein. The 35S-labeled protein was generated by coupled in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) programmed with a plasmid encoding the appropriate protein behind a T7 promoter and Redivue [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translated protein was diluted in detergent solution (62.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.4% deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Sigma, catalog number P8340) before incubation with GST proteins. The transfected HeLa cell lysates were obtained as follows. Cells cultured in 60-mm plates (70–80% confluent) were transfected using FuGENE 6 as described above. The cells were lysed in detergent solution, incubated on ice for 15 min, and spun at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Lysates (or in vitro translated protein) were incubated with the beads overnight and washed three times in detergent solution. Bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting or phosphor imaging. For immunoblotting, electrophoresed proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the membranes were blocked in 5% milk-TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Incubation with the appropriate primary antibody was overnight at 4 °C and with secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. The primary antibodies were diluted in TBS-T containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide, whereas the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a 1:2000 dilution in TBS-T only. Membranes were analyzed using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and measured by the VersaDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software. In Vitro Cleavage Assay—[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were generated by in vitro transcription and translation as described above. The labeled proteins were diluted with 100 μl of either caspase-2 buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol) or caspase-3 buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose). The diluted samples were split into two 60-μl aliquots. One aliquot of each sample received the appropriate caspase: 0.159 μg of caspase-2 (1.66 units/mg) or 0.116 μg of caspase-3 (5.55 units/mg) (both from Sigma). The other aliquots served as mock-treated controls. All samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized on a Molecular Imager FX PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One software. Apoptosis Assay—The apoptosis assay has been previously described (15Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, stable cell lines expressing golgin-160 (15Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or GFP-GCP60 were plated in regular growth medium in six-well plates 1 day before treatment with 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma). The drug was added in 1.5 ml of regular growth medium (without normacin). After treatment, cells were scraped into the medium and spun at 1000 rpm (150 × g) for 20 min. The samples were rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and respun. Cells were lysed in detergent solution (as described earlier) and incubated on ice for 15 min. An aliquot of the sample was used to determine protein concentration by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL). For analysis of PARP cleavage, 50 μg of protein was electrophoresed in a 10% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane, and immunoblotting was performed using anti-PARP antibodies. Quantification of the chemiluminescent signal was performed using a VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad). The percent of PARP cleavage was determined by measuring full-length and cleaved PARP bands, subtracting background, and then dividing the amount of cleaved PARP by the amount of total PARP (full-length plus cleaved). Golgin-160 Interacts with GCP60 in Vitro—We previously showed that the N-terminal “head” domain of golgin-160 (amino acids 1–393) encodes important motifs (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We thus searched for interactors with this region by performing a yeast two-hybrid screen using golgin-160 (1–393) as bait. The screen included ∼1 × 107 clones of a pretransformed HeLa cell library, and two of the isolates encoded the GCP60. GCP60 was initially identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner of the Golgi protein giantin (17Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). GCP60 was also reported by another group to interact with both the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIα at mitochondria, for which it was named PAP7 (18Liu J.

The sequence of GCP60 predicts that the protein contains an acyl-CoA binding site, a coiled-coil region, and a Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain (Fig. 1A) (17Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A.

Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0023)Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction of golgin-160 with GCP60 we performed an in vitro binding assay using GST fused to golgin-160-(1–393) or GST alone and lysates of HeLa cells expressing GFP-GCP60. GST proteins were prebound to glutathione beads and incubated with cell lysates, and after washing, GFP-GCP60 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, GST-golgin-160-(1–393) but not GST alone was able to precipitate GFP-GCP60. These data demonstrate that GCP60 can interact specifically with golgin-160. GCP60 Preferentially Recognizes the Golgin-160-(140–311) Fragment—We have previously shown that cleavage of golgin-160 by caspase-2, -3, and/or -7 during apoptosis generates distinct fragments (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To investigate how golgin-160 cleavage affects its interaction with GCP60, we produced GST fusion proteins corresponding to the different golgin-160 fragments that would be generated when the protein is cleaved by caspases (Fig. 2A). Binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We observed that GCP60 interacted weakly with golgin-160-(60–311) similar to golgin-160-(1–393) and did not interact with the golgin-160-(60–139) fragment. These results indicated that the binding domain for GCP60 is between residues 140 and 311 of golgin-160 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the interaction of golgin-160-(140–311) with GCP60 was much stronger than that seen for golgin-160-(1–393) or -(60–311) (Fig. 2B). To confirm this interaction, untagged GCP60 was [35S]methionine-labeled by in vitro transcription and translation and incubated with the same GST fusion proteins. We observed that GCP60 bound to golgin-160-(140–311) better than to any of the other golgin-160 fragments, including golgin-160-(1–393), which represents the full N-terminal head of golgin-160 (Fig. 2C). Our results suggest that either the golgin-160 binding site for GCP60 is mostly masked in the full-length head and 60–311 fragment or that a conformational change after caspase cleavage of golgin-160 at Asp-139 promotes its interaction with GCP60. GCP60 Prevents Accumulation of Golgin-160 Fragments in Nucleus—As mentioned earlier, the N-terminal domain of golgin-160 contains a cryptic NLS that is responsible for the nuclear localization of golgin-160 fragments (14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether overexpression of GCP60 could affect the targeting of golgin-160 fragments, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids encoding GFP-GCP60 or GFP alone, in combination with the different Myc-tagged golgin-160-(1–393), -(60–311), and -(140–311) fragments. The localization of the expressed proteins was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Golgin-160-(1–393), -(60–311), and -(140–311) were mostly present in the nucleus when expressed in combination with GFP. However, when co-expressed with GFP-GCP60, the nuclear accumulation of these fragments was significantly reduced, and the Golgi localization increased (Fig. 3A). To quantify these results, we scored the expression pattern of each golgin-160 fragment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3B shows that overexpression of GCP60 increased the Golgi localization of all the golgin-160 fragments relative to their nuclear localization. Interestingly, golgin-160-(140–311), which was almost entirely targeted to the nucleus when expressed with GFP, showed an ∼80-fold increase in Golgi localization when co-expressed with GFP-GCP60. These observations correlate with the in vitro binding assays that show an increased binding of GFP-GCP60 to golgin-160-(140–311) relative to golgin-160-(1–393) or -(60–311). Our results suggest that binding of GFP-GCP60 may prevent golgin-160 fragments from accumulating in the nucleus. The C-terminal Portion of GCP60 Interacts with Golgin-160— To narrow down the GCP60 region responsible for binding golgin-160, plasmids encoding GFP-GCP60-(1–175) and GFP-GCP60-(328–528) were expressed in HeLa cells. Binding assays were performed with GST-golgin-160 fragments. We observed that a region of GCP60 between residues 328 and 528 was responsible for binding to golgin-160 (Fig. 4A). Additionally, the truncated version of GCP60 bound best to the golgin-160-(140–311) fragment similar to the interaction with full-length GCP60 (Fig. 2A versus Fig. 4A, right). The slight difference in mobility of GFP-GCP60-(328–528) observed in the lane with GST-golgin-160-(60–311) compared with the other lanes was because of co-migration of the GST fusion protein and the GFP-GCP60 fragment. Because the C-terminal portion of GCP60 contains the giantin-binding domain that localizes the protein to the Golgi, we looked at co-transfected cells to see if this portion was sufficient to prevent golgin-160 fragments from translocating to the nucleus. Fig. 4B shows that golgin-160 fragments were preferentially targeted to the Golgi in the presence of GCP60-(328–528) just as they were when the fulllength GCP60 protein was co-expressed (Fig. 3A). GCP60-(1–175), which does not bind to golgin-160, did not influence the targeting of golgin-160 fragments, as expected (Fig. 4B). Caspase-3, but Not Caspase-2, Cleaves GCP60 in Vitro—We have previously mapped unique cleavage sites in golgin-160 for caspase-2 (Asp-59) and caspase-3 (Asp-139) and a site that can be cleaved with caspase-2, -3, or -7 (Asp-11) (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Because golgin-160-(140–311) could be generated by caspase-3 alone or by combining cleavage of caspase-3 together with caspase-2 or -7 (Fig. 2A), we investigated if the activated caspases responsible for generating this golgin-160 fragment could also cleave GCP60. All GCP60 aspartate residues are found within the N-terminal (15–156) and C-terminal (343–528) portions of the protein. Therefore, in vitro cleavage assays were performed using plasmids encoding GCP60, GFP-GCP60-(1–175), and GFP-GCP60-(328–528). The constructs were expressed and labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro transcription and translation, diluted in the appropriate buffer, and incubated in the presence or absence of caspase-2 or caspase-3 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5A shows that caspase-2 does not cleave GCP60 although it did cleave Myc-tagged caspase-2 (used as positive control). On the other hand, caspase-3 cleaved GCP60 once (Fig. 5B). This cleavage site is located in the N-terminal portion of the protein because GFP-GCP60-(1–175) was cleaved but GFP-GCP60-(328–528) was not (Fig. 5B). The fragment size generated after caspase-3 incubation led us to consider aspartate 15 and aspartate 22 as candidates for cleavage. When Asp-15, but not Asp-22, was mutated to glutamate, caspase-3 cleavage was prevented, indicating that VSVD15G is the cleavage site for caspase-3 (Fig. 5C). Thus, we predict that caspase-3 cleavage of GCP60 should not affect its localization to Golgi membranes or its interaction with golgin-160-(140–311) (17Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, right). We confirmed caspase cleavage in vivo in cells treated with staurosporine or anisomycin, where the N-terminal GFP tag disappeared over time, consistent with the caspase-3 cleavage of the N-terminal site in GCP60 (data not shown). GCP60 Sensitizes HeLa Cells to Death in Response to Staurosporine Treatment—We have previously shown that a non-cleavable form of golgin-160 impairs apoptosis induced by some pro-apoptotic stimuli (15Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because the above experiments show that GCP60 cleavage by caspase-3 should not affect its interaction with golgin-160 fragments, we investigated the effects of overexpressing GCP60 on apoptosis. We used HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-GCP60 to ensure that all cells expressed a similar level of the transgene. As a control, we used cells stably expressing another GFP-tagged peripheral Golgi protein, GFP-golgin-160 (15Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cell lines were treated with 1 μm staurosporine, a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor that has been shown to promote cleavage of golgin-160 (15Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cell death was assessed by cleavage of PARP, a well characterized marker for apoptosis. Fig. 6 shows that after 2 h of staurosporine treatment, cells expressing GFP-GCP60 were significantly more sensitive to the drug. An increase in PARP cleavage was also observed when compared with untransfected HeLa cells (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that overexpression of GCP60 alters localization and the potential function of golgin-160-(140–311) during apoptosis. Golgin-160 is a peripheral membrane protein associated with the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi complex (13Misumi Y. Sohda M. Yano A. Fujiwara T. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23851-23858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has a long coiled-coil region, characteristic of all golgins, and a non-coiled-coil region (“head”) of 393 residues at the N terminus. We previously found that this head region has a cryptic nuclear localization signal (amino acids 232–239), a Golgi targeting domain (amino acids 172–257), and three aspartates targeted by caspases during apoptosis (Asp-59, Asp-139, and Asp-311) (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In a yeast two-hybrid screen searching for interactors of the golgin-160 head domain, we identified GCP60. GCP60 was previously identified as a giantin interactor (17Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Besides a central predicted coiled-coil, GCP60 is predicted to contain an acyl-CoA binding site and a GOLD domain, which is found in other Golgi proteins and is predicted to mediate protein-protein interactions (17Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (research0023)Google Scholar). The giantin-binding domain of GCP60 is contained between residues 373 and 528 and is responsible for its Golgi localization (17Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). GCP60 was proposed to be involved in structural maintenance of the Golgi because overexpression of wild type GCP60 or the giantin binding domain in COS-1 cells disrupted Golgi structure. However, we did not observe any changes in Golgi structure when GFP-GCP60 was overexpressed in HeLa cells, perhaps because expression levels were lower than in transfected COS-1 cells. Golgin-160 binds the C-terminal region of GCP60, similar to giantin. Further mutational analysis will be required to determine whether the binding sites overlap and if they are mutually exclusive. A separate study searching for interactors of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A regulatory subunit RIα identified PAP7 (20Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z.X. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Human PAP7 is 96% identical to human GCP60 (18Liu J. Li H. Papadopoulos V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although ubiquitous, GCP60/PAP7 expression is highest in steroid-producing tissues, including testis and ovary (20Li H. Degenhardt B. Tobin D. Yao Z.X. Tasken K. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2211-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PAP7 was detected in the Golgi region and in mitochondria in Leydig MA-10 cells (21Liu J. Cavalli L.R. Haddad B.R. Papadopoulos V. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 308: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This observation and the finding that Golgi perturbation led to increased mitochondrial localization of PAP7 with increased steroidogenesis suggest that PAP7 may be involved in cholesterol trafficking from the Golgi to mitochondria, where the early steps of steroid hormone synthesis occur (18Liu J. Li H. Papadopoulos V. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, GCP60/PAP7 appears to be localized exclusively at the Golgi complex in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A and Ref. 17Sohda M. Misumi Y. Yamamoto A. Yano A. Nakamura N. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45298-45306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cleavage of golgin-160 during apoptosis generates different fragments (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), exposing a cryptic NLS that allows accumulation of some of these fragments in the nucleus (14Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this work, we found that the golgin-160 binding domain for GCP60 was included between residues 140 and 311. Interestingly, golgin-160 (140–311) interacted much better with GCP60 than with either golgin-160-(1–393) or golgin-160-(60–311). Perhaps the GCP60 binding domain in golgin-160 is mostly masked when the protein is in its full-length form, and it becomes exposed in the golgin-160-(140–311) cleaved fragment. It is also possible that upon cleavage a conformational change in the golgin-160-(140–311) fragment favors interaction with GCP60. In either case, this implies an interesting mechanism for regulation of this protein-protein interaction. By contrast, golgin-160 interaction with PIST (another peripheral Golgi membrane protein) requires the residues flanking Asp-139, such that caspase cleavage at this site is predicted to block interaction (16Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28944-28951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The expression of a caspase-resistant form of golgin-160 disrupts apoptosis induced by a subset of apoptotic signals, suggesting a potentially important role for the cleavage fragments (15Maag R.S. Mancini M. Rosen A. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we showed that when GCP60 is overexpressed, the golgin-160 fragments that have an NLS tend to be retained at the Golgi. This Golgi retention correlates with the interaction between the golgin-160 fragments and GCP60. Golgin-160-(140–311), which showed the strongest in vitro interaction, was affected most dramatically by increasing its Golgi localization over 80-fold in the presence of overexpressed GCP60. By contrast, Golgi retention of golgin-160-(60–311) and golgin-160-(1–393) showed a much less dramatic effect. Golgin-160-(140–311) can be generated by caspase-3 alone, by caspase-3 and -2, or by caspase-3 and -7. We showed that caspase-2 cleaves golgin-160 early in apoptosis (9Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Because caspase-2 cleavage alone could generate golgin-160-(60–311), we speculate that golgin-160-(60–311) could be translocated to the nucleus if caspase-2 is activated before caspase-3. Once caspase-3 is active, it could cleave golgin-160 or golgin-160-(60–311) generating golgin-160-(140–311), which in the presence of sufficient GCP60 would remain at the Golgi. This could be a strategy used by the cell to regulate the nuclear translocation of golgin-160 fragments after caspase activation. To determine whether the interaction of golgin-160 fragments with GCP60 could occur in apoptotic cells, we investigated GCP60 as a target for the caspases that can generate golgin-160-(140–311). GCP60 was not cleaved by caspase-2 but was cleaved once by caspase-3. We mapped the aspartate residue in GCP60 that was targeted by caspase-3 to Asp-15. Thus, the C-terminal caspase-3 product of GCP60 would still be predicted to bind strongly to golgin-160-(140–311) and to be retained at the Golgi because its interaction with giantin would not be jeopardized. Giantin can also be cleaved by caspases, but the C-terminal fragment generated is still membrane-associated and contains the GCP60 binding region (7Lowe M. Lane J.D. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because the preferential interaction exhibited by the golgin-160-(140–311) fragment with GCP60 could take place during apoptosis, we investigated the effects of overexpressing GCP60 during cell death. When cells stably expressing GFP-GCP60 were treated with staurosporine, we observed an increase in apoptosis as compared with control cells. This surprising result implies that nuclear translocation of golgin-160-(140–311) may be involved in survival signaling. We did not detect a difference in the steady-state levels of golgin-160-(140–311) in GCP60-overexpressing cells compared with control cells (data not shown), suggesting that the localization rather than the stability of this fragment is important in regulating apoptosis. Modulation of GCP60 expression will thus be a useful tool to further study the role of this golgin-160 cleavage fragment in transducing apoptotic signals.

Glutamate transporters remove glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, from the synaptic cleft and thereby enable the post-synaptic receptors to sense glutamate released from the pre-synaptic nerve terminals. One of the major observations highlighting the importance of these transporters comes from the study of glutamate transporter knockout mice. This study (1Tanaka K. Watase K. Manabe T. Yamada K.

In addition, the uncoupled anion flux can be altered by substituting some of the amino acid residues of transmembrane (TM) 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; WT, wild type; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid.2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; WT, wild type; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid. domain 2, without significantly affecting the properties of coupled glutamate translocation (20Ryan R.M.

Despite these insights, little is known about the mechanism of glutamate-induced anion permeation, but it has been suggested that glutamate itself may gate the anion permeation (15Wadiche J.I.

Glutamate transporters have a non-conventional topology containing two re-entrant loops and two transmembrane domains (7 and 8) in their carboxyl-terminal half (21Grunewald M. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I.

Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) beautifully confirms and refines both the topology and the proximity of the re-entrant loops. Moreover, the equivalent amino acid residues from the eukaryotic glutamate transporters, which are involved in potassium binding (12Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J.

Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Therefore, the GltPh structure appears to be a good model for the study of its eukaryotic counterparts. The two helical halves of TM7 are separated by an unwound part consisting of a highly conserved 5-amino acid stretch termed the NMDGT motif (Fig. 1B). It has been shown previously by several studies that each residue of this motif is extremely important for the function of the transporter (16Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Zarbiv R. Grunewald M. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14231-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the archaeal homologue, the amino acid residues of this motif are found to form part of the substrate binding pocket (25Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The side chains of the methionine and the threonine point toward it; but surprisingly, the side chains of the asparagine and aspartate of this motif are pointing away from the binding pocket. These two residues are seen to interact with each other and with additional residues of TM domains 3, 6, and 8. These interactions were suggested to be important for shaping and stabilizing the binding pocket structure (25Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). In this study, we test the hypothesis that interaction of the corresponding asparagine and aspartate residues is important for the function of EAAC1. Our results suggest that besides shaping the substrate binding pocket, asparagine 366 and aspartate 368 of EAAC1 have additional functions in the transport process and are crucial for the execution of the potassium-translocation limb of the transport cycle. Generation and Subcloning of Mutants—The rabbit glutamate transporter EAAC1 (4Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar) with 10 histidines added immediately after the open reading frame followed by the stop codon (30Borre L.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes PinAI and PflMI were used to subclone the mutations into the construct containing the His-tagged WT EAAC1 residing in pOG1. The latter is an oocyte expression vector containing a 5′-untranslated Xenopus β-globin sequence and a 3′-poly(A) signal. This EAAC1 construct is termed WT in this study. The subcloned DNA fragments were sequenced on both strands between the two restriction sites noted above. In the case of the N396D/D398N-GLT-1 double mutant, the enzymes BsrGI and PshAI were used for subcloning. With the exception of Fig. 5, all figures document results with the mutant in the EAAC-1 background. In Fig. 5, the activity of the N396D/D398N-GLT-1 double mutant was compared with that of wild type GLT-1. Expression in Oocytes— cRNA was transcribed using mMESSAGE-mMACHINE (Ambion), injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and maintained as described previously (16Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Surface Biotinylation—This was done as described previously (33Bennett E.R. Su H. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34106-34113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), except that 4–5 oocytes, expressing wild type or mutant EAAC1, were treated with 1.5 mg/ml of sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) in 2 ml of ND96 and the streptavidin beads were eluted with a final volume of 70 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For samples of total cell transporter, 10% of the lysate was not treated with the streptavidin beads and these samples were run on the same gel alongside those eluted from the beads. The Western blots were probed with an affinity purified antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 491–523 of rabbit EAAT3 (generously provided by N. C. Danbolt, University of Oslo; anti-C491 (Ab,371 (34Holmseth S. Dehnes Y. Bjornsen L.P. Boulland J.L. Furness D.N. Bergles D. Danbolt N.C. Neuroscience. 2005; 136: 649-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). Oocyte Electrophysiology and Uptake—Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber, penetrated with two agarose-cushioned micropipettes (1%/2 m KCl, resistance varied between 0.5 and 3 mΩ), voltage clamped using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments), and digitized using Digidata 1322 (Axon instruments) both controlled by the pClamp9.0 suite (Axon Instruments). Voltage jumping was preformed using a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (30Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The standard buffer, termed ND96, was composed of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5). In sodium substitution experiments NaCl was replaced by an equimolar concentration of either LiCl or choline Cl. In sodium titration experiments the buffer was composed of 130 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.5, and NaCl was replaced by equimolar concentrations of choline Cl. Offset voltages in chloride substitution experiments were avoided by the use of an agarose bridge (2%/2 m KCl) that connected the recording chamber to the Ag/AgCl ground electrode. For the determination of anion selectivity (Fig. 10), 10 mm NaCl of the perfusion solution was replaced isoosmotically by the sodium salt of the tested anions. Voltage jumps in the presence of each of the tested anions (in the presence and absence of l-aspartate) was followed by a ∼20-min washout with ND96 solution and the induced currents in chloride medium were measured again to ensure that the test anion was removed from the oocyte before testing the next anion. For uptake, four to five oocytes of each mutant were incubated for 20 min in ND96 containing d-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid as described previously (16Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—All current-voltage relations represent steady-state net currents ((Ibuffer+AA) – (Ibuffer)) elicited by amino acids (AA) and were analyzed by Clampfit version 8.2 or 9.0 (Axon instruments). Even though there was a large variation in the absolute values of the substrate-induced currents between oocytes of different batches and sometimes even within a given batch, the voltage dependence of these currents as well as their kinetic parameters were always very similar when different oocytes were compared. Therefore the data are presented as normalized currents, usually to those at –100 mV, as indicated in the figure legends. Moreover the range of the values of the absolute currents is also stated in the figure legends. Kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear fitting to the generalized Hill equation using the build-in functions of Origin 6.1 (Microcal). For the determination of the apparent affinity for sodium, Imax, K0.5, and nH were allowed to vary, and for the determination of the apparent affinity for acidic amino acids, the value of nH was fixed to 1. The time constants were estimated using the decay of the charge movements induced by amino acids during the “on” phase using non-linear fitting to the first order decay exponential function of Clampfit 8.2 (Axon instruments). Cell Growth and Expression—HeLa cells were cultured (35Keynan S. Suh Y.J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), infected with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7–3 (36Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Exchange data are presented as net exchange, after subtracting the values obtained on proteoliposomes not containing 10 mml-aspartate but only 0.12 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Protein was determined by Lowry's method (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate Interactions in N366Q and D368E Mutants—In contrast to oocytes expressing wild type (WT) EAAC1, where a saturating concentration of each of the three substrates, l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and l-glutamate (2 mm), induced currents of similar size (Fig. 2A), this was not the case in substitution mutants N366Q and D368E, where currents induced by 10 mm d-aspartate or l-glutamate were much smaller than those induced by the same concentration of l-aspartate (Fig. 2, B and C). In the N366Q mutant the Imax value for d-aspartate was only 39 ± 1% of that for l-aspartate. In the case of l-glutamate, even at 20 mm saturation was not yet reached (data not shown). In WT EAAC1, the Km values for the three substrates (at –100 mV) were around 10 μm (Table 1). In N366Q, the Km values for l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and l-glutamate were higher than WT EAAC1 by around 100-, 350-, and 1000-fold, respectively (Table 1). In the case of the D368E mutant the increase of the Km for l-aspartate was not as dramatic as in N366Q, around 20-fold. On the other hand l-glutamate-induced currents were too small for quantitative analysis and even at 10 mm the induced inward currents at –100 mV were smaller than 30 nA. In the case of d-aspartate, the Km values of the two mutants were similar, around 2.5 mm (Table 1).TABLE 1The apparent affinity for acidic amino acid of the EAAC1 mutantsl-Aspl-Glud-AspWT0.015 ± 0.0020.013 ± 0.0010.008 ± 0.007N366Q1.66 ± 0.3412.6 ± 0.762.90 ± 0.17D368E0.32 ± 0.05—aValues of l-glutamate-induced currents in D368E were too low for apparent affinity determination.2.40 ± 0.28ND/DN0.073 ± 0.020.25 ± 0.080.067 ± 0.032WT, low Na+0.053 ± 0.0140.065 ± 0.0130.039 ± 0.007a Values of l-glutamate-induced currents in D368E were too low for apparent affinity determination. Open table in a new tab No uptake of d-[2,3-3H]aspartate by the N366Q and D368E mutants could be detected (Fig. 3) and the same was true for the uptake of l-[2,3-3H]aspartate (data not shown), apparently because of the dramatic increase of the Km values of the mutants for the acidic amino acids (Table 1). Surface biotinylation using an anti-EAAC1 antibody showed that the lower functional expression of N366Q and D368E was not due to lower expression of these transporters on the plasma membrane than the WT (Fig. 4). In the samples of the total protein of wild type and mutants, bands of around 55–60 and 65–70 kDa were observed, which apparently represent non-mature and mature monomeric forms of the transporter, respectively. Moreover bands of lower mobility, apparently representing aggregated transporters, were observed (Fig. 4), although in other experiments the monomeric form was more abundant (data not shown). In the biotinylated samples, representing those transporters located at the plasma membrane, the mature form was predominant among the monomeric transporters, except for the case of N366Q (Fig. 4). In other experiments the pattern of N366Q was not different from that of the other mutants (data not shown). The specificity of the bands is illustrated by the fact that the transporter bands were not observed in total and biotinylated samples of non-injected oocytes (uninj., Fig. 4). In the depicted experiment, the mutant transporters were present on the plasma membrane at similar or higher levels than those of WT (Fig. 4). Even though there was variation between experiments, the expression of the mutants was usually at least that of WT (data not shown). The proportion of monomeric to aggregated transporter also changed between experiments, such that sometimes the low-mobility bands were predominant (data not shown). It was difficult to control this variability, which is apparently related to the well known property of glutamate transporters to aggregate (38Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Kanner B.I. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whatever the aggregation state of the transporter, these bands were never seen with uninjected oocytes, just as shown in Fig. 4.FIGURE 4Cell surface biotinylation of the wild type and mutants. Oocytes expressing EAAC1-WT and the indicated mutants, were labeled and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The six left lanes show the total samples, and the six right lanes show the biotinylated samples. The first lane of each group shows a sample from uninjected oocytes (Uninj.). The empty lane between the two groups contained the marker proteins and their positions (in kDa) are indicated on the left. All samples were separated on the same SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown is a representative of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the N366D, D368N, N366A, and D368A mutants, none of the three substrates (tested at concentrations up to 10 mm) induced any measurable currents (data not shown) and no uptake of d-[2,3-3H]aspartate was observed (Fig. 3). Again, as found by surface biotinylation, the lack of functional expression of these four mutants is not due to lower expression of these transporters on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 and data not shown). As will be shown below, the N366Q had a lowered apparent affinity for sodium. However, lowering the external sodium concentration from 100 to 20 mm had only a relatively modest effect on the Km values for the three substrates in WT EAAC1 as compared with the impact of the mutations (Table 1). Thus it appears that the dramatic increase in Km for the three substrates in N366Q is not just a consequence of its reduced apparent affinity for sodium. Radioactive Uptake by N366/D368 Double Mutants—In contrast to the single mutants at positions 366 and 368, oocytes expressing the N366D/D368N double mutant exhibited significant, albeit slow, uptake of d-[3H]aspartate (Fig. 3). As also shown in Fig. 3, such uptake was neither observed when the neutral alanine was introduced at both positions (N366A/D368A) nor in the N366Q/D366E and N366E/D366Q double mutants. Also in the case of the double mutants, we found that their expression level at the plasma membrane was similar to that of WT (data not shown). The observation of radioactive substrate uptake in the N366D/D368N mutant, which does not exhibit steady-state transport currents (see Figs. 6 and 7) is reminiscent of the E404D mutant of the glutamate transporter GLT-1, which has an impaired imteraction with potassium and is therefore locked in the exchange mode (12Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because oocytes have high (around 12 mm) intracellular levels of acidic amino acids (13Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), oocytes expressing the E404D mutant are able to take up radioactive acidic amino acids (in exchange for their endogenous unlabeled counterparts) to almost the same levels as those expressing WT (12Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). One way to test if the N366D/D368N mutant is locked in the exchange mode is to use reconstituted systems using the transporters expressed in cell lines, such as HeLa cells. Because we anticipated low exchange levels in the double mutant, we used the equivalent N396D/D398N double mutant in the background of the glutamate transporter GLT-1, which is much more robustly expressed in the heterologous HeLa cell expression system than EAAC1. Under net flux conditions, created by dilution of potassium containing liposomes, inlaid with wild type GLT-1, into a sodium-containing transport medium in the presence of the potassium-specific ionophore valinomycin (2.5 μm), d-[2,3-3H]aspartate uptake was observed (Fig. 5, net flux). Such uptake was not seen when the liposomes were inlaid with similarly solubilized proteins from HeLa cells transfected with the vector alone (SK), whereas with N396D/D398N double mutant liposomes (ND/DN) net flux amounted for no more than 2% of that of WT (Fig. 5). On the other hand, much higher d-[3H]aspartate uptake was seen in sodium and l-aspartate (10 mm) containing N396D/D398N liposomes (increment over similar liposomes containing sodium without l-aspartate), even though exchange by wild type GLT-I liposomes was more robust (Fig. 5, exchange). In the control liposomes (from cells transfected with the vector alone), very little exchange was observed (Fig. 5). As observed previously in GLT-1 liposomes (12Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), uptake was also seen in N396D/D398N liposomes containing l-glutamate, but not in those containing γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is not a substrate of the glutamate transporters (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained when uptake of l-[2,3-3H]aspartate was tested (Fig. 5, exchange).FIGURE 7Cation dependence of l-aspartate-induced transient currents by the N366D/D368N mutant. Currents induced by l-aspartate (300 μm) were recorded using the same voltage protocol described in the legend to Fig. 6 in ND96 (A, Na+). No response was observed upon l-aspartate application when sodium was substituted by an equimolar concentration of either lithium (B, Li+) or choline (data not shown, n = 5). The dashed lines indicate 0 current. The data shown in A and B are from the same oocyte and are representative of five oocytes.View Large"

Regulation of transcription requires coupling of gene-specific transcription activators to regulatory signals. The galactose switch, which induces the synthesis of galactose metabolic enzymes in response to this sugar in the environment, serves as a textbook model of how such coupling can be achieved in a eukaryotic cell (for reviews see Refs. 1Johnston M.

Gal80 inhibition is relieved by a mechanism that requires direct interaction with Gal3 (15Zenke F.T. Engels R. Vollenbroich V. Meyer J. Hollenberg C.P. Breunig K.D.

Woods M.P. Lebo C.M. Xin P. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2566-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which is a sensor of intracellular galactose. Gal3 is a galactokinase-related protein that has lost enzymatic activity but retained the ability to bind the galactokinase substrates galactose and ATP, both of which are required to increase the affinity of Gal3 for Gal80 (15Zenke F.T. Engels R. Vollenbroich V. Meyer J. Hollenberg C.P. Breunig K.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Platt A. Ross H.C. Hankin S. Reece R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3154-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the absence of a functional Gal3 protein, the GAL1 gene product, galactokinase (Gal1), can partially substitute for Gal3 in relieving Gal80 inhibition (20Broach J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Bhat P.J. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2701-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Apparently, Gal3 and Gal1, which are 78% identical, are the products of divergent evolution after gene duplication (22Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) and in recent S. cerevisiae are dedicated to regulatory and enzymatic functions, respectively. In the lactose-fermenting yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, which has not undergone genome duplication like S. cerevisiae, a Gal3 ortholog is lacking (22Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). Instead, KlGal1 is a bifunctional protein, which fulfills enzymatic as well as regulatory function in the K. lactis lactose/galactose (LAC/GAL) regulon (23Meyer J. Walker-Jonah A. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5454-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this yeast, intracellular galactose not only arises from uptake of this sugar from the medium but also from cytosolic hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose, a major carbon source in the natural habitat of K. lactis. Together with the galactose metabolic genes, the genes LAC12 and LAC4, encoding lactose permease and β-galactosidase, respectively, are subject to transcriptional regulation by KlGal4 (Lac9), a member of the fungal specific Gal4 family of zinc cluster transactivators (24Lacy L.R. Dickson R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Das S. Breunig K.D. Hollenberg C.P.

Kuger P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). KlGal4 can substitute for ScGal4 in inducing the GAL regulon and vice versa despite the fact that, apart from the DNA binding domain and the C-terminal Gal80 binding domain, overall similarity between both proteins is low (26Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7767-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Salmeron J.M. Langdon S.D. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell.

Although KlGAL1 can substitute for GAL3 in S. cerevisiae (23Meyer J. Walker-Jonah A. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5454-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), neither Gal3 nor ScGal1 can complement the noninducible phenotype of a K. lactis gal1 deletion mutant unless the KlGAL80 gene is exchanged by ScGAL80 (15Zenke F.T. Engels R. Vollenbroich V. Meyer J. Hollenberg C.P. Breunig K.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Only one out of the three characterized dominant alleles of ScGAL80 that confer a super-repressed phenotype (GAL80s) on ScGal4 (30Nogi Y. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has a similar effect in K. lactis upon substitution of equivalent amino acids in KlGAL80 (31Zenke F.T. Kapp L. Breunig K.D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These data indicate differences between both yeasts either in the Gal1/Gal3-Gal80 interface and/or in the mechanism that relieves Gal80 inhibition. It has been suggested that in S. cerevisiae compartmentation of regulators contributes to Gal4 activation (6Peng G. Hopper J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8548-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ScGal80p is detectable throughout the cell indicating that it shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (32Peng G. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5140-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When tethered in the cytoplasm either via a membrane-anchored Gal3 variant or by surrogate protein interaction of fusion proteins its inhibitory function is relieved (6Peng G. Hopper J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8548-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, ScGal80 can be detected at Gal4 target promotors in both uninduced and induced cells, although the level is apparently decreased in induced cells (6Peng G. Hopper J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8548-8553Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Bhaumik S.R. Raha T. Aiello D.P. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A crucial question is whether Gal4 and Gal3/Gal1 binding to Gal80 is mutually exclusive. A heterotrimeric ScGal4-ScGal80-Gal3 complex can form in vitro under conditions of high excess of Gal3 (34Platt A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), but it remains to be shown that this complex is able to activate transcription. Apparently, Gal3 destabilizes the Gal4-Gal80 complex in vitro (35Sil A.K. Alam S. Xin P. Ma L. Morgan M. Lebo C.M. Woods M.P. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7828-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Attempts to map subdomains of Gal80 sufficient for binding to either one of its interaction partners have been unsuccessful so far. Both Gal80 orthologs are remarkably sensitive to mutations, and many single amino acid exchanges in ScGal80 simultaneously eliminate binding to Gal4, Gal3, and homodimerization (36Pilauri V. Bewley M. Diep C. Hopper J. Genetics. 2005; 169: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Melcher K. Genetics. 2005; 171: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 5K. Wiedemuth and K. D. Breunig, unpublished data. 5K. Wiedemuth and K. D. Breunig, unpublished data. These mutations do not cluster in particular regions and apparently affect the overall structural integrity of Gal80 rather than specific functions. However, close proximity of Gal3/Gal1 and Gal4 binding interfaces on Gal80 is suggested by the few amino acid substitutions that selectively influence Gal4 or Gal3/Gal1 binding activity, like G302R (KlGal1 binding deficiency) and G311E (Gal4 binding deficiency) (31Zenke F.T. Kapp L. Breunig K.D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that KlGal1 and Gal4-AD binding to KlGal80 is incompatible, and we propose that the galactose switch is based on competition between its two interaction partners in the nucleus. Mathematical modeling supports a mechanism, in which two KlGal1 monomers compete against the cooperative binding of the KlGal80 dimer to the Gal4 dimer. The formation of a heterotetrameric KlGal802-KlGal12 complex and the nuclear interaction of the partners is confirmed experimentally. With the qualitative and quantitative data presented, a full mechanistic understanding of an important model transcriptional switch is within reach. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The K. lactis strains JA6/D801 (gal80-Δ1::ScURA3), JA6/D1R (gal1::Scura3), JA6/D1D802R (gal80-Δ2::Scura3 gal1::Scura3), and JA6/80HisR (KlGAL80-IHIS) are isogenic to JA6 (α trp1-11 ura3-12 ade1-600 adeT-600) (27Breunig K.D. Kuger P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) except for the indicated alleles. In JA6/80HisR, the wild type KlGAL80 gene was replaced by the KlGAL80 allele coding for the internally His6-tagged KlGal80 protein IHGal80 (the gene sequence is identical to that on plasmid pETIHG80). Yeasts were grown in synthetic minimal medium (SM: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) mixed with amino acid/base supplement according to Sherman et al. (38Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 3-21Google Scholar). The carbon sources glucose, galactose, and glycerol were added to a final concentration of 2, 2, and 3%, respectively. For selection of transformants, the corresponding amino acid or base was omitted. Plasmids—Plasmid pETIHG80 was constructed by cloning the KlGAL80-IHIS sequence from pEAG80His (15Zenke F.T. Engels R. Vollenbroich V. Meyer J. Hollenberg C.P. Breunig K.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which codes for the internally His6-tagged KlGal80 variant IHGal80, into vector pET21c (Novagen). In IHGal80 the amino acid Val349 of KlGal80 protein is replaced by sequence LRSHHHHHHG. Plasmid pETNHG80 is based on vector pET15b (Novagen) and codes for an N-terminal His6-tagged KlGal80 variant (NHGal80), in which the first methionine is replaced by sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLEDRS (recognition site for thrombin is underlined). Plasmids pETNHG80-S2 and pETNHG80-31 are derivatives of pETNHG80 and code for the N-terminal His6-tagged KlGal80 mutant variants NHGal80-S2 (amino acid exchange E367K; position is given for KlGal80 wild type protein without His6 tag) and NHGal80-31 (G311E), respectively. Plasmid pETNHG1 codes for an N-terminal His6-tagged KlGal1 protein variant (NHGal1) and was constructed by cloning the KlGAL1 sequence into pET15b. In NHGal1 the sequence of the KlGal1 wild type protein is preceded by amino acid sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH. Plasmid pGstGal1 codes for a glutathione S-transferase-KlGal1 fusion protein (31Zenke F.T. Kapp L. Breunig K.D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The centromeric plasmid pCGFPAG1 contains a GFP-KlGAL1 fusion gene under control of the ScADH1 promotor and the KlCEN2-ARS1-KARS12-ScTRP1-ScURA3 cassette from pKATUC4 (39Schulz W.A. Ebling B. Hasse A. Zenke F. Breunig K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCGFPAG1-ura3Δ is a Scura3 derivative of pCGFPAG1 and was obtained by introducing a frameshift mutation into the ScURA3 gene. Centromeric plasmids pCQRS80 and pCQRSS80 are derivatives of pKATUC4 containing a GFP-KlGAL80 and a GFP-ScGAL80 fusion gene under control of the ScADH1 promotor, respectively. Construction of multicopy plasmid pEAG80 containing the KlGAL80 gene under control of the ScADH1 promotor was described previously (31Zenke F.T. Kapp L. Breunig K.D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Further details of plasmid constructions and sequences are available on request. Synthetic Peptide—The AD-22 peptide consisting of the 22 C-terminal amino acids of KlGal4 (amino acid sequence: TQQLFNTTTMDDVYNYIFDNDE) was produced by solid phase synthesis using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy (F. Bordusa, Max Planck Research Unit for Enzymology of Protein Folding, Halle, Germany). Protein Expression and Purification—KlGal80 variants with either an N-terminal (NHGal80, NHGal80-S2, and NHGal80-31) or an internal (IHGal80) His6 tag were expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta(DE3)-pLys (Novagen) from plasmids pETNHG80, -S2, -31, and pETIHG80, respectively. The transformed cells were grown in LB-cam-amp medium (1% tryp-tone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 35 mg/liter chloramphenicol, 100 mg/liter ampicillin) to an A600 of 1-2. Protein expression was induced by diluting the cells 1:10 into induction medium (LB-cam-amp with 200 mm KH2PO4 and 1.5% lactose). Cells were grown for 12-15 h at 26 °C to an A600 of 4-8. After harvesting the cells, the pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 20 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0). Cell lysis was performed by sonication. The crude cell extract was mixed with 0.05% protamine sulfate for precipitation of nucleic acids and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded on to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen)-containing column. After washing the column with lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, the bound proteins were eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The protein solution was dialyzed overnight against buffer TCG (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% w/v glycerol, 20 mm sodium citrate) or the running buffer for ultracentrifugation experiments (see below). KlGal1p was expressed either as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GstGal1) in K. lactis (for enzyme activity measurements) or as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein (NHGal1) in E. coli (for enzyme activity and ultracentrifugation experiments). For expression of GstGal1 K. lactis gal1 gal80 deletion strain JA6/D1D802R (40Zachariae, W. (1994) Regulation des Hefetranskriptionsaktivators Lac9, Ph.D. thesis, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, GermanyGoogle Scholar) transformed with plasmid pGstGal1 was grown overnight in selective SM-glucose medium. A crude extract of the cells was prepared by glass bead lysis in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% w/v glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The extract was loaded on a column packed with glutathione-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and washed with buffer A. GstGal1 was eluted with buffer A containing 20 mm reduced glutathione and dialyzed overnight against buffer B (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20% w/v glycerol). Protein NHGal1 was expressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3)-pLys (Novagen) transformed with plasmid pETNHG1. Expression and purification procedures were essentially the same as described for the KlGal80 proteins with the exception that the washing buffer contained 20 mm imidazole. Subsequently a second purification step by gel filtration chromatography (running buffer: 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% w/v glycerol, 500 mm NaCl) was carried out. Fractions with highly purified NHGal1 were combined and dialyzed overnight against the buffer used in the ultracentrifugation experiments. MiniScGal4p (amino acids 1-100 + 840-881) was expressed from pRJR229 (11Wu Y. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-pLys (Novagen) and purified as described (41Reece R.J. Rickles R.J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Galactokinase and Inhibition Assay—Galactokinase activity (galactose + ATP→galactose-1-phosphate + ADP) was measured by means of a coupled enzymatic assay where the production of ADP was coupled to the reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and the consumption of NADH was monitored (42Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 10mm KCl, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 0.25 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm ATP, 6.6 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 13.5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. In the case of high salt conditions 100 mm potassium acetate was added. The reaction mixture was prewarmed to 30 °C and mixed with purified KlGal1 protein (GstGal1 or NHGal1) to a final concentration of 5-15 nm. After transferring the reaction mixture to the cuvettes, KlGal80 and Gal4 variants were added to the individual samples as indicated. Galactokinase reaction was started by the addition of 50 mm galactose. The Km,app values of KlGal1 for galactose and ATP are about 5 mm (data not shown) and 90 nm (43Engels, R. (1999) Die Rolle der Galactokinase beim Induktionsprozess der LAC/GAL Gene der Milchhefe Kluyveromyces lactis, Ph.D. thesis, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, GermanyGoogle Scholar), respectively, which means that in our experiments KlGal1 was saturated with both substrates. The reaction proceeded at 30 °C, and NADH consumption was monitored photometrically (Photometer Beckman DU 640) at a wavelength of 340 nm over a period of 3-5 min. The activities did not differ significantly between both purified KlGal1 variants (GstGal1 and NHGal1), and kcat values were always in the range of 60 -70 s-1. For galactokinase inhibition assays, five samples containing the same KlGal1 and varying KlGal80 and Gal4 concentrations were measured against a sample with KlGal1 giving relative galactokinase activities. Analytical Gel Filtration—Gel filtration experiments were carried out on the SMART System with column Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 (GE Healthcare). KlGal80 in buffer TCG was preincubated at room temperature for at least 30 min. 10-μl samples were applied to the column equilibrated in the running buffer as indicated. The runs were performed at 100 μl/min and 25 °C. The column was calibrated using a set of molecular mass standards (Sigma). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Proteins NHGal1 and IHGal80 were dialyzed overnight against buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl, 30 mm EDTA, 35 mm MgCl2, pH 8.2). The protein solutions (with the individual proteins or a mixture of both) were supplemented with 50 mm galactose and 1 mm ADP. Measurements were performed in an analytical ultracentrifuge Optima XL-A (Beckman Coulter). For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, double sector cells were used at 6000 rpm and 20 °C in an An50Ti rotor. The apparent molecular mass of the proteins was calculated using the software provided by Beckman Coulter. In the case of the isolated NHGal1 and IHGal80, both proteins could be shown to behave as a single homogeneous species, respectively. Thus, the apparent molecular mass reflects the mass and stable association state of the two proteins in solution. In another experiment 5 μm Gal80 was titrated with increasing concentrations of Gal1. Here the calculated apparent molecular mass is an average value describing a mixture of the Gal80-Gal1 complex and the nonassociated species. In the first part of this titration the apparent molecular mass increases with increasing Gal1 concentration up to an equimolar ratio of Gal80 and Gal1, which reflects the stoichiometry of the complex (44Behlke J. Ristau O. Schonfeld H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5149-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Further addition of Gal1 leads to a decrease of the apparent molecular mass because of the excess of the nonassociated Gal1. Preparation of K. lactis Cells for Fluorescence Microscopy—The cell suspension taken from a freshly grown culture was mixed with an equal volume of 4% formaldehyde in PBS 6The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; AD, activation domain; DAPI, 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated for 3 min. 10 μl of this suspension were spotted on a slide and adjusted by slightly pressing on with a coverslip. The slide was immersed in liquid nitrogen for 30 s and washed in PBS. The cells were coated with DAPI solution (3 μm DAPI in PBS), covered with a coverslip, and observed microscopically. Calculations of Intracellular Levels of KlGal1 and KlGal80—KlGal1 and KlGal80 concentrations were determined from galactose-induced cells of the strains JA6 and JA6/80HisR, respectively. Cells were pre-grown overnight in SM-galactose medium, diluted 1:15 into fresh medium, and grown for an additional 5 h prior to harvesting. KlGal80 was quantified after direct lysis of a defined amount of JA6/80HisR cells in SDS lysis buffer (as described in Ref. 45Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2952) Google Scholar) by Western analyses with antipenta-His antibody (Qiagen) using purified IHGal80 protein as a standard. KlGal1 protein was quantified by determination of galactokinase activity in cell extracts prepared by glass bead lysis with kcat = 70 s-1 as determined for the purified enzyme. For calculations of the intracellular and nuclear concentrations of these proteins, we determined the average volume of a K. lactis cell (23 fl) and assumed the volume of a K. lactis nucleus to be the same as that of S. cerevisiae (2 fl; see Ref. 46Winey M. Yarar D. Giddings Jr., T.H. Mastronarde D.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2119-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Mathematical Methods and Models—For quantitation of the KlGal1-KlGal80 interaction on the basis of the galactokinase inhibition experiments, the relative activities (aR) of KlGal1 in the presence of KlGal80 were fitted to the equation aR = KD,app/(KD,app + [Gal80]T), where [Gal80]T is the total concentration of KlGal80, and KD,app is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the KlGal1-KlGal80 complex on the basis of a simple bimolecular reaction scheme (Gal1 + Gal80 ↔ Gal1-Gal80). The equation was derived by assuming that the relative activity of KlGal1 equals the relative concentration of KlGal1 not bound to KlGal80 (aR = [Gal1]/[Gal1]T), and the concentration of free KlGal80 equals the total concentration of KlGal80 ([Gal80] = [Gal80]T), which approximately holds true for the analyzed experiments because KlGal80 was in excess over KlGal1. Nonlinear fitting was performed using the program Grace version 5.1.8. The equations of the mathematical steady state models used in this work are shown in Fig. 1. Model 0 describes the interactions between Gal1 (Fig. 1, G1) and Gal80 (G80) assuming a competition between Gal80 dimerization and Gal1-Gal80 binding. Models 1 and 2 describe the interactions between Gal1, Gal80, and Gal4 (Fig. 1, G4) on the basis of a competitive model. In model 1 only monomers are considered. In model 2 Gal4 and Gal80 both dimerize and exclusively interact as dimers (Fig. 1, G42 and G802) with each other, whereas monomeric Gal1 binds independently to the binding sites of a Gal80 dimer. The following equilibrium dissociation constants were used to quantify the interactions: K1 (Gal4-Gal80 interaction), K2 (Gal1-Gal80 interaction), K3 (Gal4 dimerization), and K4 (Gal80 dimerization). Simulations with the mathematical steady state models were performed using the program Octave version 2.1.36 by solving the equation system with the integrated fsolve function. In the galactokinase inhibition experiments, the relative activity of KlGal1 was taken as the fraction of Gal1 not bound to Gal80. Quantitative analyses of the experiments with KlGal80 and Gal4 (miniScGal4 and synthetic KlGal4 activation domain peptide) were carried out on the basis of model 1. To estimate the binding constants, we minimized the summed square of residuals (deviations between measured and simulated data) using the functions nmsmax and mdsmax of the Matrix Computation Toolbox (N. J. Higham, data available online). Simulations of the galactose switch of K. lactis were carried out with mathematical models 1 and 2. The proportion of active Gal4 was taken as the Gal4 fraction not bound to Gal80. Two states according to the noninduced and induced state were simulated. T"

The functional unit of TAP is a heterodimer composed of the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits, both of which are members of the ABC-transporter family. ABC-transporters are ATP-dependent pumps, channels, or receptors that are composed of four modules: two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two transmembrane domains (TMDs). Although the TMDs are rather divergent in sequence, the NBDs are conserved with respect to structure and function. Interestingly, the NBD of TAP1 contains mutations at amino acid positions that have been proposed to be essential for catalytic activity. Instead of a glutamate, proposed to act as a general base, TAP1 contains an aspartate and a glutamine instead of the conserved histidine, which has been suggested to act as the linchpin. We used this degeneration to evaluate the individual contribution of these two amino acids to the ATPase activity of the engineered TAP1-NBD mutants. Based on our results a catalytic hierarchy of these two fundamental amino acids in ATP hydrolysis of the mutated TAP1 motor domain was deduced.

Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 450-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the term we prefer to distinguish the transported substrate from ATP. Found in all three kingdoms of life, ABC-transporters contain certain sequence motifs such as the Walker A and B motifs, the C-loop (ABC signature motif), and the D-loop (3Schmitt L. Tampé R. Cur. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These sequences serve as diagnostic tools to identify ABC-transporters. Furthermore, all members of this family show a modular architecture composed of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which contain all the conserved sequence motifs, and two transmembrane domains (TMDs). In archea and eubacteria, these four modules are generally encoded on separate genes, whereas they are fused on a single polypeptide chain (“full-size” transporter) in eukarya. Additionally, fusions of one NBD and one TMD, which are called “half-size” transporters, are found in all organisms. The functional unit of these systems would be a homo- or heterodimer of two half-size transporters. Examples of the latter are hemolysin B (HlyB) from Escherichia coli (5Holland I.B. Schmitt L. Young J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and the human transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) (6Schmitt L. Tampe R. Chembiochem. 2000; 1: 16-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human TAP, located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is a key component of major histocompatibility complex class I-mediated adaptive immunity (7Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The functional TAP complex is a heterodimer composed of TAP1 and TAP2, both of which comprise a TMD-NBD fusion. It is now firmly established that the allocrites of TAP, antigenic peptides, which are generated in the cytosol by proteasomal degradation (8Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 9York I.A. Rock K.L. Annu. Rev.

After passing the ER quality control, peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I complexes travel to the cell surface and present their antigenic cargo to CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Although both NBDs are capable of binding and hydrolyzing ATP (11Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, one could envision a regulatory function of one NBD, whereas the other NBD of the TAP complex actually fuels peptide translocation. Such an asymmetric behavior of the NBDs with respect to ATP hydrolysis is reminiscent of CFTR (18Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. J. Biol.

Here, experimental data suggest that the N-terminal NBD serves as a regulatory domain, whereas the C-terminal NBD provides the energy necessary for allocrite translocation via ATP hydrolysis.

Acta. 2004; 1659: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have provided many valuable insights into the function of the ABC cassettes. In the ATP-bound state, NBDs form a composite dimer (28Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 29Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Here, ATP is sandwiched between the Walker A motif of one monomer and the C-loop of the other monomer. This in combination with biochemical data (see, e.g. Refs. 31Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5458-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Moody J.E. Millen L. Binns D. Hunt J.F.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has led to the identification of certain key amino acids important for ATP binding and hydrolysis. For instance, it was shown that a glutamate adjacent to the Walker B motif is important for ATP hydrolysis, because mutation to a glutamine abolished ATPase activity (32Moody J.E. Millen L. Binns D. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21111-21114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). It was therefore postulated that this glutamate acts as “general base” (34Orelle C. Dalmas O. Gros P. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47002-47008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Geourjon C. Orelle C. Steinfels E. Blanchet C. Deleage G. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Trends Biochem.

Results from full-length ABC-transporters and isolated NBDs supported this idea (see, e.g. Refs. 34Orelle C. Dalmas O. Gros P. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47002-47008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 36Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampe R. J. Biol.

However, more and more results have challenged the role of the conserved glutamate as a catalytic base (37Sauna Z.E. Muller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38537-38547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the case of the maltose and histidine permeases, mutation of a histidine located in the H-loop sequence abolished ATPase activity and/or allocrite translocation (31Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5458-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Shyamala V. Baichwal V. Beall E. Ames G.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26727-26735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For the NBD of HlyB, a mutation of the corresponding histidine to alanine (H662A) eliminated ATPase activity as well, whereas residual ATPase activity was detected in the glutamate to glutamine mutant (E631Q) (30Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These data, which were supported by the crystal structure of the HlyB-NBD H662A mutant with bound ATP/Mg2+, led to the proposal of a different model (30Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Here, the glutamate and the histidine form a catalytic dyad, with the glutamate stabilizing a productive conformation of the histidine, which stabilizes the transition state of ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, according to this “linchpin” model, ATP hydrolysis does not follow general base catalysis, but rather “substrate-assisted catalysis” as proposed for the p21ras oncogene (44Schweins T. Geyer M. Scheffzek K. Warshel A. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). So far, crystal structures of dimeric ABC cassettes with bound ATP were solved only for homodimeric NBDs (28Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 29Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, many ABC-transporters from higher organisms contain two different ABC cassettes. In the human TAP complex, the ATP-induced NBD-dimer is composed of the motor domains of TAP1 and TAP2. Sequence comparison of these NBDs and the two NBDs of human CFTR and human MRP1 (Fig. 1) reveal important amino acid replacements for catalytically relevant residues. First, TAP2 and the C-terminal NBDs of CFTR and MRP1 do not contain the essential second glycine of the C-loop, which, according to the crystal structures of ATP-bound, dimeric ABC cassettes, interacts with the γ-phosphate moiety of the bound ATP. Second, the glutamate, the proposed catalytic carboxylate, adjacent to the Walker B motif, is replaced by an aspartate in TAP1 and by a serine in the N-terminal NBD of CFTR. Third, the essential histidine of the H-loop, proposed to act as the linchpin, is not present in TAP1 and the N-terminal NBD of CFTR. In light of the ATP-bound dimer of NBDs, this arrangement would generate one ATP-binding site with drastically reduced or even no ATPase activity (Walker A motif of monomer 1 and C-loop of monomer 2 but no glutamate and no histidine) and one site capable of hydrolyzing ATP (Walker A motif, glutamate, and the histidine of the H-loop of monomer 2 and the C-loop of monomer 1). Such degeneration would explain the asymmetric behavior of these (11Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More important, however, is the fact that the deviation of the primary structure in the TAP1-NBD with respect to the glutamate and histidine provides a perfectly suited model system to analyze the function of these two essential amino acids during the catalytic cycle of an NBD on a molecular level and their contribution to ATPase activity. Here, we report mutational studies of the isolated ABC cassette of human TAP1. The aspartate at position 668 was mutated to glutamate (D668E), and at position 701 the conserved histidine was introduced (Q701H). Additionally, the double mutant was generated (D668E/Q701H). The double mutant, representing the canonical sequence of ABC cassettes, displayed basal ATPase activity. More important, however, is the fact that the single mutants (D668E and Q701H) behaved differently. Although the D668E mutant like the wild-type enzyme did not show ATPase activity, reintroduction of the histidine in the absence of the glutamate (Q701H) resulted in an ATPase-active enzyme, although at a reduced level compared with the double mutant (D668E/Q701H). Thus, the results indicate different functional roles of these two conserved amino acids during the catalytic cycle and clearly support the importance of the H-loop histidine for ATPase activity suggesting that a catalytic dyad composed of the glutamate and the histidine is created in the isolated ABC cassette of TAP1. Heterologous Expression of TAP1-NBD and Mutants in E. coli—The C-terminal domain (amino acids 489-748) of TAP1 was amplified by PCR on cDNA coding for TAP1 using the primers: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGGCAGCAGCCATCACCATCACCATCACCCACCCAGTGGTCTGTTGACTCCC-3′ and 5′-ATATATAAAGCTTATCATTCTGGAGCATCTGCAGGAGCCTG-3′. The 5′-extensions encoded NdeI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, and an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The resulting PCR product was cloned into the NdeI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pET21a+ (Novagen). Amino acid substitutions (in single and double) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis one amino acid downstream of the Walker B motif (D668E, GAT → GAA) and at the position of the conserved histidine (Q710H, CAA → CAC). Thus, four plasmids pET-NBD(wt), pET-NBD(D668E), pET-NBD(Q710H), and pET-NBD(D668E/Q710H), were generated. For expression, the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with the plasmids and grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. At an A600 of 0.5 the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and harvested after 3 h by centrifugation (4000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Purification of TAP1-NBD—All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellet of a 2-liter culture was resuspended in 30 ml of pre-chilled buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 15% w/v glycerol, pH 8) supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1 mg/ml deoxyribonuclease I from bovine pancreas (Fluka). After 15-min incubation, cells were broken by cell rupture treatment (2.7 kbar, Basic Z Model, Constant Systems). Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant corresponding to the cytosolic fraction was loaded onto a Zn2+/iminodiacetic acid column (5-ml volume, GE Healthcare, Freiberg, Germany) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Nonspecifically bound proteins were eluted employing a step gradient of 6 column volumes of buffer A and 6 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 25 mm imidazole. All TAP1-NBD variants were eluted with 90 mm imidazole in buffer A. The TAP1-NBD containing fractions were immediately adjusted to 20 mm dithiothreitol, pooled, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultraspin concentrators, 10 kDa, Millipore). The soluble TAP1-NBD was further purified and separated from aggregates on a Superdex 200 HR 26/60 column (320-ml bed volume, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 15% w/v glycerol, pH 8). The NBD eluted with an apparent molecular weight of 29 kDa corresponding to the size of the monomer. Fractions were stored on ice at a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml. Wild-type and mutant proteins were purified to >99% homogeneity by this two-step procedure as assessed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (15%). ATPase Activity Assay—ATPase activity was analyzed as described previously (46Zaitseva J. Zhang H. Binnie R.A. Hermodson M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the activity assay of TAP1-NBD (1 mg/ml) was performed in buffer B at 30 °C. Time- and pH-dependent ATPase activity was assayed in the presence of 2 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2. The reaction was stopped with 40 mn H2SO4, and the amount of liberated Pi was determined by a colorimetric assay, using Na2HPO4 as standard. TNP-AXP Binding Studies—To assess the binding affinity of ATP and ADP to the TAP1-NBD and their mutant versions, we used the fluorescent nucleotide analogues TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP (Molecular Probes). Binding studies were generally performed as described previously (47Horn C. Bremer E. Schmitt L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of TNP nucleotides was monitored at 540 nm using a Fluorolog (Horiba, Edison, NJ). The excitation wavelength was set at 409 nm, the slit width at 4 nm, and the temperature was maintained at 20 ± 1 °C. All experiments were performed in buffer B supplemented with the appropriate MgCl2 concentration in a total volume of 1400 μl. Upon binding of TNP-AXP (X = M, D, or T) to the TAP1-NBD, the fluorescence intensity of TNP-AXP enhances several-fold. The absolute magnitude depends on the specific protein environment within the nucleotide-binding pocket and was introduced as a fitting parameter (see below). The fluorescence intensity of TNP-AXP in buffer is low in the absence of TAP1-NBD and can be described by Equation 1, taking inner filter effects into account (48Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6771-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 49Faller L.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fluorescence constants Q1 and Q2 in buffer B (with and without 5 mm MgCl2) were determined in the absence of protein by stepwise addition of TNP-AXP from a 1 mm stock solution to assay buffer. The maximal change of volume was kept below 4% (v/v), and the fluorescence intensity was corrected for dilution and background fluorescence in the absence of any TNP-AXP. All data represent the average value of at least two independent measurements.Fbuffer=Q1L0+Q2L02 Here, Q1 and Q2 denote the specific fluorescence constants of TNP-AXP, and L0 is the concentration of TNP-AXP. The TAP1-NBD and their mutants were diluted into buffer B supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 and titrated with TNP-AXP as described above at a concentration of 150 μg/ml. The dissociation constant (KD) of the TAP1-NBD/TNP-AXP complexes was determined according to Equation 2,F=Q1L0+Q2L12+Fmax(A-A2-4L0NP0)A=KD+L0+NP0 where Q1 and Q2 denote specific fluorescence constants, which were determined independently (see above), and Fmax is the maximal fluorescence due to TNP-AXP binding to the TAP1-NBD. L0 and P0 are the total concentration of TNP-AXP and TAP1-NBD, respectively. KDL is the dissociation constant of the TAP1-NBD/TNP-AXP complex. F defines the measured fluorescence. Competitive Binding Studies of TAP1-NBD/TNP-ADP Complexes—The TAP1-NBD (150 μg/ml) was preincubated with 10 μm TNP-ADP for 2 min at 20 (±1) °C. At this concentration, ATP-induced dimerization is negligible (see below). Subsequently, AXP(X = T, D, or M) was added in a stepwise fashion from a 2 μm, 20 μm, 200 μm, 2 mm, 20 mm, 200 mm, and 500 mm stock solution at pH 8 to a final ATP concentration of maximal 20 mm. The maximal dilution was <4% (v/v). The fluorescence data were corrected for background fluorescence, normalized, and analyzed according to Equation 4 (47Horn C. Bremer E. Schmitt L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar),FPLN,AXPFPLN=A+AXP0KDLKDAXP-A+AXPKDLKDAXP2-4NP0L0A-A2-4NP0L0 where FpL,axp/FPL defines the normalized fluorescence at different AXP concentrations (AXP, X = T, D, or M). KDL is the dissociation constant of the TAP1-NBD/TNP-ADP complex in the presence or absence of 5 mm MgCl2 and was determined independently (see above). L0 and P0 are the total concentrations of TNP-ADP and TAP1-NBD, respectively. KD,axpisthe dissociation constant of TAP1-NBD/AXP complexes, and A has been defined in Equation 3. KD values of TAP1-NBD/AXP complexes are the average value of at least two independent titration experiments. Molecular Modeling—The molecular model of the TAP1-NBD/TAP2-NBD heterodimer with bound ATP/Mg2+ was generated based on the crystal structure of the HlyB-NBD H662A dimer in complex with ATP/Mg2+ (pdb entry 1XEF). After sequence alignment using the ClustalW web interface (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) employing the sequences shown in Fig. 1, the SWISS model web server (swissmodel.expasy.org/) was used following the outlines of the authors without manual interference. Sequence alignments of the ABC cassettes of human TAP1 and TAP2 with both NBDs of human CFTR and human MRP1, respectively, and bacterial NBDs, for which crystal structures of the dimeric, ATP-bound state were reported (28Chen J.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), are shown in Fig. 1. The alignment revealed a somewhat regular pattern of important deviations from the classic primary structure in the human motor domains. In human TAP1 and in the N-terminal motor domains of CFTR and MRP1, the conserved glutamate, the putative catalytic base, is replaced by an aspartate (Asp-668 in TAP1, Asp-573 in CFTR, and Asp-793 in MRP1). In addition, the histidine of the H-loop, the putative linchpin, is replaced by a glutamine in TAP1 (Gln-701) and a serine in CFTR (Ser-604), whereas a histidine is present in MRP1 (His-827). This situation is reminiscent of the recently described bacterial multidrug tranporter LmrCD from Lactococcus lactis. LmrC shows the above indicated deviations from the canonical sequences and in terms of primary structure would correspond to TAP1, whereas LmrD would correspond to TAP2 (50Lubelski J. van Merkerk R. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-loop of TAP2 and the C-terminal ABC cassettes of CFTR and MRP1 do not contain the consensus sequence (LSGGQ). Here, LAAGQ replaces the LSGGQ sequence in TAP2, LSHGQ in CFTR, and LSVGQ in MRP1. Thus, the absence of the two catalytically important residues (Glu and His) together with the deviation of the canonical C-loop sequence of TAP2 will impose certain restrains on the architecture of both ATP-binding sites, and it was indeed shown that the asymmetric C-loop sequences of TAP have a strong impact on peptide transport efficiencies in vitro (16Chen M. Abele R. Tampe R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46073-46081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Currently, three crystal structures of dimeric motor domains with bound ATP have been solved (28Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full"

The molecular determinants that are required for each of these functions are yet poorly understood. Based on the NMR structure of the closely related poliovirus 3A protein, a molecular model of the coxsackievirus B3 3A protein was constructed. Using this structural model, specific mutants were designed to study the structure-function relationship of 3A. The mutants were tested for their capacity to dimerize, support vRNA replication, and block protein transport. A hydrophobic interaction between the monomers and an intermolecular salt bridge were identified as major determinants required for dimerization. We show that dimerization is important for both efficient vRNA replication and inhibition of protein transport. In addition, determinants were identified that were not required for dimerization but that were essential for either one of the biological functions of 3A.

Enteroviruses are small RNA viruses that belong to the family of the Picornaviridae. The enteroviruses are divided into several species, e.g. poliovirus (PV), 2The abbreviations used are: PV, poliovirus; CVB3, coxsackievirus B3; vRNA, viral RNA; HEV, human enterovirus; aa, amino acid(s); wt, wild type; BGM, buffalo green monkey; MEM, minimal essential medium; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; CND, conserved N-terminal domain; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.2The abbreviations used are: PV, poliovirus; CVB3, coxsackievirus B3; vRNA, viral RNA; HEV, human enterovirus; aa, amino acid(s); wt, wild type; BGM, buffalo green monkey; MEM, minimal essential medium; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; CND, conserved N-terminal domain; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. human enterovirus A (HEV-A), human enterovirus B (HEV-B, which includes coxsackieviruses B (CVB)), human enterovirus C (HEV-C), and human enterovirus D (HEV-D). The enterovirus genome encodes a large polyprotein that is divided into P1, P2, and P3 regions and is processed by virally encoded proteases to yield the capsid proteins and the nonstructural proteins, as well as some relatively stable precursor proteins (1Porter A.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6917-6921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wimmer E. Hellen C.U. Cao X. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 353-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The nonstructural proteins are involved in viral RNA (vRNA) replication and account for the virus-induced alterations in host cell metabolism and structure. These alterations serve to create an environment that is suitable for efficient vRNA replication and/or to suppress anti-viral host cell responses.Enteroviruses are nonenveloped, cytolytic viruses that replicate on secretory pathway-derived membrane vesicles. These viruses do not need an intact secretory pathway to release their virus progeny. Instead, the viral nonstructural proteins 2B and 3A have been shown to inhibit protein transport through the secretory pathway (3Doedens J.R. Kirkegaard K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 894-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). 3A inhibits protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (4Doedens J.R. Giddings Jr., T.H. Kirkegaard K. J.

Virol. 2005; 79: 5163-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas the step inhibited by the 2B protein is presently unknown. The inhibition of protein transport by 3A is not essential for viral replication in cell culture (4Doedens J.R. Giddings Jr., T.H. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9054-9064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wessels E. Duijsings D. Notebaart R.A. Melchers W.J. van Kuppeveld F.J. J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 10409-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).In addition to inhibiting protein transport, the 3A protein is involved in multiple steps in the process of vRNA replication. Several mutations in 3A were shown to cause defects in vRNA synthesis (9Bernstein H.D. Sarnow P. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 1040-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Giachetti C. Hwang S.S. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6045-6057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hope D.A. Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9490-9498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Xiang W. Cuconati A. Paul A.V. Cao X. Wimmer E. RNA. 1995; 1: 892-904PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact role of 3A, or its precursor 3AB, is not completely understood. 3AB is thought to deliver VPg (3B), the protein primer for RNA synthesis, to the replication complex where vRNA synthesis takes place (13Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition, several other activities have been suggested for 3AB: (i) stimulation of autoprocessing of the 3CDpro precursor protein to produce the 3Cpro protease and the 3Dpol polymerase (14Molla A. Harris K.S. Paul A.V. Shin S.H. Mugavero J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27015-27020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) stimulation of the polymerase activity of 3Dpol (15Lama J. Paul A.V. Harris K.S. Wimmer E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (iii) stimulation of the binding of 3CDpro to the vRNA (17Harris K.S. Xiang W. Alexander L. Lane W.S. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27004-27014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and (iv) mediating binding of 3Dpol to membranes (18Lyle J.M. Bullit E. Bienz K. Kirkegaard K. Science. 2002; 296: 2218-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).3A is a small protein (87-89 aa) that is associated to membranes via its C-terminal hydrophobic domain (19Towner J.S. Ho T.V. Semler B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26810-26818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The structure of the soluble N terminus (aa 1-59) of PV 3A has been resolved by NMR (20Strauss D.M. Glustrom L.W. Wuttke D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PV 3A was shown to form a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two amphipathic α-helices (aa 23-29 and 32-41), which are bent 180° to form a helical hairpin, flanked by unstructured N and C termini. To gain insight into the structure-function relationship of the CVB3 3A protein, we generated a molecular model of this protein using the PV 3A structure as template. We used this model to design mutants and tested them for their ability to dimerize, inhibit protein transport, and support vRNA replication. Our data show that dimerization is important for efficient functioning of 3A. In addition, we identified determinants in 3A that do not affect dimerization but that do affect the ability to inhibit protein transport or to support vRNA replication.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCellsCVB3 (wild type (wt) and mutants) were grown in buffalo green monkey (BGM) kidney cells because this cell line allows efficient and high level CVB3 replication. BGM cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Site-directed MutagenesisIn vitro mutagenesis was performed with single-stranded DNA generated from a subgenomic pALTER phagemid construct that contained the XhoI (nucleotide 2014) to SalI (nucleotide 7438) fragment of CVB3, using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Promega). The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used to introduce unique restriction sites without modifying the aa sequence at positions 5020 (at the end of the 2C coding region) and 5169 (in the middle of the 3A coding region): 5′-TGG TCC CTG GAA CAA GGC CTC AAG CGT GGT-3′ (primer p388.16, StuI site underlined) and 5′-GGA GTT GAT CTC CGG AAC CAA CCA-3′ (primer 388.17, BseAI site underlined), respectively. pALTER clones containing either the BseAI site (pALTER-3A[BseAI]) or both the StuI and BseAI sites (pALTER-2C[StuI]/3A[BseAI]) were generated.PlasmidspEGFP-3A Mutants—For the construction of pEGFP-3A(B-seAI), the 3A coding sequence including the BseAI restriction site was amplified from pALTER-3A(BseAI). The forward primer introduced XhoI and EcoICRI sites and amplified the 3A coding sequence without start codon in frame with EGFP (p416.2: 5′-GGG GGC TCG AGT GGA GCT CTG TTC CAG GGA CCA CCA-3′, XhoI and EcoICRI sites underlined), and the reverse primer introduced a stop codon followed by a BamHI restriction site (p120-5, 5′-GGG GGG GGA TCC CTA TTG AAA ACC CGC AAA GAG-3′, BamHI site underlined). The PCR product was cloned in pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) using XhoI and BamHI. The mutant 3A proteins were generated by PCR amplification using primers that introduced specific mutations and in some cases silent mutations to introduce extra restriction sites for rapid identification of mutations (see supplemental Table S1). The PCR products were cloned in pEGFP-3A(BseAI) using either XhoI and ScaI restriction sites (3A-R6A/E7A/I8A/K9A/I10A, 3A-R6A, 3A-E7A, 3A-I8A, 3A-K9A, 3A-I10A, 3A-D24A, 3A-L25A/L26A, and 3A-S28A) or XhoI and BseAI restriction sites (3A-Y37A). The nucleotide sequence of the mutant 3A proteins was verified by sequence analysis. The second site suppressor mutations that were found after RNA transfection were cloned from the p53CB3/T7 mutant clones into the EGFP-3A(BseAI) clone using Bst1107I and BseAI.p53CB3/T7 Mutants—The CVB3 infectious cDNA clone used in this study was p53CB3/T7 (5Wessels E. Duijsings D. Notebaart R.A. Melchers W.J. van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5163-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which contains a full-length cDNA of CVB3 (strain Nancy) behind a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. For the construction of p53CB3/T7-StuI(5020)/BseAI(5169), the fragment containing the extra restriction sites was cut from pALTER-2C(StuI)/3A(BseAI) using the enzymes XbaI and BstEII and cloned in p53CB3/T7. p53CB3/T7 constructs containing mutant 3A sequences were generated by cloning mutant 3A sequences from pEGFP-3A (using BseAI and the blunt site EcoICRI) in p53CB3/T7-StuI(5020)/BseAI(5169), from which 3A was removed by cutting with StuI (blunt) and BseAI. In case a new and/or extra mutation was found in the vRNA after RNA transfection, p53CB3/T7 constructs containing the mutant 3A sequences were generated by PCR. First RNA was isolated from the virus using the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with primer 5′-GAA CTC AAA GTC GAC TTA TTG CAC TTT TGC TTG CCT-3′ (p120.2, reverse primer 3B) via standard procedures. The reverse transcription-PCR product was used as template for PCR using primers 5′-CAG GTC AGA TAC TCT CTA GAC ATG-3′ (p305.10, forward primer containing a XbaI site (bold) in 2C) and 5′-GGA GTT GAT CTC CGG AAC CAA CCA-3′ (p388.17, reverse primer introducing a BseAI site (bold) at position 46 in 3A). The PCR product was cloned into p53CB3/T7(StuI/BseAI) using XbaI and BseAI. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant 3A sequences was verified by sequence analysis.pRib-CB3-LUC—Plasmid pRib-CB3-LUC, which contains the firefly luciferase gene in place of the P1 capsid coding region, was described previously (21Van Ooij M.J.M. Vogt D.A. Paul A. Castro C. Kuijpers J. van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Cameron C.E. Wimmer E. Andino R. Melchers W.J.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). pRib-CB3-LUC-3A mutant clones were generated from p53CB3/T7-3A mutants using the restriction enzymes BssHII and PvuI.Mammalian Two-hybrid Plasmids—pACT, pBIND, and pG5luc plasmids were obtained from the Checkmate mammalian two-hybrid system (Promega). pACT-3A and pBIND-3A were described previously (5Wessels E. Duijsings D. Notebaart R.A. Melchers W.J. van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5163-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To obtain pACT and pBIND-3A mutant plasmids, the wt 3A sequence was replaced by mutant 3A sequences using the enzymes Bst1107I and BamHI.pC-A1PI-EYFP-S-EGFP-3A MutantspC-A1PI-EYFP-S-EGFP-3A was described previously (5Wessels E. Duijsings D. Notebaart R.A. Melchers W.J. van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5163-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). pC-A1PI-EYFP-S-EGFP-3A mutants were obtained by replacing the EGFP-3A wt sequence for EGFP-3A mutant sequences using restriction enzymes AgeI and XbaI.Mammalian Two-hybrid AnalysisCOS-1 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA (1:1:1 mix of the pACT:pBIND: pG5luc plasmids) using FuGENE 6 reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed, and both the firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase enzyme activities were measured from the same cell lysate using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), as described previously (22de Jong A.S. Schrama I.W. Willems P.M. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Renilla luciferase activity, which is encoded by the pBIND plasmid and which allows monitoring of the transfection efficiency, revealed no gross differences in transfection efficiency among the different samples. For all of the mutants the luciferase activities of three sample combinations were measured: (i) the pACT-3A and pBIND-3A fusion proteins, (ii) the pACT-3A fusion protein with unfused pBIND, and (iii) the pBIND-3A fusion protein with unfused pACT. For all luciferase activities the background luciferase activity, which was produced upon expression of unfused pACT and pBIND proteins, was subtracted. The firefly luciferase activity produced in cells expressing the pACT-3A fusion proteins and unfused pBIND was always much higher than that of the pBIND-3A fusion proteins and unfused pACT. Dimerization efficiency was expressed as the ratio between the firefly luciferase activity measured in cells coexpressing pACT and pBIND fusion proteins versus that measured in cells coexpressing pACT fusion proteins and unfused pBIND. This ratio was set at 100% for wild type 3A. Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant 3A (1-60) was performed to monitor expression of the pACT-3A and pBIND-3A fusion proteins.A1PI Secretion AssayThe A1PI secretion assay was performed as described previously (5Wessels E. Duijsings D. Notebaart R.A. Melchers W.J. van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5163-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In short, BGM cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA/well and at 20 h after transfection incubated in MEM lacking methionine (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. The proteins were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min at 37 °C and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, after which 800 μl of fresh serum-free MEM was added. After 2 h of chase, the medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Anti-EGFP rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:1,000) was added to the cell lysate and culture medium, and the antibody-protein complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and precipitated. The samples were resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amount of radiolabeled A1PI-EYFP in the cell fraction, and medium fraction was quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad Multi-Analyst version 1.0.1). The amount of A1PI in the medium fraction was determined as a percentage of the total amount of A1PI and compared with that of control cells (for which the value was normalized to 100% A1PI secretion). Western blot analysis showed that all mutant 3A proteins were efficiently expressed (data not shown).Analysis of Virus GrowthPlasmids were linearized with MluI, purified, and transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (23van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA transcripts were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. BGM cells grown in 25-cm2 flasks to subconfluency were transfected with 2.5 μg of RNA transcripts using DEAE-dextran as described previously (23van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were grown at 37 °C. When virus growth was observed, the cultures were incubated until the cytopathic effect was complete. In case no cytopathic effect was observed after 5 days, the cultures were subjected to three successive cycles of freezing and thawing, and 200 μl was passaged to fresh BGM monolayer cells, which were grown at 37 °C for another 5 days.Analysis of vRNA ReplicationBGM cells grown in 6-well plates to subconfluency were transfected with 1 μg of T7 RNA polymerase generated RNA transcripts of MluI-linearized pRib-CB3/T7-LUC plasmids as described above. At 8 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was assayed as described previously (23van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were grown in the absence or presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), an inhibitor of enterovirus replication that is used to determine the luciferase levels in the absence of replication (under this condition, luciferase production reflects translation of the transfected replicon RNA). The level of replication is expressed as the ratio of luciferase produced in the presence or absence of GuHCl.Sequence Analysis of vRNARNA was isolated from virus suspensions and reverse transcribed as described previously (23van Kuppeveld F.J.M. Galama J.M.D. Zoll J. Melchers W.J.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7782-7790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, supplied with MEM, grown at 37 °C, and harvested at the indicated times. The viruses were released by three cycles of freezing and thawing, and virus titers were determined by end point titration as described previously (5Wessels E. Duijsings D. Notebaart R.A.

Duijsings D. Notebaart R.A. Melchers W.J. van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5163-5173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Vriend G. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). In this program, the backbone of the protein model is derived from a structurally similar protein (that serves as a template), and side chains are replaced according to differences in sequence alignment (25Vriend G. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). As a template, we used sequence and structure information from the soluble N terminus of the PV 3A protein (aa 1-59), which has been resolved by NMR spectrometry (20Strauss D.M. Glustrom L.W. Wuttke D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The conformation of replaced side chains was determined using the position-specific rotamer method, which is a component of the WHAT_IF software (26Chinea G. Padron G. Hooft R.W. Sander C. Vriend G. Proteins. 1995; 23: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Having 47% identity and an almost gapless alignment between the PV and CVB3 3A sequences, the two proteins were predicted to share a common fold. Subsequently, the CVB3 3A model was optimized using the YASARA NOVA force field package (27Krieger E. Koraimann G. Vriend G. Proteins. 2002; 47: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) and finally validated by WHAT_CHECK (28Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander G. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). CVB3 3A was predicted to form a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two α-helices (aa 20-27 and 31-42) connected by a relatively large loop. For PV 3A, it was described that a conserved hydrophobic surface, which is mainly made up from residues in the central amphipathic α-helices, could form a dimer interface with the hydrophobic surface of the other molecule (20Strauss D.M. Glustrom L.W. Wuttke D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For CVB3 3A, modeling identified various amino acids that could play a role in 3A homodimerization. These include (i) Ile22, Leu25, Leu26, Val29, and Val34, which were predicted to be involved in the hydrophobic packing of the homodimer; (ii) Asp24 and Lys41, which were predicted to form an intermolecular salt bridge; and (iii) Ser28 and Tyr37, which were predicted to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond. Based on this model, we substituted individual residues, most of which were predicted to be involved in dimerization, for Ala residues to study their role in (i) homodimerization, (ii) inhibition of protein transport, and (iii) support of vRNA replication.FIGURE 1Putative model of the CVB3 3A protein and an alignment of several residues of the enterovirus 3A proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2116780321,"CITED1 is the founding member of the CITED family of cofactors that are involved in regulating a wide variety of CBP/p300-dependent transcriptional responses. In the present study, we show that the phosphorylation status of CITED1 changes during the cell cycle and affects its transcriptional cofactor activity. Tryptic mapping and mutagenesis studies identified five phosphorylated serine residues in CITED1. Phosphorylation of these residues did not affect CRM1-dependent nuclear export, but did decrease CITED1 binding to p300 and inhibited CITED1-dependent transactivation of Smad4 and p300. These results suggest that CITED1 functions as a cell cycle-dependent transcriptional cofactor whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation."

These enzymes are classified based on their preference for the chain length of the acyl groups. Carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) and carnitine octanoyltransferase (CrOT) prefer short- and medium-chain acyl groups as substrates, respectively. Carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPTs) prefer long-chan acyl groups as substrates. Several different isoforms of CPTs have been identified in mammals, including CPT-Ia (liver isoform), CPT-Ib (muscle isoform), CPT-Ic (brain isoform), and CPT-II. The CPT-Is are integrally associated with the outer membrane of the mitochondria, whereas CPT-II is localized in the mitochondrial matrix and may be loosely associated with the inner membrane of the mitochondria.The CPTs catalyze the rate-limiting step in the β-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria (4McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 5Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys.

The CoA esters of fatty acids cannot cross the mitochondrial membranes. Instead, they must be converted to their carnitine esters, a reaction that is catalyzed by the CPT-Is, which can then be transported into the mitochondria. Once inside, the carnitine esters are converted back to the CoA esters through the action of CPT-II. Mutation and dysregulation of the CPTs are strongly linked to many serious, even fatal human diseases (4McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 5Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys.

CPT deficiencies are among the most common causes of inherited fatty acid oxidation disorders, and homozygous deletion of CPT-1a is lethal in mice (10Nyman L.R. Cox K.B. Hoppel C.L. Kerner J.

Inhibitors of CPT-Is may be efficacious for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (11Anderson R.C. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998; 4: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lenhard J.M. Gottschalk W.K. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2002; 54: 1199-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas agonists of these enzymes can stimulate fatty acid oxidation and may regulate body weight (13Thupari J.N.

Drugs. 2004; 4: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The CrAT and CrOT enzymes may be important for the oxidation and transport of fatty acids from the peroxisomes to the mitochondria (4McGarry J.D.

The structures can be divided into two domains, N and C domains (Fig. 1), that share the same backbone fold with that of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and several other acetyltransferases (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 27Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).The active site of the enzyme is located at the interface between the two domains, and the catalytic His residue is at the center of a tunnel that extends through the middle of the enzyme (Fig. 1) (21Jogl G. Hsiao Y.-S. Tong L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1033: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Structures of the binary complexes with carnitine or CoA have defined the binding modes of these substrates and suggested a catalytic mechanism in which the positive charge on the carnitine molecule helps to stabilize the oxyanion of the transition state (substrate-assisted catalysis) (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Additional stabilization of the oxyanion is provided by hydrogen bonding to the side chain of a strictly conserved Ser residue (Ser554 in CrAT).To further probe the catalytic mechanism, it is desirable to obtain structural information on the ternary complexes of this enzyme with its substrates or products. Alternatively, structures of the enzyme in complex with bisubstrate analogs could be used to provide insight on the catalysis, as has been carried out successfully for N-acetyltransferases (28Scheibner K.A.

Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, such compounds are not readily available for CrAT, and we have therefore developed protocols for trapping the ternary complexes of this enzyme. We report here the crystal structures of wild-type mouse CrAT in a ternary (Michaelis) complex with the substrates acetyl-CoA and carnitine and in a ternary (dead end) complex with CoA and carnitine, as well as the structure of the S554A/M564G double mutant in a ternary (Michaelis) complex with hexanoylcarnitine and CoA. The structures define in molecular detail the Michaelis complexes for both the forward and reverse reactions of the enzyme and provide significant new insights into the catalytic mechanism of CrAT and possibly other carnitine acyltransferases as well.MATERIALS AND METHODSMutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Residues 30-626 of wild-type mouse CrAT were subcloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) and overexpressed in Escherichia coli (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The expression construct contains an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The S554A/M564G double mutant was created with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing.The wild-type and mutant proteins were purified following the same protocol, with nickel-agarose, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 32 mg/ml in a solution containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5) and 200 mm NaCl, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 5% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at -80 °C.Protein Crystallization—Crystals of wild-type CrAT in complex with carnitine and acetyl-CoA were obtained at 4 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 14% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 2.3 mm carnitine, and the protein was at 17 mg/ml concentration. The crystals were soaked in a solution containing 100 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 2.5 mm carnitine, 5 mm acetyl-CoA, and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol for 3 min before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection at 100 K. They belong to space group C2, with cell parameters of a = 163.9 Å, b = 89.2 Å, c = 122.6 Å, and β = 128.9°. There are two CrAT molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Using this soaking protocol, crystals of wild-type CrAT in complex with carnitine and CoA have also been obtained, the acetyl group being hydrolyzed during the soaking experiment.Crystals of the S554A/M564G mutant in complex with hexanoylcarnitine and CoA were obtained at 4 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 18% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 2.3 mm carnitine, and the protein was at 10 mg/ml concentration. The crystals were soaked in a solution containing 100 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 18% (w/v) PEG 3350, 2.5 mm carnitine, 5 mm hexanoyl-CoA, and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol for 3 min before being flash-frozen for data collection. They belong to space group C2 with cell parameters of a = 164.1 Å, b = 89.1 Å, c = 122.8 Å, and β = 129.0°. These mutant crystals are isomorphous to the ternary complexes of wild-type CrAT described above, with two CrAT molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD at the X4A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic Studies—The kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant CrAT were determined using an end point fluorometric assay (34Hassett R.P. Crockett E.L. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 1.5 mm EDTA, and 3-500 μm acetyl-CoA or hexanoyl-CoA. Each reaction contained 10-200 ng of wild-type enzyme or the M564G mutant, or 1-4 μg of the S554A or S554A/M564G mutant, in a volume of 600 μl. The reactions were initiated by the addition of carnitine (1.5 mm final concentration), allowed to progress for 10 min at room temperature, and then stopped by heat treatment at 70 °C. The free CoA product was reacted with 7-fluorobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonamide (ABD-F; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) by incubation at 42 °C for 40 min, and the fluorescence was recorded at 535 nm (excitation wavelength 405 nm) using a 96-well plate reader (200 μl of solution/well; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Control reactions in the absence of carnitine were carried out to remove the background.

Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStrategies to Obtain the Ternary Complexes of CrAT—Our structures of the CoA and carnitine binary complexes of wild-type CrAT defined the binding modes of these two substrates on their own (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have also determined the crystal structure of the F565A mutant in a ternary (dead end) complex with carnitine and CoA (17Hsiao Y.-S. Jogl G. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31584-31589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, to fully understand the catalysis by this enzyme, the structure of the ternary (Michaelis) complex with carnitine and acetyl-CoA (or acetylcarnitine and CoA) is needed. Our earlier attempts at soaking wild-type CrAT crystals with acetyl-CoA showed that the acetyl group is quickly hydrolyzed, even in the crystalline state (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This suggested that the catalytic activity of the enzyme must be reduced before there is any possibility of capturing the structure of the ternary (Michaelis) complex.Previous studies have indicated that His343 is the general base in the catalysis by CrAT (4McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 5Ramsay R.R. Gandour R.D. van der Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Crystal structures show that this side chain is held in an unusual conformation, with a hydrogen bond between the side chain Nδ2 atom and the main chain carbonyl oxygen (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A similar conformation for the catalytic His residue is observed in the related enzymes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (27Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (35Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and this conformation may enhance the reactivity of the His residue as a general base.As a first attempt to reduce the activity of the enzyme, we mutated the catalytic His343 residue of CrAT to Ala or Glu. Our kinetic studies showed that the H343A mutant is inactive toward both acetyl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA substrates, even when 50 μg of the enzyme were used in the assay (Table 2). In comparison, only 10 ng of the wild-type enzyme is needed to obtain robust activity. This suggests that the H343A mutation caused a >5,000-fold reduction in the activity of CrAT, consistent with the crucial role of this residue in catalysis. On the other hand, the H343E mutant has only a 10-fold loss in kcat/Km toward the acetyl-CoA substrate (Table 2), suggesting that the carboxylic side chain of the Glu residue can partially function as the general base for catalysis. The H343E mutant, however does not show appreciable activity toward the hexanoyl-CoA substrate (Table 2). The presence of the negative charge may disfavor substrates with longer aliphatic chains.Unfortunately, we could not observe any electron density for the CoA molecule in the active site region for either mutant (data not shown), indicating that it was mostly disordered in these mutants. Therefore, it appears that the His343 side chain may also play a role in stabilizing the conformation of the CoA molecule.Based on our structural analysis, the Ser554 residue is part of the oxyanion hole and helps to stabilize the tetrahedral transition state intermediate of the catalysis (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Earlier kinetic studies on CrOT showed that mutation of this Ser residue to Ala produced a 10-fold decrease in the kcat while having little impact on the Km for carnitine (36Cronin C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we produced the S554A mutant of CrAT for our attempts to obtain the ternary (Michaelis) complexes. Our kinetic studies indicated a 25-fold reduction in the kcat and a 4-fold increase in the Km for acetyl-CoA of this mutant (Table 2), suggesting that the S554A mutation may have a somewhat larger impact on the catalysis by CrAT than CrOT. We also produced the S554A/M564G double mutant, since the latter mutation increases the activity of CrAT toward medium-chain fatty acids (such as hexanoyl-CoA) (17Hsiao Y.-S. Jogl G. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31584-31589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Cordente A.G. Lopez-Vinas E. Vazquez M.I. Swiegers J.H. Pretorius I.S. Gomez-Puertas P. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33899-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This double mutant could then allow us to determine the binding modes of medium-chain acyl groups. Our kinetic data on this double mutant as well as the M564G single mutant (Table 2) are fully consistent with kinetic data reported earlier (17Hsiao Y.-S. Jogl G. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31584-31589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Cordente A.G. Lopez-Vinas E. Vazquez M.I. Swiegers J.H. Pretorius I.S. Gomez-Puertas P. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33899-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Whereas mutagenesis is a powerful way to reduce the catalytic activity of CrAT, there could be concerns in the resulting structures as to the impact of the mutations. Therefore, we also developed a soaking protocol that would allow us to capture the ternary (Michaelis) complex for the wild-type enzyme by sampling the pH of the soaking solution and the soaking time. The optimal pH of CrAT is 7.4, and most of the earlier soaking experiments were carried out at this pH. By lowering the pH of the soaking solution, we should be able to reduce the catalytic activity of the enzyme, since it can be expected that the His343 catalytic residue becomes a weaker base at lower pH, especially if it becomes protonated. We have varied the pH of the soaking solution from 5.5 to 8.5, together with using short soaking times (1-5 min), to obtain the simultaneous binding mode of carnitine and acetyl-CoA to the wild-type enzyme. It should be noted that the actual pH of the system could also change during the cryofreezing procedure. Structural comparisons with the binary complexes, which were obtained near the optimal pH of the enzyme, show that the reduction in the pH did not cause a significant change in the active site of the enzyme (see below).Structure of CrAT in a Ternary (Michaelis) Complex with Carnitine and Acetyl-CoA—The crystal structure of wild-type murine CrAT in a ternary complex with carnitine and acetyl-CoA has been determined at 2.2 Å resolution (Fig. 1). The atomic model contains residues 30-625 of the enzyme, with excellent agreement to the crystallographic data and expected geometric parameters (Table 1). The majority of the residues (90%) are in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, whereas residue Ile116 is the only one in the disallowed region (Table 1). This residue has clearly defined electron density and is also in the disallowed region in the structures of the free enzyme and the binary complexes.To obtain this structure, wild-type murine CrAT was first co-crystallized with carnitine and then soaked in a solution containing 5 mm acetyl-CoA at pH 6.5 for 3 min. There are two molecules of CrAT in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Clear electron density for acetyl-CoA (Fig. 2A) and carnitine was observed in the active site of one of these molecules, whereas the other active site contained carnitine and CoA. This suggests that the hydrolysis of the acetyl-CoA substrate can still occur at the lowered pH, and the enzyme is still catalytically active in the crystalline environment. Using this protocol, we also successfully obtained the crystal structure of the S554A mutant of CrAT in a ternary complex with acetyl-CoA and carnitine (data not shown). From our experiments, it appears that pH 6.5 is the optimal soaking condition for observing the electron density of acyl groups in the active site of CrAT.FIGURE 2Structure of wild-type CrAT in a ternary complex with acetyl-CoA and carnitine.

However, signaling mechanisms involving these receptors are less well characterized in mammals than in Drosophila. To obtain structure-function relationship information on human Patched and Smoothened, we expressed these human receptors in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. We show here that, as its Drosophila counterpart, human Patched is able to repress the signaling pathway in the absence of Hedgehog ligand. In response to Hedgehog, human Patched is able to release Drosophila Smoothened inhibition, suggesting that human Patched is expressed in a functional state in Drosophila cells. We also provide experiments showing that human Smo, when expressed in Schneider cells, is able to bind the alkaloid cyclopamine, suggesting that it is expressed in a native conformational state. Furthermore, contrary to Drosophila Smoothened, human Smoothened does not interact with the kinesin Costal 2 and thus is unable to transduce the Hedgehog signal. Moreover, cell surface fluorescent labeling suggest that human Smoothened is enriched at the Schneider 2 plasma membrane in response to Hedgehog. These results suggest that human Smoothened is expressed in a functional state in Drosophila cells, where it undergoes a regulation of its localization comparable with its Drosophila homologue. Thus, we propose that the upstream part of the Hedgehog pathway involving Hedgehog interaction with Patched, regulation of Smoothened by Patched, and Smoothened enrichment at the plasma membrane is highly conserved between Drosophila and humans; in contrast, signaling downstream of Smoothened is different.

Baylin S.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies suggest that dysfunction of the Hh pathway in stem or precursor cells might contribute to tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative disorders (9Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar, 10Ruiz i Altaba A. Sanchez P. Dahmane N. Nat. Rev.

The Hh peptide, which is dually modified at its N and C termini by palmitoyl and cholesterol adducts, respectively, triggers the pathway activation by stoichiometric binding to Patched (Ptc), a 12-transmembrane segment (TMS) protein (4Stone D.M. Hynes M. Armanini M. Swanson T.A. Gu Q. Johnson R.L. Scott M.P. Pennica D. Goddard A. Phillips H. Noll M. Hooper J.E. de Sauvage F. Rosenthal A.

Ptc is an atypical receptor, the activity of which is repressed upon ligand binding. In Drosophila, this results in the stabilization of the seven-TMS protein Smoothened (Smo) at the plasma membrane, which in turn interacts with a cytoplasmic complex and activates the cytoplasmic transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci) (13Torroja C. Gorfinkiel N. Guerrero I. J. Neurobiol. 2005; 64: 334-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the kinesin Costal 2 (Cos2), component of a large cytoplasmic complex, can bind to Smo and that this interaction is important for Ci activation (14Ruel L. Rodriguez R. Gallet A. Lavenant-Staccini L. Therond P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Lum L. Yao S. Mozer B. Rovescalli A. Von Kessler D. Nirenberg M. Beachy P.A.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1998-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, transfected Smo in mammalian cultured cells is internalized after activation of the pathway instead of accumulating at the cell surface (17Incardona J.P. Gruenberg J. Roelink H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 983-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarly, the internalization of Smo has been observed when the pathway is activated using a Hh agonist and can be reversed by treatment with the Hh antagonist cyclopamine (18Chen W. Ren X.R. Nelson C.D. Barak L.S. Chen J.K. Beachy P.A. de Sauvage F. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2257-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Smo localization might be regulated differently in flies and mammals. However, recent data on the role of cilia in the Hh pathway suggest that vertebrate Smo, like the Drosophila protein, is recruited to specialized membranes in response to ligand (19Corbit K.C. Aanstad P. Singla V. Norman A.R. Stainier D.Y. Reiter J.F. Nature. 2005; 437: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 20Huangfu D. Anderson K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11325-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In the absence of Hh, Ptc was proposed to act catalytically to suppress Smo activation (21Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Maiti T. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2002; 418: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). This Hh signal response scheme is globally conserved from insects to mammals. However, the molecular mechanism of Smo inhibition by Ptc is unknown, and signaling downstream of Smo, if relatively well understood in Drosophila, still needs to be resolved in mammals (13Torroja C. Gorfinkiel N. Guerrero I. J. Neurobiol. 2005; 64: 334-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Briscoe J. Therond P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Dysfunction of Ptc and Smo are responsible of numerous human pathologies, making these receptors interesting therapeutic targets. In order to obtain a sufficient amount of Ptc and Smo to purify them and determine their three-dimensional structure, we expressed the human Ptc and Smo in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. The functional characterization of the human receptors expressed in Schneider 2 cells using double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) against Drosophila Ptc and Smo, fluorescence labeling, and immunoprecipitation experiments strongly suggest that human receptors Ptc and Smo are functionally expressed in Schneider 2 cells. Based on the results presented in this paper and on sequence alignment analyses, we discuss the evolution of the Hh pathway between Drosophila and humans. Construction of Expression Vectors—For expression in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, we used the pAc5.1/V5-His type A (pAc) and pMT/V5-His (pMT) vectors (Invitrogen) containing the strong constitutive Ac5 actin promoter and the heavy metal inducible MT metallothionein promoter, respectively.

For hSmo amplification, we used the following primers: 5′-ACT AGT TCT AGA GAG CTC CCG CGG AAA AAA ATG GCC GCT GCC CGC CCA GCG CGG and 5′-GGT ACC TCT AGA TCA GCT AGC GAA GTC CGA GTC TGC ATC CAT GAG TTC. The PCR product was subcloned in pCR™2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequenced. hSmo cDNA was then digested by SpeI and NheI and subcloned in MAP NheI sites, giving pAc-hSmo-MAP and pMT-hSmo-MAP. For hPtc, we used primers 5′-ACT AGT TCT AGA GAG CTC CCG CGG AAA AAA ATG GCC TCG GCT GGT AAC GCC GCC GAG CCC and 5′-GGT ACC TCT AGA TCA GCT AGC GTT GGA GCT GCT TCC CCG GGG CCT CTC. The PCR product was directly digested by XbaI and NheI and then subcloned in NheI sites of MAP included in pAc and pMT, giving pAc-hPtc-MAP and pMT-hPtc-MAP, respectively. The chimera mSmo-dSmo consisting of the first 633 amino acids from mouse Smo fused to the C-terminal tail (amino acids 652–1036) of Drosophila Smo followed by the Myc tag, was introduced in pAc vector. Cell Culture and Transfection—The S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal serum. Cells were maintained at room temperature under normal atmosphere. For establishment of stable cell lines, S2 cells were co-transfected with 19 μg of pMT-hPtc-MAP, pAc-hPtc-MAP, pMT-hSmo-MAP, or pAc-hSmo-MAP and with 1 μg of pCoHYGRO (Invitrogen) for selection using the calcium phosphate method. 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) was added to medium in order to select transfected cells and clonal lines. Transient transfections were performed with 0.5 μg of vectors also using the calcium phosphate method. The transfection efficiency was estimated to be around 20% using a β-galactosidase assay. The effect of Hh was tested by incubating control and hSmo-expressing cells with Hh-conditioned medium prepared from stable S2 cell line expressing Hh. Membrane Protein Preparation and Purification—All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were collected, centrifuged, washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline and one time in H2O, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After 10 min in ice, cells were broken by passages through a syringe. Cellular remains were pelleted at 430 × g for 10 min, and supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g to collect heavy membranes, essentially plasma membranes. Membrane proteins were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture, and 20% glycerol. Solubilization and purification were performed as already described by De Rivoyre et al. (23De Rivoyre M. Bonino F. Ruel L. Bidet M. Therond P. Mus-Veteau I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected, pulled down at maximum speed for a few seconds, washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor mixture). Unsolubilized cells and cellular remains were pelleted. Supernatants were mixed with 4× Laemmli loading buffer, boiled for 2 min, and then loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Biosciences). Following a blocking step in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS, 0.5% Tween 20 (MTBST) for 30 min, membrane was incubated overnight in MTBST supplemented with polyclonal rabbit anti-Cos2 (1:5000), rabbit anti-Fused (Fu) (1:1000), rabbit anti-dSmo (1:200; (14Ruel L. Rodriguez R. Gallet A. Lavenant-Staccini L. Therond P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar)), anti-Myc (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or monoclonal mouse anti-HA (1:200) antibodies. Membrane was washed three times in TBS-T and then incubated in MTBST supplemented with corresponding IgG horseradish peroxidase-coupled for 1 h. Membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and revealed using ECL reagents. Double-stranded RNA Interference in S2 Cells— dsRNAi was produced by transcription in vitro with T7 polymerase on PCR products corresponding to amino acids 740–970 of dPtc and amino acids 141–370 of dSmo. Transfection with dsRNAi into S2 cells was performed as described by Ruel et al. (14Ruel L. Rodriguez R. Gallet A. Lavenant-Staccini L. Therond P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, 37 μg of dsRNAi per million cells were incubated in 1 ml of culture media without serum and then thoroughly agitated for 1 min and completed with 2 ml of culture media containing serum after 3 days of incubation, allowing protein expression turnover. Transfected cells were then split into control or Hh-containing medium and incubated for an additional 16 h. Samples were prepared for analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Surface Immunofluorescent Labeling—Stably hSmo-expressing cells or S2 cells transfected with 0.5 μg of pAc-hSmo-MAP were incubated or not with Hh-conditioned medium, and cell surface labeling was performed as described by Kurihara et al. (25Kurihara R. Tohyama Y. Matsusaka S. Naruse H. Kinoshita E. Tsujioka T. Katsumata Y. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12908-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 1 h at 0 °C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 488–787 mapping at both intra- and extracellular C terminus domain of human Smo (1:100; N-300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in S2 medium containing 10% of fetal bovine serum. After dilution and centrifugation, cells were incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with a rhodamine fluorescent secondary antibody (Alexa 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes)) in S2 medium containing 10% of fetal bovine serum. After dilution and centrifugation, cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% formaldehyde. Rhodamine fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSScan; BD Biosciences), and fluorescence microscopy with image acquisition was performed using a confocal system (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta) with an objective Plan Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil differential interference contrast, and an Applied Precision Deltavision System (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) built on an Olympus IX 70 base and a ×40/1.35 Uapo objective at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. Cell fluorescence was analyzed using Image J software. Cyclopamine Binding—Cyclopamine binding assays were performed using the fluorescent derivative BODIPY-cyclopamine generously provided by P. Beachy and adapted from Ref. 26Chen J.K. Taipale J. Cooper M.K. Beachy P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2743-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar. Cells that were wild-type, stably hSmo-expressing, or transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pAc-hSmo-MAP S2, treated or not with Hh conditioned medium, were incubated with 5 or 50 nm of BODIPY-cyclopamine for 4 h at 25 °C, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% formaldehyde. BODIPY fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described by Ruel et al. (14Ruel L. Rodriguez R. Gallet A. Lavenant-Staccini L. Therond P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μgof protein G-Sepharose bound to anti-Cos2, anti-HA, or anti-Myc were added to the clarified cell lysates at 4 °C for 2 h, and immunocomplexes were washed five times with lysis buffer. ECL reagents were used for antibody detection after blotting to nitrocellulose membranes. Protein Quantification—The proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Establishment of Schneider Cell Lines Stably Expressing Human Ptc and Human Smo—Because Ptc and Smo are involved in numerous pathologies in humans, they provide interesting therapeutic targets. We decided to overexpress each protein separately in a heterologous system (Schneider cells) in order to purify them to determine their three-dimensional structure. Schneider 2 (S2) cells are suitable hosts for the expression of large amounts of recombinant eukaryotic protein, since they are inducible, nonlytic, stable, and able to reach a cell density as high as 3 × 107 cells/ml (10-fold higher than Sf9 cells) (27Benting J. Lecat S. Zacchetti D. Simons K. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Tota M.R. Xu L. Sirotina A. Strader C.D. Graziano M.P. J. Biol.

Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). hPtc and hSmo cDNA were subcloned in S2 cell expression vectors in which the sequence MAP was previously inserted in place of the existent tags V5 and His. This MAP sequence, fused to the hSmo and hPtc C-terminal ends, provides several epitopes to follow hSmo and hPtc expression as well as opportunities for rapid purification under mild conditions using several affinity chromatography columns (23De Rivoyre M. Bonino F. Ruel L. Bidet M. Therond P. Mus-Veteau I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). S2 cells have been co-transfected with pMT-hSmo-MAP, pMT-hPtc-MAP, pAc-hSmo-MAP, or pAc-hPtc-MAP and the pCo-Hygro that allows transformant selection and stable S2 cell line establishment using hygromycin. We observed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies directed against the MAP sequence that hSmo and hPtc were transiently expressed under metallothionein or actin promotor (data not shown). After treatment with hygromycin, we obtained cell populations expressing hPtc or hSmo. Several clonal stable cell lines were then established from each polyclonal population, and the expression levels of hSmo and hPtc were analyzed by Western blot. We observed that expression levels for both proteins were higher under the actin promotor than under the metallothionein one (data not shown). We present in Fig. 1 Western blots using anti-HA antibodies performed on total extracts from different clones expressing hSmo (Fig. 1A) or hPtc (Fig. 1B) under the actin promotor. The five pAc-hSmo-MAP transfected clones present a specific highly immunoreactive signal around 100 kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass calculated from hSmo-MAP sequence (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5). By comparison with hSmo-MAP expressed in yeast (23De Rivoyre M. Bonino F. Ruel L. Bidet M. Therond P. Mus-Veteau I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which gives bands around 80 and 100 kDa, corresponding probably to nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms of hSmo, respectively, the 100-kDa band observed here may correspond to a glycosylated form of hSmo-MAP. A high molecular weight-specific band that certainly corresponds to an hSmo oligomer is also detected. A strong signal around 110 kDa is present in all extracts, including those from wild-type S2 cells corresponding to an endogenous protein highly expressed in S2 cells. One of the clones stably transfected with pAc-hPtc-MAP vector presents a strong signal around 180 kDa, corresponding to the expected molecular weight of recombinant hPtc-MAP protein (Fig. 1B, lane 2). We also observed the presence of minor lower molecular weight bands that probably correspond to degradation products. We selected one pAc-hPtc-MAP clone and one pAc-hSmo-MAP clone for their high expression levels of hPtc and hSmo. Heavy membrane fractions containing plasma membrane fragments were prepared from a 20-ml culture of hPtc- and hSmo-expressing cell lines selected. Anti-HA immunoblots presented in Fig. 1C show specific signals around 180 kDa for hPtc-expressing cells and 100 kDa for hSmo-expressing cells, indicating that both hPtc and hSmo are expressed at the plasma membrane in the S2 cell lines selected. Membrane fractions were solubilized in buffer containing 1% detergent dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and incubated with 50 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid, calmodulin, or streptavidin resins. Fractions eluted from the different resins present a specific anti-HA signal at 180 or 100 kDa, corresponding to hPtc-MAP or hSmo-MAP, respectively (Fig. 1C). A weak band around 110 kDa is also observable in membrane preparations. This band corresponds to the highly expressed contaminant observed in the total extracts presented in Fig. 1, A and B, but is not retained on the affinity resins as shown in the purification experiments performed on membrane preparation from wild-type S2 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). These experiments indicate that the three affinity domains of the MAP sequence fused in the hPtc and hSmo C terminus allow efficient binding on the corresponding resins and that this strategy can be used to purify human Ptc and human Smo, according to our recent study on the expression of hSmo in yeast (23De Rivoyre M. Bonino F. Ruel L. Bidet M. Therond P. Mus-Veteau I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In order to know if hPtc and hSmo expressed in the S2 cell lines selected are in a functional state, we tested hPtc and hSmo activities by different means. Human Ptc Is Able to Replace Drosophila Ptc in the Drosophila Hh Pathway—S2 cells present the advantage of possessing a functional Hh pathway from Ptc to the Fu·Cos2 cytoplasmic complex, but transcriptional response is lacking due to the absence of Ci (30Chen C.H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B. Ma Y. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In response to Hh protein, Smo is submitted to post-translational modifications leading to its stabilization (Fig. 2A, lane 2). This stabilization is visualized by increased levels of Smo at the plasma membrane, a step that seems to be necessary to induce signal transduction (31Denef N. Neubuser D. Perez L. Cohen S.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 32Jia J. Tong C. Wang B. Luo L. Jiang J.

Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), as visualized by their electrophoretic mobility shifts (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 2). We observe that in the S2 cell line expressing hPtc, Fu and Cos2 behave as in wild-type S2 cells in the absence of Hh (Fig. 2A, lane 5). In response to Hh, Fu and Cos2 phosphorylation and Smo accumulation are observed in this cell line (Fig. 2A, lane 6). One possibility is that the inhibitory effect of hPtc is sensitive to Drosophila Hh. Indeed, we noted that in several experiments Fu and Cos2 phosphorylation and Smo stabilization were not induced as strongly as in wild-type S2 cells, probably due to the high level of hPtc expression and thus to hPtc receptors free of Hh ligand. dsRNAi, inhibiting the expression of selected proteins, is a very efficient tool for dissecting transduction pathways in S2 cells (15Lum L. Yao S. Mozer B. Rovescalli A. Von Kessler D. Nirenberg M. Beachy P.A. Science. 2003; 299: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 36Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The effect of dsRNAi on Hh pathway can be measured, analyzing the status of Smo, Fu, and Cos2. As already described (14Ruel L. Rodriguez R. Gallet A. Lavenant-Staccini L. Therond P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), upon inhibition of dPtc expression (by dsRNAi directed against Drosophila Ptc (dsRNAi-dPtc)), the dSmo level is increased and Fu and Cos2 are phosphorylated even in the absence of Hh ligand (Fig. 2A, lane 3), underlining the inhibitory effect of Ptc on the Hh pathway. In order to see if the human form of Ptc is able to replace its Drosophila homologue, hPtc-expressing cells were treated with dsRNAi directed against dPtc (dsRNAi-dPtc). Upon expression of hPtc, Fu and Cos2 phosphorylation and dSmo stabilization are not induced by dsRNAi-dPtc treatment (Fig. 2A, lane 7), as if hPtc were able to replace dPtc by repressing the pathway. Incubation of these treated cells with Hh ligand induces phosphorylation of Fu and Cos2 and also accumulation of dSmo (Fig. 2A, lane 8), suggesting that hPtc activity is sensitive to Hh. This experiment has been repeated four times and gave similar results. Our results indicate that human Ptc expressed in the stable cell line selected is able to replace at least partially the Drosophila Ptc and therefore is expressed in a functional state. To confirm this, hPtc-expressing S2 cells were treated with dsRNAi directed against both dPtc and hPtc. In these conditions, we observe high Fu and Cos2 phosphorylation and dSmo stabilization in the absence of Hh (Fig. 2B, lane 4). This suggests that the strong r"

A complex of SmpB protein and SsrA RNA orchestrates this salvage process. The specific and direct binding of SmpB facilitates recognition and delivery of SsrA RNA to stalled ribosomes. The SmpB protein is conserved throughout the bacterial kingdom and contains several conserved amino acid sequence motifs. We present evidence to demonstrate that amino acid residues Glu-31, Leu-91, and Lys-124, which are highly conserved and clustered along an exposed surface of the protein, play a crucial role in the SsrA-mediated peptide tagging process. Our analysis suggests that the peptide-tagging defect exhibited by these SmpB variants is due to their inability to facilitate the delivery of SsrA RNA to stalled ribosomes. Moreover, we present evidence to demonstrate that the ribosome association defect of these variants is due to their reduced SsrA binding affinity. Consistent with these findings, we present biochemical evidence to demonstrate that residues Glu-31, Leu-91, and Lys-124 are essential for the SsrA binding activity of SmpB protein. Furthermore, we have investigated the interactions of SmpB·SsrA orthologues from the thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. Our investigations demonstrate an analogous role for the equivalent T. tengcongensis residues in SmpB·SsrA interactions, hence further validating our findings for the Escherichia coli SmpB·SsrA system. These results demonstrate the functional significance of this cluster of conserved residues in SmpB binding to SsrA RNA, suggesting they might represent a core contact surface for recognition of SsrA RNA.

Specific complexes of RNA and protein perform many essential biological functions, including RNA processing, RNA turnover, RNA transport, and RNA folding as well as the translation of genetic information from mRNA into protein sequences. Principles that govern RNA-protein interactions are inadequately understood due in large part to a paucity of detailed structural and biochemical information on RNA-protein complexes. These principles are important for understanding RNA-protein machines, such as the ribosome and RNA-protein structure and function in general.SsrA (also known as transfer mRNA and 10Sa RNA) is a small, highly structured RNA that is found in all bacteria (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Keiler K.C. Shapiro L. Williams K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SsrA, through its unique sequence and structure, is endowed with both tRNA and mRNA-like functions (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Felden B. Hanawa K.

Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The tmRNA model for SsrA function proposes that alaninecharged SsrA RNA recognizes stalled ribosomes, binds at the ribosomal A-site, and donates its alanine charge to the growing polypeptide (11Stepanov V.G. Nyborg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Barends S. Karzai A. Sauer R. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol.

The ribosomal reading frame then switches to the mRNA segment of SsrA, adding a degradation tag to the C terminus of targeted polypeptide. SsrA-tagged proteins are then recognized by cellular proteases and efficiently degraded (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7Gillet R. Felden B.

Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). This unique bacterial process is also known as trans-translation. All known biological activities of SsrA RNA require small protein B (SmpB) (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The known functions of SmpB are specific binding to SsrA RNA and promoting stable association and proper engagement of the SmpB·SsrA complex with stalled ribosomes (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T.

A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the absence of SmpB protein SsrA does not associate stably with 70 S ribosomes. SmpB binds specifically to the tRNA-like domain of SsrA and, although not required, enhances the efficiency of its aminoacylation by stabilizing SsrA tertiary structure (16Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Takagi M. Inokuchi H. Himeno H. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, formation of the SmpB·SsrA complex appears to be critical for recognition and rescue of stalled ribosomes.The SmpB protein is highly conserved in eubacteria. Sequence alignment analysis of SmpB orthologues from 115 bacterial species shows the presence of several conserved polar and hydrophobic residues. In studies described herein, we have sought to gain a better understanding of the biological role and energetic contributions of highly conserved surface amino acids of SmpB protein. We have specifically focused on a number of conserved residues that are closely clustered on one surface of the SmpB protein. We provide in vivo and in vitro evidence for the contribution of these amino acids in trans-translation. Additionally, we have investigated the SmpB·SsrA RNA complex of the thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (Tten) 2The abbreviations used are: Tten, T. tengcongensis; N-Tricine, [2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: Tten, T. tengcongensis; N-Tricine, [2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild type. and demonstrate that the equivalent residues make significant energetic contributions to the binding of Tten SmpB protein to Tten SsrA RNA. These results are consistent with the conclusion that this cluster of surface residues represents the core contact points of SmpB·SsrA interactions that is conserved across divergent bacterial species.MATERIALS AND METHODSSite-directed Mutagenesis—All single and double SmpB mutations were introduced by PCR mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. Plasmid pET28 BAHis6 (15Sundermeier T.R. Dulebohn D.P. Cho H.J. Karzai A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Escherichia coli strain W3110 ΔsmpB/(DE3) was transformed with individual pET28BAHis6 plasmid variants containing SmpBWT or one of the SmpB alanine variants, SmpBE31A, SmpBL91A, SmpBK124A, SmpBN93A, SmpBQ94A, SmpBE31A/L91A, SmpBE31A/K124A, SmpBL91A/K124A, SmpBN93A/Q94A, and SmpBE31A/L91A/K124A. Endogenous protein tagging assays were performed as previously described (15Sundermeier T.R. Dulebohn D.P. Cho H.J. Karzai A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Ribosome Association Assays—For 70 S ribosome preparations, 750-ml cultures of W3110 ΔsmpB/(DE3) containing plasmid pET28 BAWT or pET28BA with specified SmpB amino acid substitutions were grown in LB containing 3 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to A600 of 0.8–1.0. Bacterial cells were harvested, washed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), pelleted, and stored at –80 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 units/ml SUPERase-In (Ambion)) and lysed by gentle sonication. Lysates were centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and centrifuged again at 33,000 × g for 30 min. Typically, a 19-ml aliquot of the supernatant was layered onto a 32% sucrose cushion in buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 units/ml SUPERase-In (Ambion)) and centrifuged at 85,000 × g for 22 h. The pellet containing tight-coupled ribosomes was washed twice with 5 ml of cold buffer B. Pellets were resuspended in 0.25 ml of buffer A, and equivalent numbers of ribosomes were loaded onto a 10–50% sucrose cushion in buffer A. The sucrose gradients were centrifuged at 42,000 × g for 17 h. Gradients were fractionated, and the fractions corresponding to purified 70 S ribosomes were pooled and used for Western and Northern blot analysis. RNA for Northern blot analysis was extracted with Tri-LS reagent (Molecular Research), and equal amounts of RNA were loaded onto 1% formaldehyde agarose gels, transferred to Hi-Blot nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with a psoralenbiotin (Ambion) labeled full-length SsrA probe. For Western blot analysis, an equal number of ribosomes were loaded per lane, and the associated proteins were resolved on 15% Tris-Tricine gels. Western blots were developed with antibodies raised against purified SmpB protein and a secondary IR 800-nm dye conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes).Purification of SmpB Alanine-substituted Variants—Bacterial strain BL21 (DE3)/plysS (Stratagene) was transformed with plasmid pET28 BAHis6 harboring SmpBWT or one of the alanine variants: SmpBE31A, SmpBL91A, SmpBK124A, SmpBN93A, SmpBQ94A, SmpBE31A/L91A, SmpBE31A/K124A, SmpBL91A/K124A, SmpBN93A/Q94A, Tten-SmpBWT, Tten-SmpBE28A, Tten-SmpBL87A, Tten-SmpBH89A, Tten-SmpBR90A, or Tten-SmpBK120A. Typically, cells were grown in 3 liters of LB at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.5 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (1 m NH4Cl, 150 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole) and lysed by sonication (3 × 30-s pulses, with the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride after each pulse). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 1 h at 15,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor to remove cellular debris. Due to the greater thermal stability of the Tten SmpB protein, an additional heat treatment step was included for wild-type Tten SmpB protein and all of its alanine substitution variants. The S30 supernatants of Tten SmpB proteins were heated at 65 °C for 10 min. This treatment results in the denaturation and precipitation of greater than 80% of soluble E. coli proteins, whereas the Tten SmpB variants are entirely unaffected and remain soluble. The heat-treated protein samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 15,000 rpm to pellet the denatured E. coli proteins. The supernatant fractions were mixed with 2 ml of Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) and pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer, and the binding reaction was permitted to proceed with gentle rocking for 1 h at4 °C. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was applied to a chromatography column and washed 3× with 50 ml of lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with 12 ml of elution buffer (150 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The eluates were then diluted 3-fold in fast protein liquid chromatography buffer A (50 mm KCl, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and applied onto a Mono S ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare). A gradient of 50–850 mm KCl in buffer A was developed over 20 column volumes to isolate the SmpB protein. SmpB protein, with greater than 95% purity, elutes at ∼500 mm KCl under these conditions. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using extension coefficients of 29575 m–1 cm–1 for the E. coli SmpB variants and 10430 m–1 cm–1 for the Tten SmpB variants. Protein aliquots were stored at –80 °C until needed.Electrophoretic Mobility-shift Assays—SsrA variants were produced and labeled as described previously (15Sundermeier T.R. Dulebohn D.P. Cho H.J. Karzai A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The csrB gene was PCR-amplified from E. coli genomic DNA using a 5′-primer csrb2 (5′-CGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTGTCTTCAGGACGAAGAAC-3′) and a 3′-primer csrb3(5′-AAAAGGGGTACTGTTTTACCAG-3′). The amplified product was purified by gel electrophoresis and re-amplified to incorporate a T7 promoter sequence at its 5′-end. CsrB RNA was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase in accord with the manufacturer's recommendations (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Template DNA was digested with DNase I, and the transcription products were phenol/chloroform-extracted and purified by electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were performed essentially as described (15Sundermeier T.R. Dulebohn D.P. Cho H.J. Karzai A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, E. coli and T. tengcongensis SmpB protein variants were diluted to the desired protein concentrations in electrophoretic mobility-shift buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 10% glycerol (v/v)) in the presence of 100 nm CsrB RNA as a nonspecific competitor (in 100-fold excess over the specific SsrA RNA). Approximately 100 fmol of 3′-end-labeled SsrA113 RNA (∼1000 cpm/reaction) were added to each tube and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were loaded on a 12% non-denaturing gel and resolved by electrophoresis at 200 V in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA to resolve the free RNA from RNA-protein complexes. Gels were run at 4 °C, dried, and exposed overnight to phosphorim-aging screens. All binding experiments for E. coli and T. tengcongensis SmpB variants were performed at least in triplicate, covering a protein concentration range of 0.1 nm to 1.5 μm. Data analysis was performed according to Berggrun and Sauer (17Berggrun A. Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fraction of the primary bound species at each SmpB concentration was determined, and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant was obtained by curve-fitting using the equation Θeq = C/(1 + Kd/[SmpB]i), where Θeq is the fraction of RNA bound at equilibrium, C is a constant representing the maximum fraction bound of the specific bound species, and [SmpB]i is the initial concentration of SmpB.RESULTSMutations in Conserved SmpB Amino Acids Decrease the Level of Tagged Proteins in Vivo—The SmpB protein is a requisite component of the trans-translation process. It performs several key functions, including specific binding to SsrA RNA, recognition of stalled ribosomes, and proper positioning of SsrA in the ribosomal A-site (1Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T.

A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment analysis of SmpB protein revealed the identity of a number of invariant amino acid residues that are conserved across many diverse bacterial species (Fig. 1A). To gain insights into the functional significance of these highly conserved amino acids, we carried out a systematic alanine-scan mutagenesis of strategic residues of the E. coli SmpB protein. This analysis enabled us to evaluate the contribution of conserved residues to known SmpB functions in trans-translation. We previously reported on the functional significance of a number of highly conserved amino acid residues located in the C-terminal tail of the SmpB protein (15Sundermeier T.R. Dulebohn D.P. Cho H.J. Karzai A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study we focused specifically on several evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues (Glu-31, Leu-91, and Lys-124) and two marginally conserved residues (Asn-93, Q94), that are clustered along an exposed surface of the protein (Fig. 1C). We deemed alanine substitutions ideal for these studies, as alanine lacks a side chain beyond the β-carbon, does not impose steric restrictions, or alter the main-chain conformation. The mutants were generated by site directed mutagenesis using pET28BAHis6, a plasmid that harbors the smpB gene and a functional ssrA variant (ssrAHis6) that encodes ANDEHHHHHH in place of the normal ANDENYALAA degradation tag. The SsrAHis6 variant permits endogenously tagged proteins to be purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and detected by Western blot analysis.To scrutinize the contributions of individual residues to known SmpB functions, we evaluated the affect of single alanine substitutions on the SmpB·SsrA mediated trans-translation process in vivo. To this end, we transformed an smpB deletion strain with the pET28BAHis6 plasmid, harboring a single alanine substitution mutant of SmpB. We purified endogenously His6 tagged products of the SmpB·SsrA system and resolved them by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The levels of endogenously tagged proteins were determined by Western blot analysis using anti-His6 antibodies. This analysis revealed that alanine substitutions of the two variably conserved SmpB residues (Asn-93 and Gln-94) did not have a substantial effect on the ability of SmpB to support tagging of endogenous substrates (data not shown). In contrast, alanine substitutions of SmpB residues Glu-31, Leu-91, and Lys-124 resulted in a modest and reproducible decrease in the level of endogenously tagged proteins. Compared with wild-type SmpB protein, these variants consistently displayed a 15–20% reduction in endogenous tagging activity, suggesting a role for these highly conserved residues in one of the known SmpB functions (data not shown).To gain further insight into the contributions of these residues, we generated a number of double alanine substitution variants of SmpB protein, including E31A/L91A (SmpBEL), E31A/K124A (SmpBEK), L91A/K124A (SmpBLK), and N93A/Q94A (SmpBNQ). Evaluation of the ability of the double alanine substitution variant SmpBNQ to support trans-translation in vivo revealed little or no loss of tagging activity. In contrast, double-alanine-substituted variants SmpBEL, SmpBLK, and SmpBEK showed a marked decrease in endogenous protein tagging activity (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–6). Compared with wild-type SmpB, the tagging propensity of these variants was reduced by 30, 50, and 65%, respectively (Fig. 2C). Maximum reduction in tagging activity was observed with a triple-alanine-substituted variant, E31A/L91A/K124A (SmpBELK), which showed a 70% loss of in vivo tagging activity (Fig. 2C). These findings demonstrate that several highly conserved residues, particularly residues Glu-31, Leu-91, and Lys-124, play an important role in trans-translation in vivo.FIGURE 2Analysis of the endogenous tagging activity of E. coli SmpB alanine substitution variants.

We have previously shown that the SmpB protein is required for stable association of SsrA RNA with 70 S ribosomes (14Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Sundermeier T.R. Dulebohn D.P. Cho H.J. Karzai A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To assess the ribosome association propensities of the variants, we purified 70 S ribosomes from ΔsmpB cells harboring wild-type SmpB or one of its variants (SmpBEL, SmpBEK, SmpBLK, and SmpBELK) and measured the levels of associated SmpB protein by Western blot analysis. This assessment revealed that all of the double- and triple-alanine-substituted SmpB variants had substantially decreased levels of SmpB protein associated with 70 S ribosomes (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–6). The most notable decrease was observed with double alanine variant SmpBEK and the triple alanine variant SmpBELK (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Ribosome association assays. A, Western blot analysis with anti-SmpB antibodies displaying the amount of wild-type SmpB and select SmpB alanine substitution variants associated with 70 S ribosomes in vivo. The SmpB variant expressed in cells from which the ribosomes were purified is indicated on top. B, Coomassie stained SDS-polyacrylamide of samples in panel A, demonstrating that equal amounts of total protein were loaded in each lane. C, bar graphs, representing the mean and S.D. of three independent experiments, display the level of each SmpB variant associated with purified 70 S ribosomes, as compared with wild-type SmpB protein. Wild-type SmpB was used as a positive control, and SmpB59, a nonfunctional truncated SmpB variant, was used as a negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One possible explanation for these findings could be that the substituted proteins are less stable and/or aggregate in the cell. This would lead to lower amounts of SmpB protein available to interact with SsrA RNA and mediate its association with 70 S ribosomes. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the levels of each protein in total cellular extracts and the S30 soluble fractions. We found that, like wild-type SmpB, the alanine-substituted proteins did not aggregate and were not present in the pellet fractions (data not shown). We found the SmpBE31A, SmpBL91A, SmpBK124A, SmpBEL, SmpBEK, and SmpBLK variants to be soluble, as wild-type levels of these substituted proteins were present in S30 extracts (Fig. 4, lanes 3–6, and data not shown). These results demonstrate that the ribosome association defects attributed to these variants were not due to a decrease in the total amount of SmpB protein present in the cells. These findings do suggest, however, that alanine substitutions of these highly conserved residues deter stable association of the SmpB protein with 70 S ribosomes.FIGURE 4Analysis of the expression level of SmpB alanine substitution variants. A, Western blot analysis with anti-SmpB antibodies showing the amount of each SmpB variant present in the soluble S30 extract.

Consistent with our findings for SmpB protein, the level of 70 S ribosome-associated SsrA RNA was diminished in all SmpB variants tested (Fig. 5). The greatest decrease in the level of ribosome associated SsrA RNA was observed with SmpBELK followed by SmpBEK, SmpBLK, and SmpBEL (Fig. 5, A and C). This order corresponds precisely to the observed endogenous tagging phenotypes of these variants. Taken together, these data suggest that the ribosome association defects of the SmpB variants and the dramatic decrease in the levels of ribosome-associated SsrA RNA are most likely responsible for the deficiencies observed in the endogenous tagging assays (Fig. 2).FIGURE 5Ribosome association assays.

Formation of a stable SmpB·SsrA complex is critical for the facilitated delivery of SsrA RNA to stalled ribosomes. Thus, the ability of SmpB to deliver SsrA to stalled ribosomes is directly related to the binding affinity and specificity of SmpB protein for SsrA RNA. To characterize this step in trans-translation, we generated expression constructs of SmpB protein carrying single, double, and triple alanine substitutions of key amino acid residues. Expression and purification of these substituted proteins followed the same basic procedure as for wild-type SmpB protein (see “Materials and Methods”). In all cases the substituted proteins were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity as detected by Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) o"
https://openalex.org/W2018151549,"Crystallographic studies have implicated several residues of the p66 fingers subdomain of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase in contacting the single-stranded template overhang immediately ahead of the DNA polymerase catalytic center. This interaction presumably assists in inducing the appropriate geometry on the template base for efficient and accurate incorporation of the incoming dNTP. To investigate this, we introduced nucleoside analogs either individually or in tandem into the DNA template ahead of the catalytic center and investigated whether they induce pausing of the replication machinery before serving as the template base. Analogs included abasic tetrahydrofuran linkages, neutralizing methylphosphonate linkages, and conformationally locked nucleosides. In addition, several Phe-61 mutants were included in our analysis, based on previous data indicating that altering this residue affects both strand displacement synthesis and the fidelity of DNA synthesis. We demonstrate here that altering the topology of the template strand two nucleotides ahead of the catalytic center can interrupt DNA synthesis. Mutating Phe-61 to either Ala or Leu accentuates this defect, whereas replacement with an aromatic residue (Trp) allows the mutant enzyme to bypass the template analogs with relative ease."
https://openalex.org/W2009076560,"Argos, a secreted antagonist of Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (dEGFR) signaling, acts by sequestering the activating ligand Spitz. To understand how different domains in Argos contribute to efficient Spitz sequestration, we performed a genetic screen aimed at uncovering modifiers of an Argos misexpression phenotype in the developing eye. We identified a series of suppressors mapping to the Argos transgene that affect its activity in multiple developmental contexts. These point mutations map to both the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions, implicating both domains in Argos function. We show by surface plasmon resonance that these Argos mutants are deficient in their ability to bind Spitz in vitro. Our data indicate that a mere ∼2-fold decrease in KD is sufficient to compromise Argos activity in vivo. This effect could be recapitulated in a cell-based assay, where a higher molar concentration of mutant Argos was needed to inhibit Spitz-dependent dEGFR phosphorylation. In contrast, a ∼37-fold decrease in the binding constant nearly abolishes Argos activity in vivo and in cellular assays. In agreement with previously reported computational studies, our results define an affinity threshold for optimal Argos inhibition of dEGFR signaling during development.

Remarkably, this versatility is accomplished with a single receptor (dEGFR) and four activating ligands: Spitz (Spi), Gurken, Keren, and Vein. The functional diversity of dEGFR signaling has been partially attributed to the differential use of ligands throughout development (8Shilo B.Z.

Interestingly, no knock-out phenotype or expression pattern has been reported for the fourth ligand, Keren (21Reich A. Shilo B.Z. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4287-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to the four agonists, the Drosophila EGF receptor signaling system includes two extracellular inhibitors, which function in negative feedback loops to antagonize dEGFR signaling. Kekkon 1 is a transmembrane molecule of the leucine-rich repeat-immunoglobulin (LIG) superfamily that attenuates dEGFR activity via a direct interaction (22Ghiglione C. Carraway 3rd, K.L.

Genetics. 2004; 167: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Argos (Aos) is a secreted molecule that was initially proposed to bind and inhibit dEGFR by virtue of its atypical EGF domain (24Freeman M. Klambt C. Goodman C.S. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 963-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Recent work, however, has demonstrated that Aos instead exerts its antagonistic effect on dEGFR signaling by sequestering the activating ligand Spi, although its effect on the remaining three ligands has not yet been reported (25Klein D.E. Nappi V.M. Reeves G.T. Shvartsman S.Y. Lemmon M.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Aos was also shown to associate with the surface of cultured S2 cells in an interaction that is dissociable with excess soluble heparin (25Klein D.E. Nappi V.M. Reeves G.T. Shvartsman S.Y. Lemmon M.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism for Aos activity in vivo. However, the functional and physiological significance of this finding remains unclear. Structurally, Aos is composed of N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions (NCR and CCR, respectively), separated by a largely unconserved linker. The NCR, which contains 4 cysteines, has no known direct function, and misexpression of this domain alone displays no biological activity. The CCR includes 12 cysteines (see Fig. 1B) and contains a putative EGF-like domain (residues 363-424) (24Freeman M. Klambt C. Goodman C.S. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 963-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Misexpression of the entire CCR from Aos (residues 225-444) displays partial activity in vivo and is sufficient for binding Spi in vitro (albeit with a ∼20-fold decreased affinity) (25Klein D.E. Nappi V.M. Reeves G.T. Shvartsman S.Y. Lemmon M.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Howes R. Wasserman J.D. Freeman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4275-4281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, misexpression of the putative EGF-like domain alone does not rescue Aos mutant phenotypes (26Howes R. Wasserman J.D. Freeman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4275-4281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), arguing that (if it does adopt an EGF-like fold) it is not sufficient for Aos function. Aos participates in multiple developmental processes where it is expressed as a “high threshold” gene, in response to high levels of Spi-induced dEGFR signaling (27Wasserman J.D. Freeman M. Cell. 1998; 95: 355-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 28Golembo M. Schweitzer R. Freeman M. Shilo B.Z. Development. 1996; 122: 223-230PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with its role as an inhibitor of dEGFR signaling, Aos knock-outs exhibit phenotypes typical of dEGFR gain-of-function mutants, and Aos misexpression inhibits dEGFR signaling (26Howes R. Wasserman J.D. Freeman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4275-4281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Freeman M. Development. 1994; 120: 2297-2304PubMed Google Scholar). Aos contributes importantly to the spatio-temporal regulation of dEGFR signaling through its participation in a negative feedback loop as a result of Spi-dependent dEGFR signaling. For example, Aos is required for the proper timing of pulsations during oenocyte delamination (30Brodu V. Elstob P.R. Gould A.P. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 885-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Aos has also been described as a long range inhibitor during eye development (and other tissues), acting to ensure the formation of steep Spi gradients close to the source of Spi production (31Freeman M. Development. 1997; 124: 261-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent computational studies have proposed two key roles for Aos in dEGFR signaling based on a model of the dEGFR/Spi/Aos module in embryonic ventral ectoderm patterning (32Reeves G.T. Kalifa R. Klein D.E. Lemmon M.A. Shvartsman S.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). First, sequestration by Aos limits the spatial range of Spi action. Second, the Aos negative feedback loop counteracts fluctuations in gene dosage (Spi secretion rate and dEGFR levels), imparting robustness to the system (32Reeves G.T. Kalifa R. Klein D.E. Lemmon M.A. Shvartsman S.Y. Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One important prediction of the model was that Spi sequestration by Aos must be nearly irreversible (or of very high affinity) to provide a robust feedback loop. As such, an increase in the off rate would result in a loss of robustness, although this remains to be tested experimentally. To test the prediction that even small reductions in Spi/Aos affinity cannot be tolerated and to investigate the domain requirements for Aos activity, we screened for mutations in an Aos transgene that suppress the strong misexpression phenotype caused in the developing eye (29Freeman M. Development. 1994; 120: 2297-2304PubMed Google Scholar). We report the identification of a series of point mutations in Aos that reduce or impair its activity in multiple tissues. These lesions map to both the NCR and CCR regions, demonstrating that both modules are necessary for Aos function in vivo. We have also correlated reductions in the phenotypic strength of Aos mutants with decreases in their in vitro binding affinity for Spi. Whereas a mere ∼2-fold reduction in affinity appears to be sufficient to reduce the effectiveness of Aos as a dEGFR inhibitor, a ∼37-fold decrease in affinity greatly compromises its activity. We also show that these mutants are correspondingly less efficient in abolishing Spi-dependent dEGFR phosphorylation in cellular studies. Our data thus show that both the NCR and CCR in Aos are necessary for establishing a high affinity complex with Spi, which is critical for imparting dEGFR signaling robustness. Identification of Aos Orthologs—Publicly available genome sequences were searched using the tblastn algorithm for sequences related to Aos. Sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW1.8 (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/multi-align/multi-align.html) and prepared for publication using the BOX-SHADE server (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). Genetics—P{GAL4-ninaE.GMR}, P{UAS-aos}/CyO flies were generated by standard recombination methods from the individual P insertions. The males were mutagenized with 25 mm EMS (33Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Handbook. Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) and crossed to w; iso2; iso3 females at 27 °C. P{GAL4-ninaE.GMR}, P{UAS-aos} progeny were screened for suppression of the rough eye phenotype (see Fig. 2). Suppressors affecting activity of P{GAL4-ninaE.GMR} were identified by crossing them to P{UAS-egfrDN}/CyO and were subsequently discarded. Suppressors that retained GAL4 activity were balanced and characterized further by mapping, sequencing, Western analysis, and misexpression with embryonic and wing drivers (Tubulin-GAL4 and MS1096-GAL4). For embryonic activity, suppressor lines (UAS-aos*/CyO) were crossed to the Tubulin-GAL4/CyO strain, and percentage of viability was calculated as 100× (# flies with straight wing)/.5(# flies with curly wing). For rescue analysis, a sev-GAL4 driver was combined with each of the represented UAS-aos loss of function alleles (see Fig. 5) and then introduced into an aos null background (aosΔ7/Df(3L)Exel6129). For scanning electron microscopy of the adult eye, the females were dehydrated in an increasing ethanol: dH2O series, as described by Tio et al. (18Tio M. Ma C. Moses K. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sequence and Western Blot Analysis of aos Alleles—For each putative loss of function allele genomic DNA was isolated from 10-20 adult flies with Qiagen DNeasy columns (Qiagen). The aos transgene was then amplified by PCR, purified by gel extraction (Qiagen), and sequenced using cycle sequencing according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). At least two independent rounds of genomic DNA purification, PCR, and sequencing were carried out for each allele. For Western analysis, ovaries from four females misexpressing the suppressors during stages 9-11 in the follicle cells (CY2-GAL4, UAS-aos) were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline, transferred into 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline +25 μl of 4× sample buffer on ice, and homogenized. 15 μl of each sample was loaded on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with anti-Aos (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 1:100, stripped, and reprobed with anti-α-tubulin (12G10; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 1:5000 as a loading control. Molecular Cloning and Protein Production—Full-length Aos was amplified by PCR, incorporating a SpeI restriction site in the 5′ primer and a His6 tag followed by a NotI restriction site in the 3′ primer, and subcloned into pFastbac (Invitrogen) giving pFbAosHis. Aos mutants were generated by QuikChange (Stratagene) using pFb-AosHis as a template. Baculoviruses encoding different Aos alleles were generated and amplified according to the manufacturer's instructions. For protein purification, 1 liter of Sf9 cells were infected with each corresponding baculovirus (except AosV146D, which required 2-2.5 liters) for 3 days. Conditioned medium was dialyzed against 12 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and flowed through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column with a 2-ml bed volume (Qiagen). The column was washed with 25 ml of 20 mm imidazole in buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl), and protein was eluted in 5 ml of 300 mm imidazole/buffer A. The eluted protein was concentrated and further purified by gel filtration using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl. Secreted His-tagged Spi (amino acids 1-128) was purified from transfected S2 cells as described previously (25Klein D.E. Nappi V.M. Reeves G.T. Shvartsman S.Y. Lemmon M.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using absorbance at 280 nm. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—SPR experiments were performed on a BIAcore 3000. Spi was immobilized onto a CM5 sensorchip by standard amine coupling using 10 mm acetate, pH 5.5, for preloading the CM-dextran surface. Purified Aos mutants were flowed over the Spi-containing sensorchip from lower to higher concentrations at 10 μl/min. The sensorchip was regenerated after running each sample with 10 mm glycine, pH 3, and 1 m NaCl. Binding curves were generated by normalizing the total response units at equilibrium against the maximal saturation response (Bmax) and plotting them as a function of protein concentration. Curves were fit to a single-site binding model using the program Prism, from which the KD values were derived. The experiments were done at least three times, generating error bars and standard error values. The experiments were also carried out by flowing protein from higher to lower concentration, yielding slightly higher KD values (likely because of sample aggregation and incomplete regeneration), but similar wild type to mutant ratios. Activation Studies— dEGFR activation assays in S2 cells were performed as described previously (25Klein D.E. Nappi V.M. Reeves G.T. Shvartsman S.Y. Lemmon M.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, dEGFR-expressing D2f cells (kindly provided by Benny Shilo) were serum-starved overnight, and dEGFR production was induced with 60 μm CuSO4 for 3 h. The cells were incubated on ice with purified Spi alone or in the presence of the indicated amount of purified Aos proteins for 10 min. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS with phosphatase and protease inhibitors), and lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with anti-pY20 (Santa Cruz), stripped, and reprobed with anti-dEGFR as a loading control (23Alvarado D. Rice A.H. Duffy J.B. Genetics. 2004; 167: 187-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Isolation of Mutations Affecting Aos Activity—Aos was first described in D. melanogaster as an antagonistic ligand of dEGFR with an atypical EGF motif that was hypothesized to direct its association with dEGFR and preclude Spi binding (24Freeman M. Klambt C. Goodman C.S. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 963-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that Aos inhibits dEGFR signaling by binding to the activating ligand Spi rather than associating with the receptor itself (25Klein D.E. Nappi V.M. Reeves G.T. Shvartsman S.Y. Lemmon M.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), bringing the significance of the atypical EGF-like domain in Aos into question. As pointed out by Howes et al. (26Howes R. Wasserman J.D. Freeman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4275-4281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), sequences outside the putative EGF motif of Aos are strongly conserved in the house fly Musca domestica (representing an evolutionary distance of ∼100 million years) and are required for Aos function in vivo, further suggesting that more than just the putative EGF-like domain is required for Aos function. We have expanded upon these observations by identifying Aos orthologs outside the dipteran lineage (Fig. 1). We found Aos orthologs in two additional arthropods, the honeybee Apis mellifera and the beetle Tribolium castaneum, indicating conservation of Aos over a span of ∼500 million years. We were unable to identify Aos orthologs in vertebrates, suggesting that, like the dEGFR inhibitor Kekkon1, the existence of Aos is phylogenetically restricted (35MacLaren C.M. Evans T.A. Alvarado D. Duffy J.B. Dev. Genes Evol. 2004; 214: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Gur G. Rubin C. Katz M. Amit I. Citri A. Nilsson J. Amariglio N. Henriksson R. Rechavi G. Hedman H. Wides R. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3270-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation in Aos extends well beyond the boundaries of the putative EGF motif and reveals two strongly conserved regions (Fig. 1) that we term the NCR and CCR, which are separated by a region of variable length. The NCR and CCR are defined primarily by sets of 4 and 12 conserved cysteines, respectively. Previous studies have indicated that the CCR represents the primary ligand-binding domain and can provide a measure of activity in vivo (25Klein D.E. Nappi V.M. Reeves G.T. Shvartsman S.Y. Lemmon M.A. Nature. 2004; 430: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 26Howes R. Wasserman J.D. Freeman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4275-4281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, no direct functionality has been ascribed to the NCR. Given these regions of strong sequence conservation and the reported function of Aos as a “Spi sink,” we sought to investigate the contributions of each domain to Aos function. We therefore carried out a screen for mutations that disrupt the ability of an Aos transgene to affect eye development upon misexpression, as diagrammed in Fig. 2A. During eye development Aos limits Spi availability, thus attenuating dEGFR signaling and preventing the specification of excess photoreceptors (24Freeman M. Klambt C. Goodman C.S. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 69: 963-975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Freeman M. Development. 1994; 120: 2297-2304PubMed Google Scholar, 31Freeman M. Development. 1997; 124: 261-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in the dosage of aos (and consequently dEGFR activity) are readily observed as disruptions in the highly organized array of facets in the adult compound eye. Misexpression of an Aos transgene in the developing eye (using GMR-GAL4) leads to inhibition of dEGFR signaling (presumably through sequestration of Spi) and causes a severe loss of photoreceptors and morphological defects in the adult eye (Figs. 2A and 3B) (37Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 39Taguchi A. Sawamoto K. Okano H. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1639-1648PubMed Google Scholar). Reducing transgene activity would restore normal morphology to the eye and thus provides a means to identify mutations in Aos that impair its activity in vivo. To carry out a screen for functionally defective aos transgenes, we utilized the GAL4/UAS system (37Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Duffy J.B. Genesis. 2002; 34: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In this bipartite expression system, regulation of the transgene of interest, here aos, is controlled by UASs bound by the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4. Drosophila strains expressing GAL4 in specific spatio-temporal patterns are then used to direct UAS transgene expression in the tissue of interest. For this screen we generated a recombinant fly strain with the UAS-aos transgene under the control of a GAL4 line, P{GAL4-ninaE.GMR}, that drives GAL4 expression (and thus Aos misexpression) in the developing eye. This strain, referred to as GMR>aos+, was mutagenized and outcrossed, and the progeny were screened for suppression of the eye defects associated with Aos misexpression (Fig. 2A). In addition to recovering mutations in the aos transgene, the primary focus of this work, we anticipated the recovery of two additional classes of mutations that would also suppress the GMR>aos+ eye phenotype shown in Fig. 3B. Mutations in the GAL4 driver would prevent misexpression of the aos transgene and thus revert the associated eye phenotype. These mutations were identified as progeny that failed to show eye defects when combined with a distinct UAS responder transgene, here a dominant negative version of dEGFR (UAS-dEGFRDN), and were discarded (Fig. 2A). Progeny that retained an intact GMR-GAL4 driver (and thus Aos misexpression) were further characterized. Mutations in genes essential for Aos function might also be recovered and as such would be unlinked to the UAS-aos transgene (38Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 39Taguchi A. Sawamoto K. Okano H. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1639-1648PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation and characterization of 16 mutations linked to the aos transgene that resulted in suppression of the misexpression phenotype in the eye (Table 1 and Figs. 2B and 3). Of these 16 lines, 15 showed strong suppression in the eye, consistent with minimal Aos function. The remaining mutant (aos334, identified as AosP372S below) showed only partial suppression in the eye (Table 1 and Fig. 3C), suggesting that it retained moderate activity. In addition to its function in the eye, Aos has been implicated in regulating dEGFR signaling in other contexts, including wing development and embryogenesis (13Golembo M. Raz E. Shilo B.Z. Development. 1996; 122: 3363-3370PubMed Google Scholar, 34Schweitzer R. Howes R. Smith R. Shilo B.Z. Freeman M. Nature. 1995; 376: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Suppressor activity was assessed in these two contexts as well, using wing-specific (MS1096-GAL4) and ubiquitous (Tubulin-GAL4) drivers. Misexpression of wild type aos with MS1096-GAL4 leads to a loss of wing veins, whereas embryonic misexpression with Tubulin-GAL4 results in lethality. All of the mutated aos transgenes showed similar activity profiles in other tissues (Table 1), indicating that the suppressor lines from which they were derived did not have tissue-specific alterations. The one exception to this is aosP372S, which showed only partial suppression in the eye (and in viability) but apparently strong suppression in the wing (Table 1).TABLE 1Molecular and genetic characterization of aos mutantsLineNucleotide changeAmino acid changeAllelic classActivityEyeaActivity based on the severity of the rough eye phenotype when the UAS-aos allele is combined with the GMR-GAL4 driver. ++ indicates a severe rough eye phenotype, whereas + and - indicate moderate or weak phenotypes, respectivelyWingbPercentage of wings with gap in the L4 vein when the UAS-aos allele is combined with the MS1096-GAL4 driver.
