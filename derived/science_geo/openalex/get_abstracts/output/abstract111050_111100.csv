https://openalex.org/W2054225000,"Spontaneous local increases in the concentration of intracellular calcium, called ""calcium sparks,"" were detected in quiescent rat heart cells with a laser scanning confocal microscope and the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3. Estimates of calcium flux associated with the sparks suggest that calcium sparks result from spontaneous openings of single sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium-release channels, a finding supported by ryanodine-dependent changes of spark kinetics. At resting intracellular calcium concentrations, these SR calcium-release channels had a low rate of opening (approximately 0.0001 per second). An increase in the calcium content of the SR, however, was associated with a fourfold increase in opening rate and resulted in some sparks triggering propagating waves of increased intracellular calcium concentration. The calcium spark is the consequence of elementary events underlying excitation-contraction coupling and provides an explanation for both spontaneous and triggered changes in the intracellular calcium concentration in the mammalian heart."
https://openalex.org/W1963791094,"Microdomains of high intracellular calcium ion concentration, [Ca2+]i, have been hypothesized to occur in living cells exposed to stimuli that generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Mitochondrially targeted recombinant aequorin was used to show that IP3-induced Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores caused increases of mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]m, the speed and amplitude of which are not accounted for by the relatively small increases in mean [Ca2+]i. A similar response was obtained by the addition of IP3 to permeabilized cells but not by perfusion of cells with Ca2+ at concentrations similar to those measured in intact cells. It is concluded that in vivo, domains of high [Ca2+]i are transiently generated close to IP3-gated channels and sensed by nearby mitochondria; this may provide an efficient mechanism for optimizing mitochondrial activity upon cell stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2010117150,"The molecular pathogenesis of diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL), the most frequent and clinically relevant type of lymphoma, is unknown. A gene was cloned from chromosomal translocations affecting band 3q27, which are common in DLCL. This gene, BCL-6, codes for a 79-kilodalton protein that is homologous with zinc finger-transcription factors. In 33 percent (13 of 39) of DLCL samples, but not in other types of lymphoid malignancies, the BCL-6 gene is truncated within its 5' noncoding sequences, suggesting that its expression is deregulated. Thus, BCL-6 may be a proto-oncogene specifically involved in the pathogenesis of DLCL."

https://openalex.org/W2053144375,"Recognition of objects from their visual images is a key function of the primate brain. This recognition is not a template matching between the input image and stored images like the vision in lower animals but is a flexible process in which considerable change in images, resulting from different illumination, viewing angle, and articulation of the object, can be tolerated. Recent experimental findings about the representation of object images in the inferotemporal cortex, a brain structure that is thought to be essential for object vision, are summarized and discussed in relation to the computational frames proposed for object recognition."

https://openalex.org/W1518531861,"One of the major obstacles in investigating in vivo proteolytic phenomena has been the inaccessibility to spatial information as to where in the tissue the reaction proceeds because the orthodox method employing electrophoretic analysis requires homogenization of samples and thus results in loss of such spatial information. To overcome this technical drawback, we have developed methodology to produce antibodies that specifically distinguish a proteolyzed form of a given protein from its intact form. Here we describe our immunohistochemical observation of calpain-catalyzed fodrin proteolysis in postischemic gerbil hippocampus, using an antibody exclusively specific to the proteolyzed 150-kDa form of fodrin alpha subunit. Our data establish a novel discovery that transient (10 min) global forebrain ischemia followed by reperfusion induces at least two distinct phases of fodrin proteolysis in hippocampus: an early phase in molecular layer and in stratum oriens of CA3 and CA1 sectors within 15 min and a late drastic and persistent phase in the entire CA1 after 4-24 h. The former may be one of the early events initiating the complex cascade leading to the delayed neuronal death, while the latter should be considered as a more direct cause for the actual degeneration in CA1."

The design was for an amphipathic α helix with a ""flat"" hydrophobic surface that would interact with a transmembrane protein as a detergent. When mixed with peptide, 85 percent of bacteriorhodopsin and 60 percent of rhodopsin remained in solution over a period of 2 days in their native forms. The crystal structure of peptide alone showed it to form an antiparallel four-helix bundle in which monomers interact, flat surface to flat surface, as predicted."
https://openalex.org/W1616865676,"The molecular cues that control patterning of the heart tube during early cardiogenesis are largely unknown. The present study has explored the embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation system to determine if this in vitro model could be useful in studying the process of regional specification of cardiac muscle cells at the earliest possible stages. As assessed by polymerase chain reaction, ribonuclease protection, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical analyses, ES cell differentiation into embryoid bodies is characterized by the transcriptional and translational activation of the ventricular regulatory (phosphorylatable) myosin light chain gene, demonstrating that ventricular specification occurs during ES cell cardiogenesis. The finding of a ventricular-specific marker in an in vitro system in the absence of an intact heart tube provides evidence for cardiac regional specification independent of positional cues or physiologic stimuli. The temporal expression of the myogenic regulatory factors, myogenin and MyoD, suggests activation of the skeletal muscle program following cardiac myogenesis in vitro, indicating temporal fidelity to the progression of in vivo myogenesis. These data establish the mouse embryonic stem cell system as a model for cardiac chamber specification and suggest a promising approach in the study of regional specification in genetically engineered cardiac muscle cells."

https://openalex.org/W1487005519,"The human thromboxane A2 gene, present as a single copy, spans over 15 kilobases (kb) and contains 3 exons divided by 2 introns. The first intron, intron 1, exists in the 5'-noncoding region, 83 base pairs upstream from the ATG start site and is 6.3 kb long. Intron 2 with a length of 4.3 kb is located at the end of the sixth transmembrane region, thereby separating it from the downstream coding sequences including the seventh transmembrane region and the 3'-untranslated region. By rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends, transcription initiation sites starting in two different putative promoter regions were determined. In the 5'-flanking region of these transcription initiation sites, no typical TATA box exists. The major promoter, the promoter region I, contains four potential SP-1 binding sites and several potential binding sites for other transcription factors. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, a small portion of the RNA transcribed from this gene was shown to contain an additional 115-base pair long noncoding exon, exon 1b, which is located in intron 1. No additional exon in intron 2 was detectable, indicating that a single type of thromboxane A2 receptor protein is encoded by this gene. Chromosomal localization was carried out by fluorescence in situ hybridization of cloned genomic DNA to the metaphase chromosome. The gene was assigned to 19p13.3 of human chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1926746605,"Abstract The Ca2+ content of the intracellular Ca2+ stores controls the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) in the clonal cell line A7r5. This regulation was characterized with respect to the understanding of the release phenomenon. Independent of the loading protocol used, increasing the Ca2+ content of the stores increased the sensitivity of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-induced Ca2+ release until a Ca2+ content of about 30% of the steady-state value was reached. Loading of the stores to higher levels had only a marginal effect on the Ca2+ release. The effects of luminal Ca2+ were still observed in the presence of 10 mM BAPTA (1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), excluding the possibility that luminal Ca2+ acted indirectly via cytoplasmic binding sites. Conditions were developed to simultaneously measure [3H]InsP3 binding to the InsP3R and the 45Ca2+ content of the stores in the same cells. [3H]InsP3 binding to a high affinity binding site was potentiated by luminal Ca2+. Analysis at the molecular level revealed the simultaneous expression of different splice variants of InsP3R-I, as well as the expression of InsP3R-III, and of the putative InsP3R-IV. We conclude that the control of the InsP3R by luminal Ca2+ could account for quantal release and that the observed heterogeneity of the InsP3R may also contribute to this behavior, especially at high levels of store loading."

https://openalex.org/W1536995103,"One of the final events in cornification of epidermal cells is processing of profilaggrin to the keratin-associated protein filaggrin. Processing involves several proteolytic events and occurs in two discrete proteolytic stages (Resing, K. A., Walsh, K. A., and Dale, B. A. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 1372-1378; Resing, K. A., Walsh, K. A., Haugen-Scofield, J., and Dale, B. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1837-1846). In a keratinocyte cell line derived from newborn rat epidermis, these two stages are independently regulated. Profilaggrin was expressed when the cells reached confluence; processing to intermediates began 24-36 h later (stage one), with filaggrin appearing at 48 h (stage two). Stage two processing required calcium in the medium with maximum processing occurring at 5-10 mM. Furthermore, stage two processing was inhibited by nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, suggesting that calcium influx activates this event. Second-stage processing was also inhibited by the protease inhibitor leupeptin, implicating calpain. Confluent cells had higher levels of calpain I than subconfluent cells; in confluent cells, two immunoreactive bands were detected, comigrating with inactive (80 kDa) and activated (78 kDa) calpain I. In cells processing profilaggrin, most of the calpain I was in the 78-kDa form, implying extensive activation, supporting a role for calpain in processing."
https://openalex.org/W1493302758,"The lectin from Eranthis hyemalis has been previously characterized as consisting of two polypeptide chains covalently linked by disulfide bond(s) (Cammue, B. P., Peeters, B., and Peumans, W. J. (1985) Biochem. J. 227, 949-955). We have further characterized the biochemical properties of the lectin and demonstrated that it possesses the property of inhibition of protein synthesis using in vitro eukaryotic translation systems. The protein also possesses antiviral activity against the plant virus, alfalfa mosaic virus, and larvicidal activity against the southern corn rootworm, Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii, a major insect pest of the maize plant. Both isoelectric focusing on gels and chromatofocusing indicated heterogeneity of the protein, with three species having isoelectric points in the range 4-5. The disulfide bond(s) can be rapidly reduced with beta-mercaptoethanol under native conditions. The reduced alkylated polypeptide chains remain associated under native conditions to form a species, EHL', that elutes at the same position as the native protein and has the same molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium experiments. However, circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements indicated conformational differences between the species."
https://openalex.org/W1527586984,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues both in vitro and in vivo. This phosphorylation appears to regulate the rate of receptor desensitization and is associated with AChR clustering induced by the neuronal extracellular matrix protein agrin. To identify the protein tyrosine kinase(s) that phosphorylates the nicotinic receptor, we have used molecular cloning techniques to identify and characterize two protein tyrosine kinases that are highly expressed in Torpedo electric organ, a tissue enriched in synaptic components including the AChR. One of the kinases was identified as the Torpedo homolog of neuronal fyn, whereas the other was a novel kinase we have named fyk due to its homology to both fyn and yes protein tyrosine kinases. Using antibodies to fyn and fyk, Fyn was shown to be a 55-kDa protein phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, whereas Fyk was a 56-kDa/53-kDa doublet phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine residues. At the mRNA and/or protein level, fyn and fyk were present in Torpedo electric organ, skeletal muscle, and brain. Both kinases were detected in the membrane fractions enriched in the AChR, with Fyn and Fyk representing 36 and 8%, respectively, of the protein tyrosine kinase activity in these postsynaptic membranes. In addition, Fyn and Fyk were shown by coimmunoprecipitation to be specifically associated with the AChR. Furthermore, the AChR was phosphorylated in Fyn and Fyk immunoprecipitates. These results indicate that Fyn and Fyk are involved in the regulation of postsynaptic membrane function and suggest that these protein tyrosine kinases may phosphorylate the AChR."

https://openalex.org/W1606919098,"When monolayer cultures of rat hepatocytes are incubated with the ethanolamine/choline analogue, monomethylethanolamine, the secretion of apolipoproteins B100 and B48, as well as the lipid constituents, of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is inhibited by approximately 50% (Vance, J. E. (1991) J. Lipid Res. 32, 1971-1982). In the present study we have investigated the mechanism by which monomethylethanolamine disrupts VLDL secretion. Hepatocytes were treated with 400 microM monomethylethanolamine overnight, which resulted in an increase in the cellular content of the derived phospholipid, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, from 0.32 +/- 0.15 to 2.92 +/- 0.74 nmol/mg of cell protein. The biosynthesis of apoproteins B100 and B48 was not impaired by treatment of cells with monomethylethanolamine. However, monomethylethanolamine decreased by approximately 50% the amount of apoproteins B, but not of the typical secretory protein, albumin, present in the luminal content subfraction of microsomes. The intracellular degradation of apoproteins B was also increased in phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine-enriched, compared with control, cells. Moreover, the pool of apoprotein B present in intact microsomes from hepatocytes incubated with monomethylethanolamine was more accessible to exogenously added trypsin, presumably because a larger pool of the apoprotein B was exposed on the cytosolic surface of these microsomes. The data strongly suggest that an increase in the microsomal content of phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine diminishes the ability of apoprotein B to translocate across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane into the luminal compartment. Consequently, the association of apoprotein B with lipids and/or the normal assembly of mature VLDL particles is impaired."
https://openalex.org/W1592624151,"Several tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the insulin receptor kinase substrate IRS-1 are predicted to be within Tyr-Met-X-Met (YMXM) motifs, and synthetic peptides corresponding to these sequences are excellent substrates for the insulin receptor kinase in vitro (Shoelson, S. E., Chatterjee, S., Chaudhuri, M., and White, M. F. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 2027-2031). In this study, YMXM-containing peptides are shown to act as substrates for two members of the nonreceptor subfamily of tyrosine kinases, v-Src and v-Abl (the transforming gene products of Rous sarcoma virus and Abelson murine leukemia virus, respectively). For v-Src, a baculovirus expression system was used which was capable of producing milligram quantities of pure 60-kDa v-Src in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. The source of v-Abl was an Escherichia coli expression vector that produces a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase with the abl catalytic domain. The synthetic YMXM-containing peptides had among the highest apparent affinities described to date for either tyrosine kinase, with Km values as low as 97 microM for v-Src and v-Abl. Comparisons with the results obtained with the insulin receptor kinase revealed differences in substrate specificity among the enzymes. In particular, v-Src was more tolerant of substitutions at the Met+1 and Met+3 positions in the YMXM motif than either v-Abl or the insulin receptor kinase but was more dependent on the presence of a preceding acidic amino acid. For v-Abl, the presence of threonine at any position in the YMXM motif caused a reduction in catalytic efficiency. Phosphorylated YMXM motifs are recognition elements for binding to the src homology 2 domains of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase and additional proteins; hence, differences in specificity of tyrosine kinases toward YMXM-containing proteins may have relevance to downstream signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W1485323498,"Osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) is a member of the TGF-beta superfamily that is expressed in the nervous system. We recently showed that human recombinant osteogenic protein-1 (hOP-1) strongly promotes the aggregation of dividing neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells, in part by inducing the major isoforms of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) (Perides, G., Safran, R. M., Rueger, D. C., and Charness, M. E. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 10326-10330). Here we show that hOP-1 induces L1 expression approximately 6-fold in NG108-15 cells without changing the levels of N-cadherin, neurofilament 200, Thy-1, tau, and G alpha s. OP-1 induction of L1 and N-CAM was unassociated with changes in cell proliferation and was not reproduced by cellular differentiation. The increased adhesiveness of hOP-1-treated NG108-15 cells could be inhibited in part by Fab fragments of an anti-L1 polyclonal antiserum. L1 and N-CAM expression first increased 12-18 h after hOP-1 treatment, reached a maximum after 2-3 days, persisted for up to 5 days, and returned to control levels 3 days after hOP-1 withdrawal. The increases in L1 and N-CAM protein levels were preceded or accompanied by large increases in the abundance of L1 and all detectable N-CAM mRNAs. Actinomycin D prevented the induction by hOP-1 of L1 and N-CAM mRNAs, suggesting that hOP-1 regulates immunoglobulin CAM gene transcription. OP-1 is the first described growth factor that regulates both N-CAM and L1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1547450960,"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3's (D3) potential mitogenic mechanism of action was pursued in cultured rat hepatic Ito cells, a fibrogenic effector cell which proliferates in vivo during liver injury and fibrogenesis. D3 stimulated Ito cell DNA synthesis and potentiated platelet-derived growth factor-induced mitogenesis. D3's enhancement of [3H]thymidine incorporation was associated with nuclear Egr expression. Recent studies have causally linked the activated proto-oncogene c-Raf with downstream Egr induction. The serine-threonine kinase Raf protein is phosphorylation-activated by a large array of agonists including plasma membrane and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases but has not previously been associated with the steroid superfamily of mediators. To consider potential prenuclear acute pathways of D3-induced stimulation, the activation of Raf was examined following D3 exposure. D3 induced Raf activation as assessed via (a) enhanced Raf phosphorylation following in vivo 32P labeling, (b) enhanced kinase function utilizing exogenous histone 1 protein as substrate, and (c) the shift in Raf physical localization changing from a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution to a perinuclear domain. A similar activation of Raf kinase was found in 3T3 cells exposed to D3 with enhanced histone phosphorylation detectable within 1 min following stimulation. The proximal cascade leading to Raf kinase activation may involve a protein kinase activity was severely attenuated by stimulated kinase activity was severely attenuated by previous phorbol ester treatment for 20 h or staurosporine pretreatment."

https://openalex.org/W2025567944,"The γδ resolvase protein is one of a large family of transposon-encoded site-specific recombinases. It performs recombination in a DNA-protein complex that contains 12 resolvase protomers and two copies of the 120-base pair DNA substrate, res (each with three binding sites for a resolvase dimer). A derivative of resolvase with altered DNA binding specificity was used to show that the role of resolvase at site I, which contains the crossover point, differs from its role at the other two binding sites. The resolvase dimers that initially bind to site I are the only ones that require the residue Ser10, essential for catalysis of DNA breakage. In addition, these site I-bound dimers do not use a specific interaction between dimers that is required elsewhere in the complex for synapsis of the res sites."
https://openalex.org/W1572267015,"Calmodulin (CaM) and the cardiac isoform of troponin C (cTnC) are close structural homologs, but cTnC cannot activate most CaM target enzymes. To investigate structure-function relationships, we constructed a series of CaM.cTnC chimeras and determined their ability to bind Ca2+ and activate CaM target enzymes. Previously, we exchanged domain 1 and found that the chimeras exhibited profoundly impaired activation of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) and had differential effects on other CaM target enzymes (George, S. E., VanBerkum, M. F. A., Ono, T., Cook, R., Hanley, R. M., Putkey, J. A., and Means, A. R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9228-9235). One of the domain 1 chimeras was a potent competitive inhibitor of smMLCK. We now extend our study of CaM.cTnC chimeras by exchanging all of the remaining functional domains of CaM and cTnC. We determined the ability of the chimeras to bind Ca2+ and activate phosphodiesterase (PDE) and smMLCK. Chimeras containing both domains 3 and 4 of cTnC exhibited high affinity Ca2+ binding that was indistinguishable from cTnC, whereas chimeras containing either domain 3 or 4 of cTnC demonstrated Ca2+ affinity that was intermediate between CaM and cTnC. All of the CaM.cTnC chimeras showed near-maximal PDE activation but required 5-775-fold higher concentrations than CaM to produce half-maximal PDE activation. In contrast, all of the chimeras showed impaired ability to activate smMLCK, and some were potent competitive inhibitors of smMLCK activation by CaM."
https://openalex.org/W1498369662,"The gel mobility-shift assay is an important tool for the study of protein-nucleic acid interactions. High detection sensitivity is typically attained by radioisotopic labeling of the target nucleic acid fragments. A novel fluorescence methodology offers significant advantages over this conventional approach. Ethidium, thiazole orange, and oxazole yellow homodimers form stable, highly fluorescent complexes with double-stranded DNA that can be detected in gels by a laser-excited, confocal, fluorescence scanning system with a sensitivity higher than that attainable with radioisotopic labeling. We describe here the use of these dyes in a gel-mobility assay to detect complexes of a truncation of the Kluyveromyces lactis heat shock transcription factor, containing the trimerization and DNA-binding domains (HSFDT), with target DNA. At an appropriate molar DNA base pair to dye ratio, the labeling of a DNA fragment with dimeric dye did not affect the binding to HSFDT. The detection of the fluorescent-dye labeled HSFDT-DNA complexes with the laser scanner achieves a spatial resolution far superior to that of conventional autoradiography and permits analysis of multimer protein-DNA complexes that are not resolved by traditional detection methods. We have used this technique to demonstrate that HSF forms multimeric complexes on DNA by addition of trimeric units. The latter conclusion is based on an analysis of the mobilities of the multiple HSFDT-DNA complexes and on a two-color mobility-shift fluorescence assay that uses a mutant of HSFDT engineered for site-specific labeling with fluorescein and target DNA labeled with an energy transfer dye, thiazole orange-thiazole blue heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W1603850645,"Mutant human initiator tRNA genes carrying changes in each of the three features unique to eukaryotic initiator tRNAs have been constructed, and introduced into CV-1 monkey kidney cells using SV40 virus vectors. The mutant tRNA genes are expressed, and the mutant tRNAs can all be aminoacylated with both rabbit liver and Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetases. Based on aminoacylation levels, the tRNAs are expressed to 5-15-fold over the level of endogenous initiator tRNA. The activity of the mutant [35S]methionyl-tRNAs in initiation was studied in rabbit reticulocyte and wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis systems programmed with various mRNAs. Initiation is studied by using a mRNA that codes for a protein whose N-terminal methionine is stable and not removed by methionine aminopeptidase. Changing the A1:U72 base pair to a G1:C72 base pair greatly reduced activity of the tRNA in initiation. Changing the three consecutive G:C base pairs (G29G30G31:C39C40C41) in the anticodon stem to those found in elongator methionine tRNA also reduced initiation activity. Interestingly, changing the A54 and A60 residues in loop IV to T54 and U60 had less of an effect on activity. The tRNA with changes in all three conserved features had virtually no activity in initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1576053596,"We report the purification from bovine brain cytosol of a 110-kDa phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC-110) that was markedly stimulated by G-protein beta gamma-subunits. The enzyme was purified approximately 2000-fold with a yield of 4%. On the basis of size and immunological cross-reactivity, PLC-110 was distinct from 150-kDa PLC-beta 1, 145-kDa PLC-gamma 1, and 85-kDa PLC-delta 1. An antiserum to a peptide corresponding to a conserved PLC Y domain sequence cross-reacted with PLC-110. PLC-110 was also recognized by two antisera selective for NH2-terminal and internal sequences in PLC-beta 3, but not by a third peptide antiserum to the COOH terminus of this enzyme, suggesting that PLC-110 is related to PLC-beta 3. Reconstitution of purified PLC-110 with beta gamma-subunits produced greater than 100-fold activation, indicating activation was observed at approximately 60 nM beta gamma and full activation at approximately 500 nM beta gamma. PLC-110 maximally hydrolyzed phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at 1 microM Ca2+, but showed no activity toward phosphatidylinositol at Ca2+ concentrations up to 1 mM. Concentrations of purified guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-liganded alpha q that fully activated PLC-beta 1 failed to stimulate PLC-110. This observation indicates that the site at which beta gamma interacts with PLC-110 is distinct from that at which alpha q regulates the activity of PLC-beta isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1547357196,"Although human IgG2 is not cytophilic, we have shown previously that an IgG2 antibody expressing the sequence PLLGG (underline = substitution) spanning CH2 domain residues 233-237 (Eu numbering) displayed IgG1-like Fc gamma RI binding activity. In contrast, IgG1 PLLGG exhibited 3-fold less affinity, whereas IgG2 ELLGG was 3-fold more active than native IgG1. These results suggested that additional site(s) conferred enhanced binding properties to the engineered, cytophilic IgG2 variant. These sites were shown to reside in the IgG2 CH2 domain, since the IgG1 CH2 module did not have enhanced activity in a panel of hybrid IgG1/IgG2 antibodies. To map these sites further, human IgG1 and IgG2 constant region gene segments were modified to allow reciprocal COOH-terminal half segment exchanges of CH2 exons. These were cloned into a pSV2neo expression vector bearing a rearranged MOPC 315 heavy chain variable region gene and transfected into a MOPC 315 heavy chain deletion mutant. The dinitrophenol affinity-purified IgGs were radiolabeled and assessed for Fc gamma RI binding activity in direct binding assays using U937 cells. The COOH terminus of the IgG2 CH2 domain was found to contain accessory site(s) since it enhanced the binding properties of both IgG1 PLLGG and native IgG1. In contrast, grafting of the COOH terminus of the IgG1 CH2 domain onto IgG2 PLLGG and IgG2 ELLGG diminished their cytophilic activity. The amino acid responsible for the enhancing properties of the COOH terminus of the IgG2 CH2 domain was shown to be threonine 339, since IgG1 PLLGG/Thr339 displayed increased Fc gamma RI binding affinity. Kinetics studies revealed that this is accomplished through an increase in the forward rate constant of the IgG-Fc gamma RI interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2111585912,"Abstract The initiation of DNA replication by phage lambda depends on a specialized nucleoprotein structure that provides for the precise localization and activity of the Escherichia coli DnaB helicase at the lambda replication origin. Previous work has shown that the DnaJ and DnaK heat shock proteins function in the initiation pathway by releasing the DnaB helicase from the initiation complex to carry out localized unwinding of origin DNA. This DnaJ.DnaK pathway results in mainly unidirectional DNA unwinding and replication, whereas replication in vivo is mainly bidirectional. Based on recent replication work indicating an important role for the GrpE heat shock protein, we have used electron microscopy to study the action of GrpE in the DNA unwinding and replication reactions. We have found that GrpE acts with DnaJ and DnaK to facilitate the unwinding reaction at low concentrations of DnaK. In the presence of GrpE, bidirectional unwinding occurs in approximately half of the unwound DNA molecules. In addition, GrpE significantly increases the frequency of replication proceeding leftward from the origin. We suggest that reactions including GrpE result in more complete disassembly of the preinitiation nucleoprotein structure, thus allowing replication to proceed in both directions from the origin."
