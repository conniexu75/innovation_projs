https://openalex.org/W3027204812,"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made the development of a vaccine a top biomedical priority. In this study, we developed a series of DNA vaccine candidates expressing different forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and evaluated them in 35 rhesus macaques. Vaccinated animals developed humoral and cellular immune responses, including neutralizing antibody titers at levels comparable to those found in convalescent humans and macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. After vaccination, all animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2, and the vaccine encoding the full-length S protein resulted in &gt;3.1 and &gt;3.7 log 10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa, respectively, as compared with viral loads in sham controls. Vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody titers correlated with protective efficacy, suggesting an immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates."

A key unanswered question is whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in protective immunity against reexposure. We developed a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed that macaques had high viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, humoral and cellular immune responses, and pathologic evidence of viral pneumonia. After the initial viral clearance, animals were rechallenged with SARS-CoV-2 and showed 5 log 10 reductions in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa compared with after the primary infection. Anamnestic immune responses after rechallenge suggested that protection was mediated by immunologic control. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced protective immunity against reexposure in nonhuman primates."
https://openalex.org/W3024607230,"In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Wuhan (Hubei province, China)1; it soon spread across the world. In this ongoing pandemic, public health concerns and the urgent need for effective therapeutic measures require a deep understanding of the epidemiology, transmissibility and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here we analysed clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shanghai. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, assembled from 112 high-quality samples together with sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) dataset, showed a stable evolution and suggested that there were two major lineages with differential exposure history during the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan. Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes. Lymphocytopenia, especially reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts upon hospital admission, was predictive of disease progression. High levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count. The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age and lymphocytopenia (and its associated cytokine storm), whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3026840717,"To advance the measurement of distributed neuronal population representations of targeted motor actions on single trials, we developed an optical method (COSMOS) for tracking neural activity in a largely uncharacterized spatiotemporal regime. COSMOS allowed simultaneous recording of neural dynamics at ∼30 Hz from over a thousand near-cellular resolution neuronal sources spread across the entire dorsal neocortex of awake, behaving mice during a three-option lick-to-target task. We identified spatially distributed neuronal population representations spanning the dorsal cortex that precisely encoded ongoing motor actions on single trials. Neuronal correlations measured at video rate using unaveraged, whole-session data had localized spatial structure, whereas trial-averaged data exhibited widespread correlations. Separable modes of neural activity encoded history-guided motor plans, with similar population dynamics in individual areas throughout cortex. These initial experiments illustrate how COSMOS enables investigation of large-scale cortical dynamics and that information about motor actions is widely shared between areas, potentially underlying distributed computations."

The ecotourism of endangered mountain gorillas has attracted many tourists and functioned as a key component of their conservation. There might be expectations on the part of tourists to observe or interact with gorillas in close proximity and such expectations may have been engendered by the contents of social media in this Information Age. However, the risk of disease transmission between humans and gorillas is a large concern and it is important to maintain a certain distance while observing gorillas to minimize risk. We conducted a content analysis and described the general characteristics of 282 YouTube videos related to mountain gorilla tourism. Humans and gorillas were observed simultaneously in 70% of the videos, and physical contact or close proximity within arm’s reach were identified in 40%. To explore the factors affecting the number of views and likes that these videos received, we ran generalized linear mixed models and performed AIC model selection with 206 videos in which humans and gorillas were observed simultaneously. Videos obtained more views and likes when the thumbnail photos included humans and gorillas together, while videos with thumbnail photos of only gorillas did not obtain more views and likes compared with those that included no gorillas. Moreover, videos obtained more views and likes in cases where physical contact or close proximity within arm’s reach with gorillas were clearly observed, compared with those that did not clearly include close human-gorilla interaction. These results suggest that human-gorilla interaction and proximity with gorillas attract more public attention than gorillas shown by themselves. Our study highlights the importance of further investigation on the direct link between such contents that violate tourism regulations and the conflicting situation."

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia and its associated factors among the elderly with T2DM in public primary care clinics in Malaysia. This study utilised data from a longitudinal study of 506 adults with T2DM aged ≥60 years. Data on socio-demography, clinical and functional status, diet and levels of physical activity (PA) were collected. Sarcopenia was defined using Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria and its associated factors were analysed using multiple logistic regression. The proportion of elderly with T2DM with sarcopenia was 28.5%. Those aged ≥70 years (β = 0.73;OR = 2.07; 95%CI = 1.24, 3.48; p = 0.006), men (β = 0.61; OR = 1.84; 95%CI = 1.12, 3.02; p = 0.017), with ≥10 years duration of diabetes (β = 0.62; OR = 1.85; 95%CI = 1.11, 3.09; p = 0.018), not using insulin sensitizers (β = -1.44; OR = 0.24; 95%CI = 0.08, 0.71; p = 0.010), using less than 5 medications (β = 0.68; OR = 1.98; 95%CI = 1.17, 3.36; p = 0.011), low body mass index (BMI) (β = -2.43; OR = 0.09; 95%CI = 0.05, 0.17; p<0.001), and engaging in low (β = 0.77; OR = 2.15; 95%CI = 1.07, 4.35; p = 0.032) and moderate physical activities (β = 0.80; OR = 2.23; 95%CI = 1.07, 4.66; p = 0.033) were associated with sarcopenia. Factors that predicts sarcopenia such as level of physical activity and body mass index were among the modifiable factors that could be used in developing future strategies to prevent or delay the progression of sarcopenia among elderly with T2DM to improve their health status."
https://openalex.org/W3026489108,"Male involvement in maternal health has been linked to positive health outcomes for women and children, as they control household resources and make significant decisions, which influence maternal health. Despite of the important role they have in maternal health care, their actual involvement remains low. The objective of this study was to explore community perspectives on potential barriers to men's involvement in maternity care in central Tanzania.Qualitative research methods were used in data collection. We conducted 32 focus group discussions (16 FGDs with men and 16 FGDs with women) and 34 in-depth interviews with community leaders, village health workers and health care providers. Interview guides were used to guide the focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The interviews and discussions were audio recorded, transcribed and translated into English and imported into QSR NVivo 9 software for thematic analysis. Three themes emerged from the data; men's maternity care involvement indicators, benefits of men's involvement in maternity health care services and barriers to men's involvement in maternity health care services.Both men and women participants acknowledged the importance of men's involvement in maternity health care services, even though few men actually got involved. Identified benefits of men's involvement in maternity health care services include: Learning any risk factors directly from the health care providers and getting prepared in addressing them; and reinforcing adherence to instruction received from the health care provider as family protectors and guardians. Barriers to men's involvement in maternity health care services are systemic; starting from the family, health care and culture-specific gender norms for maternity related behaviour as well as healthcare facilities structural constrains inhibiting implementation of couple-friendly maternity health care services.Men's involvement in maternity care is influenced by culture-specific maternity-related gender norms. This situation is compounded by the conditions of deprivation that deny women access to resources with which they could find alternative support during pregnancy. Moreover, structures meant for maternal health care services lack privacy, thus inhibiting male partners' presence in the delivery room. Intervention to increase men's involvement in maternity care should address individual and systemic barriers to men's involvement."
https://openalex.org/W3027262552,"Healthier carbohydrate (carb)-rich foods are essential for health, but practical, validated indices for their identification are not established. We compared four pragmatic metrics, based on, per 10g of carb:(a) ≥1g fiber (10:1 carb:fiber), (b) ≥1g fiber and <1g free sugars (10:1:1 carb:fiber:free sugars), (c) ≥1g fiber and <2g free sugars (10:1:2 carb:fiber:free sugars); and (d) ≥1g fiber and, per each 1 g of fiber, <2g free sugars (10:1 carb:fiber, 1:2 fiber:free sugars; or 10:1|1:2). Using 2013–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey /Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, we assessed, overall and for 12 food categories, whether each metric discriminated carb-rich products higher or lower (per 100g) in calories, total fat, saturated fat, protein, sugar, fiber, sodium, potassium, magnesium, folate, and 8 vitamins/minerals. Among 2,208 carb-rich products, more met 10:1 (23.2%) and 10:1|1:2 (21.3%), followed by 10:1:2 (19.2%) and 10:1:1 (16.4%) ratios, with variation by product sub-categories. The 10:1 and 10:1|1:2 ratios similarly identified products with lower calories, fat, free sugars, and sodium; and higher protein, fiber, potassium, magnesium, iron, vitamin B6, vitamin E, zinc and iron. The 10:1:2 and 10:1:1 ratios identified products with even larger differences in calories and free sugars, but smaller differences in other nutrients above and lower folate, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin; the latter findings were attenuated after excluding breakfast cereals (~9% of products). These novel findings inform dietary guidance for consumers, policy, and industry to identify and promote the development of the healthier carb-rich foods."
https://openalex.org/W3027485908,"Several Botryosphaeriaceae species are known to occur worldwide, causing dieback, canker and fruit rot on various hosts. Surveys conducted in ten commercial citrus orchards in the northern region of Algeria revealed five species of Botryosphaeriaceae belonging to three genera associated with diseased trees. Morphological and cultural characteristics as well as phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α) identified Diplodia mutila, Diplodia seriata, Dothiorella viticola, Lasiodiplodia mediterranea and a novel species which is here described as Lasiodiplodia mithidjana sp. nov.. Of these, L. mithidjana (14.1% of the samples) and L. mediterranea (13% of the samples) were the most widespread and abundant species. Pathogenicity tests revealed that L. mediterranea and D. seriata were the most aggressive species on citrus shoots. This study highlights the importance of Botryosphaeriaceae species as agents of canker and dieback of citrus trees in Algeria."
https://openalex.org/W3026038761,"Cigarette smoke exposure is a risk factor for many pulmonary diseases, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Cigarette smokers are more prone to respiratory infections with more severe symptoms. In those with COPD, viral infections can lead to acute exacerbations resulting in lung function decline and death. Epithelial cells in the lung are the first line of defense against inhaled insults such as tobacco smoke and are the target for many respiratory pathogens. Endocytosis is an essential cell function involved in nutrient uptake, cell signaling, and sensing of the extracellular environment, yet, the effect of cigarette smoke on epithelial cell endocytosis is not known. Here, we report for the first time that cigarette smoke alters the function of several important endocytic pathways in primary human small airway epithelial cells. Cigarette smoke exposure impairs clathrin-mediated endocytosis and fluid phase macropinocytosis while increasing caveolin mediated endocytosis. We also show that influenza virus uptake is enhanced by cigarette smoke exposure. These results support the concept that cigarette smoke-induced dysregulation of endocytosis contributes to lung infection in smokers. Targeting endocytosis pathways to restore normal epithelial cell function may be a new therapeutic approach to reduce respiratory infections in current and former smokers."
https://openalex.org/W3026623057,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive disturbance as a consequence of the loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain, neuritic plaques and hyperphosphorylation of TAU protein. Although the underlying mechanisms leading to these events are unclear, mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), e.g., E280A (PSEN1 E280A), are causative factors for autosomal dominant early-onset familial AD (FAD). Despite advances in the understanding of the physiopathology of AD, there are no efficient therapies to date. Limitations in culturing brain-derived live neurons might explain the limited effectiveness of AD research. Here, we show that mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) can be used to model FAD, providing novel opportunities to study cellular mechanisms and to establish therapeutic strategies. Indeed, we cultured MSCs with the FAD mutation PSEN1 E280A and wild-type (WT) PSEN1 from umbilical cords and characterized the transdifferentiation of these cells into cholinergic-like neurons (ChLNs). PSEN1 E280A ChLNs but not WT PSEN1 ChLNs exhibited increased intracellular soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPf) fragments and extracellular Aβ42 peptide and TAU phosphorylation (at residues Ser202/Thr205), recapitulating the molecular pathogenesis of FAD caused by mutant PSEN1. Furthermore, PSEN1 E280A ChLNs presented oxidative stress (OS) as evidenced by the oxidation of DJ-1Cys106-SH into DJ-1Cys106-SO3 and the detection of DCF-positive cells and apoptosis markers such as activated pro-apoptosis proteins p53, c-JUN, PUMA and CASPASE-3 and the concomitant loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, mutant ChLNs displayed Ca2+ flux dysregulation and deficient acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity compared to control ChLNs. Interestingly, the inhibitor JNK SP600125 almost completely blocked TAU phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that FAD MSC-derived cholinergic neurons with the PSEN1 E280A mutation provide important clues for the identification of targetable pathological molecules."
https://openalex.org/W3027281179,"Background Our research aimed to explore the correlation between mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and central obesity and insulin resistance (IR) in Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Materials A total of 103 participants (60 men) were recruited in our study. MUAC was measured around the mid-arm between the shoulder and elbow. Waist circumference (WC) was obtained as central obesity parameter, and the IR parameter of Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. The subjects were divided into three groups according to the tertiles cut-points of MUAC level. Results Body mass index (BMI), WC, the percentages of central obesity and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the groups with higher MUAC than those in the group with lower MUAC (all P < 0.05). Pearson analysis showed that MUAC was correlated with BMI, WC, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), logHOMA-IR, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), uric acid (UA) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in all subjects. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that MUAC was independently associated with logHOMA-IR (β = 0.036, P<0.001) after adjusting for age, gender, WHR, UA, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that MUAC was an independent predictor of central obesity (OR: 2.129, 95%CI: 1.311–3.457, P = 0.002). Furthermore, MUAC≥30.9cm for male and ≥30.0cm for female were the optimal cutoff values for identifying central obesity. Conclusions Our study indicated that among Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes, MUAC is a simple and effective tool for the determination of central obesity and IR. Additionally, the larger MUAC is proved to be more associated with metabolic risk factors of higher UA and LDL-C and lowever HDL-C."
https://openalex.org/W3027503903,"West Nile virus (WNV) has consistently been reported to be associated with human cases of illness in the region near Chicago, Illinois. However, the number of reported cases of human illness varies across years, with intermittent outbreaks. Several dynamic factors, including temperature, rainfall, and infection status of vector mosquito populations, are responsible for much of these observed variations. However, local landscape structure and human demographic characteristics also play a key role. The geographic and temporal scales used to analyze such complex data affect the observed associations. Here, we used spatial and statistical modeling approaches to investigate the factors that drive the outcome of WNV human illness on fine temporal and spatial scales. Our approach included multi-level modeling of long-term weekly data from 2005 to 2016, with weekly measures of mosquito infection, human illness and weather combined with more stable landscape and demographic factors on the geographical scale of 1000m hexagons. We found that hot weather conditions, warm winters, and higher MIR in earlier weeks increased the probability of an area of having a WNV human case. Higher population and the proportion of urban light intensity in an area also increased the probability of observing a WNV human case. A higher proportion of open water sources, percentage of grass land, deciduous forests, and housing built post 1990 decreased the probability of having a WNV case. Additionally, we found that cumulative positive mosquito pools up to 31 weeks can strongly predict the total annual human WNV cases in the Chicago region. This study helped us to improve our understanding of the fine-scale drivers of spatiotemporal variability of human WNV cases."

A better understanding about their associated factors may help to achieve improvements on this area. The aims of this study were to investigate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and hospitalizations, as well as between these characteristics and the length of stay (LOS), within the first year of outpatient treatment, for the most incident cancers in the Brazilian population. In this cohort study, we investigated 417,477 patients aged 19 years or more, who started outpatient cancer treatment, from 2010-2014, for breast, prostate, colorectal, cervix, lung and stomach cancers. The outcomes evaluated were: i) Hospitalizations within the first year of outpatient cancer treatment; and ii) LOS of the hospitalized patients. It was performed a binary logistic regression to evaluate the association between the explanatory variables and the hospitalizations and a negative binomial regression to evaluate their influence on the length of hospital stay. The hospitalizations occurred for 34% of patients, with a median of LOS of 6 days (IQR: 2-15). Female patients were 16% less likely to be hospitalized (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.82-0.86), with lower average of LOS (AR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.97-0.99), each additional year of age reduced in 2% the hospitalization odds (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99) and in 1% the average of LOS (AR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-0.99), patients from South region had twice more chances of hospitalization than from North region (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.93-2.10) and patients with colorectal cancer had greater probability of hospitalization (OR: 4.42; 95% CI: 4.27-4.48), with the highest average of LOS (AR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.35-1.40). In view of our results, we consider that the government must expand the policies with potential to reduce the number of hospitalizations."
https://openalex.org/W3028008645,"Fold-switch pathways remodel the secondary structure topology of proteins in response to the cellular environment. It is a major challenge to understand the dynamics of these folding processes. Here, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the α-helix–to–β-strand and β-strand–to–α-helix transitions and domain motions displayed by the essential mannosyltransferase PimA from mycobacteria. Using 19F NMR, we identified four functionally relevant states of PimA that coexist in dynamic equilibria on millisecond-to-second timescales in solution. We discovered that fold-switching is a slow process, on the order of seconds, whereas domain motions occur simultaneously but are substantially faster, on the order of milliseconds. Strikingly, the addition of substrate accelerated the fold-switching dynamics of PimA. We propose a model in which the fold-switching dynamics constitute a mechanism for PimA activation.

In the crystal structure of unliganded PimA, two distinct conformations of a region in the N-terminal domain, termed the reshuffling region (residues 118–163), are seen, suggesting that this region can undergo motions between a compact and an extended conformation, even in the absence of substrate (Fig. 1A) (23Giganti D.

Moreover, the crystal structures of PimA in the presence of GDP or GDP-Man support the hypothesis that the reshuffling region displays fold-switching of secondary structure elements with both α-helix–to–β-strand and β-strand–to–α-helix transitions upon addition of substrate (Fig. 1A) (23Giganti D.

Fold-switching activates PimA, since PimA mutants locked in the unliganded conformation are inactive, while mutants locked in the substrate-bound conformation are active (23Giganti D. Albesa-Jové D.

Here, we demonstrate by using 19F NMR methods that motions of PimA occur on a second-to-millisecond timescale and include interconversions between several conformational states. Our observations provide a basis to suggest an activation mechanism for PimA in which the addition of substrate accelerates dynamics between active and inactive conformations. 19F nuclei are NMR active with a gyromagnetic ratio that is 0.94 times that of protons, have 100% natural abundance, and display high sensitivity to their magnetic environment (29Gerig J.

At the same time, fluorine is nearly absent from biological molecules, reducing the number of resonances observed in a spectrum to those that stem from artificially introduced 19F labels. Therefore, 19F nuclei are suitable probes that allow employing NMR experiments for dynamic studies even for large proteins for which more common labeling approaches are not successful (31Didenko T. Liu J.J. Horst R. Stevens R.C. Wüthrich K. Fluorine-19NMR of integral membrane proteins illustrated with studies of GPCRs.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Based on analyses of the different crystallographic structures of PimA (Fig. 1A), we introduced a Cys mutation in position Arg144 (here termed PimAR144C) (Fig. 1A) and labeled it with 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (TFA), giving rise to a 19F labeled mutant PimAR144C-TFA (see Experimental procedures). The introduced 19F label of the mutant PimAR144C-TFA is located in different chemical environments in the different crystallographic conformations of PimA, as highlighted in Fig. 1A. In the active state, the residue is buried inside the protein and, thus, not exposed to solvent, while it is solvent-exposed in the inactive states. 19F nuclei have been shown to be sensitive to such differences in the hydrophobicity of their immediate environment (32Manglik A.

Thus, it can be expected that the 19F probe located at Cys144 can sense motions that we hypothesize to occur in the reshuffling region, which are 1) extended to compact domain motion and 2) fold-switching dynamics between the inactive and active states. Given that the probe experiences sufficiently distinct chemical environments, domain motions that are typically on the order of milliseconds can be probed by NMR relaxation dispersion experiments (34Carver J. Richards R. A general two-site solution for the chemical exchange produced dependence of T2 upon the Carr-Purcell pulse separation.J. Magn. Reson. 1972; 6: 89-10510.1016/0022-2364(72)90090-XCrossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In addition, fold-switching dynamics are expected to occur on a second timescale and can be probed by saturation transfer experiments (35Spoerner M. Hozsa C. Poetzl J.A. Reiss K. Ganser P. Geyer M.

We first determined that the introduced label does not alter the three-dimensional structure of PimA. Supporting this notion, wild-type PimA, PimAR144C, and labeled PimAR144C-TFA mutants displayed similar far-UV CD spectra (Fig. S1A) (25Guerin M.E. Schaeffer F. Chaffotte A. Gest P. Giganti D.

It is expected that the addition of ligands to the protein sample will increase the Tm. The higher the affinity of a ligand, the higher the apparent Tm value, because it requires more energy to dissociate higher affinity compounds (39Mayhood T.W. Windsor W.T. Ligand binding affinity determined by temperature-dependent circular dichroism: cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitors.Anal.

We have previously described that the addition of GDP or GDP-Man to wild-type PimA increases the Tm of the enzyme, with the β-phosphate of the nucleotide group playing a prominent role (25Guerin M.E. Schaeffer F. Chaffotte A. Gest P. Giganti D. Korduláková J. van der Woerd M. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. Substrate-induced conformational changes in the essential peripheral-membrane binding mannosyltransferase PimA from mycobacteria. Implications for catalysis.J. Biol.

As depicted in Fig. S1B, thermal unfolding followed by the far-UV CD signal at 222 nm indicated slight differences in protein stability between unliganded WT PimA, PimAR144C, and PimAR144C-TFA. Interestingly, after the addition of GDP, wild-type PimA, PimAR144C, and PimAR144C-TFA displayed a clear increase in the Tm values (Table S1), supporting the notion that the mutation and labeling do not significantly perturb the enzymatic structure and function (Fig. S1). PimA contains two Cys residues buried inside the protein core that are not expected to be labeled during the labeling procedure (see Experimental procedures). To verify this, the labeling scheme was applied to WT PimA. Only resonances that are less than 5 Hz wide were observed in a 19F spectrum (Fig. S2), showing that they stem from small molecules. The resonances could be assigned to residual 3-bromo-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (BTFA) label and 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (TFA), the latter being the product of an incomplete labeling reaction. The resonance at −119.8 ppm stems from an impurity in the BTFA solution. Therefore, no labeling was observed for WT PimA. We conclude that PimAR144C-TFA is only labeled at the introduced Cys residue. Despite being singly labeled, two resonances are observed at −84.1 ppm and −82.7 ppm (Fig. 1B, bottom). As discussed below, these two peaks display saturation transfer, further corroborating that they stem from the same 19F label. To assign the resonances to conformations of PimA, we investigated the 19F spectrum of the triple mutant PimAT126C-V359C-R144C-TFA, previously shown to be locked in the inactive conformation. This variant cannot undergo reshuffling due to a disulfide bond formed between Cys126 and Cys359; these residues are in close spatial proximity in the inactive state but far apart in the active state (23Giganti D. Albesa-Jové D. Urresti S. Rodrigo-Unzueta A. Martínez M.A. Comino N. Barilone N. Bellinzoni M. Chenal A. Guerin M.E. Alzari P.M. Secondary structure reshuffling modulates glycosyltransferase function at the membrane.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 (25402770): 16-1810.1038/nchembio.1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PimAT126C-V359C-R144C-TFA displays only a single resonance at −84.1 ppm (Fig. 1B, top), which therefore can be assigned to the inactive state. Consequently, the resonance at −82.7 ppm is assigned to the active state. This assignment is corroborated by the fact that the resonance at −84.1 ppm shifts 0.1 ppm upfield in 100% D2O, whereas the resonance at −82.7 ppm does not shift (Fig. 1B, center). For fully solvent-exposed 19F labels, upfield solvent isotope shifts of 0.2–0.3 ppm have been observed when comparing shifts in a 90% H2O/10% D2O to 100% D2O solvent (33Evanics F. Kitevski J.L. Bezsonova I. Forman-Kay J. Prosser R.S. 19F NMR studies of solvent exposure and peptide binding to an SH3 domain.BBA-Gen.

In the crystal structure, Arg144 is shielded from solvent in the active state, whereas this is not the case for the inactive conformations (Fig. 1A), supporting the assignment. The assignment is further supported by extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed on the different states of PimA labeled with TFA. Based on these simulations, we calculated the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of the TFA label in the different states. A higher SASA value indicates that the label is more solvent-exposed. As shown in Fig. S3, the SASA of the TFA label in the active state is 19.3 Å2, which differs markedly from the values obtained for the protein in the inactive forms (96.7 Å2 and 60.1 Å2 for the extended and compact structures, respectively). Thus, MD simulations revealed that the TFA label in the active state is less surface exposed than that in the inactive state, in agreement with the NMR experiments. To test whether the two resonances in the 19F spectrum of PimAR144C-TFA are in slow exchange, we conducted saturation transfer experiments at increasing saturation times. Exchange rates were obtained from a fit to the model given in (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5), (Eq. 6), (Eq. 7). Experimental data to obtain R1 longitudinal relaxation rates that are required for the analysis are shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2. Figure 2 shows resonance intensity attenuation due to slow conformational exchange for the inactive and active state resonances upon saturation of the active or inactive state resonance, respectively. In the absence of GDP-Man, the exchange rate was determined to be 2.3 s−1. These dynamics correspond to fold-switching between the active and inactive states of the protein, as demonstrated by the assignments (Fig. 1B). The second timescale of the motion is in accordance with studies of the chemokine lymphotactin, for which fold-switching dynamics were shown to be on the order of seconds (14Volkman B.F. Liu T.Y. Peterson F.C. Lymphotactin structural dynamics.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 461 (19480914): 51-7010.1016/S0076-6879(09)05403-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the absence of GDP-Man, the active and inactive states of PimA are nearly equally populated (Fig. 2C and Table 1).Table 1Parameters obtained from saturation transfer experiments for (A) the active state resonance and (B) for the inactive state resonance of PimAR144C-TFACondition and resonance stateChemical shift (ppm)kIAaI, the inactive state; A, the active state, i.e. kIA is the exchange rate from the inactive to the active state, and ΔGIA is the free energy difference between the inactive and active state and vice versa.

Open table in a new tab To test how GDP-Man affects these dynamics, we first conducted a titration experiment to corroborate that the sugar donor saturates the binding site. As shown in Fig. 1C, titration of GDP-Man to 100 μm PimAR144C-TFA leads to a gradual decrease in intensities of both resonances up to a nucleotide sugar concentration of 200 μm. At this concentration, the inactive state resonance shifts 0.2 ppm upfield, and further addition of GDP-Man does not alter the spectrum anymore. At the field strength employed in Fig. 1C (16.4 T), the active state resonance is too broad to clearly observe a resonance shift. Since the line broadening due to the field-dependent chemical shift anisotropy of 19F is reduced at lower field strength, we compared the spectra of PimAR144C-TFA in the presence and absence of GDP-Man at 14.1 T. At this lower field, a downfield shift of the active state resonance of 0.1 ppm was observab"
https://openalex.org/W3027059982,"Radiotherapy (RT) is of critical importance in the locoregional management of early breast cancer. Although RT is routinely used following breast conserving surgery (BCS), patients may occasionally be effectively treated with BCS alone. Currently, the selection of patients undergoing BCS who do not need breast irradiation is under investigation. With the advancement of personalized medicine, there is an increasing interest in reduction of aggressive treatments especially in older women. The primary objective of this study was to identify elderly patients who may forego breast irradiation after BCS without measurable consequences on local tumor growth and survival.We analyzed 2384 early breast cancer patients aged 70 and older who were treated in 17 German certified breast cancer centers between 2001 and 2009. We compared RT versus no RT after guideline adherent (GA) BCS. The outcomes studied were breast cancer recurrence (RFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Low-risk patients were defined by luminal A, tumor size T1 or T2 and node-negative whereas higher-risk patients were defined by patients with G3 or T3/T4 or node-positive or other than Luminal A tumors. To test if there is a difference between two or more survival curves, we used the Gp family of tests of Harrington and Fleming.The median age was 77 yrs (mean 77.6±5.6 y) and the median observation time 46 mths (mean 48.9±24.8 mths). 950 (39.8%) patients were low-risk and 1434 (60.2%) were higher-risk. 1298 (54.4%) patients received GA BCS of which 85.0% (1103) received GA-RT and only 15% (195) did not. For low-risk patients with GA-BCS there were no significant differences in RFS (log rank p = 0.651) and in BCSS (p = 0.573) stratified by GA-RT. 5 years RFS in both groups were > 97%. For higher-risk patients with GA-BCS we found a significant difference (p<0.001) in RFS and tumor-associated OS stratified by GA-RT. The results remain the same after adjusting by adjuvant systemic treatment (AST) and comorbidity (ASA and NYHA).Patients aged 70 years and older suffering from low-risk early breast cancer with GA-BCS can avoid breast irradiation with <3% chance of relapse.

https://openalex.org/W3027852648,"A sizeable body of evidence has recently emerged to suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation might be involved in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). There is now strong epidemiological and genetical evidence linking PD to inflammatory bowel diseases and we recently demonstrated that the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein, which is critically involved in PD pathophysiology, is upregulated in inflamed segments of Crohn's colon. The microtubule associated protein tau is another neuronal protein critically involved in neurodegenerative disorders but, in contrast to alpha-synuclein, no data are available about its expression and phosphorylation patterns in inflammatory bowel diseases. Here, we examined the expression levels of tau isoforms, their phosphorylation profile and truncation in colon biopsy specimens from 16 Crohn's disease (CD) and 6 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and compared them to samples from 16 controls. Additional experiments were performed in full thickness segments of colon of five CD and five control subjects, in primary cultures of rat enteric neurons and in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) knockout mice. Our results show the upregulation of two main human tau isoforms in the enteric nervous system (ENS) in CD but not in UC. This upregulation was not transcriptionally regulated but instead likely resulted from a decrease in protein clearance via an Nrf2 pathway. Our findings, which provide the first detailed characterization of tau in CD, suggest that the key proteins involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as alpha-synuclein and tau, might also play a role in CD."
https://openalex.org/W3026180501,"Homeostasis between pro- and anti- inflammatory responses induced by bacteria is critical for the maintenance of health. In the oral cavity, pro-inflammatory mechanisms induced by pathogenic bacteria are well-established; however, the anti-inflammatory responses that act to restrain innate responses remain poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that infection with the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis enhances the activity of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) in innate immune cells, and subsequently phospho-inactivates Nedd4-2, an ubiquitin E3 ligase. In turn, Wingless-INT (Wnt) 3 (Wnt3) ubiquitination is decreased, while total protein levels are enhanced, leading to a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In contrast, JAK3 or Wnt3a inhibition robustly enhances nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells activity and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in P. gingivalis-stimulated innate immune cells. Moreover, using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that downstream molecules of Wnt3a signaling, including Dvl3 and β-catenin, are responsible for the negative regulatory role of Wnt3a. In addition, using an in vivo P. gingivalis-mediated periodontal disease model, we show that JAK3 inhibition enhances infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduces expression of Wnt3a and Dvl3 in P. gingivalis-infected gingival tissues, and increases disease severity. Together, our results reveal a new anti-inflammatory role for JAK3 in innate immune cells and show that the underlying signaling pathway involves Nedd4-2-mediated Wnt3a ubiquitination."

Furan fatty acids (FuFAs) are present in the lipids of some plant, fish, and microbial species and appear to function as second messengers in pathways that protect cells from membrane-damaging agents. We report here the results of chemical, genetic, and synthetic biology experiments to decipher the biosynthesis of the monomethylated FuFA, methyl 9-(3-methyl-5-pentylfuran-2-yl) nonanoate (9M5-FuFA), and its dimethyl counterpart, methyl 9-(3,4-dimethyl-5-pentylfuran-2-yl) nonanoate (9D5-FuFA), in two α-proteobacteria. Each of the steps in FuFA biosynthesis occurs on pre-existing phospholipid fatty acid chains, and we identified pathway intermediates and the gene products that catalyze 9M5-FuFA and 9D5-FuFA synthesis in Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 and Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009. One previously unknown pathway intermediate was a methylated diunsaturated fatty acid, (10E,12E)-11-methyloctadeca-10,12-dienoic acid (11Me-10t,12t-18:2), produced from (11E)-methyloctadeca-11-enoic acid (11Me-12t-18:1) by a newly identified fatty acid desaturase, UfaD. We also show that molecular oxygen (O2) is the source of the oxygen atom in the furan ring of 9M5-FuFA, and our findings predict that an O2-derived oxygen atom is incorporated into 9M5-FuFA via a protein, UfaO, that uses the 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 fatty acid phospholipid chain as a substrate.

Solving a furan fatty acid biosynthesis puzzleJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 295Issue 29PreviewFuran fatty acids (FuFAs), characterized by a central furan moiety, are widely dispersed in nature, but their biosynthetic origins are not clear. A new study from Lemke et al. employs a full court press of genetics, genomics, biochemical, and advanced analytical techniques to dissect the biosynthetic pathway of mono- and dimethyl FuFAs and their intermediates in two related bacteria. These findings lay the foundation both for detailed study of these novel enzymes and for gaining further insights into FuFA functions.

There is significant potential to produce natural or modified fatty acids through synthetic biology or cellular engineering, given the range of known acyl chains and the number of gene products predicted to produce or modify these compounds across the phylogeny. We are studying the biosynthetic pathway for an unusual yet important fatty acid, a 19-carbon monomethylated furan fatty acid, 9-(3-methyl-5-pentylfuran-2-yl)-nonanoic acid, alternatively named 10,13-epoxy-11-methyl-octadecadienoic acid (9M5-FuFA) (13Vetter W.

However, strategies to produce large quantities of natural or modified FuFAs are limited by a lack of information about their biosynthesis. An opportunity to dissect the pathway for FuFA biosynthesis was provided by the increased abundance of 9M5-FuFA fatty acyl chains in phospholipids (18Lemke R.A. Peterson A.C. Ziegelhoffer E.C.

UfaM is a SAM-dependent methylase that synthesizes a methylated trans-unsaturated fatty acid, methyl (E)-11-methyloctadeca-12-enoate (11Me-12t-18:1), from the cis-vaccenic acid side chains within phospholipids (Fig. 1). Although 11Me-12t-18:1 is a potential intermediate in 9M5-FuFA synthesis, information is lacking on any additional intermediates, the remaining enzyme(s) in this biosynthetic pathway, and other compounds that are needed to produce 9M5-FuFA. In this work, a methylated diunsaturated fatty acid, (10E,12E)-11-methyloctadeca-10,12-dienoic acid (11Me-10t,12t-18:2), is identified as another intermediate in 9M5-FuFA biosynthesis. Also identified are previously unknown fatty acid–modifying enzymes from two α-proteobacteria (Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 and Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009) that synthesize 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 from 11Me-12t-18:1 and convert the methylated diunsaturated fatty acid into 9M5-FuFA (Fig. 1). This work also shows that atmospheric oxygen (O2) is the source of the oxygen atom in the furan ring of 9M5-FuFA. We further show that R. palustris produces a methyl 9-(3,4-dimethyl-5-pentylfuran-2-yl) (9D5-FuFA), which is the first published report of the synthesis of this fatty acyl chain in bacteria, and that a newly discovered protein acts as a SAM-dependent fatty acid methylase to synthesize diunsaturated 9D5-FuFA from the monounsaturated 9M5-FuFA (Fig. 1). These studies provide important new insights into the biosynthesis of furan rings and information to predict the presence of similar biosynthetic pathways and identify genes that can be used to engineer increased production of FuFAs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Deciphering the FuFA biosynthetic pathway is aided by the knowledge of genes needed for the production of 9M5-FuFA in R. sphaeroides (18Lemke R.A. Peterson A.C. Ziegelhoffer E.C. Westphall M.S.

For example, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) prepared from the phospholipids found in R. sphaeroides ΔchrR cells contain higher detectable levels of 9M5-FuFA and 11Me-12t-18:1 than WT cells, in addition to the 18:1, 18:0, 16:1, and 16:0 fatty acid chains found in WT cells (Fig. 2A). Previous work (18Lemke R.A. Peterson A.C. Ziegelhoffer E.C. Westphall M.S. Tjellstrom H. Coon J.J. Donohue T.J. Synthesis and scavenging role of furan fatty acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, a mutation that deleted all five genes in the RSP1087-1091 operon prevented the accumulation of 9M5-FuFA and led to increased production of 11Me-12t-18:1 (18Lemke R.A. Peterson A.C. Ziegelhoffer E.C. Westphall M.S. Tjellstrom H. Coon J.J. Donohue T.J. Synthesis and scavenging role of furan fatty acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

From these observations, 11Me-12t-18:1 was proposed to be an intermediate in 9M5-FuFA synthesis, and one or more products of the RSP1087-1091 operon were potential catalysts of subsequent reactions in 9M5-FuFA synthesis (18Lemke R.A. Peterson A.C. Ziegelhoffer E.C. Westphall M.S. Tjellstrom H. Coon J.J. Donohue T.J. Synthesis and scavenging role of furan fatty acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To test these proposals, the fatty acid composition of phospholipids from mutants lacking both chrR (which leads to higher levels of 9M5-FuFA accumulation than in WT cells) and single genes in the RSP1087-1091 operon were analyzed. Examination of this set of isogenic strains showed that placing individual in-frame deletions of either RSP1087, RSP1088, or RSP1089 in ΔchrR cells had no detectable impact on the fatty acid profile compared with cells lacking only chrR (Fig. 2, E–G). This demonstrates that each of these three gene products were not necessary for synthesis of either 9M5-FuFA or 11Me-12t-18:1. In contrast, inactivation of either RSP1091 (ufaD) or RSP1090 (ufaO) in ΔchrR cells did alter the fatty acid profile compared with that found in cells lacking only the chrR gene (Fig. 2, C and D). Loss of ufaD led to the disappearance of both fatty acids 9M5-FuFA and the previously identified 11Me-12t-18:1 (Fig. 2C). ΔchrR cells lacking ufaO were missing fatty acids corresponding to both 9M5-FuFA and 11Me-12t-18:1 but contained a previously undetected fatty acid of unknown identity (Fig. 2D). These data predict that both ufaD and ufaO are involved in conversion of 11Me-12t18:1 into 9M-FuFA. One possibility is that UfaD converts the previously identified 11Me-12t-18:1 into the fatty acid that is derivatized to the unknown FAME and that UfaO catalyzes the conversion of this compound into the furan-containing fatty acid, 9M5-FuFA (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, the chemical identity of the unknown fatty acid that accumulates in cells lacking ufaO needed to be determined. MS analysis of the FAME derivative indicates that it has a molecular mass of 308.2 Da, but analysis of its fragmentation pattern was insufficient to unambiguously elucidate its chemical structure. Hydrogenation of the lipids from cells lacking ufaO led to a shift in GC retention time of this FAME (Fig. 3, A and B) and an increase in the parent ion mass by 4 Da to 312.2 Da (Fig. 3, C and D). The magnitude of the mass increase after hydrogenation indicates that the untreated FAME contains two double bonds. The new GC retention time and mass were indistinguishable from those of the hydrogenated form of an 11Me-12t-18:1 FAME (Fig. 3B). These observations suggest that the unknown fatty acid is a diunsaturated derivative of 11Me-12t-18:1. To determine the chemical identity of this unknown fatty acid, several additional experiments were conducted. A 4,4-dimethyloxazoline (DMOX) derivative of phospholipids from cells lacking ufaO identified a product whose molecular mass (347.3182 Da) predicted the chemical formula (C23H41O1N1), and the fragmentation pattern of the DMOX-modified unknown compound provided additional support for the assignment of the parent fatty acid as a diunsaturated derivative of the monounsaturated 11Me-12t-18:1 (Fig. 4A). As an independent assessment of this assignment, the two-dimensional NOESY NMR spectrum of purified samples of FAME derivatives of the unknown fatty acid was performed. This analysis identified NMR signals diagnostic of the conjugated double bonds predicted from hydrogenation of the FAME and the MS fingerprints of the DMOX derivative of this compound (Fig. 4). Analysis of the NMR data also indicated that about 98% of the FAME had both double bonds in the trans-configuration. Previous studies concluded the double bond in 11Me-12t-18:1 was in the trans-configuration (22Shirasaka N. Nishi K. Shimizu S. Biosynthesis of furan fatty acids (F-acids) by a marine bacterium, Shewanella putrefaciens.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346 (9219910): 253-26010.1016/S0005-2760(97)00042-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As such, it appears 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 differs from 11Me-12t-18:1 by the presence of a second trans double bond adjacent to the methyl group at position 11 in the acyl chain. The above results predict that the FuFA biosynthetic pathway utilizes three gene products (ufaM, ufaD, and ufaO) that sequentially convert cis-vaccinate (18:1(11E)) into 11Me-12t-18:1, 11Me-10t,12t-18:2, and 9M5-FuFA (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, FAME profiles of phospholipids prepared from cells containing different combinations of ufaM, ufaD, and ufaO cloned behind an isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter on a low-copy plasmid were examined. The parent strain for this study contained an intact chrR gene but lacked all three of these genes (ufaM, ufaD, and ufaO) on the chromosome. Use of this strain allowed us to separate the synthesis of 9M5-FuFA and its putative biosynthetic intermediates from the increases in expression of other genes that are caused by the loss of chrR (Fig. 5A) (23Anthony J.R.

FAMEs of phospholipids from the parent strain (missing ufaM, ufaD, and ufaO on the chromosome) lacked detectable levels of 9M5-FuFA or any of the putative FuFA pathway intermediates (Fig. 5B). In contrast, when this parent strain contains only the ufaM gene on a plasmid, it accumulated a fatty acid corresponding to 11Me-12t-18:1 (Fig. 5C), as predicted from its known activity as a fatty acyl methylase (18Lemke R.A. Peterson A.C. Ziegelhoffer E.C. Westphall M.S. Tjellstrom H. Coon J.J. Donohue T.J. Synthesis and scavenging role of furan fatty acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, fatty acids isolated from this parent strain containing ufaM plus ufaD on the same plasmid produced 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 (Fig. 5D), whereas fatty acids isolated from the same strain containing ufaM plus ufaD and ufaO on this plasmid accumulated 9M5-FuFA (Fig. 5D). These results predict that these three genes are sufficient in vivo for 9M5-FuFA synthesis from cis-vaccenic acid (18:1), the fatty acid substrate for the SAM-dependent methylase, UfaM (18Lemke R.A. Peterson A.C. Ziegelhoffer E.C. Westphall M.S. Tjellstrom H. Coon J.J. Donohue T.J. Synthesis and scavenging role of furan fatty acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The results of the above experiments further predict that 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 is converted from 11Me-12t-18:1 by UfaD. To test this hypothesis, a recombinant His8-tagged version of UfaD was incubated with R. sphaeroides phospholipid-derived liposomes and tested for fatty acyl modifications. When assays were performed in the presence of liposomes that contained 11Me-12t-18:1 fatty acids (prepared from a strain lacking ufaD), the predicted fatty acid substrate for desaturation, a FAME with a GC retention time and MS fragmentation pattern identical to methyl 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 was detected (Fig. 6, A and B). All of the detected 18:2 fatty acid products were methylated, suggesting that UfaD did not desaturate the abundant 18:1 fatty acid found in R. sphaeroides phospholipids. The results of this experiment allow us to contend that UfaD is a previously unknown fatty acyl desaturase and that this protein has a high degree of specificity for 11Me-12t-18:1 as a substrate. The predicted product of UfaD activity, 11Me-10t,12t-18:2, accumulates when ΔchrR cells also lacking ufaO are grown in the presence of O2 (Fig. 2D). However, 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 does not accumulate to detectable levels when the same strain was grown in the absence of O2 (Fig. S1). Thus, O2 is required for 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 formation, possibly because it serves as an electron acceptor for the newly identified UfaD desaturase (25Fox B.G. Lyle K.S. Rogge C.E. Reactions of the diiron enzyme stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase.Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37 (15260504): 421-42910.1021/ar030186hCrossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Another prediction from the above data are that 9M5-FuFA is derived from 11Me-10t,12t-18:2. When a recombinant His6-UfaO protein synthesized in vitro using a wheat germ cell-free extract was incubated with R. sphaeroides liposomes containing 11Me-10t,12t-18:2 (a possible substrate for UfaO), a FAME with a GC retention time and MS fragmentation pattern indistinguishable from 9M5-FuFA (Fig. 7) was observed. To test the source of the oxygen atom in the furan ring of 9M5-FuFA, this assay was repeated under an atmosphere of 18O2 (99% isotopic enrichment). In these reaction products, the diagnostic M+ (324.3 Da), α-ion (167.1 Da), and β-ion (111.1 Da) derived from 9M5-FuFA each had a mass that was ∼2 Da larger than the ones present when the reaction was performed in the presence of air (322.2, 165.1, and 109.1 Da, respectively, Fig. 8 (A and B)). The observed 2-Da increase in the mass of these ions and their abundance compared with their counterparts when a control reaction was performed in 16O2 atmosphere shows that O2 is the source of the oxygen atom in the furan ring of 9M5-FuFA. As an independent test of the source of the oxygen atom in 9M5-FuFA, the fatty acid profile of ΔchrR cells grown aerobically in the presence of either 16O2 (Fig. 8C) or 18O2 (Fig. 8D) were analyzed. When cells are grown in the presence of 18O2, the diagnostic M+, α-ion, and β-ion from 9M5-FuFA FAMEs were 2 Da larger than those found when the same strain is grown in the presence of air. In addition, FAMEs derived from the 9M5-FuFA obtained from cells grown in the presence of 18O2 have a mass and fragmentation pattern indistinguishable from the product of UfaO activity (Fig. 8B). Based on the results of the above in vitro and in vivo experiments, O2 is the direct source of the oxygen atom in the furan ring of 9M5-FuFA, suggesting that UfaO is a previously unknown fatty acyl–modifying enzyme that uses the methylated diunsaturated fatty acid, 11Me-10t,12t-18:2, as a substrate. The use of O2 as the source of the oxygen atom in 9M5-FuFA is consistent with the results of previous in vivo experiments that demonstrated that this FuFA only accumulated in phospholipids when ΔchrR cells were grown under aerobic conditions (18Lemke R.A. Peterson A.C. Ziegelhoffer E.C. Westphall M.S. Tjellstrom H. Coon J.J. Donohue T.J. Synthesis and scavenging role of furan fatty acids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Other cells are predicted to contain proteins related to UfaM, UfaD, and UfaO (24Dufour Y.S. Landick R. Donohue T.J. Organization and evolution of the biological response to singlet oxygen stress.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383 (18723027): 713-73010.1016/j.jmb.2008.08.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we tested whether the R. palustris UfaM, UfaD, and UfaO homologs (RPA2569, RPA2571, and RPA2570, respectively) were sufficient to produce the expected fatty acyl chains. To do this, these three genes were cloned behind an IPTG-inducible promoter on a low-copy plasmid and placed in the R. sphaeroides ΔufaM, ΔufaD, and ΔufaO triple-mutant strain. Analysis of FAMEs prepared from phospholipids from this strain showed that these three R. palustris genes are sufficient to produce 11Me-12t-18:1, 11Me-10t,12t-18:2, and 9M5-FuFA in R. sphaeroides (Fig. 9C) (Fig. 9 (A and B) shows data from biological replicates of Fig. 5 (A and B)). These data demonstrate that proteins homologous to R. sphaeroides UfaM, UfaD, and UfaO are sufficient for production of 9M5-FuFA and its predicted pathway intermediates. The above finding led us to ask whether R. palustris contained intermediates or products of the 9M5-FuFA pathway. It was especially important to test this prediction as published analyses do not report the accumulation of a FuFA (9M5-FuFA or others) in R. palustris (26McKinlay J.B. Oda Y. Rühl M. Posto A.L. Sauer U. Harwood C.S. Non-growing Rhodopseudomonas palustris increases the hydrogen gas yield from acetate by shifting from the glyoxylate shunt to the tricarboxylic acid cycle.J. Biol.

By analysis of the FAME profile of phospholipids from aerobically grown R. palustris cells, we identified 9M5-FuFA and 11Me-12t-18:1 (Fig. 10). The accumulation of these compounds was abolished when cells contained an in-frame deletion of RPA2569 (ufaM), RPA2570 (ufaO), and RPA2571(ufaD), but when these three genes were expressed from a plasmid in the ΔRPA2569–2571 mutant, 11Me-12t-18:1 and 9M5-FuFA production was restored (Fig. 10). From these results, we conclude that the"

It is becoming clear that fully driverless vehicles will not be able to handle ""edge"" cases in the near future, suggesting that new methods are needed to monitor remotely driverless vehicles' safe deployment. While the remote operations concept is not new, a super-human driver is needed to handle sudden, critical events. We envision that the remote operators do not directly drive the vehicles, but provide input on high level tasks such as path-planning, object detection and classification. This can be achieved via input from multiple individuals, coordinated around a task at a moment's notice. Assuming a 10% penetration rate of driverless vehicles, we show that one remote driver can replace 14,840 human drivers. A comprehensive nationwide interoperability standard and procedure should be established for the remote monitoring and operation of driverless vehicles. The resulting system has potential to be an order of magnitude safer than today's ground transportation system. We articulate a research and policy roadmap to launch this nationwide system. Additionally, this hybrid human-AI system introduces a new job category, likely a source of employment nationwide."
https://openalex.org/W3028016229,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mutates immunoglobulin genes and acts genome-wide. AID targets robustly transcribed genes, and purified AID acts on single-stranded (ss) but not double-stranded (ds) DNA oligonucleotides. Thus, it is believed that transcription is the generator of ssDNA for AID. Previous cell-free studies examining the relationship between transcription and AID targeting have employed a bacterial colony count assay wherein AID reverts an antibiotic resistance stop codon in plasmid substrates, leading to colony formation. Here, we established a novel assay where kb-long dsDNA of varying topologies is incubated with AID, with or without transcription, followed by direct sequencing. This assay allows for an unselected and in-depth comparison of mutation frequency and pattern of AID targeting in the absence of transcription or across a range of transcription dynamics. We found that without transcription, AID targets breathing ssDNA in supercoiled and, to a lesser extent, in relaxed dsDNA. The most optimal transcription only modestly enhanced AID action on supercoiled dsDNA in a manner dependent on RNA polymerase speed. These data suggest that the correlation between transcription and AID targeting may reflect transcription leading to AID-accessible breathing ssDNA patches naturally occurring in de-chromatinized dsDNA, as much as being due to transcription directly generating ssDNA."
https://openalex.org/W3026080401,"To understand the effects of thermal shock on microcrack propagation and permeability in coal, thermal shock tests were conducted on coal specimens by using a constant temperature drying oven (105 °C) and a SLX program controlled cryogenic tank. The growth and propagation of microcracks were measured with computer tomography (CT) scanning and scanning electron microscope (SEM) tests. Results showed that thermal shocks improved the permeability of coal significantly. Notably, the permeability of coal after thermal shocks increased from 211.31% to 368.99% and was positively correlated with temperature difference. CT scanning images revealed that thermal shocks increased the crack number, crack volume and crack width as well as smoothened and widened the gas flow paths, thereby enhancing coal permeability. Moreover, SEM images showed that heating-cooling shocks created more new microcracks, forming more complex crack propagation paths and better connectivity among microcracks in coal compared to cooling shocks. We proposed a crack propagation criterion for coal to explain the mechanism of crack failure and propagation during thermal shocks. Our experiment results and theoretical analysis indicate that the heating-cooling shock is more effective in damaging and breaking coal than the cooling shock. Thus, it can be used as an alternative approach to enhance coal permeability in the production of coalbed methane (CBM)."
https://openalex.org/W3026140838,"Signaling through the endocannabinoid system is critical to proper functioning of the cerebellar circuit. However, most studies have focused on signaling through cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors, while relatively little is known about signaling through type 2 (CB2) receptors. We show that functional CB2 receptors are expressed in Purkinje cells using a combination of immunohistochemistry and patch-clamp electrophysiology in juvenile mice. Pharmacological activation of CB2 receptors significantly reduces inhibitory synaptic responses and currents mediated by photolytic uncaging of RuBi-GABA in Purkinje cells. CB2 receptor activation does not change the paired-pulse ratio of inhibitory responses and its effects are blocked by inclusion of GDP-β-S in the internal solution, indicating a postsynaptic mechanism of action. However, CB2 receptors do not contribute to depolarization induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), indicating they are not activated by endocannabinoids synthesized and released from Purkinje cells using this protocol. This work demonstrates that CB2 receptors inhibit postsynaptic GABAA receptors by a postsynaptic mechanism in Purkinje cells. This represents a novel mechanism by which CB2 receptors may modulate neuronal and circuit function in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W3027722190,"Hearing loss is the second most common nonfatal problem affecting the Chinese population. Historical studies have suggested an association between exposure to heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead, and hearing loss. Few studies have investigated this relationship in the general population in China. We conducted a case-control study with 1008 pairs of participants from a cross-sectional epidemiological survey conducted in Zhejiang Province. A self-designed questionnaire was adopted to collect information on demographics, chronic diseases, lifestyles and environmental noise. Pure-tone averages of hearing thresholds at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were computed. Blood lead and cadmium levels were analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrometer. After adjusting for all other potential confounding factors, compared with the lowest blood cadmium quartile (0.00-0.53 μg/L), blood cadmium quartile 2 (0.54-0.92 μg/L), quartile 3 (0.93-1.62 μg/L) and quartile 4 (1.63-57.81 μg/L) exhibited significantly elevated risks for hearing loss, with odds ratios of 1.932 (95% CI: 1.356-2.751), 2.036 (95% CI: 1.423-2.914) and 1.495 (95% CI: 1.048-2.133), respectively (P-trend<0.001). However, an association of lead with hearing loss was not found. Young age (less than 60 years), male sex and current smoking were associated with increased blood cadmium concentration. Additionally, a positive association between blood cadmium and lead concentrations was found. Therefore, we conclude that exposure to environmental cadmium may be a risk factor for hearing loss among the general population in China."

The life cycle of P. marinus is influenced by viruses. Cyanophages that infect P. marinus have evolved genomes with as many as 327 open reading frames (ORFs) (15Sullivan M.B. Coleman M.L. Weigele P. Rohwer F. Chisholm S.W.

Viruses from three clades infect P. marinus, including T4-like myoviruses, T7-like podoviruses, and, less commonly, members of Siphoviridae (16Labrie S.J. Frois-Moniz K. Osburne M.S. Kelly L.

In some ecosystems, as many as 50% of cyanobacteria may be infected at any point in time (17Sieradzki E.T. Ignacio-Espinoza J.C. Needham D.M. Fichot E.B. Fuhrman J.A. Dynamic marine viral infections and major contribution to photosynthetic processes shown by spatiotemporal picoplankton metatranscriptomes.Nat.

Some cyanophages exhibit infection cycles that are closely tied to day/night rhythms of cyanobacteria, although individual viruses vary in their responses (18Liu R. Liu Y. Chen Y. Zhan Y. Zeng Q. Cyanobacterial viruses exhibit diurnal rhythms during infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2019; 116 (31235591): 14077-1408210.1073/pnas.1819689116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Once infection begins, many host genes are repressed in favor of phage homologs (19Lindell D. Jaffe J.D. Coleman M.L. Futschik M.E. Axmann I.M. Rector T. Kettler G. Sullivan M.B. Steen R. Hess W.R. Church G.M. Chisholm S.W.

While recent estimates suggest that cyanophages are limited by energy rather than nutrients (21Puxty R.J. Evans D.J. Millard A.D. Scanlan D.J. Energy limitation of cyanophage development: implications for marine carbon cycling.ISME J. 2018; 12 (29379179): 1273-128610.1038/s41396-017-0043-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), our understanding of their controls over host electron transfer (ET) remains limited. Following infection, cyanophages express metabolic genes to modulate host photosynthesis (22Lindell D. Sullivan M.B. Johnson Z.I. Tolonen A.C. Rohwer F. Chisholm S.W.

Certain cyanophages encode an entire photosystem I (PSI) complex that is thought to be a more promiscuous oxidizer of electron carriers than host PSI, which may push host cells toward cyclic photosynthesis (25Sharon I. Alperovitch A. Rohwer F. Haynes M. Glaser F. Atamna-Ismaeel N. Pinter R.Y. Partensky F. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. Nelson N. Béjà O.

Viral plastocyanin homologs, which possess altered charged surfaces, compared with host plastocyanin, can also be expressed and are thought to transfer electrons directly to cytochrome aa3 oxidase rather than PSI as a mechanism for managing redox balance (26Puxty R.J. Millard A.D. Evans D.J. Scanlan D.J. Shedding new light on viral photosynthesis.Photosynth. Res. 2015; 126 (25381655): 71-9710.1007/s11120-014-0057-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other phage genes implicated in oxygenic photosynthesis include hli (high-light-inducible protein), pebA (15,16-dihydrobiliverdin:Fd reductase), psbD (PSII D2 protein), pcyA (phycocyanobilin:Fd reductase), and petF (Fd) (15Sullivan M.B.

Although the sequence similarities of these genes to their cyanobacterial homologs give clues to their cellular roles, we do not know how these proteins interact with host proteins to tune the host electron fluxome. The Prochlorococcus P-SSM2 phage Fd (pssm2-Fd) supports the reduction of phage phycoerythrobilin synthase (PebS), which catalyzes the reduction of biliverdin IXα to (3E/3Z)-phycoerythrobilin (27Dammeyer T.

In addition, it is not known how the primary structure and biophysical properties of phage Fds compare with those of host Fds. In this study, we used a sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis to examine how cyanophage and cyanobacterial Fds relate to one another. We also determined the first structure of a cyanophage Fd, which has high structural similarity to cyanobacterial Fds. We show that this Fd has a low midpoint potential characteristic of photosynthetic Fds, we establish that this protein has a low thermostability (Tm = 28 °C), and we show that it supports ET to a host oxidoreductase involved in sulfur assimilation. These results suggest that viral Fds support ET to cyanobacterially encoded oxidoreductases, and they extend our understanding about the ways in which viruses interact with cyanobacterial hosts. To better understand the prevalence of cyanophage Fds, we searched all 8392 viral genomes available in the Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes database for ORFs matching the InterPro signature for [2Fe-2S] Fds (34Finn R.D. Attwood T.K. Babbitt P.C. Bateman A. Bork P. Bridge A.J. Chang H.-Y. Dosztányi Z. El-Gebali S. Fraser M. Gough J. Haft D. Holliday G.L. Huang H.

This genome mining yielded 26 Fds from phages that have been shown to infect Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus (including pssm2-Fd), a Fd from an uncultured marine virus, and a Fd from the giant Pseudomonas phage OBP (35Cornelissen A.

All viral ORFs encoded Fds with 95–97 residues, with the exception of the Pseudomonas phage OBP, which encoded 83 residues. SSNs represent a simple way to visualize how protein paralogs relate to one another in their primary structure, and they provide a frame of reference for establishing how phage-encoded proteins might have evolved from host proteins. Additionally, the individual clusters in these networks often include protein homologs with similar functional properties (36Gerlt J.A. Genomic enzymology: web tools for leveraging protein family sequence–function space and genome context to discover novel functions.Biochemistry. 2017; 56 (28826221): 4293-430810.1021/acs.biochem.7b00614Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), so they can provide hints about the possible functions of phage-encoded proteins. To understand which cyanobacterial Fds are most closely related to phage Fds, we used an SSN to compare viral Fds with 807 cyanobacterial Fds obtained from a recent genome-mining effort (37Campbell I.J. Bennett G.N. Silberg J.J. Evolutionary relationships between low potential ferredoxin and flavodoxin electron carriers.Front. Energy Res. 2019; 7: 7910.3389/fenrg.2019.00079Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Zea mays Fd1 (zm-Fd1) was included for a frame of reference, because this protein has been intensively studied (38Kim J.Y. Nakayama M. Toyota H. Kurisu G. Hase T.

When the Fds were compiled into a SSN (40Atkinson H.J. Morris J.H. Ferrin T.E. Babbitt P.C.

Across the 12 largest clusters, the average Fd length varied by ∼100 amino acids. These clusters also vary in the number of cyanobacterial species represented and the average Fd size, with the top five most species-diverse clusters being VI (100 ± 8 residues), IX (115 ± 9 residues), VII (106 ± 13 residues), I (79 ± 2 residues), and XI (163 ± 8 residues) (Dataset S1). The phage Fds all localize to Cluster VI, in close association with cyanobacterial Fds (Fig. 1B), with the exception of Pseudomonas phage OBP Fd, which does not cluster with any Fds. Cluster VI includes numerous structurally characterized Fds, including Fds from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (s6803-Fd1), Nostoc sp. PCC 7119 (nsp-Fd1), Thermosynechococcus elongatus (te-Fd1), and Mastigocladus laminosus (ml-Fd1). Additionally, this cluster contains zm-Fd1, the Fd included for a frame of reference.

Urine samples were collected from a consecutive series of 1,532 pregnant women hospitalized at 20–41 weeks gestation in a Chinese single obstetric unit. A simple disposable Congo red based device was newly developed and employed to prospectively test misfolded proteins in pregnant women’s urine. A total of 140 preeclampsia cases were clinically diagnosed, 101 severe and 87 pre-term. Detection and false positive rates were similar in the training and validation subsets with combined 74% and 3.0%. The detection rate was 83% in severe, 86% in pre-term, 49% and 50% in mild and term cases (P<0.0001) respectively. In conclusion, a simple point-of-care urinary test for misfolded proteins can be used to screen for preeclampsia in late pregnancy with very high screening performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to screen for preeclampsia using Congo red based device in Chinese pregnant population."

https://openalex.org/W3028025053,"In the conifer tree rings, each tracheid goes through three phases of differentiation before becoming an element of the stem water-conducting structure: division, extension, and cell wall thickening. These phases are long-lasting and separated temporally, especially cell wall thickening. Despite the numerous lines of evidence that external conditions affect the rate of growth processes and the final anatomical dimensions during the respective phases of tracheid differentiation, the influence of the environment on anatomical dimensions during the cell division phase (cambial activity) has not yet been experimentally confirmed. In this communication, we provide indirect evidence of such an effect through observations of the small fluctuations in the latewood cell wall thickness of rapidly growing tree rings, which exhibit a high cell production rate (more than 0.4 cells per day on average). Such small fluctuations in the cell wall thickness cannot be driven by variations in external factors during the secondary wall deposition phase, since this phase overlaps for several tens of latewood cells in the rings of fast-growing trees due to its long duration."

AKI was defined according to the KDIGO criteria.429 patients were included of whom 259 (60%) had AKI. Among HM patients, 73 (78%) had AKI (70% AKI on admission to ICU; 7% during ICU stay); among ST patients, 186 (56%) had AKI (45% on admission to ICU, 11% during ICU stay). ICU and 28-day mortality rates were 33% and 48%, respectively in HM patients, and 22% and 31%, respectively in ST patients. Multivariable analysis showed that AKI was an independent risk factor for both ICU and 28-day mortality. New AKI after 24 hours in ICU was associated with higher mortality than AKI on admission.AKI is common in critically ill cancer patients and independently associated with ICU and 28-day mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3026584098,"Renal tubular injury contributes to the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). This study explored the role and mechanisms of E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin in the renal tubular injury of DN. We found that Parkin expression gradually decreased and was inversely associated with IL-6, TGF-β1, and GATA4 expression in the kidney during the progression of DN. Parkin over-expression (OE) reduced inflammation, fibrosis, premature senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), and improved renal function while Parkin knockout (KO) had opposite effects in DN mice. Parkin-OE decreased GATA4 protein, but not its mRNA transcripts in the kidney of DN mice and high glucose (HG)-treated RTECs. Immunoprecipitation indicated that Parkin directly interacted with GATA4 in DN kidney. Parkin-OE enhanced GATA4 ubiquitination. Furthermore, Parkin-KO upregulated growth arrest-specific gene 1 (GAS1) expression in renal tubular tissues of DN mice and GATA4-OE enhanced the HG-upregulated GAS1 expression in RTECs. Conversely, GAS1-OE mitigated the effect of Parkin-OE on HG-induced P21, IL-6, and TGF-β1 expression in RTECs. These results indicate that Parkin inhibits the progression of DN by promoting GATA4 ubiquitination and downregulating the GATA4/GAS1 signaling to inhibit premature senescence, inflammation, and fibrosis in DN mice. Thus, these findings uncover new mechanisms underlying the action of Parkin during the process of DN."
https://openalex.org/W3027722132,"Due to the complex role of sexual excitation in risky sexual behaviors, this study aimed to disentangle this phenomenon by jointly analyzing the combined role of three forms of sexual excitation: genital and subjective, and individual´s propensity. Therefore, we examined the relationship between the components of the Dual Control Model, that is, propensity for sexual excitation/inhibition, in addition to genital and subjective arousal, and sexual assertiveness and intention to engage in casual sexual encounters in which sexual risk was implicitly or explicitly present. The sample consisted of 99 heterosexual young adults (55 men and 45 women) with ages ranging from 18 to 32 years. Participants performed an experiment in the laboratory, which involved them watching a sexual clip and then being presented with two erotic excerpts (stories) depicting casual sexual encounters in which there was an existence of implicit and explicit sexual risks. In men, the propensity for sexual inhibition was the most determining variable in preventing them from sexual risk-taking. In women, intention to engage in risky sexual behaviors was better determined by their propensity for sexual excitation and sexual assertiveness in negotiating the use of contraceptive methods. This research highlights the relevance of excitation and inhibition as a trait, in addition to subjective arousal and sexual assertiveness in intention to engage in risky sexual behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3028191647,"Context Legal abortion restrictions, stigma and fear can inhibit people’s voices in clinical and social settings posing barriers to decision-making and abortion care. The internet allows individuals to make informed decisions privately. We explored what state-level policy dimensions were associated with volume of Google searches on abortion and on the abortion pill in 2018. Methods We used Google Trends to quantify the relative search volume (RSV) for “abortion” and “abortion pill” (or “abortion pills” hereafter referred to as “abortion pill”) as a proportion of total search volume for all queries in each US state. We also identified the top search queries most related to “abortion” and “abortion pill” and considered these as indicators of population concern. Key exposures were healthcare cost, access and health outcomes, and number of legal restrictions and protections at the state level. In descriptive analyses, we first grouped the states into tertiles according to their RSV on “abortion” and “abortion pill”. To examine the association between each exposure (and other covariates) with the two outcomes, we used unadjusted and adjusted linear regression. Results The average RSV for “abortion” in the low, moderate and high tertile groups was 48 (SD = 3.25), 55.5 (SD = 2.11) and 64 (SD = 4.72) (p-value <0.01) respectively; for “abortion pill” the average RSVs were 39.6 (SD = 16.68), 61.9 (SD = 5.82) and 81.7 (SD = 6.67) (p-value < 0.01) respectively. Concerns about contraceptive availability and access, and unplanned pregnancies independently predicted the relative search volumes for abortion and abortion pill. According to our baseline models, states with low contraceptive access had far higher abortion searches. Volume of abortion pill searches was additionally positively associated with poor health outcomes, poor access to abortion facilities and non-rurality. Conclusion Search traffic analysis can help discern abortion-policy influences on population concerns and require close monitoring. State-policies can predict search volume for abortion and abortion pill. In 2018, concerns about contraceptives and unplanned pregnancies, predicted abortion searches. Current decreases in public contraceptive funding and the Title X Gag rule designed to block millions of people from getting care at Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of birth control and abortion care, may increase concerns about unintended pregnancies that can lead to increases in online relative volume of abortion searches."
https://openalex.org/W3026139010,"There is a huge technology gap between regions in Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, which is the reality that must be faced. However, most of the available researches on innovation efficiency are based on the logic of a given technology level, ignoring the regional technological gap. This paper will stand from the perspective of technology gap and re-examine the innovation efficiency of pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in different regions of China and its impact on regional industrial competitiveness.We use the DEA-BCC input-oriented model to measure innovation efficiency of 28 provinces from the data of China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. The threshold model is constructed, with technology level as the threshold variable, innovation efficiency as the main explanatory variable, and industrial competitiveness as the dependent variable. In the threshold model, 28 regions are divided into three technical groups, and further, the impact of innovation efficiency on industrial competitiveness in different groups is analyzed and compared.According to the empirical research results, an U-shaped efficiency trap has been found in Chinese pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, and the areas with medium technical level are at the bottom of the trap. The improvement of innovation efficiency does not necessarily promote the improvement of regional industrial competitiveness. Only in high-level and low-level technology groups, innovation efficiency has effectively promoted the improvement of industrial competitiveness. In addition, the intensity of R&D investment has a similar impact on industrial competitiveness.The findings suggest that, regions in the efficiency trap should strive to seek opportunities for industrial transformation and focus on the industrial transformation of new technology, new industry and new opportunities, instead of blindly pursuing R&D investment intensity and superstitious innovation efficiency. So as to free up innovation resources for high-quality technological innovation in other regions. In addition, the Chinese government should make use of its public hospital system to normalize and expand the centralized drug procurement and eliminate the low-quality innovation."
https://openalex.org/W3026735749,"Skin aspartic acid protease (SASPase) is believed to be a key enzyme involved in filaggrin processing during epidermal terminal differentiation. Since little is known about the regulation of SASPase function, the aim of this study was to identify involved protein partners in the process. Yeast two hybrid analyses using SASPase as bait against a human reconstructed skin library identified that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 binds to the N-terminal fragment of SASPase. This interaction was confirmed in reciprocal yeast two hybrid screens and by Surface Plasmon Resonance analyses. Immunohistochemical studies in human skin, using specific antibodies to SASPase and the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2, showed that the two proteins partially co-localized to the stratum granulosum. In vitro enzymatic assays showed that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 enhanced the autoactivation of SASPase to its 14 kDa active form. Taken together, the data suggest that the N-terminal domain of filaggrin 2 regulates the activation of SASPase that may be a key event upstream of filaggrin processing to natural moisturizing factors in the human epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W3026308939,"Disturbance forces facilitate motor learning, but theoretical explanations for this counterintuitive phenomenon are lacking. Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such ‘active inference’ is driven by ‘surprise’. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance might help learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning). Our findings reconcile research on the relationship between noise, variability, and motor learning, and show that information is the currency of motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W3026633962,"Introduction Larvicide application in ovitrap is one of the currently available methods used in mosquito eradication campaign. We previously reported that copper in liquid form is a promising candidate due to its potent larvicide properties in a laboratory setting and in the field. In the field study, several larvae survived in outdoor ovitrap due to the dilution of copper concentration by rainwater. The surviving larvae were smaller and less motile. This led our interest to study the effect of a sub-lethal dose of copper in ovitrap on mosquito larval development, pupation time and lifespan in the adult stage. Methods First instar larvae of Aedes albopictus, Anopheles stephensi, and Culex pipiens were put in water containing 0.15 ppm, 0.30 ppm, and 0.60 ppm of copper. The surviving larvae, the emerging pupae, and adult mosquitoes were observed and counted every 24-hour and statistically analyzed by t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Inter-species difference in response to different concentration of copper were also analyzed. Results Copper showed a potent larvicide effect at 0.60 ppm concentration. Prolonged pupation time and a lower number of adult mosquitoes were observed at 0.15 ppm concentration. Copper exposure did not affect adult mosquitoes’ lifespan. Culex pipiens was the most susceptible species to copper exposure. Conclusion This study demonstrates the efficacy of copper at <1 ppm to kill mosquito larvae and to prolong pupation and adult emergence time. Utilization of copper at a low concentration is cost-efficient in the public health setting and remains an open option as an environmentally safe vector control strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3026546544,"Purpose Anatomically preshaped implants are needed for exact restoration of the anatomy after fractures of the proximal ulna and ulnar shaft, which enables a good functional outcome. Aim of this computed tomographic analysis was to identify specific characteristics of the ulna. The data serve for the development of a new intramedullary implant for stabilisation of proximal and diaphyseal ulna fractures. Methods With a standardized research method 100 CT scans of the ulna were evaluated regarding anatomic parameters like width of the medullary canal, proximal ulna dorsal angulation and varus angulation. Also, correlations of these parameters were analyzed statistically. Results The mean proximal ulna dorsal angulation (PUDA) was 6.4° (SD 2.8°), while the mean varus angulation of the proximal ulna was 12.4° (SD 3.3°). The length of the ulna bone was 253.6 mm (SD 19.9 mm) on average. The average minimum diameter of the medullary canal was 4.2 mm (SD 1.1 mm) located at 141.3 mm (SD 19.7 mm) from the olecranon tip. There is a positive correlation between age and minimum diameter in our patient cohort (p< 0.001). Conclusion Our study described the anatomy of the proximal ulna and the ulna shaft with a reproducible research method in a representative patient cohort. The knowledge of the evaluated anatomic parameters can lead to an improvement of any implant design for the fixation of proximal and diaphyseal ulna fractures."

Low POLE expression plays a pivotal role in accumulation of mutations and onset of cancer, contributing to development and growth of tumor cells. The aim of this study is to reveal the survival, alternative genes and antitumoral immune activities in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with low POLE expression and provide treatment strategies that can increase their survival rates. This study investigated the clinicopathologic parameters, various tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), endogenous retrovirus, molecular interactions and in vitro drug screen according to POLE mutation/expression in 168 and 1,019 NSCLC patients from the Konkuk University Medical Center (KUMC) and the Cancer Genome Atlas, respectively. We identified mutations of 75 genes in the sequencing panels, with POLE frame shift p.V1446fs being the most frequent (56.8%) in KUMC based on 170 targeted sequencing panels. Mutant and high expression of POLE correlated with favorable prognosis with increased TILs and tumor mutation burden, compared with wild type and low expression of POLE. We found specific molecular interactions associated with cell cycle and antigen presentation. An in vitro drug screen identified dasatinib that inhibited growth of the NSCLC cell line with low POLE expression. POLE could contribute to the future development of anticancer drugs for patients with NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3028518976,"Despite a growing body of literature on HIV service costs in sub-Saharan Africa, only a few studies have estimated the facility-level cost of prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) services, and even fewer provide insights into the variation of PMTCT costs across facilities. In this study, we present the first empirical costs estimation of the accelerated program for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Zimbabwe and investigate the determinants of heterogeneity of the facility-level average cost per service. To understand such variation, we explored the association between average costs per service and supply-and demand-side characteristics, and quality of services. One aspect of the supply-side we explore carefully is the scale of production-which we define as the annual number of women tested or the yearly number of HIV-positive women on prophylaxis.We collected rich data on the costs and PMTCT services provided by 157 health facilities out of 699 catchment areas in five provinces in Zimbabwe for 2013. In each health facility, we measured total costs and the number of women covered with PMTCT services and estimated the average cost per woman tested and the average cost per woman on either ARV prophylaxis or ART. We refer to these facility-level average costs per service as unitary costs. We also collected information on potential determinants of the variation of unitary costs. On the supply-side, we gathered data on the scale of production, staff composition and on the types of antenatal and family planning services provided. On the demand side, we measured the total population at the catchment area and surveyed eligible pairs of mothers and infants about previous use of HIV testing and prenatal care, and on the HIV status of both mothers and infants. We explored the determinants of unitary cost variation using a two-stage linear regression strategy.The average annual total cost of the PMTCT program per facility was US$16,821 (median US$8,920). The average cost per pregnant woman tested was US$80 (median US$47), and the average cost per HIV-positive pregnant woman initiated on ARV prophylaxis or treatment was US$786 annually (median US$420). We found substantial heterogeneity of unitary costs across facilities regardless of facility type. The scale of production was a strong predictor of unitary costs variation across facilities, with a negative and statistically significant correlation between the two variables (p<0.01).These findings are the first empirical estimations of PMTCT costs in Zimbabwe. Unitary costs were found to be heterogeneous across health facilities, with evidence consistent with economies of scale."

According to the theoretical analysis and empirical tests, the results show that the open policy of the Chinese rating industry contributes to higher rating quality in the domestic bond market. This open policy leads to rating convergence between DRAs and GRAs from in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W3026808882,"Drug resistance is a common obstacle in leukemia treatment and failing to eradicate leukemia stem cells is the main cause of leukemia relapse. Previous studies have demonstrated that telomerase activity is associated with deregulated self-renewal of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Here, we identified a novel compound IX, an imatinib derivative with a replacement fragment of a telomerase inhibitor, which can effectively eradicate LSCs but had no influence on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) survival. We showed that compound IX can decrease the viability of drug-resistant K562/G cells and blast crisis CML primary patient cells. Besides, IX can affect LSC survival, inhibit the colony-forming ability, and reduce LSC frequency. In vivo results showed that IX can relieve the tumor burden in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model and prolong the lifespan. We observed that compound IX can not only decrease telomerase activity, but also affect the alternative lengthening of telomeres. In addition, IX can inhibit both the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. Our data suggested this novel compound IX as a promising candidate for drug-resistant leukemia therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3027759701,"Homeostasis is an essential concept to understand the stability of organisms and their adaptive behaviors when coping with external and internal assaults. Many hormones that take part in homeostatic control come in antagonistic pairs, such as glucagon and insulin reflecting the inflow and outflow compensatory mechanisms to control a certain internal variable, such as blood sugar levels. By including negative feedback loops homeostatic controllers can exhibit oscillations with characteristic frequencies. In this paper we demonstrate the associated frequency changes in homeostatic systems when individual controllers -in a set of interlocked feedback loops- gain control in response to environmental changes. Taking p53 as an example, we show how Per2, ATM and Mdm2 feedback loops -interlocked with p53- gain individual control in dependence to the level of DNA damage, and how each of these controllers provide certain functionalities in their regulation of p53. In unstressed cells, the circadian regulator Per2 ensures a basic p53 level to allow its rapid up-regulation in case of DNA damage. When DNA damage occurs the ATM controller increases the level of p53 and defends it towards uncontrolled degradation, which despite DNA damage, would drive p53 to lower values and p53 dysfunction. Mdm2 on its side keeps p53 at a high but sub-apoptotic level to avoid premature apoptosis. However, with on-going DNA damage the Mdm2 set-point is increased by HSP90 and other p53 stabilizers leading finally to apoptosis. An emergent aspect of p53 upregulation during cell stress is the coordinated inhibition of ubiquitin-independent and ubiquitin-dependent degradation reactions. Whether oscillations serve a function or are merely a by-product of the controllers are discussed in view of the finding that homeostatic control of p53, as indicated above, does in principle not require oscillatory homeostats."
https://openalex.org/W3028457484,"Previous studies conducted in Nepal have not identified the potential maternal risk for underweight among children under-five years of age in resource-poor settings. Therefore, to identify these risk factors for being underweight among children under-five years old, a community-based case-control study was conducted in a rural village in the Chitwan District in Nepal. Cases were defined as children who were diagnosed as underweight based on low weight per age, whereas controls were the children with normal weight for their age. Mothers of 93 cases and 186 controls were invited for an interview to collect the data. More than half of underweight children were female (51.6%) and nearly one third of them (31.2%) were aged 13-24 months. Nearly, 30% of the cases belonged to families in the lowest wealth quintile and 82% of cases were from food insecure families. Logistic regression analysis showed that children of mothers who were illiterate had 1.48 times the odds of being underweight compared to whose mothers were not illiterate (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.53-3.07)). Children whose mother had not completed their postnatal care (PNC) were 3.16 more times likely to be underweight compared to children of mothers who completed PNC (95% CI: 1.24-8.03). The children who received care from other family members besides their mothers were 6.05 times more likely to be underweight (95% CI: 1.44-25.42); the children having mothers who had no income at all had 5.13 times the odds of being underweight (95% CI: 1.27-20.71) and children with diarrhea episodes within one month were 2.09 times more likely to be underweight (95% CI:1.02-4.31) compared to those children without any diarrhea episodes within one month. Women should be encouraged to take care of their children themselves, seek PNC services and take precautions to protect their children from diarrhea. Also, enabling factors such as education and improved income for women can help to reduce malnutrition among children."
https://openalex.org/W3028032465,"Although polyploidy is pervasive and its evolutionary significance has been recognized, it remains unclear how newly formed polyploid species become established. In particular, the impact of multiple origins on genetic differentiation among populations of a polyploid species and whether lineages of independent origins have different evolutionary potentials remain open questions. We used population genetic and phylogenetic approaches to identify genetic differentiation between lineages with independent origins within an allotetraploid fern, Lepisorus nigripes. A total of 352 individuals from 51 populations were collected throughout the distribution range. To examine the genetic structure, multilocus genotyping, Bayesian population structure analysis, and neighbor-net analysis were carried out using single-copy nuclear genes. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to detect recurrent polyploid origins. Proportions of abortive spores were analysed as the measure of postzygotic reproductive isolation. Two genetically distinct lineages, the East-type and the West-type, were distributed mainly in the eastern and western parts, respectively, of the Japanese archipelago. Phylogenetic analyses indicated independent origins of these types and detected additional independent origins within each type. We also revealed limited genetic recombination between both types, even in their sympatric regions. F1 hybrids between the East- and West-types showed a reduction in fertility. It is likely that the East- and West-types formed independently in the eastern and western parts of Japan, respectively. The limited genetic recombination and reduced fertility of hybrids suggest that the two types are at an incipient stage of speciation. Two polyploid lineages with independent geographic origins could develop reproductive isolation barrier(s)."
https://openalex.org/W3028066913,"Reproductive success of endangered Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) colonies in Peru has been associated with nesting habitat type, presumably due to differences in environmental exposure and activity patterns that may affect energy demands and metabolism. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to determine serum concentrations of 19 saccharides from 30 Humboldt penguins nesting at Punta San Juan, Peru in order to evaluate differences in metabolic state between penguins nesting in a sheltered burrow or crevice (n = 17) and those in exposed surface nests (n = 13). Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses identified serum saccharides (arabinose, maltose, glucose-6-phosphate, and levoglucosenone in particular) that were nest-dimorphic with substantial differences between surface- and sheltered-nesting penguins. Four sugars (arabinose, xylose, fructose-6-phosphate, and sucrose) had ≥ 2-fold difference in concentration between nest types. Seven saccharides were in the top five subsets generated by discriminant analysis; four of these are simple sugars (D-glucopyranose, α ⇄ β; D-glucose; D-maltose; and D-mannose) and three are derivatives (glucose 6-phosphate, levoglucosenone, and N-acetylglucosamine). D-ribose had the highest information values (generated from weight-of-evidence values) followed by glucose 6-phosphate, levoglucosenone, and D-galactose. Sex was not a significant predictor of saccharide concentration. Levoglucosenone, which is a metabolite of the environmental contaminant levoglucosan, was significantly higher in surface-nesting penguins, reflecting a higher rate of exposure in non-sheltered penguins. Differences in the saccharide profiles of surface- and sheltered-nesting Humboldt penguins likely reflect increased metabolic requirements of surface-nesters at Punta San Juan. Conservation of appropriate sheltered-nesting habitat for penguins is essential for sustained reproductive success and colony health."
https://openalex.org/W3028389310,"Nitrogen (N) availability is an important factor regulating the feedback mechanisms of global change. This research uses a small Calamagrostis angustifolia wetland i = on the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China as the research object and 15N tracer technology to study the effects of different nitrogen deposition levels (0 gN/m2, 4 gN/m2, and 8 gN/m2) through in situ controlled field experiments. Temporal and spatial distribution patterns of nitrogen in plants and soils and their short-term effects on nitrous oxide emissions fluxes were studied. The results showed that 1) the nitrogen content in the stems, leaves and roots of C. angustifolia decreased slowly with the growing season. Nitrogen application significantly increased the absorption of tracer nitrogen in the aboveground and underground plant parts (P<0.01), and the more nitrogen applied, the larger the absorption amount was (P<0.01). The absorbed amount accounted for 52%-86% of the total tracer nitrogen. 2) The tracer nitrogen in the soil did not show a significant change; the more nitrogen that was applied, the more nitrogen that was retained in the soil, and the tracer nitrogen adsorbed by the soil was mainly ammonium nitrogen. 3) The variation in the 15N-labeled nitric oxide emissions flux under different nitrogen treatments was consistent; nitrogen application increased the 15N-labeled nitric oxide emissions flux, but the difference between the low-nitrogen and high-nitrogen treatments was not significant (P>0.05)."
