https://openalex.org/W2005291574,"Lignocellulosic biomass has long been recognized as a potential sustainable source of mixed sugars for fermentation to biofuels and other biomaterials. Several technologies have been developed during the past 80 years that allow this conversion process to occur, and the clear objective now is to make this process cost-competitive in today's markets. Here, we consider the natural resistance of plant cell walls to microbial and enzymatic deconstruction, collectively known as “biomass recalcitrance.” It is this property of plants that is largely responsible for the high cost of lignocellulose conversion. To achieve sustainable energy production, it will be necessary to overcome the chemical and structural properties that have evolved in biomass to prevent its disassembly."

To provide a truly widespread primary energy source, solar energy must be captured, converted, and stored in a cost-effective fashion. New developments in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and the materials and physical sciences may enable step-change approaches to cost-effective, globally scalable systems for solar energy use."
https://openalex.org/W2014606320,"Extensive studies are currently being performed to associate disease susceptibility with one form of genetic variation, namely, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In recent years, another type of common genetic variation has been characterized, namely, structural variation, including copy number variants (CNVs). To determine the overall contribution of CNVs to complex phenotypes, we have performed association analyses of expression levels of 14,925 transcripts with SNPs and CNVs in individuals who are part of the International HapMap project. SNPs and CNVs captured 83.6% and 17.7% of the total detected genetic variation in gene expression, respectively, but the signals from the two types of variation had little overlap. Interrogation of the genome for both types of variants may be an effective way to elucidate the causes of complex phenotypes and disease in humans."

Increasing its share in the world matrix will help prolong the existence of fossil fuel reserves, address the threats posed by climate change, and enable better security of the energy supply on a global scale. Most of the “new renewable energy sources” are still undergoing large-scale commercial development, but some technologies are already well established. These include Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, which, after 30 years of production, is a global energy commodity that is fully competitive with motor gasoline and appropriate for replication in many countries."
https://openalex.org/W1999775510,"Rett syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mosaic expression of mutant copies of the X-linked MECP2 gene in neurons. However, neurons do not die, which suggests that this is not a neurodegenerative disorder. An important question for future therapeutic approaches to this and related disorders concerns phenotypic reversibility. Can viable but defective neurons be repaired, or is the damage done during development without normal MeCP2 irrevocable? Using a mouse model, we demonstrate robust phenotypic reversal, as activation of MeCP2 expression leads to striking loss of advanced neurological symptoms in both immature and mature adult animals."
https://openalex.org/W2008841394,"A central issue in the regulation of apoptosis by the Bcl-2 family is whether its BH3-only members initiate apoptosis by directly binding to the essential cell-death mediators Bax and Bak, or whether they can act indirectly, by engaging their pro-survival Bcl-2–like relatives. Contrary to the direct-activation model, we show that Bax and Bak can mediate apoptosis without discernable association with the putative BH3-only activators (Bim, Bid, and Puma), even in cells with no Bim or Bid and reduced Puma. Our results indicate that BH3-only proteins induce apoptosis at least primarily by engaging the multiple pro-survival relatives guarding Bax and Bak."
https://openalex.org/W2098656972,"Postpartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a disease of unknown etiology and exposes women to high risk of mortality after delivery. Here, we show that female mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of stat3 develop PPCM. In these mice, cardiac cathepsin D (CD) expression and activity is enhanced and associated with the generation of a cleaved antiangiogenic and proapoptotic 16 kDa form of the nursing hormone prolactin. Treatment with bromocriptine, an inhibitior of prolactin secretion, prevents the development of PPCM, whereas forced myocardial generation of 16 kDa prolactin impairs the cardiac capillary network and function, thereby recapitulating the cardiac phenotype of PPCM. Myocardial STAT3 protein levels are reduced and serum levels of activated CD and 16 kDa prolactin are elevated in PPCM patients. Thus, a biologically active derivative of the pregnancy hormone prolactin mediates PPCM, implying that inhibition of prolactin release may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for PPCM.

Postpartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a disease of unknown etiology, characterized by an acute onset of heart failure in women in the late stage of pregnancy up to several months postpartum, resulting in high mortality despite optimal medical therapy (Elkayam et al., 2005Elkayam U.

In PPCM patients, serum markers of inflammation and apoptosis are significantly elevated, which appears to predict impaired functional status and mortality, consistent with the idea that inflammation and apoptosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of PPCM (Sliwa et al., 2006Sliwa K.

Heart Fail. 2002; 4: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In line with these clinical observations, it has been shown that transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the α subunit of Gq develop PPCM, which could be attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of apoptosis (Hayakawa et al., 2003Hayakawa Y. Chandra M. Miao W. Shirani J. Brown J.H. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Armstrong R.C. Kitsis R.N.

We noted that female mice with a homozygous or heterozygous cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of STAT3 (αMHC-cre+/o; stat3flox/flox: CKO; αMHC-cre+/o; stat3flox/+: HET) develop PPCM in a dose-dependent manner (CKO > HET). Notably, STAT3 is involved in protection of the heart from oxidative stress by upregulation of antioxidative enzymes such as the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) (Negoro et al., 2001Negoro S. Kunisada K. Fujio Y. Funamoto M. Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Osugi T. Izumi M. Oshima Y. Nakaoka Y. et al.Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protects cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced oxidative stress through the upregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase.Circulation. 2001; 104: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). STAT3 also plays an important role in promoting myocardial angiogenesis both by paracrine and autocrine mechanisms in cardiomyocytes and nonmyocytes (Bartoli et al., 2003Bartoli M. Platt D.

USA. 2000; 97: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the above genetic mouse model to investigate potential underlying mechanisms, which may initiate and/or drive PPCM. We found a detrimental link between enhanced oxidative stress and cleavage of the pregnancy hormone prolactin (PRL) into an antiangiogenic 16 kDa form (Corbacho et al., 2002Corbacho A.M.

Furthermore, we explored similarities between PPCM in mice and humans and initiated a novel therapeutic strategy with the PRL inhibitor bromocriptine in woman with a high risk of developing PPCM. Nulli-pari CKO (CKO-NP) and HET females (HET-NP) develop normally and do not show signs of heart failure or increased mortality. At the age of 6 months, cardiac function is normal and comparable with sisters harboring two copies of the floxed stat3 allele (NT-NP) without the αMHC-cre+/o transgene (Table 1, HET-NP, data not shown).Table 1HW:BW, Cardiac Dimensions, and Function in NT and CKO Female Mice Postpartum with or without Treatment with BRNPPPPP/BRNTCKONTCKONTCKOHW:BW (mg:g)3.8 ± 0.53.7 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.5∗5.5 ± 1.2∗#4.1 ± 0.54.5 ± 0.7∗∗LVEDD (mm)3.5 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.43.9 ± 0.2∗∗4.8 ± 1.0∗∗#3.9 ± 0.2∗3.6 ± 0.2LVESD (mm)2.2 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.52.7 ± 0.4∗∗3.8 ± 1.3∗∗#2.5 ± 0.1∗2.3 ± 0.3IVSD (mm)0.69 ± 0.070.69 ± 0.100.72 ± 0.190.80 ± 0.210.65 ± 0.060.62 ± 0.08IVSS (mm)1.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.4#1.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.2LVPWD (mm)0.53 ± 0.110.50 ± 0.080.64 ± 0.11∗0.50 ± 0.050.50 ± 0.080.52 ± 0.08LVPWS (mm)0.97 ± 0.100.87 ± 0.120.98 ± 0.250.58 ± 0.20∗#0.90 ± 0.140.80 ± 0.16FS (%)38 ± 333 ± 532 ± 7∗14 ± 8∗∗##38 ± 436 ± 9HR (beats/min)350 ± 54343 ± 74312 ± 31326 ± 72300 ± 31303 ± 54Postpartum (PP), postpartum/BR (PP/BR), and age-matched nulli-pari (NP) females were utilized for these studies. Heart-to-body-weight ratio (HW:BW), LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), end-systolic diameter (LVESD), intraventricular septum thickness in diastole (IVSD) or in systole (IVSS), LV posterior wall thickness in diastole (LVPWD) and systole (LVPWS), fractional shortening (FS), and heart rate (HR) were determined by transthoracic echocardiography in sedated mice.

No pregnancy-associated cardiac phenotype or mortality was observed in 20 NT sisters (Figure 1A) or ten females with only the cre transgene (αMHC-cre+/o: C+/+-PP; Figure 1A and Table S1, in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Thus, neither the floxed stat3 allele alone nor cre alone had an adverse effect peri- and postpartum. By contrast, physiological stresses of pregnancy, labor, and/or nursing resulted in PPCM in all of the 53 CKO females studied. Roughly two-thirds (37 out of 53 CKO females versus 0 out of 20 NT-PP females, p < 0.01) had died after the second pregnancy (Figure 1A). Notably, no CKO female survived more than five pregnancies. In HET females, PPCM-related death was found after three to four deliveries (Figure 1A). Death occurred always within the first 3 weeks after delivery. After two and four pregnancies, respectively, the majority of CKO and HET females presented signs of overt heart failure, such as generalized edema and labored breathing. The hearts were characterized by four-chamber dilatation, often with thrombi in the atria, extensive fibrosis (Figure 1B), and an increase in cardiomyocyte length (Table S2 and Figure S1). Echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) dilatation and depressed fractional shortening in CKO-PP and HET-PP females (Table 1 and Table S3) compared with NT-PP females. CKO-PP females showed increased cardiac mRNA levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) (Chi and Karliner, 2004Chi N.C. Karliner J.S. Molecular determinants of responses to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury: focus on hypoxia-inducible and heat shock factors.Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and BNIP3 (Kubasiak et al., 2002Kubasiak L.A. Hernandez O.M. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Hypoxia and acidosis activate cardiac myocyte death through the Bcl-2 family protein BNIP3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12825-12830Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C) and a markedly reduced content of energy-rich phosphates, ATP (−68% ± 7%, p < 0.01 versus NT-PP), and ADP (−57% ± 10%, p < 0.01 versus NT-PP), indicative for cardiac hypoxia. Cardiac apoptosis, as indicated by an increased number of TUNEL-positive cells (cardiomyocytes and nonmyocytes) and protein levels of activated caspase-3 (act-Casp-3), was substantially higher in CKO-PP females compared with NT-PP females (Figures 1D and 1E) or C+/+-PP females (Figure S2). In NT-Prg (day 17 of pregnancy) and NT-PP females, we observed increased Tyr-705 phosphorylation of STAT3 (Figure 1F). As expected, cardiac STAT3 was barely detectable in CKO females (Figure 1F) and STAT3 signals were markedly reduced in the isolated cardiomyocyte-enriched fraction, but not in the nonmyocyte fraction of CKO-PP compared with NT-PP hearts, (Figure S2), indicating that STAT3 activation in LVs from NT-PP mice is mainly occurring in cardiomyocytes. Prolactin (PRL) serum levels increased late in pregnancy and postpartum and are known to activate STAT3 (Cataldo et al., 2000Cataldo L. Chen N.Y. Yuan Q. Li W. Ramamoorthy P. Wagner T.E. Sticca R.P. Chen W.Y. Inhibition of oncogene STAT3 phosphorylation by a prolactin antagonist, hPRL-G129R, in T-47D human breast cancer cells.Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 1179-1185PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, infusion of recombinant PRL activated STAT3 in the heart in vivo, and addition of PRL to cultured cardiomyocytes activated STAT3 in vitro (Figure S3). Pregnancy induces a reversible physiological hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes (Eghbali et al., 2005Eghbali M. Deva R. Alioua A. Minosyan T.Y. Ruan H. Wang Y. Toro L. Stefani E. Molecular and functional signature of heart hypertrophy during pregnancy.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1208-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CKO-Prg and NT-Prg females showed a similar increase in cardiomyocyte growth (cross-sectional area and length; Figure S1 and Table S2), indicative for normal Prg-induced cardiac hypertrophy in CKO-Prg females. Physiological hypertrophy, as it is observed during pregnancy (Eghbali et al., 2005Eghbali M. Deva R. Alioua A. Minosyan T.Y. Ruan H. Wang Y. Toro L. Stefani E. Molecular and functional signature of heart hypertrophy during pregnancy.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1208-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), requires the proportional growth of the capillary network (Hudlicka and Brown, 1996Hudlicka O. Brown M.D. Postnatal growth of the heart and its blood vessels.J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 266-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In NT-Prg and CKO-Prg females, the ratio of capillaries to cardiomyocytes increased to a similar degree (Figures 2A and 2B). This increased capillary density was maintained in NT-PP females, although it had decreased to prepregnancy levels in CKO-PP females (Figures 2A and 2B). The reduction in the LV capillary density in CKO-PP mice was paralleled with decreased expression of VEGF (CKO-PP: mRNA, −30% ± 15%; VEGF protein: −56% ± 22% versus NT-PP, p < 0.05) and of von Willebrandt Factor (CKO-PP: vWF mRNA, −26% ± 16% versus NT-PP, p < 0.05). STAT3 is known to protect cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress in part by the upregulation of the ROS scavenging enzyme MnSOD (Negoro et al., 2001Negoro S. Kunisada K. Fujio Y. Funamoto M. Darville M.I. Eizirik D.L. Osugi T. Izumi M. Oshima Y. Nakaoka Y. et al.Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 protects cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced oxidative stress through the upregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase.Circulation. 2001; 104: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). NT-PP mice showed a marked increase in cardiac MnSOD protein levels compared to NT-NP, whereas only a moderate increase was observed in CKO-PP females (Figure 2D). Likewise, cardiac MnSOD mRNA levels were higher in NT-PP than CKO-PP females (NT-PP: +54% ± 1% versus CKO-PP, p < 0.05). The production of ROS was enhanced in LVs from CKO-PP compared with NT-PP females as determined by dihydroethidium fluorescence staining, (5 days postpartum: +91% ± 32% versus NT-PP, p < 0.05, Figure 2C; and 3 weeks postpartum CKO-PP: +48% ± 23% versus NT-PP, p < 0.05) and as determined by NADH-stimulated superoxide production measured by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (3 weeks postpartum: CKO-PP: +122% ± 71% versus NT-PP, p < 0.05). We assessed whether the pharmacological suppressor of ROS, tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP), a substance with catalytic activities similar to MnSOD (Houstis et al., 2006Houstis N. Rosen E.D. Lander E.S. Reactive oxygen species have a causal role in multiple forms of insulin resistance.Nature. 2006; 440: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar), would prevent PPCM. In fact, MnTBAP attenuated ROS generation in CKO females (CKO-MnTBAP: +6% ± 7% versus NT-PP, n.s.; Figure 2B), the upregulation of activated cathepsin D (CD) and act-Casp-3 protein, and the increase in β-myosin heavy chain (βMHC) mRNA (Figure S4). Moreover, CKO-MnTBAP females showed preserved cardiac capillary density (Figure S4) and cardiac function (Table S4) and displayed no postpartum-related mortality (0% in CKO-MnTBAP, n = 12, after two subsequent pregnancies). Despite preserved cardiac function, MnTBAP did not prevent the LV dilatation (Table S4) and the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) mRNA (Figure S4), indicating only a partial suppression of the PPCM phenotype in CKO females. PRL, a dominant hormone in pregnancy and early postpartum, can exert opposing effects on angiogenesis depending on proteolytic processing of the proangiogenic full-length 23 kDa PRL into an antiangiogenic 16 kDa form (Corbacho et al., 2002Corbacho A.M. Martinez De La Escalera G. Clapp C. Roles of prolactin and related members of the prolactin/growth hormone/placental lactogen family in angiogenesis.J.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An antibody recognizing both forms of PRL (Lkhider et al., 2004Lkhider M. Castino R. Bouguyon E. Isidoro C. Ollivier-Bousquet M. Cathepsin D released by lactating rat mammary epithelial cells is involved in prolactin cleavage under physiological conditions.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5155-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed immunoreactivity in LV sections of nursing CKO-PP and NT-PP females, but not in LV sections of NT-NP or CKO-NP females (Figure S5), whereas in western blot analysis, neither this nor other commercially available antibodies against PRL revealed reproducible quantitative or qualitative results. However, in an ex vivo assay (Lkhider et al., 2004Lkhider M. Castino R. Bouguyon E. Isidoro C. Ollivier-Bousquet M. Cathepsin D released by lactating rat mammary epithelial cells is involved in prolactin cleavage under physiological conditions.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5155-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using supernatant of minced LV tissue from CKO-PP females, a high cleavage activity for recombinant PRL into the 16 kDa form was observed, whereas no cleaved 16 kDa PRL was generated from LV tissue extracts of CKO-NP, NT-PP, CKO-Prg, or NT-Prg mice (Figure 3A). Among the proteolytic enzymes known to process PRL, CD very efficiently cleaves PRL into its 16 kDa form (Corbacho et al., 2002Corbacho A.M. Martinez De La Escalera G. Clapp C.

Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In fact, the PRL cleaving activity of CKO-PP LV supernatant was attenuated by preincubation with the CD inhibitor pepstatin A (Lkhider et al., 2004Lkhider M. Castino R. Bouguyon E. Isidoro C. Ollivier-Bousquet M. Cathepsin D released by lactating rat mammary epithelial cells is involved in prolactin cleavage under physiological conditions.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5155-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or by preabsorbing the supernatant with a CD neutralizing antibody (Figures 3A and 3B), implicating that CD is the major PRL cleavage enzyme in CKO-PP hearts. Oxidative stress promotes the release of CD from lysosomes into the cytosol in cardiomyocytes (Corbacho et al., 2002Corbacho A.M. Martinez De La Escalera G. Clapp C.

Oxidative stress causes relocation of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D with ensuing apoptosis in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1151-1156PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac protein levels of the active single chain mature form of CD (CD Msc) were markedly upregulated in CKO-PP females compared with those in NT-PP, NT-NP, and CKO-NP females (Figure 3C), but expression of activated CD was attenuated in CKO-MnTBAP females (Figure S4). LV sections from NT-NP and CKO-NP females showed weak staining for CD in cardiomyocytes (Figure 3D), whereas marked staining for CD was observed in cardiomyocytes and the LV interstitium of CKO-PP and HET-PP females (Figure 3D). CD cleavage activity was substantially enhanced in supernatants of minced LVs of CKO-PP females compared with CKO-NP or NT-PP females (Figure 3E). Cultured cardiomyocytes infected with a CD expressing adenovirus (CD-Ad) released active CD forms into the cell culture medium, which processed 23 kDa PRL into 16 kDa PRL (Figure S6). We analyzed the effect of locally produced CD in the presence of high systemic PRL levels by injecting a CD expressing adenovirus (CD-Ad) into hearts of NT-PRL or control females (NT-NaCl). Seven days after infection with CD-Ad, NT-PRL mice showed severe cardiac damage (Figure 3F), including elevated levels of act-Casp-3 (Figure 3G) and enhanced mortality compared with NT-NaCl mice infected with CD-Ad (mortality: CD-Ad in NT-PRL, 33%, n = 9; versus 0% in CD-Ad in NT-NaCl, n = 7). Enhanced cardiac CD expression was detected in all CD-Ad-infected mice. PRL, notably mainly the cleaved 16 kDa form, could only be detected in females that were chronically infused with recombinant 23 kDa PRL (Figure 3G). To examine the effect of the 16 kDa PRL in the heart, we injected adenoviral vectors expressing human 16 kDa PRL (16K-Ad) or lacZ (lacZ-Ad) as control into the LV wall of NT-NP females. Two weeks after infection, persistent cardiac expression of 16 kDa PRL was observed in 16K-Ad-infected females that was associated with LV dilatation and decreased cardiac function compared with lacZ-Ad-infected females (Figures 4A–4C). The 16 kDa PRL expression was paralleled by decreased cardiac capillary density (−31% ± 12%, p < 0.05, Figure 4D), reduced VEGF expression, and increased protein levels of act-Casp-3 (Figure 4A). Infection with 16K-Ad did not alter the LV:BW ratio or the cardiomyocyte CSA (Figure S6). In cultured cardiomyocytes, survival was similar after infection with the 16K-Ad or the lacZ-Ad (Figure S6). However, 16K-Ad infection of cultured cardiomyocytes impaired their metabolic activity (Figure S6). Chronic infusion (3 weeks) of recombinant full-length 23 kDa PRL in NT-NP and CKO-NP (NT-PRL and CKO-PRL) in absence of postpartum-associated stress did not affect cardiac function and survival (Table S5). Activation of STAT5 was observed in LVs of NT-PRL and CKO-PRL mice (Figure S3), in line with studies implicating STAT5 as a preferential target for PRL (Cataldo et al., 2000Cataldo L. Chen N.Y. Yuan Q. Li W. Ramamoorthy P. Wagner T.E. Sticca R.P. Chen W.Y. Inhibition of oncogene STAT3 phosphorylation by a prolactin antagonist, hPRL-G129R, in T-47D human breast cancer cells.Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 1179-1185PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation with 23 kDa PRL enhanced the activation of STAT3 in NT-NP hearts in vivo and in cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro (Figure S3). In line with described proangiogenic effects of 23 kDa PRL (Corbacho et al., 2002Corbacho A.M. Martinez De La Escalera G. Clapp C. Roles of prolactin and related members of the prolactin/growth hormone/placental lactogen family in angiogenesis.J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 219-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the myocardial capillary density was slightly enhanced in NT-PRL and CKO-PRL females (Table S5). The role of PRL for the development of PPCM was tested by preventing its release from the pituitary glands using bromocriptine (BR), a dopamine-D2-receptor agonist, known to block PRL efficiently in humans (Harrison, 1979Harrison R.G. Suppression of lactation.Semin. Perinatol. 1979; 3: 287-297PubMed Google Scholar) and mice (Nagafuchi et al., 1999Nagafuchi H. Suzuki N. Kaneko A. Asai T. Sakane T. Prolactin locally produced by synovium infiltrating T lymphocytes induces excessive synovial cell functions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.J. Rheumatol. 1999; 26: 1890-1900PubMed Google Scholar). CKO (CKO-BR) and NT (NT-BR) females were treated with BR for two consecutive pregnancies. The efficient blockade of PRL release was confirmed by the following observations: (1) in contrast to NT-PP and CKO-PP females with detectable PRL antigens in LV sections, LV sections from NT-BR and CKO-BR mice were negative for PRL staining (Figure S5), (2) NT-BR and CKO-BR were not able to nurse their offspring because pups appeared underdeveloped three days after birth, and (c) the increased activation of STAT5, the preferential target of PRL, was attenuated in CKO-BR and NT-BR females (Figure S7). BR prevented postpartum mortality in CKO-BR females (mortality after two pregnancies: 0% in CKO-BR females, n = 12 versus 70% in CKO-PP females, n = 53, p < 0.01) and preserved postpartum angiogenesis (Figures 2A and 2B), cardiac function, and dimensions (Figure 1B, Table 1, and Figure S8). BR also prevented cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1E), attenuated the mRNA expression of HIF1α and BNIP3 (Figure 1C) and βMHC and MMP3 (Figure S8), and normalized the expression of αMHC (Figure S8) in CKO-BR females. BR did not reduce ROS production in the early state (5 days postpartum) of treatment (CKO-BR: +67% ± 9% versus CKO-PP: 91% ± 32%, n.s., Figure 2C). After 3 weeks of postpartum treatment, however, ROS production in CKO-BR was markedly reduced (CKO-BR: +7% ± 23% versus CKO-PP 48% ± 23%, p < 0.05, Figure S8). In NT-BR females, cardiac function, cardiac angiogenesis, blood pressure, and heart frequency were not affected (Table 1 and Tables S6–S8). Thus, we did not identify direct effects of BR on the myocardium. To explore whether STAT3 is involved in human PPCM as well, STAT3 protein levels were quantified in LV tissue obtained from PPCM patients (n = 5) at the time of transplantation and compared with levels in similar LV tissues of otherwise normal human hearts (n = 7). Figure 5A shows reduced STAT3 protein levels in LVs from patients with PPCM compared with normal human LVs. In the serum of lactating patients with PPCM, levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a marker for oxidative stress (Weinbrenner et al., 2003Weinbrenner T. Cladellas M. Isabel Covas M. Fito M. Tomas M. Senti M. Bruguera J. Marrugat J. High oxidative stress in patients with stable coronary heart disease.Atherosclerosis. 2003; 168: 99-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and CD activity were enhanced compared with healthy lactating mothers (Figures 5B and 5C). Marked levels of an antigen corresponding to the 16 kDa PRL were detected by western blot (Figure 5D) in the sera of three out of five lactating PPCM patients with obvious cardiac dysfunction at the time of serum sampling (mean percentage of EF, 24 ± 7). It is important to note that the 23 kDa form of PRL was readily detectable, whereas the 16 kDa PRL was barely detectable in healthy lactating women (n = 5, Figure 5D). Women with PPCM who recover normal cardiac function have a high risk for recurring PPCM (Sliwa et al., 2004Sliwa K. Forster O. Zhanje F. Candy G. Kachope J. Essop R.

We therefore initiated a preliminary clinical study in women who had recovered from a previous episode of PPCM and presented with a subsequent pregnancy. Six out of 12 women received BR in addition to standard therapy up to 3 months postdelivery while six patients received standard treatment (peripartum ejection fraction, EF, was similar in both groups; Table"

https://openalex.org/W2006556440,"Removing electrons from the CuO 2 plane of cuprates alters the electronic correlations sufficiently to produce high-temperature superconductivity. Associated with these changes are spectral-weight transfers from the high-energy states of the insulator to low energies. In theory, these should be detectable as an imbalance between the tunneling rate for electron injection and extraction—a tunneling asymmetry. We introduce atomic-resolution tunneling-asymmetry imaging, finding virtually identical phenomena in two lightly hole-doped cuprates: Ca 1.88 Na 0.12 CuO 2 Cl 2 and Bi 2 Sr 2 Dy 0.2 Ca 0.8 Cu 2 O 8+δ . Intense spatial variations in tunneling asymmetry occur primarily at the planar oxygen sites; their spatial arrangement forms a Cu-O-Cu bond-centered electronic pattern without long-range order but with 4 a 0 -wide unidirectional electronic domains dispersed throughout ( a 0 : the Cu-O-Cu distance). The emerging picture is then of a partial hole localization within an intrinsic electronic glass evolving, at higher hole densities, into complete delocalization and highest-temperature superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2111719518,"Cell motility proceeds by cycles of edge protrusion, adhesion, and retraction. Whether these functions are coordinated by biochemical or biomechanical processes is unknown. We find that myosin II pulls the rear of the lamellipodial actin network, causing upward bending, edge retraction, and initiation of new adhesion sites. The network then separates from the edge and condenses over the myosin. Protrusion resumes as lamellipodial actin regenerates from the front and extends rearward until it reaches newly assembled myosin, initiating the next cycle. Upward bending, observed by evanescence and electron microscopy, results in ruffle formation when adhesion strength is low. Correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy shows that the regenerating lamellipodium forms a cohesive, separable layer of actin above the lamellum. Thus, actin polymerization periodically builds a mechanical link, the lamellipodium, connecting myosin motors with the initiation of adhesion sites, suggesting that the major functions driving motility are coordinated by a biomechanical process."

For gap junctions to properly control organ formation and electrical synchronization in the heart and the brain, connexin-based hemichannels must be correctly targeted to cell-cell borders.

These findings support an unanticipated mechanism for protein delivery to points of cell-cell contact. Gap junctions, which are formed by the serial coupling of hemichannels of adjacent cells, allow direct sharing of ions and small cytoplasmic molecules. Each hemichannel is a hexamer of connexin, and the most common isoform is Connexin43 (Cx43). Gap junctions reside at cell-cell borders, where their density is of critical importance. In the heart, for example, gap junctions are concentrated at the intercalated disc (ID) that joins the ends of cardiomyocytes, and this is where they ensure propagation of action potentials (Gros and Jongsma, 1996Gros D.B.

Understanding the molecular mechanism of gap junction localization at the cell-cell border, therefore, is important not only for addressing the basic cell biological question of gap junction formation but also for developing treatments for life-threatening diseases. A model for gap junction formation has emerged from biochemical and cell biological studies over the past decade. The half-life of Cx43 is between 1 and 3 hr (Beardslee et al., 1998Beardslee M.A. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Saffitz J.E. Rapid turnover of connexin43 in the adult rat heart.Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, Laird et al., 1991Laird D.W. Puranam K.L. Revel J.P. Turnover and phosphorylation dynamics of connexin43 gap junction protein in cultured cardiac myocytes.Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), which indicates that gap junction trafficking is a dynamic process. Gap junction hemichannels that are packaged in vesicles emerge from the Golgi, reach the cortical membrane via microtubules, which have insertion sites all over the cell surface (Jordan et al., 1999Jordan K. Solan J.L. Dominguez M. Sia M. Hand A. Lampe P.D. Laird D.W. Trafficking, assembly, and function of a connexin43-green fluorescent protein chimera in live mammalian cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2033-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Lauf et al., 2002Lauf U. Giepmans B.N. Lopez P. Braconnot S. Chen S.C. Falk M.M.

USA. 2002; 99: 10446-10451Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and form clusters of gap junctions known as plaques at cell-cell borders. FRAP studies show that connexin hemichannels can float freely within the cortical membrane (Lauf et al., 2002Lauf U. Giepmans B.N. Lopez P. Braconnot S. Chen S.C. Falk M.M. Dynamic trafficking and delivery of connexons to the plasma membrane and accretion to gap junctions in living cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 10446-10451Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Over a time course of tens of minutes or hours, newer hemichannels are evident first at the plaque perimeter and later on throughout the plaque (Gaietta et al., 2002Gaietta G. Deerinck T.J. Adams S.R. Bouwer J. Tour O. Laird D.W. Sosinsky G.E. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Multicolor and electron microscopic imaging of connexin trafficking.Science. 2002; 296: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, Lauf et al., 2002Lauf U. Giepmans B.N. Lopez P.

USA. 2002; 99: 10446-10451Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which leads to this commonly held view of gap junction plaque formation: after their microtubule-mediated delivery, hemichannels diffuse laterally within the membrane to cell-cell border regions. In this model, hemichannels that coalesce at the periphery of the plaques then move inwards, and those reaching the center of the plaque become internalized for degradation as annular gap junctions (Laird, 2005Laird D.W. Connexin phosphorylation as a regulatory event linked to gap junction internalization and degradation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, Segretain and Falk, 2004Segretain D. Falk M.M. Regulation of connexin biosynthesis, assembly, gap junction formation, and removal.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1662: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The current model is the simplest scenario that could account for the experiments reported thus far, but it does not explain how plaques occur at specific locations of the cell membrane. While junctional proteins such as ZO-1 may retain connexins (Giepmans and Moolenaar, 1998Giepmans B.N. Moolenaar W.H. The gap junction protein connexin43 interacts with the second PDZ domain of the zona occludens-1 protein.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 931-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), few other connexin-binding proteins have been identified. In multiple tissues, gap junctions colocalize with adherens junctions (AJs) formed by cadherins. At the cardiac ID, the AJs are assembled prior to the establishment of a Cx43 gap junction plaque (Angst et al., 1997Angst B.D. Khan L.U. Severs N.J. Whitely K. Rothery S. Thompson R.P. Magee A.I. Gourdie R.G. Dissociated spatial patterning of gap junctions and cell adhesion junctions during postnatal differentiation of ventricular myocardium.Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Notably, mislocalized Cx43 plaques in ischemic myocardium are associated with similarly mislocalized AJs (Matsushita et al., 1999Matsushita T. Oyamada M. Fujimoto K. Yasuda Y. Masuda S. Wada Y. Oka T. Takamatsu T. Remodeling of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions at the border zone of rat myocardial infarcts.Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Indeed, transfection of E-cadherin into gap junction-incompetent cells allows the transfected cells to form functional gap junctions (Mege et al., 1988Mege R.M. Matsuzaki F. Gallin W.J. Goldberg J.I. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Construction of epithelioid sheets by transfection of mouse sarcoma cells with cDNAs for chicken cell adhesion molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1988; 85: 7274-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Moreover, N-cadherin knockout mice cannot form gap junctions (Luo and Radice, 2003Luo Y. Radice G.L. Cadherin-mediated adhesion is essential for myofibril continuity across the plasma membrane but not for assembly of the contractile apparatus.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and conditional knockout of N-cadherin in the heart causes poor expression and mislocalization of gap junctions, thus leading to arrhythmogenic death (Li et al., 2005Li J. Patel V.V. Kostetskii I. Xiong Y. Chu A.F. Jacobson J.T. Yu C. Morley G.E. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Cardiac-specific loss of N-cadherin leads to alteration in connexins with conduction slowing and arrhythmogenesis.Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Since Cx43-laden microtubules must interact with the plasma membrane to deliver the hemichannels and because cadherin-mediated signaling is implicated in microtubule regulation (Jamora and Fuchs, 2002Jamora C. Fuchs E. Intercellular adhesion, signalling and the cytoskeleton.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E101-E108Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), we wondered whether plaque formation involves microtubule interaction with the AJ. We looked into the possible involvement of the microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) because they control microtubule dynamics and could be captured by membrane-associated proteins (Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2005Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C. Microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins: mechanisms and functions.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, Mimori-Kiyosue et al., 2005Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Grigoriev I. Lansbergen G. Sasaki H. Matsui C. Severin F. Galjart N. Grosveld F.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Among the +TIPs, the dimeric EB1 associates directly with the plus ends of microtubules and has dual binding sites for a number of proteins, including p150(Glued) (Berrueta et al., 1999Berrueta L. Tirnauer J.S. Schuyler S.C. Pellman D. Bierer B.E. The APC-associated protein EB1 associates with components of the dynactin complex and cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 425-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is a component of the dynein/dynactin complex. The dynein/dynactin complex, in turn, can tether microtubules at AJs (Chausovsky et al., 2000Chausovsky A. Bershadsky A.D. Borisy G.G. Cadherin-mediated regulation of microtubule dynamics.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Ligon et al., 2001Ligon L.A. Karki S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L. Dynein binds to beta-catenin and may tether microtubules at adherens junctions.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed plaques formed by fluorescently tagged Cx43 in HeLa cells that do not express endogenous Cx43. Within a few minutes following the photobleaching of a plaque and its surrounding area in our FRAP studies, there was rapid replenishment of fluorescent Cx43 within the plaque but not in the bleached surrounding area. The recovery was sensitive to reagents that alter microtubule dynamics. Time lapse imaging of live cells expressing fluorescently tagged EB1 and Cx43 further showed that microtubule plus ends approached the plaque more frequently than they approached the rest of the cortical membrane and that they remained at the plaque for longer periods of time. Moreover, gap junction plaque formation was disrupted by siRNA knockdown of EB1, of its binding partner p150(Glued), and of the AJ protein β-catenin. It was further disrupted by the application of peptides that compromise homophilic cadherin interactions at the AJ. In addition, TIRF microscopy showed enhanced EB1 interaction and Cx43 vesicle delivery to the cell surface that rested on coverslips coated with cadherin extracellular domains. Thus, mammalian cells use +TIPs for targeted delivery of Cx43 to form gap junction plaques that are spatially coincident with AJs; this mechanism could restrict intercellular communication to cells of the same tissue type. In isolated HeLa cells transiently transfected with a construct containing Cx43 tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (Cx43-YFP), Cx43-YFP was concentrated in the perinuclear Golgi. The protein then translocates to the cell-cell border when two cells came into contact. Imaging isolated cells with low levels of Cx43-YFP expression with long exposure times indicated that Cx43-YFP is localized to microtubules (Figure 1A). To avoid artifacts due to fixation, we repeated the imaging but did so in pairs of live HeLa cells with shorter exposure time at multiple Z planes, and we used deconvolution software to resolve the distribution of GFP-α-tubulin and Cx43-RFP (Figure 1B), which showed a strong correlation between cortical microtubule ends and Cx43 plaques. Within sparsely populated plaques, it is possible to resolve individual microtubules and their orientations and locations relative to Cx43 distribution, revealing direct association of microtubule tips with the plaque regions with the highest Cx43 intensity (Figures 1C and 1D). Next, in FRAP studies we used a confocal microscope to follow Cx43-YFP dynamics in live HeLa cells with or without treatments that alter microtubule dynamics. Entire plaques and their surrounding areas were subjected to fluorescence photobleaching, and the recovery of fluorescence was monitored every 20 s for 5 min, revealing rapid repopulation of the plaque in its original geometry. Plaque reappearance was inhibited by 100 μM nocodazole, which depolymerizes microtubules, and 10 μM Taxol, which stabilizes microtubules but prevents growth at the plus end (Morrison et al., 1998Morrison E.E. Wardleworth B.N. Askham J.M. Markham A.F. Meredith D.M. EB1, a protein which interacts with the APC tumour suppressor, is associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton throughout the cell cycle.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar; Figure 2). After bleaching in the horizontal XY plane, we recorded, depending on plaque geometries, in the horizontal plane for horizontally aligned plaques (data not shown) and in the vertical plane for vertically aligned plaques (Figure 2A), and we found no significant differences in recovery kinetics. Whereas Cx43-YFP in the cell-cell border as well as the lower level of Cx43-YFP in surrounding regions were readily detectable, pooled data from both regions revealed rapid plaque repopulation, while nonplaque regions acquired much lower levels of fluorescence (Figure 2B); this suggests direct delivery of connexin to the plaque. The efficiency of plaque formation was quantified by allowing HeLa cells transfected with Cx43-YFP to form plaques over 18–24 hr prior to the nocodazole (100 μM, 30 min) or Taxol (10 μM, 2 hr) treatment and then the effect of these reagents on isolated pairs of cells expressing Cx43-YFP was assessed (Figure 3A) by measuring the percent of the cell-cell border with cortical connexin plaques (Figure 3B). Drug treatment caused a marked reduction in the concentration of Cx43 at the cell-cell border. To test whether microtubule plus ends preferentially interact with the cortical membrane in the vicinity of connexin plaques, we cotransfected HeLa cells with Cx43-RFP and fluorescently tagged EB1, which is a marker for rapidly growing microtubule plus ends (Figure 4A), then compared time series of EB1 dynamics at Cx43 plaques, at regions of cell-cell border without Cx43 plaques, or at cell edges not in contact with other cells (Figure 4B). EB1-capped microtubules grew toward the connexin plaque three times more frequently than those approaching membrane not in contact with other cells, and each microtubule lasted on average 3.5 times longer when it was within 2 μm of a plaque (Figure 4C; Movie S1). The significantly greater microtubule plus end orientation (frequency of cortical approaches) and stabilization (duration of appearance near the cortex) at plaques (Figure 4C) are a likely underestimate because we excluded nonplaque regions without EB1. Greater EB1 orientation and stabilization at plaques may account for the rapid repopulation of plaques after photobleaching (Figure 2). Since imaging with widefield epifluorescence involves collapsing the depth of a three-dimensional structure into a plane, we used TIRF microscopy that limits the imaging depth to within 50–100 nm of the coverslip and examined cells that had been transfected with EB1-GFP and plated on coverslips coated with the extracellular domain of N-cadherin, thus allowing homophilic N-cadherin-N-cadherin contacts to form between the cell and the coverslip. Control coverslips were created with IgG. There was a much greater density of EB1 comets in the immediate vicinity of the plasma membrane and a longer EB1-cell membrane interaction in cells plated on coverslips coated with cadherin extracellular domains (Figures 4D and S1), which is consistent with the greater abundance of EB1 comets found near the cell-cell border (Figures 4A–4C). These results indicate that cadherin-based AJs may capture and anchor EB1-tipped microtubules to the plasma membrane. For direct visualization of vesicles being targeted for fusion with the cell membrane, we again used TIRF microscopy and monitored Cx43-YFP in cells plated on coverslips coated with either the extracellular domain of N-cadherin (Figures 5A and 5B) or IgG (control; Figures 5C and 5D). With TIRF microscopy to capture Cx43-YFP signals that originated only from membrane and submembrane regions, we analyzed individual Cx43 vesicle movements in the central square of the image (Figures 5A and 5C). Starting from the appearance of a vesicle in the last minute of a 5 min sequence of images (marked as time = 0 s), we manually traced the appearances and paths of five vesicles, as indicated by five differently colored lines with colored arrows marking their final positions (Figures 5B and 5D). At the end of the traced path, the vesicles typically became brighter and immobile in cells that were in contact with cadherin extracellular domains (Figure 5B; see also kymograph in Figure S2 and Movie S2). We interpreted these terminal events as being vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane, which is consistent with previous observations that most gap junctions are immobile within the plasma membrane (Jordan et al., 1999Jordan K. Solan J.L. Dominguez M. Sia M. Hand A. Lampe P.D. Laird D.W. Trafficking, assembly, and function of a connexin43-green fluorescent protein chimera in live mammalian cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2033-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The vesicles of cells contacting the extracellular domain of N-cadherin were notable for a short prefusion path length (indicating directed delivery) and a high incidence of fusion (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5E). In contrast, in cells plated on coverslips coated with IgG and no N-cadherin (Figures 5C, 5D, and 5E) vesicles exhibited few fusion events and longer path lengths (the vesicles that disappeared by the end of the minute are marked by an “X” at the end of their respective paths; see also the kymograph in Figure S2 and Movie S3). In addition to performing visual analysis and measuring path length for 158 manually tracked vesicles (Figure 5E), we quantified fusion events that were automatically computed for 35 cells (Figure 5F), which revealed that the cells plated on coverslips with N-cadherin domains have six times as many fusion events as the control cells have. In our TIRF imaging, there were rare occasions where microtubule orientation made it possible to observe a dynamic sequence in which several connexin vesicles apparently moved progressively toward the membrane just above the cadherin extracellular domains along a microtubule and fused with the membrane, thus causing a plaque at the membrane to grow in size (Movie S4). Subsequent immunofluorescence labeling of microtubules revealed their presence along the tracks for Cx43 vesicle movements. Consistent with membrane distribution of Cx43 being a function of directed delivery, the membrane patch with lowest overall Cx43 density corresponds to the regions with lowest microtubule density (middle panel, Movie S4). In addition, the computed vesicle velocity along the track, 1.8 ± 0.2 μm/s (n = 3 vesicles), is within the range of kinesin-based transport along microtubules (Hirokawa et al., 1998Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Okada Y. Kinesin and dynein superfamily proteins in organelle transport and cell division.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the notion of microtubule-based Cx43 delivery directly into a growing gap junction plaque. Next, we asked whether Cx43 plaque formation requires specific proteins that interact with the microtubule plus ends. Because Taxol can dissociate EB1 from microtubule plus ends (Morrison et al., 1998Morrison E.E. Wardleworth B.N. Askham J.M. Markham A.F. Meredith D.M. EB1, a protein which interacts with the APC tumour suppressor, is associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton throughout the cell cycle.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and because EB1 appears to be involved in microtubule tethering (Figure 4), we tested the involvement of EB1 in plaque formation by exposing HeLa cells to EB1 siRNA for 24 hr before transfecting them with Cx43-YFP. Knockdown of EB1 protein (Figures S3 and S4) caused a substantial reduction of connexin plaque formation at the cell-cell border (Figures 6C and S5) and at the cell membrane that was in contact with cadherin extracellular domain as revealed by TIRF imaging (Figures S6 and S7), but it did not prevent AJ formation in HeLa cells or hepatocytes (Figures S8 and S9). Taken together with our finding of a concentration of EB1 comets near the plaque (Figures 4C, 4D, S1, and S5; Movie S1), the requirement of endogenous EB1 for plaque formation suggests that EB1 at the microtubule plus ends may interact with proteins at the cell-cell border and enhance targeted delivery of Cx43. Lending further support to the importance of EB1 in plaque formation, EB1 coimmunoprecipitated with Cx43-YFP in transfected HeLa cells (Figure S10). The cadherin-based AJ is a highly efficient “glue” that binds cells together and may also regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton (Chausovsky et al., 2000Chausovsky A. Bershadsky A.D. Borisy G.G. Cadherin-mediated regulation of microtubule dynamics.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Waterman-Storer et al., 2000Waterman-Storer C.M. Salmon W.C. Salmon E.D. Feedback interactions between cell-cell adherens junctions and cytoskeletal dynamics in newt lung epithelial cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2471-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, β-catenin, which is the cytoplasmic binding partner of cadherin, binds dynein (Ligon et al., 2001Ligon L.A. Karki S. Tokito M. Holzbaur E.L. Dynein binds to beta-catenin and may tether microtubules at adherens junctions.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The dynein/dynactin complex is a potential cortical anchor of microtubules (Fuchs and Karakesisoglou, 2001Fuchs E. Karakesisoglou I. Bridging cytoskeletal intersections.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) since p150(Glued) in the dynactin complex has a binding domain for EB1 (Askham et al., 2002Askham J.M. Vaughan K.T. Goodson H.V. Morrison E.E. Evidence that an interaction between EB1 and p150(Glued) is required for the formation and maintenance of a radial microtubule array anchored at the centrosome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3627-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Hayashi et al., 2005Hayashi I. Wilde A. Mal T.K. Ikura M. Structural basis for the activation of microtubule assembly by the EB1 and p150(Glued) complex.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested for the involvement of p150(Glued) and β-catenin in forming gap junction plaques. Compared to HeLa cells expressing Cx43-YFP, with p150(Glued) in a cytoplasmic pool and at the cell-cell border near the plaques formed by Cx43-YFP, siRNA knockdown of p150(Glued) greatly decreased Cx43-YFP accumulation at the cortical membrane of the cell-cell border (Figures 6A, bottom row, and 6C). Reducing p150(Glued) expression also decreased EB1 dwell time at the cell border (Movie S5) but did not prevent AJ formation (Figure S11), which is consistent with the role of p150(Glued)-containing dynein/dynactin in anchoring microtubules at the cell-cell border (Dujardin and Vallee, 2002Dujardin D.L. Vallee R.B. Dynein at the cortex.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Koonce and Samso, 2004Koonce M.P. Samso M. Of rings and levers: the dynein motor comes of age.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 612-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Dynein/dynactin may thus help Cx43-containing vesicles on microtubules reach the cortex and offload connexin to the plasma membrane at the cell-cell border. If p150(Glued) connects the microtubule plus end to the AJ, β-catenin likely constitutes part of the cortical anchor, given that both β-catenin and the p150(Glued)-containing dynactin complex bind dynein. Indeed, immunocytochemistry of HeLa cells transfected with Cx43-YFP, with or without coexpression of β-catenin siRNA (Figure 6B), revealed that not only was Cx43-YFP colocalized with β-catenin, but siRNA knockdown of β-catenin also significantly reduced plaque formation (Figures 6B and 6C). We then examined the distribution of endogenous p150(Glued), β-catenin, and Cx43 in adult ventricular cardiomyocytes and found that they colocalize at the IDs. Colocalization of cardiac Cx43 and β-catenin (Figure 6D) is consistent with the observation that the ID is rich in both gap junctions and AJs. The colocalization of p150(Glued) and Cx43, both in isolated cardiomyocytes and at intact cell-cell borders of isolated pairs (Figure 6E), indicates that p150(Glued) is poised in native heart cells to connect cadherins with microtubule plus ends for Cx43 delivery. We next asked whether plaque formation also depends on cadherin. The extracellular domain of cadherin engages in homophilic interactions with cadherin from adjoining cells while the cytoplasmc domain of cadherin binds β-catenin. In order to test if functional N-cadherin on the cell membrane contributes to the formation of gap junction plaques, we applied a peptide that blocks homophilic intercellular N-cadherin interactions (Frenzel and Johnson, 1996Frenzel E.M. Johnson R.G. Gap junction formation between cultured embryonic lens cells is inhibited by antibody to N-cadherin.Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to HeLa cells already transfected with Cx43-YFP and adherent on coverslips. This treatment disrupted most cell-cell contacts, although isolated cell pairs could still be found (Figure 7A). Cells were fixed 24 hr after exposure to the peptides, and the cortic"

Their combined rate of mass loss doubled in less than a year in 2004 and then decreased in 2006 to near the previous rates, likely as a result of fast re-equilibration of calving-front geometry after retreat. Total mass loss is a fraction of concurrent gravity-derived estimates, pointing to an alternative source of loss and the need for high-resolution observations of outlet dynamics and glacier geometry for sea-level rise predictions."
https://openalex.org/W1980673831,"Nuclear receptors undergo ligand-dependent conformational changes that are required for corepressor-coactivator exchange, but whether there is an actual requirement for specific epigenetic landmarks to impose ligand dependency for gene activation remains unknown. Here we report an unexpected and general strategy that is based on the requirement for specific cohorts of inhibitory histone methyltransferases (HMTs) to impose gene-specific gatekeeper functions that prevent unliganded nuclear receptors and other classes of regulated transcription factors from binding to their target gene promoters and causing constitutive gene activation in the absence of stimulating signals. This strategy, based at least in part on an HMT-dependent inhibitory histone code, imposes a requirement for specific histone demethylases, including LSD1, to permit ligand- and signal-dependent activation of regulated gene expression. These events link an inhibitory methylation component of the histone code to a broadly used strategy that circumvents pathological constitutive gene induction by physiologically regulated transcription factors."

https://openalex.org/W2073936984,"Conflicting views exist of how circuits of the antennal lobe, the insect equivalent of the olfactory bulb, translate input from olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) into projection-neuron (PN) output. Synaptic connections between ORNs and PNs are one-to-one, yet PNs are more broadly tuned to odors than ORNs. The basis for this difference in receptive range remains unknown. Analyzing a Drosophila mutant lacking ORN input to one glomerulus, we show that some of the apparent complexity in the antennal lobe's output arises from lateral, interglomerular excitation of PNs. We describe a previously unidentified population of cholinergic local neurons (LNs) with multiglomerular processes. These excitatory LNs respond broadly to odors but exhibit little glomerular specificity in their synaptic output, suggesting that PNs are driven by a combination of glomerulus-specific ORN afferents and diffuse LN excitation. Lateral excitation may boost PN signals and enhance their transmission to third-order neurons in a mechanism akin to stochastic resonance."

In the prefusion form, G has the shape of a tripod with the fusion loops exposed, which point toward the viral membrane, and with the antigenic sites located at the distal end of the molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2091286481,"Type Ia supernovae, the thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf stars composed of carbon and oxygen, were instrumental as distance indicators in establishing the acceleration of the universe's expansion. However, the physics of the explosion are debated. Here we report a systematic spectral analysis of a large sample of well-observed type Ia supernovae. Mapping the velocity distribution of the main products of nuclear burning, we constrain theoretical scenarios. We find that all supernovae have low-velocity cores of stable iron-group elements. Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova ejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of nickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product of incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in all supernovae, having an expansion velocity of ∼11,000 kilometers per second and corresponding to a mass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the supernovae considered here burned similar masses and suggests that their progenitors had the same mass. Synthetic light-curve parameters and three-dimensional explosion simulations support this interpretation. A single explosion scenario, possibly a delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae."

Although RAIDD DD and PIDD DD are monomers, they assemble into a complex that comprises seven RAIDD DDs and five PIDD DDs. Despite the use of an asymmetric assembly mechanism, all DDs in the complex are in quasi-equivalent environments. The structure provided eight unique asymmetric interfaces, which can be classified into three types. These three types of interactions together cover a majority of the DD surface.

https://openalex.org/W1982197097,"Yeast cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle upon exposure to mating pheromones. As cells commit to a new cycle, G1 CDK activity (Cln/CDK) inhibits signaling through the mating MAPK cascade. Here we show that the target of this inhibition is Ste5, the MAPK cascade scaffold protein. Cln/CDK disrupts Ste5 membrane localization by phosphorylating a cluster of sites that flank a small, basic, membrane-binding motif in Ste5. Effective inhibition of Ste5 signaling requires multiple phosphorylation sites and a substantial accumulation of negative charge, which suggests that Ste5 acts as a sensor for high G1 CDK activity. Thus, Ste5 is an integration point for both external and internal signals. When Ste5 cannot be phosphorylated, pheromone triggers an aberrant arrest of cells outside G1 either in the presence or absence of the CDK-inhibitor protein Far1.

These findings define a mechanism and physiological benefit of restricting antiproliferative signaling to G1. Cellular decisions are commonly regulated by external signals via mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades (Qi and Elion, 2005Qi M. Elion E.A. MAP kinase pathways.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3569-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Though widely appreciated to stimulate cell proliferation, MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways can also regulate cell differentiation. Relatively little is known about how differentiation and antiproliferative signals may be integrated with or counteracted by the cell-division status of individual cells. In yeast, mating pheromones activate a MAPK cascade to trigger fusion between two haploid gamete cells (Dohlman and Thorner, 2001Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Regulation of G protein-initiated signal transduction in yeast: paradigms and principles.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This mating reaction exhibits fundamental hallmarks of differentiation: cells exit the cell cycle, induce a unique program of gene expression, and undergo morphogenetic changes that allow them to adopt a new fate. Mating pheromones cause cells to arrest specifically in the G1 stage of the cell cycle prior to the G1 → S transition step known as “Start.” However, cells that have already passed Start become refractory to pheromone arrest; this property was used to define Start as a unique point of commitment to a new round of division (Hartwell et al., 1974Hartwell L.H. Culotti J. Pringle J.R. Reid B.J. Genetic control of the cell division cycle in yeast.Science. 1974; 183: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). One contributor to the G1 specificity of pheromone arrest is the mutual antagonism between cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and Far1, a CDK inhibitor (Chang and Herskowitz, 1990Chang F. Herskowitz I.

Pheromone signaling in G1 cells allows the MAPK Fus3 to phosphorylate and activate Far1 (Chang and Herskowitz, 1992Chang F. Herskowitz I.

Conversely, as cells pass Start, Cln/CDKs phosphorylate Far1 and target it for degradation (McKinney et al., 1993McKinney J.D. Chang F. Heintz N. Cross F.R.

However, other mechanisms may play an equally critical role in restricting pheromone arrest to G1, but they are poorly understood. In particular, signal transduction through the MAPK cascade is actively inhibited by G1 CDKs in a way such that pheromone-induced transcription of mating genes (e.g., FUS1) is minimized during periods of maximum G1 cyclin expression (Oehlen and Cross, 1994Oehlen L.J.

While G1 CDK inhibition of pheromone signaling has been recognized for many years, the target and mechanism have remained elusive. Previous studies suggested that the inhibited step of the signaling pathway lay somewhere between the heterotrimeric G protein βγ dimer (Gβγ) and the first kinase of the MAPK cascade, the MAPKKK Ste11 (Wassmann and Ammerer, 1997Wassmann K.

Indeed, Cln2/CDK can phosphorylate the PAK-family kinase Ste20 (Oehlen and Cross, 1998Oehlen L.J. Cross F.R.

USA. 1999; 96: 6591-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Thus, this failed to confirm Ste20 as a relevant target. In the interim, our understanding of this signaling pathway has advanced considerably. An important step in activation of the mating pathway (see Figure 1A) is the plasma membrane recruitment of the MAPK cascade scaffold protein Ste5 by the pheromone-activated Gβγ dimer (Pryciak and Huntress, 1998Pryciak P.M.

Indeed, artificial targeting of Ste5 to the plasma membrane causes constitutive signaling (Pryciak and Huntress, 1998Pryciak P.M. Huntress F.A.

Membrane recruitment of Ste5 serves two roles: (1) it promotes activation of Ste11 by its membrane-localized activator, Ste20 (Pryciak and Huntress, 1998Pryciak P.M. Huntress F.A.

Biol. 2000; 10: 630-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and (2) it amplifies signal transmission from active Ste11 through the remainder of the kinase cascade (Lamson et al., 2006Lamson R.E. Takahashi S. Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Dual role for membrane localization in yeast MAP kinase cascade activation and its contribution to signaling fidelity.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 618-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that although Gβγ is the usual trigger for Ste5 recruitment, it is not sufficient. Instead, Ste5 also binds directly to membranes, and cooperativity between these two weak interactions (Ste5-Gβγ and Ste5-membrane) controls membrane recruitment (Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The Ste5-membrane interaction requires an N-terminal “PM” (plasma membrane-binding) domain, which is a short basic-rich amphipathic α helix that binds acidic phospholipid membranes and which can also target Ste5 to the nucleus when it is not engaged at the plasma membrane. Gain-of-function mutations in the PM domain cause increased membrane affinity, which allows Ste5 to localize to the plasma membrane and activate signaling even without Gβγ (Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that G1 CDK activity inhibits pheromone signaling by inhibiting Ste5 membrane recruitment. The Ste5 PM domain is flanked by multiple CDK sites that are phosphorylated by G1 CDKs in vivo and in vitro, and the addition of multiple negatively charged phosphates impedes binding to acidic phospholipid membranes. Furthermore, we show that when CDK regulation of Ste5 is disrupted, pheromone signaling blocks cell-cycle progression even after cells pass Start and even in the absence of Far1; this provides a physiological rationale for antagonizing pheromone signaling as cells begin a new division cycle. To identify the target of Cln/CDK inhibition we used several new tools to dissect early steps in the mating pathway. First, activated forms of various pathway components (Figure 1B) were expressed from a strong, galactose-inducible promoter (PGAL1) to bypass upstream signaling steps. We then compared signaling with and without overexpression of Cln2, which is the G1 cyclin that is most potent at inhibiting pheromone response (Oehlen and Cross, 1994Oehlen L.J. Cross F.R. G1 cyclins CLN1 and CLN2 repress the mating factor response pathway at Start in the yeast cell cycle.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1058-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). While each activation method caused strong signaling, only those that required the Ste5 PM domain could be inhibited by Cln2 (Figure 1C). Especially revealing is the comparison between Ste5-Q59L and Ste5-CTM. Both activate signaling by targeting Ste5 to the plasma membrane, and both bypass Gβγ but still require Ste20 (Pryciak and Huntress, 1998Pryciak P.M. Huntress F.A.

Huntress F.A. Membrane recruitment of the kinase cascade scaffold protein Ste5 by the Gβγ complex underlies activation of the yeast pheromone response pathway.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2684-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was resistant. Furthermore, when comparing two Ste11 derivatives, we found that Ste11-Cpr (which requires the Ste5 PM domain; Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) remained sensitive to Cln2 inhibition, whereas Ste11ΔN (which bypasses Ste5 altogether; Pryciak and Huntress, 1998Pryciak P.M. Huntress F.A. Membrane recruitment of the kinase cascade scaffold protein Ste5 by the Gβγ complex underlies activation of the yeast pheromone response pathway.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2684-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) was resistant. These results argue that G1 CDK inhibition does not act on Gβγ, Ste20, Ste11, or even the ability of Ste5 to facilitate signaling through the MAPK cascade. Instead, signaling is inhibited only when membrane localization by the Ste5 PM domain is required. In addition to promoting the initial Ste20 → Ste11 step, membrane localization of Ste5 serves a second, Ste20-independent role in boosting signal transmission from active Ste11 through the MAPK cascade (Lamson et al., 2006Lamson R.E. Takahashi S. Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Dual role for membrane localization in yeast MAP kinase cascade activation and its contribution to signaling fidelity.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 618-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of this “amplification” effect, pheromone can stimulate signaling in ste20Δ cells that harbor a preactivated Ste11 mutant, Ste11-Asp3 (Lamson et al., 2006Lamson R.E. Takahashi S. Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Dual role for membrane localization in yeast MAP kinase cascade activation and its contribution to signaling fidelity.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 618-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cln2 still inhibited this Ste20-independent response (Figure 1D), which indicates that there must be a target other than Ste20. Notably, however, partial Cln2 resistance was observed. Yet because this was true for both the Ste20-independent signaling by Ste11-Asp3 (Figure 1D) and the Ste20-dependent signaling by Ste11-Cpr (Figure 1C), it did not reflect the participation of Ste20 per se. Rather, we suggest that Cln2 inhibition is strongest when it can antagonize two successive signaling steps that each rely on Ste5 membrane localization and that it becomes incomplete when the first step is bypassed by prelocalization or preactivation of Ste11. Further experiments showed that Cln2/CDK inhibition of pheromone response could be reversed by strengthening the Ste5-membrane interaction. First, mutations in the PM domain (Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that enhance membrane binding (T52L, Q59L, or a T52L Q59L double mutant) reduced Cln2 inhibition (Figure 1F, left) from 89% (wild-type [WT]) to 34% (T52L Q59L). Second, by replacing the native Ste5 PM domain with foreign membrane-binding motifs (Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we found that signaling remained Cln2 sensitive when we used a relatively weak motif, the PH domain from PLCδ, but that signaling became Cln2 resistant when we used two tandem copies of this same motif (Figure 1F, right). The PM domain can also target Ste5 into the nucleus (Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but Cln2 sensitivity was not changed by a PM domain mutation (NLSm; Figure 1E) that specifically disrupts nuclear localization (Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Collectively, our results suggest that Cln/CDK antagonizes the ability of the Ste5 PM domain to mediate membrane-localized signaling. Of 15 possible CDK sites (i.e., SP or TP) within Ste5, eight are concentrated around the PM domain (Figure 2A). This conspicuous clustering, when coupled with results described above, suggested that phosphorylation at one or more of these sites might regulate Ste5 signaling. Indeed, small deletions on either side of the Ste5 PM domain conferred partial Cln2 resistance (Figure S1B). Therefore, we replaced the Ser or Thr residues at all eight SP/TP sites with nonphosphorylatable Ala residues. This “Ste5-8A” mutant remained fully capable of pheromone response but was now completely resistant to Cln2 inhibition (Figures 2B and S1C). This phenotype was specific to the Ste5-8A mutant, as a previously described Ste20 mutant, Ste20-13A, which lacks 13 CDK sites (Oda et al., 1999Oda Y. Huang K. Cross F.R. Cowburn D. Chait B.T. Accurate quantitation of protein expression and site-specific phosphorylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 6591-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), conferred no Cln2 resistance in parallel tests (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the Cln2 resistance displayed by Ste5-8A was separable from any possible effects on Ste5-Gβγ binding because Gβγ-independent signaling by PGAL1-STE5-Q59L became resistant to Cln2 when Ste5 harbored the 8A mutations (Figure 2C). We also examined Ste5-8A signaling in synchronous cultures (Figure 2D). As cells progressed through the cell cycle, pheromone response was monitored by transcriptional induction of a FUS1-lacZ reporter and by phosphorylation of the MAPK Fus3. By either assay, Ste5-8A largely disrupted the normal cell-cycle periodicity of pheromone response. Some fluctuation remained (especially at times immediately after release from cdc15 arrest), which could represent a minor effect of cell-cycle position on other targets or a nonspecific effect of the temperature-shift protocol. Overall, however, it is clear that the Ste5-8A mutant confers a very strong, if not complete, resistance to G1 CDK regulation of pheromone response. To discover which of these eight Ste5 sites governs CDK regulation, we replaced individual Ser or Thr sites with Ala residues. Remarkably, none of the eight single (1A) mutants displayed the complete Cln2 resistance that was shown by Ste5-8A, and instead most conferred weak partial resistance (Figure 2E) with some variation in strength. By making combined mutants, we observed gradually increasing resistance to Cln2 as more sites were removed (Figure 2E), yet complete resistance was seen only when all eight sites were eliminated. Conversely, however, while Cln2 could inhibit signaling to a measurable degree when Ste5 retained four or five CDK sites, inhibition was much stronger when Ste5 retained six, seven, or eight CDK sites. Clearly, then, no single site controls sensitivity to Cln2. Rather, multiple CDK sites are required to fully inhibit Ste5 signaling. We hypothesized that the addition of anionic phosphates next to the basic-rich PM domain would interfere with its electrostatic attraction to acidic phospholipid membranes. Although our findings had hinted that full interference might require phosphorylation at multiple Ste5 sites, it was equally possible that multiple sites merely serve to increase the likelihood of phosphorylation at one or a few sites. To address these issues, we replaced the same Ser/Thr residues with negatively charged Glu residues (Figure 3A). Placement of Glu residues at all eight sites (Ste5-8E) did reduce pheromone response but not as strongly as it was reduced when Ste5-WT was inhibited by Cln2 (Figure 3B). To explain this partial effect, we reasoned that if electrostatic interference was the operative mechanism, then the net charge might dictate the level of inhibition. Because Ser/Thr phosphorylation introduces a charge of −2, phosphorylation at eight sites would add a net charge of −16, whereas eight Glu residues would add a net charge of only −8 and thus would be less inhibitory. To test this notion, we sought to better mimic the −2 charge of each phosphate by using two Glu residues, and so we replaced the SP or TP dipeptides at each of the eight Ste5 sites with EE dipeptides (Figure 3A). Indeed, pheromone response by this “Ste5-16E” mutant was reduced to a level similar to that seen when Ste5-WT was inhibited by Cln2 (Figure 3B). This strong effect required EE dipeptides at all eight sites because EE dipeptides at only four sites either before or after the PM domain (Ste5-up8E or Ste5-dn8E) caused only a partial reduction, which was reminiscent of when the eight Glu residues were distributed among all eight sites (Ste5-8E) except that signaling could be further inhibited by Cln2 via the remaining four CDK sites. Several observations suggest that the strong signaling deficit of the Ste5-16E mutant reflects a specific effect on the Ste5 PM domain and not a complete inactivation of Ste5. First, the Ste5-16E mutant showed normal protein levels (Figure 3C), and it still bound Ste4 (Gβ; Figure 3D). Second, the Ste5-16E mutant could still mediate basal signaling from an activated Ste11 derivative, Ste11-4 (Figure 3E), which does not require the Ste5 PM domain (Mahanty et al., 1999Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Nuclear shuttling of yeast scaffold Ste5 is required for its recruitment to the plasma membrane and activation of the mating MAPK cascade.Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Third, as with inhibition by Cln2 (see Figure 1C), the 16E mutation inhibited Ste5-Q59L but not Ste5-CTM (Figure 3F) and therefore only blocks membrane signaling that requires the Ste5 PM domain. A control mutant with AA dipeptides at all eight sites was not informative because it was poorly expressed and completely defective in all assays. We traced this to the fact that an AA dipeptide was not tolerated at site three or four (data not shown). By allowing sites three and four to harbor only single replacements (either A or E) and by replacing the six other sites with AA or EE dipeptides, which generated “Ste5-14A” and “Ste5-14E,” we found that Ste5-14A remained functional (and fully resistant to Cln2), whereas Ste5-14E was strongly inhibited (Figure 3B). Therefore, the EE phenotypes reflect the addition of charge rather than the multiplicity of mutations. As with inhibition by Cln2, the Glu replacements affected membrane-based signaling in general rather than Gβγ-triggered signaling in particular because they also disrupted Gβγ-independent signaling by Ste11-Cpr (Figure 3G). Again, the degree of inhibition was proportional to the added negative charge. Notably, Ste5-14E retained more function than Ste5-16E did, which suggests that 16 negative charges are more inhibitory than 14 negative charges are. This agrees with our finding that removing single CDK sites confers partial Cln2 resistance. Because the Ste5 PM domain normally acts cooperatively with Ste5-Gβγ binding (Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M. A membrane binding domain in the Ste5 scaffold synergizes with Gβγ binding to control localization and signaling in pheromone response.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we predicted that the inhibitory effect of a small number of negative charges would be enhanced when Ste5-Gβγ affinity is reduced. Indeed, when using Ste4 (Gβ) mutants with reduced binding to Ste5, we could now detect inhibition by one to four added Glu residues (Figure 3H). Thus, a small number of charges have measurable inhibitory potential, but multiple charges are necessary when the interactions governing Ste5 membrane recruitment occur with normal affinity. Collectively, the Glu-replacement phenotypes show that added negative charges disrupt membrane signaling that is mediated by the Ste5 PM domain and that the requirement for multiple CDK sites truly reflects a need for adding multiple phosphates. Using a Ste5-GFP×3 fusion expressed at native levels (Winters et al., 2005Winters M.J. Lamson R.E. Nakanishi H. Neiman A.M. Pryciak P.M.

On a compositional basis, the PT can be subdivided into three structurally continuous regions, the subacrosomal layer, the outer periacrosomal layer on the outer aspect of the equatorial segment and the post-acrosomal sheath (PAS) (1Aul R.B.

Tech. 2003; 61: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Traditionally, PT has been considered as a cytoskeletal scaffold responsible for maintaining the overall architecture of the mature sperm head. However, recent studies indicate that the bulk of proteins making up the PT are not traditional cytoskeletal proteins but rather a variety of cytosolic proteins linked together and susceptible to extraction under different regimens (3Oko R.

For example, alkaline extractable SubH2Bv, exclusive to the subacrosomal layer, is implicated in acrosome-nuclear docking during spermiogenesis (1Aul R.B. Oko R.J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Salt-extractable non-nuclear somatic core histones, residing in the PAS, may be involved in stabilizing the chromatin of the decondensing sperm nucleus soon after oocyte entry (4Tovich P.R. Oko R.J.

The DTT salt or alkaline extractable calicin and cylicin II share a basic pI with the histones and bind to actin in vitro (6Rousseaux-Prevost R. Lecuyer C. Drobecq H. Sergheraert C. Dacheux J.L.

Detergent- and salt-resistant fraction, “calyx fraction” of the PT, contains novel actin related proteins Arp-T1 and Arp-T2, which share a 60% sequence similarity to β-actin and may interact with calicin and cylicin in situ (7Lecuyer C.

The DTT-cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-extractable Stat4, a transcription factor, presumably found throughout the PT (10Herrada G. Wolgemuth D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1543-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may contribute to the zygotic development after fertilization. Together, these data imply that the PT is an assembly of specialized proteins that serve multiple functions in both spermiogenesis and fertilization. Based on the relative ease of solubilization of the PAS in the oocyte cytoplasm and the signaling nature of some of its constituents (2Sutovsky P. Manandhar G. Wu A. Oko R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the PAS is the most likely region to harbor sperm proteins regulating oocyte activation and early stages of zygotic development after fertilization.Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for how oocyte activation is achieved by the spermatozoon during mammalian fertilization. The currently favored cytosolic factor model postulates that upon sperm-oocyte fusion, signaling molecules are released into the egg cytoplasm that activate the dormant egg by eliciting intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, which serve as a secondary messenger for downstream effectors of zygotic development (reviewed in Refs. 11Swann K. Larman M.G. Saunders C.M. Lai F.A. Reproduction. 2004; 127: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and 12Kurokawa M. Sato K. Wu H. He C. Malcuit C. Black S.J. Fukami K. Fissore R.A. Dev.

Thus far, two sperm molecules, tr-kit (truncated c-Kit tyrosine kinase) and phospholipase Cζ, have been shown to parthenogenetically trigger oocyte activation leading to cleaved mouse embryos. tr-kit appears to activate the oocyte via a Fyn-phospholipase Cγ1-mediated signaling pathway (13Sette C. Bevilacqua A. Bianchini A. Mangia F. Geremia R. Rossi P. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sette C. Paronetto M.P. Barchi M. Bevilacqua A. Geremia R. Rossi P.

Biol. 2002; 245: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The discovery of the sperm-specific phospholipase Cζ, on the other hand, offered the possibility that a phospholipase C protein of paternal origin was directly involved in triggering Ca2+ oscillations during oocyte activation (16Saunders C.M.

Furthermore, local solubilization of the PAS-PT is sufficient to elicit full oocyte activation in the absence of complete sperm incorporation into the ooplasm (2Sutovsky P. Manandhar G. Wu A. Oko R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Sutovsky P. Oko R. Hewitson L. Schatten G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Kurokawa et al. (12Kurokawa M. Sato K. Wu H. He C. Malcuit C. Black S.J. Fukami K. Fissore R.A. Dev.

These investigators emphasized that only in the case of high pH treatment was the Ca2+ releasing activity fully released indicating that the factor was most likely a PT component according to our definition (4Tovich P.R. Oko R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32431-32438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Perry et al. (21Perry A.C. Wakayama T. Yanagimachi R. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) proposed a so-called trans-complementation scheme of sperm-borne oocyte activating factors, detailing that full oocyte activation and embryo development can be achieved only with the combination of a DTT-soluble fraction obtained from Triton-demembranated mouse sperm head and the heat-stable component of the head after DTT extraction. Their observation indicated that at least two different sperm factors are involved during oocyte activation. Collectively, these observations corroborate our hypothesis that PAS-PT is the site housing sperm oocyte activating factor(s). In this context, we report the characterization a novel, sperm-specific PAS-PT protein, PAWP, which appears to promote meiotic resumption and pronuclear formation, mediated by an unprecedented WW domain-signaling pathway during fertilization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibody Preparation and Immunoblotting—Immune sera were raised in rabbits against the bull PT alkaline extract (anti-PT serum) as described previously (22Oko R. Maravei D. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 32: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Once PAWP was cloned, polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against two synthetic oligopeptides from both N- and C-terminal ends of its open reading frame, termed anti-PAWP_N and anti-PAWP_C, respectively. Immune serum was also produced in rabbits against the entire bull recombinant PAWP protein (anti-recPAWP). The four antibodies were affinity purified against recPAWP using a standard procedure (20Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analyses in this study were performed on 4.5% stacking and 12% polyacrylamide gels. For the Western blotting procedure, either polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membrane (0.45 μm pore size, Millipore, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) or nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm pore size, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) was used in protein transfer using a Hoefer Transphor apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). Immunodectection reaction was visualized by SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Biolynx, Brockville, Ontario, Canada).Differential Sperm Head Treatments—Isolated bull sperm heads underwent two cycles of freeze-thaw followed by centrifugation (14,000 × g). The combined supernatants were then dialyzed and lyophilized for Western blot analysis along with the pellet. Isolated bull sperm heads were also treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h and washed three times with PBS. The pellet was re-suspended in 15 mm DTT at 4 °C for 1 h. The suspension was then separated into supernatant and pellet by centrifugation for immunoblot analysis (20Oko R. Maravei D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1000-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Molecular Cloning of cDNA Encoding PAWP—Anti-PT serum was used to screen a bull testicular Stratagene ZAP Express™ cDNA library as described (1Aul R.B. Oko R.J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). One of six clones was chosen for full-length sequencing (Cortech, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada) and the sequence of both its nucleotide strands was determined.For obtaining the human homologue of PAWP, primers were designed according to the draft sequence (GenBank™ accession number XM_001168) and used for standard reverse transcription-PCR followed by cDNA amplification (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) with upstream primer (5′-ATG CCA TTT GAT CTG ATG-3′) and downstream primer (5′-TAC CTC ATT GTC AGG TAG-3′) at Tm 52 °C for 34 cycles. The human cDNA was inserted into pCR® II-TOPO® vector within an EcoRI restriction site (Invitrogen), sequenced, and deposited to GenBank™ (accession no. AF393575). The mouse version of PAWP was cloned and amplified in the same fashion, with upstream primer (5′-GAG CTC GAT GGC ACT GAA CCA G-3′) and downstream primer (5′-GCG GCC GCC AAG GTT AAC ATC TTA GAG C-3′ (the underlined sequences represent SacI and NotI restriction sites, respectively) at Tm 52 °C for 34 cycles.Construction, Expression, and Purification of Bovine recPAWP—Full-length PAWP cDNA was subcloned into the pET28b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) between the HindIII and XhoI sites and sequenced for verification. The construct was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3[PlyS] cells (Novagen) for expression and the subsequent nickel column purification of His-tagged recPAWP, using the protocol provided by the vendor (Qiagen). The His tag was removed using thrombin (Sigma).PAWP Sperm Equivalent Estimation—The amount of PAWP present in a single spermatozoon was calculated based upon densitometric comparison of known concentrations of recPAWP with known amounts of bovine spermatozoa by utilizing anti-recPAWP antiserum probed immunoblots. The reactive bands of the immunoblots were analyzed by using Scion Image Beta 4.02 Acquisition and Analysis software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MA). The standard curve generated from recPAWP (ranged from 0.025 to 0.2 μg) by using Microsoft Excel Data Analysis software was used for extrapolation of PAWP protein concentration present in a single spermatozoon.Northern Blotting and Chemiluminescent Detection—Total RNA from various bovine and rat tissues was isolated by using RNeasy mini-preparation kit (Qiagen), separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to and UV-cross-linked to positively charged nylon membrane (0.45 μm pore size, Roche Applied Science). DIG-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized and used for Northern blot hydridization according to the DIG System User's Guide for Filter Hybridization (Roche Applied Science).Ultrastructural Immunocytochemistry—The LR-white-embedded bovine testicular and epididymal tissues were processed for immunogold labeling by using previously described procedures (5Tovich P.R. Sutovsky P. Oko R.J. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 1182-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were mounted on Formvar-coated nickel grids and blocked with 10% normal goat serum prior to overnight incubation of the primary antibodies at 4 °C. The sections were then washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (1:20; Sigma) followed by counterstaining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The final sections were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (Hitachi 7000).Verification of Functional PPXY Motif(s) in PAWP—The binding the two putative PPXY motifs of recPAWP was examined by using GST-fused wild-type WW domains of YAP and Nedd4 (referred to as YAP and Nedd4). To show the specificity of the binding, two YAP WW domain mutants were used, YAPP202A and YAPH129F (all WW domain proteins, their respective mutants, and ligands were generous gifts from Dr. Marius Sudol) (23Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 24Sudol M. Chen H.I. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 25Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14514-14523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Approximately equal amounts (5 μg) of purified GST-fused WW domains were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for both positive binding and competitive inhibition assays. For positive binding assay, blots were blocked with 2% milk in PBS (pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween) and incubated with recPAWP (0.1 μg) in same buffer at 4 °C overnight followed by anti-recPAWP antibody detection. A synthetic peptide, Ac-PPVRYGSPPPGYEAPT-CONH2 (bold fonts indicate the PPXY motif overlapping with the underlined YGXPPXG motif) was designed as a competitive inhibitor to recPAWP by comparing bull, human, and mouse amino acid sequences. (Fig. 2b, inset). The above peptide was modified to demonstrate the specificity and the importance of the PPXY motif. In one modification, the tyrosine residue was constitutively phosphorlyated (PPGYP), while in the other the tyrosine residue was substituted with phenylalanine, PPGF. A synthetic peptide Ac-GTGKSPRRTL-CONH2, matching amino acid sequence of a common bovine sperm head protein, arylsulfatase A (AsA), was also used as a negative control. All peptides were synthesized, and purity was confirmed by HPLC (SynPep Corp., Dublin, CA). A PPXY (PY) ligand from WBP-1 (WW-binding protein 1) for YAP was also used as a competitive binding inhibitor (23Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 26Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32869-32877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). For the competitive inhibition assay, PPXY peptide, its derivatives PPGYP, PPGF, and PY ligand, were preincubated with Western or dot blots loaded with both wild-type and mutant WW domains at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation of recPAWP and immunodetection. In another competitive inhibition assay, YAP and its mutant YAPP202A GST fusion constructs were preincubated with recPAWP prior to applying the latter onto the blots and immunodetection. In this study, GST tag was removed from all constructs, since it posed steric hindrance. Affinity-purified anti-recPAWP anti-serum was used to detect the presence of recPAWP on the blot. Control blots loaded with the equal amount of proteins were used to demonstrate that the anti-serum had no cross reactivity to the GST-fused WW domain proteins.Porcine Oocyte Collection and in Vitro Fertilization—Ovaries were collected from pre-pubertal gilts at a local slaughterhouse, and oocytes were collected as described previously (27Abeydeera L.R. Day B.N. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Oocytes were washed twice and transferred into TCM-199 medium containing 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/ml FSH, 0.5 μg/ml LH, and 0.57 mm cysteine (mTCM-199) at 39 °C in atmosphere of 5% CO2 in humidified air. After 22-24 h, the oocyte-cumulus cell complexes were transferred to mTCM-199 without FSH and LH. They were cultured for additional 20 h under the same condition. Freshly ejaculated sperm-rich fraction was collected from a fertile boar and frozen as described previously (27Abeydeera L.R. Day B.N. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A sperm pellet was thawed in 2 ml of Dulbecco's PBS (calcium- and magnesium-free) supplemented with 0.1% polyvinyl alcohol at 39 °C and separated on a two layer (80 and 60%) Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The sperm pellet was re-suspended in modified Tris-buffered medium. The final sperm concentration for IVF was 1 × 106 cells/ml. Fertilized oocytes were cultured at 39 °C in North Carolina State University (NCSU)-23 medium with the addition of 0.4% BSA in atmosphere of 5% CO2 in humidified air.Intractyoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) and Microinjection of recPAWP—For the manipulation, microdrops of 6 μl of 4% PVP and 20 μl of HEPES-buffered NCSU23 with adjusted osmolarity (HEPES-NCSU23) were placed on a Petri dish and covered with mineral oil. Affinity-purified anti-recPAWP (1 μl) or its preimmune serum (1 μl, diluted 1:200 first) were diluted into 1 μl of sperm suspension (4 × 106/ml) in modified Tris-buffered medium (1:1) as well as the PPXY peptides and AsA control peptide (1 μl each, both with initial concentration of 1 mg/ml in modified KHM injection buffer (78 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0)). This suspension (2 μl) was thoroughly mixed in a 6 μl drop of 4% PVP (final dilution of anti-serum and peptides, 1:8). ICSI was performed using an Eppendorf Cell Tram microinjection system equipped with Prime Tech piezo drill. After the spermatozoon was immobilized with piezo pulses, it was aspirated into a micropipette with PVP solution, with or without experimental molecules, and injected into the oocyte within a microdrop of HEPES-NCSU23. After ICSI, oocytes were washed twice and cultured in a 10-μl drop of NCSU23 for 8 h at 39 °C in atmosphere of 5% CO2 in humidified air. The microinjection of recPAWP into mammalian oocytes was carried out as described in ICSI experiments, except for the absence of an injected spermatozoon. An estimated 10 pl of solution containing 0.1 to 1.0 pg of soluble recPAWP, control BSA, or AsA peptide (sham injection) was aspirated into the injection pipette. Pronuclear development was determined after processing of the oocytes for immunofluorescence.Mammalian Oocyte Processing and Immunofluorescence—Sperm-injected and in vitro fertilized oocytes were stripped of zona pellucida by a brief incubation in TL-HEPES containing 0.5% w/v protease (Sigma), fixed for 40 min in 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS, and permeabilized for 1 h in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m PBS before immunofluorescence staining procedures (28Sutovsky P. Simerly C. Hewitson L. Schatten G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2841-2854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes were sequentially incubated with the affinity-purified anti-recPAWP (1:50; 40-min incubation) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-TRITC (1:80; 40 min; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). To examine the formation of nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complexes, oocytes were incubated with a nucleoporin-specific mouse monoclonal antibody mAb 414 (1:200, Babco, Berkeley, CA) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Anti-c-Yes serum (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by anti-rabbit IgG (1:80) was used to identify the assembly of c-Yes foci in the ooplasm of activated oocytes (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The DNA stain DAPI (1:80) was mixed with secondary antibodies. The un-injected and sham-injected oocytes served as controls.Bull, rhesus monkey, and boar spermatozoa were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence and DAPI staining as described previously (29Sutovsky P. Ramalho-Santos J. Moreno R.D. Oko R. Hewitson L. Schatten G. Hum. Reprod. 1999; 14: 2301-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were anti-PAWP_N and anti-PAWP_C (1:200). Images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse 1000 microscope with high numerical aperture objectives, and an RTE/CCD 1217 camera (Princeton Instruments, Inc., Trenton, NJ), operated by MetaMorph software. Digital images were edited by using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA).Microinjection of recPAWP into Xenopus Oocytes—The isolation and manipulation of oocytes were performed as described previously (30Ma C. Benink H.A. Cheng D. Montplaisir V. Wang L. Xi Y. Zheng P.P. Bement W.M. Liu X.J. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Sexually mature Xenopus laevis females were primed with gonadotropin (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, 50 IU/frog, Sigma) 3 days before operations. Ovarian fragments were removed surgically under hypothermia and subjected to collagenase A digestion (2 mg/ml, Roche Applied Science, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) in calciumfree OR2 medium (83 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8), with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) for 3 h to obtain follicle-cell free oocytes. Stage VI oocytes were then individually selected and grouped. Collagenase-treated oocytes were stimulated with progesterone (5 μm) and germinal vesicle breakdown was assessed by the appearance of a white spot (maturation spot) on the pigmented animal pole after 3-6 h. Three hours after germinal vesicle breakdown, the mature eggs were arrested at metaphase II with the first polar body present (PB). Injection of alkaline PT extract or recPAWP (0.02 ng/nl) in a total volume of 27 nl with or without PPXY peptides (0.04 ng/nl) was conducted in calcium-free OR2 medium. Artificial activation was achieved by incubating metaphase II-arrested oocytes in OR2 medium with 0.5 μg/ml calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma) for 60 s. Twenty minutes after injection (or ionophore treatment), oocytes were fixed in 100% methanol for 30 min, rehydrated in 50% (v/v) methanol, and then transferred to Tris-buffered saline containing SYTOX Green (1:10,000; Molecular Probes) for detection of polar bodies as viewed under a Olympus IMT2-RFL inverted fluorescence microscope.RESULTSCharacteristics of Anti-PT Serum—The anti-PT serum used to immunoscreen the bull testicular cDNA expression library was raised in rabbits against the SDS non-extractable but alkaline extractable bull PT polypeptides (Fig. 1). The full or partial sequence identities of most of the prominent PT polypeptides (asterisks in Fig. 1) of this alkaline extractable group have been described previously (2Sutovsky P. Manandhar G. Wu A. Oko R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3Oko R. Aul R.B. Wu A. Sutovsky P. Robaire B. Chemes H.E. Morales C.R. Andrology in the 21st Century.

PAWP (arrowheads) is a less prominent member of this group, although it appears to be the most antigenic (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 1). Our cDNA immunoscreening took advantage of this heightened antigenicity and of the fact that the anti-PT serum from the first boost only recognized PAWP, and a previously cloned and characterized 15-kDa PT protein, SubH2Bv (1Aul R.B.

https://openalex.org/W2021681212,"The small Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 have each been shown to function in insulin exocytosis and are presumed to function in actin remodeling and insulin granule mobilization. However, whether either GTPase is required for the mobilization phase of insulin release (second phase) and are linked in a common signaling pathway has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of Cdc42 from isolated islets results in the selective loss of secondphase insulin release. Consistent with a role in this nutrient-dependent phase, Cdc42 activation was detected exclusively in response to d-glucose and was unresponsive to KCl or non-metabolizable glucose analogs in MIN6 β-cells. Cdc42 activation occurred early in secretion (3 min), whereas Rac1 activation required ∼15–20 min, suggesting Cdc42 as proximal and Rac1 as distal regulators of second-phase secretion. Importantly, Rac1 activation and function was linked in a common pathway downstream of Cdc42; Cdc42 depletion ablated glucose-induced Rac1 activation, and expression of constitutively active Rac1 in Cdc42-depleted cells functionally restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Occurring at a time midway between Cdc42 and Rac1 activations was the phosphorylation of p21-activated-kinase 1 (Pak1), and this phosphorylation event required Cdc42. Moreover, small interfering RNA-mediated Pak1 depletion abolished Rac1 activation and glucose-stimulated insulin release, suggesting that Pak1 may mediate the link between Cdc42 and Rac1 in this pathway.

Taken together, these data substantiate the existence of a novel signaling pathway in the islet β-cell whereby Cdc42 functions as a key proximal transmitter of the glucose signal early in stimulus-secretion coupling to support the later stage of insulin release. Insulin is released from pancreatic islet β-cells in two distinct phases in response to glucose stimulation. The first phase of insulin release can be elicited by elevation of intracellular calcium levels to trigger fusion of granules pre-docked at the plasma membrane, a glucose stimulation. The second phase of insulin release requires the amplifying action of glucose and is presumed to require mobilization of storage pool granules to the cell surface to sustain insulin release for an hour or longer depending upon how long the β-cell detects stimulatory levels of glucose. Thousands of storage granules exist behind a filamentous actin (F-actin) barrier in the pancreatic β-cell, and F-actin remodeling is known to mobilize granules to the target membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) 2The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; GDI, guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor; G-protein (GTPase), guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; MKRBB, modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; Pak1, p21-activated kinase; PM, plasma membrane; PVDF, polyvinylidene fluoride; RIA, radioimmunoassay; siRNA, small interfering RNA; IB, immunoblot; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBD, protein binding domain. sites at the cell surface, yet the mechanisms involved in remodeling and granule mobilization are largely unknown and untested. We and others have presented evidence to suggest that the key to actin remodeling in the islet β-cell may lie in the glucose-specific activation of the small Rho family GTPase protein Cdc42 (1Nevins A.K.

Veluthakal R. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3523-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that Cdc42 is kept in its GDP-loaded and inactivated state by its interaction with Caveolin-1, whereby Caveolin-1 functions as a novel Cdc42 guanine dissociation inhibitor (GDI) in β-cells. Caveolin-1 binds to Cdc42 present on secretory granules, and the complex rapidly translocates to the plasma membrane and dissociates within 3 min of glucose stimulation (6Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18961-18972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The caveolin-1-Cdc42 complex is associated with the vesicle (v)-SNARE protein VAMP2 on the insulin granules and disruption of the Cdc42-VAMP2 interaction attenuates glucose but not KCl-stimulated insulin secretion (2Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This glucose-specific Cdc42 activation is also coupled to interactions between target SNARE proteins and F-actin (1Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of the constitutively active form of Cdc42 (Q61L) inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion but was without effect upon K+-stimulated secretion, suggesting that specifically glucose-stimulated insulin secretion requires Cdc42 cycling to the GDP-bound state. Importantly, blockage of cycling using the Q61L mutant correlated with formation of cortical F-actin that was resistant to reorganization in response to glucose stimulation. This was distinctly different from the response to constitutively active Cdc42 in PC12 neuroendocrine cells (7Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Malacombe M. Way M. Bader M.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and demonstrates the selective responsiveness of Cdc42 to glucose in the β-cell. This fits well with the concept of the β-cell using its cytoskeleton differently from neuronal cells, due to intrinsic differences in the pattern of release of neurotransmitter from that of insulin. However, how Cdc42 signals the remodeling of F-actin in the β-cell remains unknown. Another Rho family GTPase, Rac1, has also been implicated in insulin secretion from β-cells. Like Cdc42, Rac1 was shown to translocate to the plasma membrane and undergo activation within 15 min of glucose stimulation. However, whether Rac1 activation occurred earlier than 15 min was not tested (5Kowluru A. Veluthakal R. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3523-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Li J. Luo R. Kowluru A. Li G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based upon this late time of activation in the scheme of stimulus-secretion coupling and also upon indirect evidence showing that a Rac1 mutant disrupted insulin release only in the latter half of the stimulatory period, Rac1 has been implicated as a factor mediating the second phase of secretion (8Li J. Luo R. Kowluru A. Li G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence for Rac1 function or for the function of Cdc42 in biphasic secretion from islets exists to show that either play essential roles in second-phase secretion. Cdc42 and Rac1 are well studied in other cell types and have been shown to function sequentially in a common pathway or to function in divergent pathways (9Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar, 10Baird D. Feng Q. Cerione R.A. Curr.

For example, in the control of cell motility, activation of Cdc42 leads to the sequential activation of Rac1 (12Puls A. Eliopoulos A.G. Nobes C.D. Bridges T. Young L.S. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in other cell types this order of activation is either reversed, or Cdc42 and Rac1 activations function antagonistically (14Diebold B.A. Fowler B. Lu J. Dinauer M.C. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Finkielstein C.V. Overduin M. Capelluto D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27317-27326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac1 has been shown to engage in cross-talk with yet another small G-protein, ARF6, to coordinate the signaling cascade underlying epithelial cell migration (16Santy L.C. Casanova J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Such a cross-talk mechanism has been suggested to explain Rac1 function in pancreatic β-cells (17Lawrence J.T. Birnbaum M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13320-13325Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although neither this potential mechanism nor its potential participation in a mechanism involving Cdc42 has been examined. In this report we use multiple siRNA-mediated depletion approaches to provide direct evidence for a role for Cdc42 as a key proximal regulator specifically of second-phase insulin release and that Rac1 activation is downstream of Cdc42 in a common pathway. Activation of this pathway was selectively responsive to d -glucose and not to non-metabolizable analogs of glucose or KCl stimulation, consistent with the role of this pathway in signaling the second and not the first phase of insulin granule exocytosis. The mechanism of Cdc42 signaling to Rac1 was further shown to involve Pak1: 1) Pak1 became activated in response to glucose at ∼5 min, midway between the times of activation of Cdc42 (3 min) and Rac1 (20 min), and 2) siRNA-mediated depletion of Cdc42 inhibited Pak1 phosphorylation, and depletion of Pak1 resulted in ablation of Rac1 activation. These data demonstrate that the early activation of Cdc42 during the time of first-phase secretion acts as a conduit for distant and late effects upon insulin release in the second phase. Materials—The EZ-Detect Cdc42/Rac1 activation kit containing mouse anti-Cdc42 and Rac1 antibodies was purchased from Pierce. Mouse anti-Myc antibody, mouse anti-hemagglutinin antibody, rabbit anti-Pak1 antibody, rabbit anti-actin antibody, rabbit IgG, and protein G Plus-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The phospho-specific anti-Pak1 (Thr-423) antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were acquired from Bio-Rad. Lipofectamine2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. Hyperfilm-MP and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The RIA grade bovine serum albumin, d-glucose, 2-deoxy-glucose, l-glucose, 3-orthomethyl glucose, and KCl were obtained from Sigma. The human C-peptide, rat insulin, and sensitive rat insulin RIA kits were purchased from Linco Research Inc. (St. Charles, MO). All siRNA oligonucleotides for targeting endogenous mouse Cdc42 and Pak1 were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX): Cdc42 si-A, GCAAUGAGUGCUAGUUUUUtt; Cdc42 si-B, CCCAAAUUGAUCUCAGAGAtt; Cdc42 si-C, CCUUUGAAAUACACCAAAUtt; Pak1, CAUCAAAUAUCACAAAGUCtt. Plasmids—The full-length mouse Cdc42 cDNA was obtained using the following PCR primers to screen a MIN6 cDNA library: forward primer, 5′-AGAGAATTCATGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGAATATGCAGACAATTAAGTGA-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-CTCGGATCCTCATAGCAGCACACACCTGCGGCT-3′. The PCR product contained an engineered N-terminal Myc tag and was subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and the construct was verified by sequencing. The four plasmid-based siRNA constructs, pSilencer1.0-Cdc42 (siCdc42), were generated as previously described (18Spurlin B.A. Thomas R.M. Nevins A.K. Kim H.J. Kim Y.J. Noh H.L. Shulman G.I. Kim J.K. Thurmond D.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1910-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, annealed complimentary double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding 19 nucleotides of mouse Cdc42 followed by a loop region (TTCAAGAGA) and the antisense of the 19 nucleotides were inserted into ApaI and EcoRI sites of the pSilencer1.0 vector (Ambion). The pSilencer1.0 control construct (siCon) was generated as previously described (19Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Sequences of four pSilencer siCdc42 constructs were: siCdc42#1, ATTCCCATCGGAATATGTA; siCdc42#2, GTTATCCACAGACAGATGT; siCdc42#3, CTAACCACTGTCCAAAGAC; siCdc42#4, GCCTATTACTCCAGAGACT. The sequence of siCdc42#4 was used to generate the siCdc42-Ad adenovirus, inserted into the 5′ XhoI and the 3′ SpeI site of the pSilencer-Adeno-CMV vector (Ambion). Adenoviral LacZ backbone purchased from Ambion was used as a control (Con-Ad). Recombination, expression, purification, and titration of cesium chloride viral particles were performed by Viraquest Inc. (North Liberty, IA). Adenoviruses were packaged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to facilitate identification of transduced cells. The pCMV6-myc-Pak1 and pCGN-HA-Rac1(Q61L) constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Lawrence Quilliam (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN). Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Secretion Assays—CHO-K1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 292 μg/ml l-glutamine. At 80–90% confluence cells were electroporated with 40 μg of DNA as previously described (20Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 μm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins present in lysates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and depletion detected by immunoblotting. MIN6 cells (a gift from Dr. John Hutton, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO) were cultured in DMEM (25 mm glucose) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (19Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At 50–60% confluence cells were co-transfected with 2.5 μg of each plasmid DNA and human proinsulin (pCB6/INS, a gift from Dr. Chris Newgard, Duke University, Durham, NC) as previously described (21Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17624-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the insulin secretion rescue assay, DNA quantities were reduced to 1.5 μg of each of the three different plasmids to accommodate the constraints of the DNA:transfectin ratio for optimal transfection efficiency. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with and incubated for 2 h in freshly prepared modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. Cells were stimulated with 20 mm d-glucose or 50 mm KCl for the times indicated in the figures. MKRBB was then collected and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min for subsequent quantitation of secretion using human C-peptide radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research). Transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides into MIN6 cells was achieved using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) with 100 nm oligonucleotides to obtain ∼80–90% transfection efficiency. A nontargeting RNA (scrambled siRNA, also obtained from Ambion) was used as a control. Transfected cells were maintained in the supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h and subsequently incubated in MKRBB and stimulated as described above. Insulin secreted into the MKRBB was quantitated using a rat insulin RIA kit (Linco). Cells were harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for detection of Cdc42, Pak1, or Rac1 depletion or activation. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions were isolated as previously described (2Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All steps of fractionation procedure were performed at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Briefly, MIN6 cells at 70–80% confluence were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing the following protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle, and homogenates were centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 5500 × g for 15 min, and the subsequent supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the secretory granule fraction in the pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction. Plasma membrane fractions (PM) were obtained by mixing the postnuclear pellet with 1 ml of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 2 volumes of buffer B (2 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was overlaid with buffer A and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 1 h to obtain an interface containing the plasma membrane. The interface was collected and diluted to 2 ml with homogenization buffer for centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. All pellets were resuspended in the 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to solubilize membrane proteins. Cdc42 and Rac1 Activation Assays—To specifically detect the GTP-loaded forms of Cdc42 or Rac1, the EZ-Detect Cdc42/Rac1 activation kit from Pierce was used as described previously (2Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Freshly made fractions (100 μg) or whole cell lysate (500 μg) were combined with 20 μg of GST-Pak1-PBD-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. After 3 washes with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from the agarose beads and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with mouse anti-Cdc42 or mouse anti-Rac1 antibodies. The relative abundance of eluted Cdc42/Rac1 was determined by Western blotting and densitometry. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For Pak1 immunoprecipitation, 2 mg of cleared detergent lysates were combined with 2 μg of rabbit anti-Pak1 antibody and allowed to rotate for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G Plus-agarose beads were added, and reactions were rotated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. After three washes with lysis buffer the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting with a phospho-specific (Thr-423) Pak1 antibody (Chemicon). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Adenoviral Transduction of MIN6 Cells—MIN6 cells at 60% confluence were transduced with either siCdc42-Ad or siCon-Ad CsCl-purified particles for 2 h at 37 °C (multiplicity of infection of 100). Transduced cells were then washed twice and incubated for 48 h in complete medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2. GFP fluorescence was visualized in >95% of cells in all experiments. Transduced cells were subsequently preincubated in MKRBB for 2 h and stimulated with 20 mm d-glucose for 20 min. Cleared detergent lysates were prepared for assessment of Rac1 activation as described above. Mouse Islet Isolation, Adenoviral Transduction, and Perifusion—Pancreatic mouse islets were isolated, adenovirally transduced, and used for perifusion as previously described (18Spurlin B.A. Thomas R.M. Nevins A.K. Kim H.J. Kim Y.J. Noh H.L. Shulman G.I. Kim J.K. Thurmond D.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1910-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreata pooled from five 8–12-week-old male mice (C57BL/6J) were batch-digested with collagenase and purified using a Ficoll density gradient. After isolation, 120 islets were hand-picked into two groups and immediately transduced at an multiplicity of infection of 50 with either siCdc42-Ad or siCon-Ad CsCl-purified particles for 1 h at 37 °C. Transduced islets were then washed twice and incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 at 37 °C, 5% CO2. GFP fluorescence was visualized in greater than 95% of islets in all experiments. For perifusion analysis, 50 GFP-positive (GFP+) islets were handpicked onto a column between two layers of Cytodex 3 beads (Amersham Biosciences), washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (magnesium-free), and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in freshly gassed KRBH buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 134 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Islets were then perifused at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min for 10 min in KRBH buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose with eluted fractions captured at 1-min intervals followed by d -glucose stimulation (20 mm) for 35 min. Insulin secreted into eluted fractions was quantitated by a sensitive rat insulin RIA immunoassay kit (Linco Research, Inc.). This entire procedure was repeated for a total of five independent perifusion experiments. For validation of Cdc42 depletion in transduced islets, 200 GFP+ islets were handpicked and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—All data are evaluated for statistical significance using Student's t test. Data are expressed as the average ± S.E. Depletion of Cdc42 by siRNA Impairs Glucose-induced Insulin Secretion in β-Cells—We and others have demonstrated that impairment of Cdc42 activation or cycling leads to inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (1Nevins A.K.

Lopez M. Wu C. Marks P.W. Davidson L. Kwiatkowski D.J. Kirchhausen T. Orkin S.H. Rosen F.S. Mayer B.J. Kirschner M.W. Alt F.W. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 758-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), so we used siRNA-mediated depletion of Cdc42. We used seven different siRNA sequences to target multiple domains and functional regions of Cdc42 (Fig. 1A), three commercially available oligonucleotides and four that we generated and expressed by a plasmid-based system. The three commercially available siRNA oligonucleotides were transiently transfected into MIN6 cells (designated as siA, siB, and siC) using the reagent Lipofectamine 2000 to obtain ∼80–90% of cells transfected, as gauged using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. Two of the three oligonucleotides successfully depleted endogenous Cdc42 protein from MIN6 cells, with siA depleting to the greatest extent at 60% (Fig. 1B). Depletion of Cdc42 by siA also resulted in a 30% inhibition of glucose-induced insulin release compared with the control oligonucleotide (Fig. 1C). In an independent approach we also tested the effects of plasmid-based siRNA delivery using four 19-mer sequences (designated as #1–#4) in the pSilencer vector as we have described previously (18Spurlin B.A. Thomas R.M. Nevins A.K. Kim H.J. Kim Y.J. Noh H.L. Shulman G.I. Kim J.K. Thurmond D.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1910-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Due to the low transfection efficiency of plasmid into MIN6 cells, we chose to first evaluate the efficiency of each siRNA at depleting Cdc42 using the easily transfectable CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cells were co-transfected with an Myc-tagged mouse Cdc42 plasmid to evaluate the effectiveness of each mouse-specific siRNA on depletion of mouse Cdc42 (CHO-K1 cells express endogenous hamster Cdc42). All four Cdc42 siRNA constructs effectively depleted Myc-tagged mouse Cdc42 expression (Fig. 1D), with si#4 being the most effective (∼70% knockdown). To determine the functional impact of Cdc42 depletion upon glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a human proinsulin plasmid was co-transfected with si#4 into MIN6 cells to serve as a reporter of secretion from transfectable cells. Human proinsulin is packaged and processed to human C-peptide and insulin in secretory granules in a manner similar to that of the mouse proinsulin present in the MIN6 cells, but the human C-peptide is immunologically distinct from that of the mouse C-peptide. Consistent with the effect of the commercial siRNA oligonucleotide siA, our plasmid-based si#4 inhibited ∼50% of the glucose-induced human C-peptide release (Fig. 1E). These results suggested that Cdc42 is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Cdc42 Is Essential for Second-phase Insulin Release from Islets—To address whether Cdc42 is required in first, second, or both phases of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, we used isolated islets transduced with siCdc42 adenovirus. Freshly isolated mouse islets were transduced with adenoviruses encoding either siCdc42#4 (siCdc42-Ad) or the matched control (siCon-Ad) for 24 h. Adenoviruses were packaged with GFP, enabling selection of 50 transduced islets for each perifusion chamber. GFP+ islets were used for perifusion study in parallel chambers, and insulin secretion was measured every minute over a 60-min time period as described previously (19Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After an equilibration period of 30 min, islets were perifused for 10 min in KRBH buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose (basal) followed by stimulation for 35 min at 20 mm glucose and, finally, returned to basal conditions for an additional 15 min. Insulin release kinetics showed biphasic responsiveness from islets isolated from wild-type mice that mimicked those previously reported (25Preitner F. Ibberson M. Franklin I. Binnert C. Pende M. Gjinovci A. Hansotia T. Drucker D.J. Wollheim C. Burcelin R. Thorens B. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Control islets exhibited a peak within 5 min of glucose stimulation, consistent with the occurrence of first-phase insulin secretion. The first-phase peak was followed by a drop to the sustained second p"

Stopped-flow kinetics, circular dichroism, and NMR experiments reveal that there are at least three distinct phases in the folding of Top7, that a nonnative conformation is stable at equilibrium, and that multiple fragments of Top7 are stable in isolation. These results indicate that the folding of Top7 is significantly less cooperative than the folding of similarly sized naturally occurring proteins, suggesting that the cooperative folding and smooth free energy landscapes observed for small naturally occurring proteins are not general properties of polypeptide chains that fold to unique stable structures but are instead a product of natural selection.

A critical consideration in the accurate modeling and engineering of biological systems is the contribution of evolutionary pressures; are the physical properties of its components sufficient to predict the behavior of a system, or is it also necessary to understand the evolutionary pressures operating on the system? A route to identifying such pressures is to compare the properties of systems lacking evolutionary history to those of naturally occurring systems. Due to recent advances in de novo protein design, this is now possible for protein folding (Kuhlman and Baker, 2004Kuhlman B. Baker D. Exploring folding free energy landscapes using computational protein design.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Protein structures are stabilized primarily by the sequestration of hydrophobic residues away from solvent in the protein core (Dill, 1990Dill K.A. Dominant Forces In Protein Folding.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7133-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3196) Google Scholar). Because hydrophobic interactions are quite nonspecific, alternative hydrophobic core packing arrangements could exist that, while less stable than the native packing arrangement, could be more stable than the unfolded state. This would produce a rugged folding free energy landscape in which the folding of a polypeptide chain could be slowed by trapping in nonnative minima. In agreement with this picture, many theoretical models predict that protein folding should be a complex, slow process characterized by the trapping of the polypeptide chain in nonnative minima (Chan, 2000Chan H.S. Modeling protein density of states: additive hydrophobic effects are insufficient for calorimetric two-state cooperativity.Proteins. 2000; 40: 543-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Fukunishi, 1998Fukunishi Y.

How does a protein fold?.Nature. 1994; 369: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). However, a large body of work carried out over the past 15 years suggests that rugged folding free energy landscapes are quite rare in small, naturally occurring proteins; these proteins generally have highly cooperative folding transitions in which nonnative states are not significantly populated (Jackson, 1998Jackson S.E.

Distinguishing between two-state and three-state models for ubiquitin folding.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11696-11701Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Is this discrepancy caused by fundamental differences between these simple models and real polypeptide chains, or is it due to evolutionary pressures that have operated on naturally occurring proteins (Jewett et al., 2003Jewett A.I. Pande V.S. Plaxco K.W. Cooperativity, smooth energy landscapes and the origins of topology-dependent protein folding rates.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)? If the cooperative folding and smooth free energy landscapes of small, naturally occurring proteins are a general property of any polypeptide folding to a unique stable structure, then a protein capable of folding to a stable native state but lacking an evolutionary history would be expected to possess a smooth free energy landscape. Previous attempts to explore evolutionary pressures on protein folding landscapes have involved characterization of novel sequences that adopt naturally occurring protein structures. For example, novel folded variants of protein L and the Src SH3 domain have been identified using phage-display technology (Gu et al., 1995Gu H. Yi Q. Bray S.T. Riddle D.S. Shiau A.K. Baker D.

The proteins generated by these two methods show two-state cooperative folding; however, these methods were unable to generate proteins completely lacking an evolutionary history—with a single exception (Gillespie et al., 2003Gillespie B.

The complete separation of protein structure from evolutionary history was recently achieved through the design of a sequence that folds into a novel structure (Kuhlman et al., 2003Kuhlman B.

Because the sequence and structure of the Top7 protein differ from those of known proteins, it is an ideal candidate to study the free energy landscape of a protein lacking an evolutionary history. Like naturally occurring proteins, Top7 folds to a unique stable native state, but preliminary kinetic studies suggested the folding of Top7 may not be highly cooperative (Scalley-Kim and Baker, 2004Scalley-Kim M. Baker D. Characterization of the folding energy landscapes of computer generated proteins suggests high folding free energy barriers and cooperativity may be consequences of natural selection.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In order to explore the differences between Top7 and naturally occurring proteins, we have systematically characterized the free energy landscape by searching for stable nonnative states of Top7 using NMR, stopped-flow kinetics, and mutational and fragment studies. Our results demonstrate that the folding free energy landscape of Top7 is much more complex than those of small, naturally occurring proteins. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the evolutionary pressures on protein folding and future endeavors in protein engineering. In protein folding kinetics studies, unfolded protein in denaturant is diluted into buffer lacking denaturant, and the formation of secondary and tertiary structure during folding is followed by monitoring the change in circular dichroism (CD) signal of the polypeptide chain and/or intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues. The folding processes of most small naturally occurring proteins can be fit with a single exponential (Ae−kt), consistent with a single cooperative transition between the unfolded and native states, and the logarithm of the rate constant k is typically a linear function of the denaturant concentration. Deviations from single-exponential kinetics and/or significant nonlinearity in the denaturant dependence of folding kinetics suggest the population of metastable nonnative states during folding (Baldwin, 1996Baldwin R.L. On-pathway versus off-pathway folding intermediates.Fold. Des. 1996; 1: R1-R8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Folding and unfolding experiments monitoring tertiary structure formation using the intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophan at position 83 demonstrate that for most guanidine concentrations a triple exponential (Afaste−kfastt + Amiddlee−kmiddlet + Aslowe−kslowt) is needed to fit the folding reaction of Top7, whereas the unfolding reaction can be fit to a single exponential. Figure 1A shows a kinetic trace of Top7 folding fit using a triple-exponential model (one exponential for the fast increase in fluorescence and two for the slower decrease in fluorescence). Figure 1B shows the guanidine dependence of the three rate constants (kfast, kmiddle, kslow) from the triple-exponential fit. The guanidine dependence of protein folding rates reflects the amount of surface area burial during the corresponding transition (Myers et al., 1995Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Denaturant m values and heat capacity changes: relation to changes in accessible surface areas of protein unfolding.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), and the strong guanidine dependence of the fast phase, kfast (m value = 1.1 kcal mol−1 M−1, see Experimental Procedures), indicates that a significant fraction of the surface area is buried during this transition. Below 4 M guanidine, the middle and slow phases, kmiddle and kslow, are guanidine independent, suggesting that these phases correspond to transitions in which no additional surface area is buried, most likely structural rearrangements between collapsed states. Because Top7 does not possess any prolines, neither of these guanidine-independent phases is due to cis-trans proline isomerizations, which cause multiphasic folding in some naturally occurring proteins (Calloni et al., 2003Calloni G. Taddei N. Plaxco K.W. Ramponi G. Stefani M. Chiti F. Comparison of the folding processes of distantly related proteins. Importance of hydrophobic content in folding.J. Mol.

Folding dynamics of the src SH3 domain.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15685-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Figure 1C shows the guanidine dependence of the amplitudes of the three phases (Afast, Amiddle, Aslow). At higher guanidine concentrations the amplitudes of the fast and slow phases approach zero, suggesting that the nonnative structures associated with the two phases are disappearing. The disappearance of these phases suggests that at high guanidine concentrations Top7 displays the single-exponential folding and unfolding kinetics, with rate constants dependent on the guanidine concentration (Figure 1B), that are characteristic of cooperatively folding proteins. Previous folding experiments have shown that apparent complexities in the folding of small, naturally occurring proteins can be ascribed to transient aggregation (Silow and Oliveberg, 1997Silow M. Oliveberg M. Transient aggregates in protein folding are easily mistaken for folding intermediates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 6084-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, Silow et al., 1999Silow M. Tan Y.J. Fersht A.R. Oliveberg M. Formation of short-lived protein aggregates directly from the coil in two-state folding.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13006-13012Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the rate constants and associated amplitudes of the three phases are not dependent on protein concentration (Figure 1D), suggesting the complex folding kinetics of Top7 are not due to intermolecular interactions. Continuous-flow circular dichroism experiments were carried out to monitor the formation of secondary structure during folding. At low concentrations of guanidine, 80% of the circular dichroism signal of the native protein is recovered during the first 2 ms of folding (Figure 1E). The kinetics and guanidine dependence of the rapid formation of secondary structure parallel those of the fast phase observed in the fluorescence experiments. Thus, at low guanidine concentrations unfolded Top7 rapidly collapses to nonnative conformations containing significant amounts of secondary structure. At high guanidine concentrations, the folding kinetics of Top7 are similar to those of small naturally occurring proteins. The kinetics near the equilibrium unfolding transition of Top7 (∼6 M guanidine) can be fit quite well with a single exponential, and the rate is linearly dependent on the denaturant concentration (Figures 1C and 1D and Scalley-Kim and Baker, 2004Scalley-Kim M. Baker D. Characterization of the folding energy landscapes of computer generated proteins suggests high folding free energy barriers and cooperativity may be consequences of natural selection.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, folding appears to be a cooperative transition between the open unfolded state and the compact folded state, as observed for most small naturally occurring proteins. As the guanidine concentration is decreased, the free energy landscape of Top7 becomes much more complex, possessing multiple stable minima. At low guanidine concentrations (<4 M), the folding of Top7 is a triple-exponential reaction, indicating that at least four states are populated during the folding reaction (U, I1, I2, and F) (Ikai and Tanford, 1973Ikai A. Tanford C. Kinetics of unfolding and refolding of proteins. I. Mathematical analysis.J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 73: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Given the large number of parameters in a four-state system and the multiple possible connections between the states, we do not attempt to fit a specific quantitative model to the data. Instead, we take a more qualitative approach and propose the simplified model outlined in Figure 1F and described in the following paragraphs. The middle phase is likely to represent a transition from a collapsed species to the native state. This interpretation is based on the continuity in the values of the rate constants associated with the middle phase and the values of the rate constants associated with the single-exponential folding transition at high guanidine concentrations, which clearly represents a transition to the native structure. At lower guanidine concentrations, the middle phase is guanidine independent, suggesting that it represents a transition to the native state from a collapsed species (I1). The switch from the guanidine dependence of the folding rate at high guanidine concentration to the guanidine independence at lower concentrations is seldom observed for small, naturally occurring proteins (Jackson, 1998Jackson S.E. How do small single-domain proteins fold?.Fold. Des. 1998; 3: R81-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar)—in the rare cases where this is observed, the decreases in the guanidine dependence of the folding rates occur only at very low denaturant concentrations, and the rates do not become completely denaturant independent (Ferguson et al., 1999Ferguson N. Capaldi A.P. James R. Kleanthous C. Radford S.E. Rapid folding with and without populated intermediates in the homologous four-helix proteins Im7 and Im9.J. Mol.

USA. 2004; 101: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The stopped-flow fluorescence and circular dichroism experiments suggest that the fast phase reflects the rapid collapse of the chain into conformations having significant secondary structure (I1 and I2). Because the signal change associated with the fast phase is in the opposite direction of the fluorescence change associated with the final formation of the native state (Figure 1A), the fast phase cannot represent a direct transition from the unfolded to folded state. Such a rapid burst phase is generally not observed for proteins fewer than 100 amino acids (Grantcharova and Baker, 1997Grantcharova V.P. Baker D.

Biol. 1999; 6: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the case of Top7, the rapid collapse may be due to the extremely hydrophobic nature of the protein core (the free energy decrease associated with hydrophobic association may outweigh the entropic cost of chain collapse). The very slow phase could represent a parallel kinetic channel or an additional obligatory step in a sequential process. The former is more plausible, because if the middle phase represents a transition to the native state, it cannot be preceded by a much slower obligatory step, as it would no longer be observable (Bai, 2003Bai Y. Hidden intermediates and levinthal paradox in the folding of small proteins.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the slow phase suggests that an alternative collapsed state (I2) is formed in parallel with I1 during the rapid collapse phase; because of the slow rate of escape from I2, it may be viewed as a kinetic trap (Figure 1F). The denaturant independence of the slow phase suggests that transitions out of this state do not involve significant changes in surface area. The marked similarity in the denaturant dependencies of the middle phase and the slow phase, notably the sharp kink at 4 M guanidine, suggests that transitions from both states may involve a similar structural rearrangement. To probe the structure and sequence features critical for the three kinetic phases, and to attempt to simplify the complexity of the kinetics, we examined the folding kinetics of 11 point mutants of Top7 (Table 1 and Figure 2L). The results further highlight the complexity of Top7 folding. Remarkably, no mutation simplified the kinetics (all three phases are present for all the proteins examined), presumably because the mutations do not significantly destabilize the nonnative states—in fact, some mutations appear to make the folding process even more complex (see the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The mutations do change the rates associated with the different phases, but to further complicate the analysis, these changes differ for nearly all of the mutants.Table 1Location and Contribution to Stability of Top7 Mutants Examined in the Kinetics StudiesProteinLocationm Value aValues were determined from CD-monitored guanidine denaturation curves (see Experimental Procedures).ΔG (3 M) aValues were determined from CD-monitored guanidine denaturation curves (see Experimental Procedures).ΔΔG (3 M)Wild-typebF83W mutation.NA−2.226.54NAK41E/K42E/K57EbF83W mutation.1st and 2nd helix−2.226.680.14F17Q/Y19LcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.2nd strand−2.266.810.27G14AcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.1st hairpin−2.295.98−0.56Y21LcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.2nd strand−2.146.33−0.21L29AcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.1st helix−1.833.77−2.77N34GcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.1st helix−1.845.40−1.14V48AcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.3rd strand−2.134.87−1.67F63AcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.2nd helix−2.054.47−2.07A64G/A65GcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.2nd helix−2.175.28−1.26L67AcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.2nd helix−2.135.84−0.70V81AcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.4th strand−2.015.01−1.53G85AcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.2nd hairpin−2.125.35−1.16V90AcMutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W.5th strand−2.095.45−1.10a Values were determined from CD-monitored guanidine denaturation curves (see Experimental Procedures).b F83W mutation.c Mutations are in the context of K41E, K42E, K57E, and F83W. Open table in a new tab We can roughly classify the effects of the mutations as follows. L67A (Figure 2H), A64G/A65G (Figure 2G), and V81A (Figure 2I) slow down the fast phase; L29A (Figure 2C), V48A (Figure 2E), and F63A (Figure 2F) speed up one or both of the two slower phases; L67A, G85A (Figure 2J), and to a lesser extent Y21L (Figure 2B), A64G/A65G, V81A, and V90A (Figure 2K) slow down one or both of the two slower phases; and G14A and N34G do not affect any phase. To interpret these results, we assume that because all the mutations involve side-chain truncations they destabilize intermediates and/or transition states (TSs) relative to the unfolded state (Matouschek and Fersht, 1991Matouschek A. Fersht A.R. Protein engineering in analysis of protein folding pathways and stability.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 82-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and that the interactions in transition states are subsets of the interactions in the stable structures they lead to. Therefore, in the model outlined above (Figure 1F), mutations that destabilize one or both of the nonnative structures should speed up one or both of the slower phases, and if they also destabilize the transition states leading into these states, they should slow down the fast phase. In contrast, mutations that destabilize the transition states out of the nonnative states toward the native state should slow down the middle and/or the slow phase. Given the complexity, detailed interpretation of the mutational results must proceed with caution, but in light of the considerations above, the residues in the middle portion of Top7 (L29, V48, F63, A64, A65, L67, and V81) appear important for the formation and/or stability of one or more of the nonnative states, and residues in the C-terminal portion (A64, A65, L67, V81, G85, and V90) appear important for the transition to the native state. Y21L does not affect the stability of the native state, but does slow the middle phase, perhaps by stabilizing the nonnative states. To identify structural elements of Top7 that may be responsible for the formation of the folding intermediates, five fragments of Top7 were purified and analyzed. The C-terminal fragment (CFr) consists of residues 45–94 (Figure 3B) and contains residues suggested by the mutational studies to be critical for the formation of the native state. The other fragments contain residues that appeared to be critical for the stability of I1 and/or I2. The smallest fragment, H1-H2 (residues 28–76), contains both helices and strand 3. The remaining fragments contain the H1-H2 core in addition to strand 2 and/or strand 4—S2-H2, H1-S4, and S2-S4 (Figures 3C–3F). CD analysis demonstrated that all five fragments form stable structures (Figure 4A) and, with the exception of H1-H2, possess significant amounts of secondary structure (Figure 4B). In the context of the full-length protein, the region corresponding to CFr forms a compact substructure, while the β strands of the other four fragments do not pair with each other (Figure 3), suggesting that the strands of these fragments in isolation are stabilized by nonnative contacts. In contrast, fragments of small naturally occurring proteins are seldom stable in isolation (Camarero et al., 2001Camarero J.A. Fushman D. Sato S. Giriat I. Cowburn D. Raleigh D.P. Muir T.W.

We also reported that deletion of ytfE significantly alters the phenotype of E. coli, generating a strain with enhanced susceptibility to nitrosative stress and defective in the activity of several iron-sulfur-containing proteins. In this work, it is shown that the E. coli ytfE confers protection against oxidative stress. Furthermore, we found that the damage of the [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters of aconitase B and fumarase A caused by exposure to hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide stress occurs at higher rates in the absence of ytfE.

Iron-sulfur ([Fe-S]) clusters are very simple, almost ubiquitous, and evolutionary ancient prosthetic groups that are essential for the function of proteins involved in a wide range of biological processes, including electron transfer chains, redox and nonredox catalysis of reactions that underpin metabolic pathways, and gene regulation, and as environmental sensors (1Beinert H.

Although in many cases in vitro assembly of [Fe-S] clusters and incorporation into apoproteins can occur spontaneously under reducing conditions and in the presence of ferrous iron and sulfide salts, in other cases [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis requires specific accessory proteins (2Johnson D.C.

Furthermore, proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters are one of the major targets of nitrosative and oxidative compounds that cause displacement of the iron atoms of the cluster and consequent malfunction of the protein/enzyme (7Drapier J.C.

In addition, the release of iron may further potentiate the effects of oxidative stress due to formation of the hydroxyl radical by the Fenton reaction (11Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, enzymes of the dehydratase family that contain [4Fe-4S]2+ catalytic centers (e.g. aconitase and fumarase) are rapidly inactivated (12Flint D.H. Emptage M.H. Guest J.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10331-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, three different machineries for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis were identified: the ISC (iron sulfur cluster) operon, the SUF (sulfur assimilation) operon, and the recently discovered CSD operon (reviewed in Refs. 2Johnson D.C.

These systems are widely spread in nature, with the ISC system and their homologs present in bacteria and most eukaryotes and the SUF system present in bacteria, archaea, plants, and parasites. Despite the similarity of the biochemical activity exhibited by some of the proteins encoded by the isc and suf operons, which might suggest overlapping functions, the two systems seem to be adapted for different purposes. Regulation and phenotypic studies performed in E. coli led to the proposal that the ISC system acts as the housekeeping [Fe-S] cluster assembly system, whereas the SUF system constitutes a specific system for cluster assembly under oxidative stress and iron depletion conditions (5Fontecave M.

Nevertheless, in E. coli, both sufABCDSE and iscRSUA operons are induced under oxidative and nitrosative stress conditions (14Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J.

In a previous study, we proposed that the di-iron protein E. coli YtfE could represent a novel system involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which is particularly important in cells subjected to stress conditions. In fact, expression of E. coli ytfE was found to be highly stimulated by nitrosative stress and iron starvation, and all examined iron-sulfur proteins had decreased activity levels in the strain lacking ytfE (16Justino M.C.

The goal of the present work is to evaluate the role of ytfE in oxidative stress and to determine whether YtfE is involved in the repair of degraded iron-sulfur clusters. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The strains used in this work were the wild type E. coli K-12 (ATCC 23716) and LMS4209 (K-12 ΔytfE) (16Justino M.C. Vicente J.B. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2636-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and for plasmid manipulations, the E. coli XL2-Blue strain was used. The fumarase A-expressing vector (pGS57) (20Woods S.A. Schwartzbach S.D. Guest J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and aconitase B-expressing vector (pGS783) (21Bradbury A.J. Gruer M.J. Rudd K.E. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Jeffrey Green (University of Sheffield). For the complementation of the ytfE mutant strain, a fragment of 1.1 kb comprising the ytfE promoter and coding regions was amplified by PCR from E. coli K-12 genomic DNA, using the primers 5′-ATTAGTCTGATGGATCCGATAGCCGT-3′ and 5′-GGCTGTTTATTGGTAAGAATTCGGCTGCTG-3′ and was cloned BamHI/EcoRI into pUC18. The generated plasmid (pytfE) was then used to transform the ΔytfE strain. All cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) 3The abbreviations used are: LB, Luria-Bertani; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; NO, nitric oxide. medium, pH 7.0, at 37 °C and 150 rpm. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), and kanamycin (30 μg/ml) (all from Sigma) were used when necessary. For oxidative stress sensitivity assays, cultures grown under microaerophilic conditions (i.e. grown in closed flasks completely filled with medium) that reached an A600 of 0.3 were treated with 2 mm hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) or left untreated, and the growth was followed for ∼2 h. For fumarase expression, wild type and ytfE mutant cells were transformed with pGS57 and grown aerobically with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to an A600 of ∼0.5. For aconitase expression, cells transformed with pGS783 were grown aerobically to an A600 of 0.3, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown for an additional 3 h. Fumarase- and aconitase-expressing cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended (1:100) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The level of aconitase B expression achieved in the wild type and in the mutant strain was the same, as judged by the similar intensity of the aconitase band analyzed by immunoblotting (data not shown). This is in accordance with the observation that the ratio of the level of the endogenous aconitase activity as well as fumarase activity in the wild type versus ytfE mutant is similar to the ratio of the wild type versus ytfE strain when the strains are overexpressing each enzyme. Determination of the Intracellular Free Iron by the Streptonigrin Sensitivity Assay and EPR Analysis—The assay for streptonigrin sensitivity was performed essentially as described in Ref. 22Nachin L. El H.M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar. Briefly, overnight cultures were used to inoculate fresh LB medium (A600 = 0.1), treated with streptonigrin and 2,2′-dipyridyl (both from Sigma), and grown aerobically at 37 °C and 180 rpm. After 18 h, the A600 values were measured, and the percentage of inhibition of growth was determined with respect to the growth of a corresponding control culture. The control cultures were treated with equal volumes of the solvents used to prepare the streptonigrin and 2,2′-dipyridyl solutions, dimethylformamide and methanol, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed. The intracellular free iron content was determined as described in Ref. 23Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar. Succinctly, 400 ml of aerobic grown cultures were collected by centrifugation at an A600 of ∼0.6, resuspended in 9 ml of fresh LB medium, and treated with 1 ml of 0.2 m desferrioxamine mesylate (Sigma) for 10 min, at 37 °C, under aerobic conditions. Untreated samples received the same amount of water. Cells were then collected, washed once with ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of the same buffer with 10% (v/v) glycerol. Aliquots of 0.3 ml were transferred to EPR tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments continuous flow helium cryostat and were recorded at 9.39 MHz microwave frequency, 2.4 milliwatt microwave power, and 10 K. The iron content in each sample was determined by amplitude of the EPR signal and normalized for protein concentration. Total protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (24Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18590) Google Scholar). Four independent cultures were analyzed. Whole Cell EPR Analysis—For EPR analysis, the cell suspensions of wild type and ytfE mutant strain expressing fumarase A or aconitase B were normalized for protein concentration and lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles, and aliquots of 300 μl were transferred to EPR tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen as control samples. The cell lysates of the wild type and ytfE strains were treated with either 4 mm H2O2 or 150 μm nitric oxide (NO) and incubated at room temperature. At fixed time points, 300-μl aliquots were removed and frozen. NO treatment was done by the addition of a pure NO-saturated anaerobic water solution (∼2 mm) prepared as described in Ref. 16Justino M.C. Vicente J.B. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2636-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. The EPR spectra were obtained as described above and at a temperature of 8–8.5 K. Preparation of Holo- and Apo-YtfE—Recombinant E. coli YtfE protein was purified essentially as described in Ref. 19Justino M.C. Almeida C.C. Goncalves V.L. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 257: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, as a mixture of monomer and dimeric forms, with 2 irons/monomer. To prepare the iron-depleted YtfE (apo-YtfE), 200 μm holo-YtfE was incubated with 10 mm EDTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 1 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The solution was then passed through a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Enzymatic Activity Assays—Enzymatic activities were determined in cell lysates prepared and treated in the same manner as the EPR samples. For the [Fe-S] cluster repair assays, 100 μg/ml tetracycline was added to the cell extracts 2 min before imposing the stress to inhibit de novo protein synthesis. H2O2 or NO stresses were stopped by the addition of 400 units of catalase or 40 μm hemoglobin (both from Sigma), respectively, and the enzyme activities were determined at fixed time points. Purified holo- or apo-YtfE proteins were added at 20 μm final concentration to the ytfE mutant cell extracts immediately after stopping the stress, and when appropriate, 1 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl was added before the protein. For the anaerobic incubation with ferrous iron, after the addition of catalase to the ytfE mutant cell extracts, the tubes were closed with Suba-seals, and the samples were deaerated under a flux of N2 and thus maintained over the duration of the incubation. After 1–2 min, 5 mm dithiothreitol and 80 μm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 were added, and the time was set t = 0. Aconitase activity was determined by following the formation of NADPH through the indirect method described in Ref. 25Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar. The samples were quickly thawed at room temperature and cleared by the addition of 0.5% (w/v) of sodium deoxycholate and a 1-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The samples were immediately inserted into Suba-sealed cuvettes, with deaerated 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+, and 1 unit of isocitrate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and the reactions were started by the addition of 30 mm sodium citrate. Fumarase activity was determined following the disappearance of fumarate as described in Ref. 26Massey V. Biochem. J. 1953; 53: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. The cell samples were quickly thawed at room temperature, cleared by the addition of 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and then diluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. The reactions were started by the addition of 10 mm fumarate and followed at 295 nm (ϵfumarate = 0.07 mm-1 cm-1) (26Massey V. Biochem. J. 1953; 53: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities were determined at 25 °C and are defined as units (μmol of product formed or consumed/min) per mg of total protein. The enzymatic activities were determined in duplicate from two independent cultures and are presented as averaged values with error bars representing one S.D. YtfE Is Involved in the Response to Oxidative Stress Caused by Hydrogen Peroxide—To determine whether the ytfE gene could be involved in the E. coli response to oxidative stress, the growth of E. coli wild type and the ytfE mutant strains were compared upon treatment with H2O2. As shown in Fig. 1, the addition of 2 mm H2O2 caused a very small growth inhibition in the wild type strain, whereas the ΔytfE cells suffered growth impairment, clearly showing that the lack of ytfE results in a strain with higher sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide stress. The ytfE disruption mutant could be complemented by a clone containing the ytfE gene, since the complemented strain grew to final culture densities similar to that of the parent strain following treatment with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1). The ytfE Mutant Has Higher Intracellular Iron Levels—We previously reported that the ytfE mutant strain is sensitive to iron limitation, that the ytfE gene is induced by iron starvation, and that Fur acts as a repressor in the transcription of ytfE (19Justino M.C. Almeida C.C. Goncalves V.L. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 257: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, it was proposed that the repression of ytfE by YjeB may be responsible for the iron-dependent regulation of ytfE (27Bodenmiller D.M. Spiro S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this work, the effect of streptonigrin, an iron-activated antibiotic whose toxicity increases with free iron, was evaluated on wild type and mutant strains in the absence and presence of the iron chelator 2,2′-dipyridyl (Table 1). The results clearly showed the higher sensitivity of the mutant strain to streptonigrin, even at a low antibiotic concentration (1 μg/ml), reflecting a higher amount of free iron in this strain. Whole cell EPR also demonstrated that the disruption of the ytfE gene led to a 2-fold increase in the intracellular levels of the free iron pool (data not shown).TABLE 1The E. coli ytfE mutant has a higher concentration of intracellular free iron Average values of three independent cultures ± S.D.StrainPercentage of growth compared with untreated controlNo 2,2′-dipyridyl1 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl1 μg/ml streptonigrin2 μg/ml streptonigrin1 μg/ml streptonigrin2 μg/ml streptonigrin%%%%Wild type81 ± 758 ± 395 ± 0.495 ± 5ΔytfE14 ± 47 ± 194 ± 1192 ± 8 Open table in a new tab Damage of [Fe-S] Clusters by Oxidative and Nitrosative Stress Is Accelerated in the Absence of ytfE—The E. coli strain disrupted in the ytfE gene displays lower resistance to stress conditions and diminished activity of iron-sulfur-containing enzymes (16Justino M.C.

Saraiva L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 257: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since [Fe-S] clusters are sensitive targets of both oxygen- and nitrogen-reactive species, we have evaluated the role of YtfE during damage caused by NO and H2O2 on two iron-sulfur proteins. To this end, E. coli wild type and ytfE mutant cells were transformed with plasmids pGS57 or pGS783 that contain the fumA and acnB genes, encoding for the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster containing dehydratases fumarase A and aconitase B, respectively. The active [4Fe-4S]2+ forms of aconitase B and fumarase A are EPR-silent. Under exposure to oxidative stress conditions, the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster converts to the enzymatically inactive [3Fe-4S]1+ form, which is EPR-detectable with a signal at g ∼ 2.02 (12Flint D.H. Emptage M.H. Guest J.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10331-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Imlay J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Prolonged exposure to stress conditions causes further degradation of the [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster to states that are also EPR-silent (13Djaman O. Outten F.W. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44590-44599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 29Han D. Canali R. Garcia J. Aguilera R. Gallaher T.K. Cadenas E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11986-11996Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). NO reacts with the iron atoms of the [Fe-S] clusters, forming iron-dinitrosyl complexes that are also EPR-detectable with a signal at g ∼ 2.04 and are enzymatically inactive (7Drapier J.C. Methods. 1997; 11: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol.

Therefore, E. coli cells were grown under conditions that ensure the expression of the two enzymes, and the EPR signals of the [Fe-S] clusters and enzymatic activities of fumarase and aconitase were monitored under oxidative and nitrosative stress conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). Oxidative Stress—E. coli wild type and ytfE mutant cells expressing fumarase or aconitase were exposed to 4 mm H2O2, and EPR spectra were recorded at different times after the addition of the chemical. Figs. 2 and 3 show that in both strains, the addition of hydrogen peroxide induced the development of an EPR signal with g value of ∼2.02, which corresponds to the degradation of the [4Fe-4S]2+ center to the enzymatically inactive intermediate [3Fe-4S]1+ form. However, the intensity and evolution of this signal and the time course of the activities of the two enzymes were different between the wild type and the mutant strain (Figs. 2 and 3).FIGURE 3Comparison of the hydrogen peroxide-induced damage on aconitase B overexpressed in E. coli wild type and ΔytfE cells by EPR and enzyme activity analysis. Wild type (A) and ΔytfE (B) cell extracts were treated with 4 mm H2O2, and the EPR spectra were recorded after 1, 5, and 30 min and are presented after subtraction of the EPR spectrum recorded of wild type untreated cell extracts (A, inset). The inset in B shows the unsubtracted EPR spectrum of ΔytfE untreated cells. The EPR intensity scales are the same for A and B. Other EPR parameters are as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, measured intensities of the EPR signals at g ∼ 2.02, attributed to the [3Fe-4S]1+ form of aconitase B, expressed in wild type (filled circles) and ΔytfE (open squares) cell extracts. D, aconitase activity determined in wild type (filled symbols) and ΔytfE (open symbols) treated with 1 mm H2O2 (circles) or with 4 mm H2O2 (squares) immediately after the zero point and normalized for the initial activity of each strain (wild type, 53.9 milliunits/mg protein; ΔytfE: 25.1 milliunits/mg protein).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In E. coli wild type cells overexpressing fumarase A, a signal at g ∼ 2.02 was observed immediately after H2O2 exposure. Five minutes after the stress imposition, the signal exhibited a small increase, keeping the same intensity after 30 min (Fig. 2, A and C). Overexpression of fumarase A in ytfE-depleted cells gave rise to a more intense g ∼ 2.02 signal that also increased after 5 min but, contrary to what was observed in wild type cells, exhibited a clear decrease for longer times (Fig. 2, B and C). The higher intensity of the g ∼ 2.02 signal correlates well with the faster and stronger decrease of the fumarase activity observed for ΔytfE upon the addition of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 when compared with the wild type strain (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the loss of the g ∼ 2.02 observed in ytfE mutant cells for longer periods is most probably due to further degradation of the [3Fe-4S]1+ center, as judged by the very low values of fumarase activity in yftE-depleted cell extracts measured for the same time interval (Fig. 2D). When submitted to hydrogen peroxide stress, cells producing aconitase B also exhibited the g ∼ 2.02 signal, but the E. coli wild type and the ytfE mutant presented different time evolution patterns (Fig. 3, A–C). The intensity of the EPR signal of the [3Fe-4S]1+ center of aconitase B observed in the ytfE mutant cells after hydrogen peroxide exposure was lower than that measured in the wild type cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Enzymatic measurements also revealed that cells expressing aconitase B and treated for 1 min with 4 mm of hydrogen peroxide showed a severe loss of aconitase activity, either in wild type or in ΔytfE (Fig. 3D). Hence, the lower intensity of the aconitase g ∼ 2.02 signal in ΔytfE is most probably due to a more degraded form of the aconitase [Fe-S] cluster present in the ΔytfE cells that is EPR-silent. Confirmation was obtained by lowering the concentration of hydrogen peroxide to 1 mm, in which case it was observed that the decrease in the aconitase activity caused by oxidative stress was more pronounced in the absence of ytfE (Fig. 3D). Nitrosative Stress—E. coli fumarase and aconitase produced in wild type and ytfE mutant cells and treated with nitric oxide were also analyzed. Nitrosative stress induced the development of a signal at g ∼ 2.04 in the EPR spectrum of fumarase A- and aconitase B-overexpressing cells resulting from the formation of an inactive dinitrosyl-iron-thiol complex, as previously reported (8Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). As expected, the EPR spectra of cells expressing fumarase A and submitted to NO showed the g ∼ 2.04 signal, whose intensity increased with time in the ytfE-depleted cells and remained essentially invariant in the wild type cells (Fig. 4, A–C). Enzymatic data acquired after the first minutes of NO stress showed that a ∼40% decrease in the initial activity of fumarase occurred for both strains. However, for longer times, the fumarase activity in the mutant strain exhibited a significant additional decrease, not observed in the wild type (Fig. 4D), indicating that in the ytfE minus background, [Fe-S] clusters are more prone to nitrosative damage. The EPR spectrum of wild type cells expressing aconitase B and exposed for 5 min to NO exhibited a signal with a g value of ∼2.02 (Fig. 5A), which can be attributed to the [3Fe-4S]1+ form, since the formation of varying amounts of this species has been reported for cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases treated with NO (8Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this form was never observed in the EPR spectra of ytfE mutant cells expressing aconitase B after incubation with NO (Fig. 5B). Analysis of the EPR signal of aconitase B dinitrosyl-iron-thiol complex (g ∼ 2.04) revealed that 30 min after the addition of 150 μm NO, the intensity of the signal was still increasing in ytfE mutant cells and has decreased in wild type cells (Fig. 5C). Since this concentration of NO rapidly induced a very strong loss of aconitase activity in both strains (Fig. 5D), the enzymatic activities were measured at lower NO concentrations (50 μm). Under these conditions, the loss of aconitase activity was enhanced in the ytfE mutant strain compared with the wild type strain (Fig. 5D). Altogether, these results showed that in the absence of the ytfE gene, hydrogen peroxide or nitrosative stress caused a stronger damage of the [Fe-S] clusters of both aconitase B and fumarase A, which translated into a more rapid loss of the enzymatic activities. Iron-Sulfur Cluster Repair Is Abolished in the ytfE Mutant— We next addressed the role of ytfE in the repair of [Fe-S] clusters disrupted by nitrosative and oxidative agents. To this end, the reappearance of the activities of cells expressing aconitase or fumarase was assayed in the presence of tetracycline, which blocks protein synthesis and ensures that regain of activity is due only to cluster repair. Moreover, for each enzyme, the stress exposure time was chosen in order to generate an equal decrease of the initial activity in both the wild type and mutant strain. For cells producing aconitase B and treated with hydrogen peroxide under conditions in which both strains had lost approximately half of the activity, it was observed that, contrary to the wild type strain that could recover full activity, the ytfE mutant was unable to regain any of the lost activity, at least in the period of observation tested (Fig. 6A). A similar behavior was observed for overexpressing aconitase B cells submitted to nitrosative stress (Fig. 6B), showing that the disruption of ytfE completely impaired the recovery of aconitase activity and that ΔytfE cell extract kept losing activity along the time. An analogous set of experiments was performed with cells expressing fumarase A and submitted to oxidative or nitrosative stress. After H2O2 stress, the wild type strain was able to attain full recovery of the fumarase activity within 10 min if the stress had caused a loss of approximately half of the initial activity (Fig. 7A) and within 1 h in the case of a more prolonged stress (Fig. 7B). On the contrary, no recovery at all of the fumarase activity was observed in the ytfE mutant, indicating that in this strain, the oxidative induced damage was irreversible (Fig. 7, A and B). The damage caused by NO on the fumarase activity was also found to be irreversible in the ytfE mutant, as judged by the absence of any degree of fumarase activity recuperation. In contrast, wild type cell extracts could recover almost all of the initial fumarase activity in a short period of time (Fig. 7C). In summary, these data showed that in the absence of ytfE and under the conditions tested, E. coli is unable to repair [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters modified by hydrogen peroxide or nitrosative stress. YtfE Is Able to Repair Oxidative and Nitrosative Damaged Iron-Sulfur Clusters—To confirm that the lack of [Fe-S] cluster repair was indeed dependent on the YtfE protein, the same set of experiments was performed for the ytfE mutant strain expressing the iron-sulfur enzymes but this time in the presence of purified E. coli YtfE protein. Hence, to cell lysates of ΔytfE expressing aconitase B or fumarase A, exposed to hydrogen peroxide or nitric oxide, and scavenged with catalase or hemoglobin, purified holo-YtfE was added, and the enzymatic activities were followed. It was observed that the addition of YtfE promoted the regain of the total enzymatic activity of fumarase or aconitase (Fig. 8, A and B), in contrast to what was previously observed in the ytfE mutant strain (Figs. 6 and 7), and fully reproduced the values measured for the wild type strain. It was also seen that the recovery of the enzymatic activity was independent of the time of the hydrogen peroxide stress applied (Fig. 8A) and that the rate of repair varied with the concentration of YtfE utilized (data not shown). The holo-YtfE was also able to promote repair under iron limitation conditions (Fig. 8C). On the contrary, neither apo-YtfE nor the addition of Fe2+ (80 μm) could promote the recovery of the enzymatic activity (Fig. 8C). It is worth mentioning that the ytfE mutant did not exhibit auxotrophy for thiamine, a phenotype related to impaired sulfur metabolism (30Mihara H. Esaki N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and that YtfE has no cysteine desulfurase activity (data not shown). The addition of YtfE to the cell lysates prior to the application of the stress did not prevent the decrease of the enzyme activity observed upon oxidative stress (data not shown), suggesting that YtfE is mainly involved in the repair of damaged clusters and does not protect them from destruction. E. coli ytfE shares transcriptional and phenotypic similarities with isc and suf operons, two systems with important roles in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters (31Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J.

The ytfE mutant also exhibits sensitivity to iron starvation (19Justino M.C. Almeida C.C. Goncalves V.L. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 257: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which is greater than the one observed for the iscS mutant and lower than that of the sufABCDSE mutant (36Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Furthermore, and as also observed for the suf mutant (22Nachin L. El H.M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), deletion of the ytfE gene led to an increase of intracellular free iron. Concerning the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters in E. coli, it has been reported that disruption of the isc operon yields a strain with lower activity of [Fe-S] cluster-containing enzymes (31Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 34Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all isc operon-encoded proteins of E. coli seem to be necessary for de novo synthesis and unnecessary for cluster repair, with the exception of IscS (13Djaman O. Outten F.W. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44590-44599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In fact, although the iscS mutant is still able to repair the destabilized clusters, the rate at which it occurs is significantly slower than in the wild type cells (13Djaman O. Outten F.W. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44590-44599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies on the Suf system revealed that this system is adapted to sustain [Fe-S] biogenesis under iron starvation and oxidative stress (13Djaman O. Outten F.W. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44590-44599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F.

In this work, we show that the activity of two iron-sulfur enzymes, aconitase B and fumarase A, are dependent on YtfE, since their activities in unstressed cell extracts were ∼50 and 30% lower in the ytfE mutant strain, respectively. In fact, these results corroborate our previous data, where it was also reported that ytfE is required for full activity of other examined iron-sulfur proteins, whereas enzymes that did not contain iron-sulfur clusters were unaffected by the mutation (19Justino M.C. Almeida C.C. Goncalves V.L. Teixeira M. Saraiva L.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 257: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the results reported here clearly revealed not only that the loss of aconitase and fumarase activities upon oxidation or nitrosylation occurs faster in the ytfE minus background, but also that the absence of ytfE results in a strain incapable of any significant repair, even after periods of time as long as 1 h, contrary to what is observed for the wild type strain that attains full recovery of the enzymatic activities within a few minutes. Only upon the addition of purified holo-YtfE protein to the mutant cell extracts were the fumarase and aconitase activities fully regained and at rates similar to the wild type (Fig. 8). The sensitivity of aconitase B and fumarase A to oxidative and nitrosative compounds is related with their rapid inactivation upon exposure to these agents, albeit by different mechanisms. Reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxide inactivate these enzymes through oxidization of the [4Fe-4S]2+ center, yielding an unstable [4Fe-4S]3+ cluster that spontaneously degrades to a [3Fe-4S]1+ form, with loss of the catalytic iron atom to the bulk solution (28Imlay J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide reacts with the [4Fe-4S]2+ center, leading to the formation of a catalytically inactive dinitrosyl-iron complex. The repair of the nitric oxide-modified clusters is proposed to require the initial removal of the dinitrosyl-iron complex, followed by reinsertion of ferrous iron and sulfide (37Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30980-30986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38Yang W. Rogers P.A. Ding H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12868-12873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas reactivation of the oxidatively damaged form can be achieved by treatment under reducing conditions with ferrous iron (39Varghese S. Tang Y. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In both cases, the reactivation of the damaged centers involves reinsertion of iron. The fact that the addition of purified holo-YtfE to cell extracts containing iron-sulfur enzymes in the inactive form allows the full recovery of their activity leads us to propose that YtfE is involved in the enzymatic process needed to recruit and integrate the ferrous iron. In summary, in this study, we have found that the ytfE gene is involved in oxidative stress protection. Furthermore, we have established that YtfE is an important protein for the repair process of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters damaged by oxidative and nitrosative stress. Further work will be needed to assess the role of YtfE on other types of Fe-S clusters. Nevertheless, it seems that E. coli requires several systems to achieve the assembly and repair of iron-sulfur clusters, and the importance of each system concerning the type of cluster remains to be established. We are grateful to Jeffrey Green (The Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, University of Sheffield, UK) for providing the antibody for the E. coli aconitase B and the expression vectors pGS783 and pGS57."
https://openalex.org/W1973185212,"C. elegans worms hatching in the absence of food show growth arrest during the first larval stage (L1). While much has been learned about the later diapause, dauer, which worms enter under adverse conditions, much less is known about the mechanisms governing L1 arrest. Here we show that worms lacking activity of the asna-1 gene arrest growth reversibly at the L1 stage even when food is abundant. asna-1 encodes an ATPase that functions nonautonomously to regulate growth. asna-1 is expressed in a restricted set of sensory neurons and in insulin-producing intestinal cells. asna-1 mutants are reduced in insulin secretion while overexpression of asna-1 mimics the effects of insulin overexpression. Human ASNA1 is highly expressed in pancreatic beta cells, but not in other pancreatic endocrine cell types, and regulates insulin secretion in cultured cells. We propose that ASNA1 is an evolutionarily conserved modulator of insulin signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2134556162,"Kinins play a central role in the modulation of cardiovascular function and in the pathophysiology of inflammation. These peptides mediate their effects by binding to two specific G-protein coupled receptors named B1 and B2. To evaluate the full functional relevance of the kallikrein-kinin system, we generated mice lacking both kinin receptors (B1B2-/-). Because of the close chromosomal position of both kinin receptor genes, B1B2-/- mice could not be obtained by simple breeding of the single knockout lines. Therefore, we inactivated the B1 receptor gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells derived from B2-deficient animals. The B1B2-/- mice exhibited undetectable levels of mRNAs for both receptors and a lack of response to bradykinin (B2 agonist) and des-Arg9-bradykinin (B1 agonist), as attested by contractility studies with isolated smooth muscle tissues. B1B2-/- mice are healthy and fertile, and no sign of cardiac abnormality was detected. They are normotensive but exhibit a lower heart rate than controls. Furthermore, kinin receptor deficiency affects the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced hypotension. While blood pressure decreased markedly in wild-type mice and B2-/- and moderately in B1-/- mice after bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, blood pressure remained unchanged in B1B2-/- mice. These results clearly demonstrate a pivotal role of kinins and their receptors in hypotension induced by endotoxemia in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1985635124,"The first biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of a purified membrane transporter for riboflavin (vitamin B2) is presented. The riboflavin transporter RibU from the bacterium Lactococcus lactis was overexpressed, solubilized, and purified. The purified transporter was bright yellow when the cells had been cultured in rich medium. We used a detergent-compatible matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry method (Cadene, M., and Chait, B. T. (2000) Anal. Chem. 72, 5655–5658) to show that the source of the yellow color was riboflavin that had been co-purified with the transporter. The method appears generally applicable for substrate identification of purified membrane proteins. Substrate-free RibU was produced by expressing the protein in cells cultured in chemically defined medium. Riboflavin, FMN, and roseoflavin bound to RibU with high affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry (Kd for riboflavin is 0.6 nm), but FAD did not bind to the transporter. The absorption spectrum of riboflavin changed dramatically when the substrate bound to RibU. Well resolved bands appeared at 441, 464, and 486 nm, indicating a hydrophobic binding pocket. The fluorescence of riboflavin was almost completely quenched upon binding to RibU, and also the tryptophan fluorescence of the transporter was quenched when flavins bound. The results indicate that riboflavin is stacked with one or more tryptophan residues in the binding pocket of RibU. Mutagenesis experiments showed that Trp-68 was involved directly in the riboflavin binding. The structural properties of the binding site and mechanistic consequences of the exceptionally high affinity of RibU for its substrate are discussed in relation to soluble riboflavin-binding proteins of known structure.

The structural properties of the binding site and mechanistic consequences of the exceptionally high affinity of RibU for its substrate are discussed in relation to soluble riboflavin-binding proteins of known structure. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is a water-soluble vitamin that is converted by flavokinases and FAD synthases to the cofactors FMN and FAD. These cofactors are indispensable for all living organisms, and they are involved in a wide range of reactions (1Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Vertebrates have lost the ability to synthesize riboflavin and the need to take up the vitamin from their gut (2Bowman B.B. Mccormick D.B. Rosenberg I.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1989; 9: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The proteins involved in epithelial uptake of riboflavin and membrane transport into other cell types in the body have not been identified yet. Most prokaryotes, fungi, and plants can synthesize riboflavin using pathways that have been well studied (3Bacher A. Eberhardt S. Fischer M. Kis K. Richter G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In addition, some prokaryotes and fungi can also take up riboflavin from the environment. The molecular identities of two very diverse types of riboflavin transporters have recently been established in yeast and bacteria (4Burgess C.M. Slotboom D.J. Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H.

A classical genetic approach revealed that riboflavin is transported across the plasma membrane of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Mch5p, a homologue of mammalian monocarboxylate transporters (6Reihl P. Stolz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39809-39817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In vivo transport studies suggested that the protein facilitates diffusion and does not use metabolic energy for transport of riboflavin. In the bacteria Lactococcus lactis and Bacillus subtilis, two homologous riboflavin transporters, YpaA and RibU, respectively, were found (4Burgess C.M. Slotboom D.J. Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H. Poolman B. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2752-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Kreneva R.A. Gel'fand M.S. Mironov A.A. Yomantas Y.A. Kozlov Y.I. Mironov A.S. Perumov D.A. Russ. J. Genet. 2000; 36: 972-974Google Scholar). RibU is a 22.8-kDa membrane protein with five predicted membrane-spanning segments. RibU is not homologous to any previously characterized flavin-binding protein and belongs to a novel family of transport proteins with members found in Bacteria and Archaea. In vivo transport studies showed that RibU, like Mch5p in yeast, is likely to mediate facilitated diffusion (4Burgess C.M. Slotboom D.J. Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H. Poolman B. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2752-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we have overexpressed and purified RibU, and we have spectroscopically and biochemically characterized the binding of flavins to the transporter. Materials—Riboflavin, FMN, and FAD were obtained from Sigma, and roseoflavin was from Toronto Research Chemicals. The concentrations of the flavins in solution were determined photometrically (7Fischer M. Haase I. Feicht R. Richter G. Gerhardt S. Changeux J.P. Huber R. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For roseoflavin an extinction coefficient of 31 mm-1·cm-1 at 505 nm was used (8Otto M.K. Jayaram M. Hamilton R.M. Delbruck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) 3The abbreviations used are: DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; RfBP, riboflavin-binding protein. was obtained from Anatrace. [3H]Riboflavin (24 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources. Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—L. lactis strains NZ9000 (9Kuipers O.P. de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and NZ9000-ΔribA (10Burgess C. O'Connell-Motherway M. Sybesma W. Hugenholtz J. van Sinderen D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 5769-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were used for cloning and expression. The ribU gene was engineered with the coding sequence for a C-terminal His10 tag by PCR. An NcoI site was introduced to coincide with the start codon, and an XbaI site was engineered immediately after the stop codon. These restriction sites were used to clone the ribU-His gene into expression plasmid pNZ8048 (9Kuipers O.P. de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar) behind the nisinA promoter. The DNA sequence was checked (ServiceXS, The Netherlands). Three mutants (W68Y, W79Y, and W97Y) were made using the PCR overlap extension method and cloned into a pNZ8048-derived vector by ligase-independent cloning. 4E. R. Geertsma, manuscript submitted. The sequences coding for an N-terminal His tag and tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site were introduced. All mutations (TGG to TAT) were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Service XS, The Netherlands). L. lactis strains were grown at 30 °C in either GLX or M17 (Difco) medium supplemented with 1.0% (w/v) glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. GLX contained 2% (w/v) gistex LS (Strik BV, Eemnes, The Netherlands) and 65 mm potassium phosphate (KPi), pH 7. Cells were grown in 1-liter bottles to an A600 of 0.7, followed by induction of the expression with 0.1% (v/v) culture supernatant of the nisin A producing strain NZ9700 (9Kuipers O.P. de Ruyter P.G.G.A. Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Biotechnol. 1998; 64: 15-21Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 1.5 h after induction. For the production of riboflavin-free RibU-His, 6 liters of cells were grown in M17 medium to an A600 of 0.7. Subsequently, cells were harvested, washed with sterile 50 mm KPi, pH 7, and transferred to a pH- and temperature-controlled fermenter (pH 6.8, 30 °C) containing 10 liters of chemically defined medium supplemented with 1.0% (w/v) glucose and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol (11Molenaar D. Hagting A. Alkema H. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5438-5444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without riboflavin. After 15 min, expression was induced with nisin A as described above. Cells were harvested after 1.5 h of induction and were frozen and stored at -80 °C. Purification of RibU-His—Membrane vesicles were prepared according to standard procedures (12van der Heide T. Poolman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7102-7106Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C. For solubilization, membrane vesicles were resuspended to a protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml in buffer A (10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8) supplemented with 15 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 8, and 0.5% DDM and incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing by inverting. Unsolubilized material was spun down (20 min at 440,000 × g and 4 °C), and the supernatant was incubated with nickel-Sepharose chromatography medium equilibrated in buffer A containing 15 mm imidazole, pH 8 (1 ml of medium/15 mg of membrane protein; GE Heathcare), for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The resin was poured into a disposable column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 60 mm imidazole, pH 8, and 0.05% DDM. Proteins were eluted in buffer A supplemented with 500 mm imidazole, pH 8, and 0.05% DDM in five fractions of 0.5 column volumes each. 5 mm Na-EDTA, pH 7.5, was added to the fractions, and the peak fraction (0.5 ml) was loaded onto a 23-ml Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% DDM). Fractions containing RibU-His were collected and used immediately. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were recorded on a MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems). For spectra of the purified protein the linear mode was used, and samples were prepared according to Cadene and Chait (13Cadene M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For riboflavin detection, the reflectron mode was used. Protein Concentration Determination and UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—The protein content of membrane vesicles was estimated using the BCA assay (Pierce) or the Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The concentration of purified RibU-His was determined by measuring absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.14 ml·mg-1·cm-1. For calculation of the extinction coefficient, quantitative amino acid analysis was performed (Eurosequence, The Netherlands). UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were performed using an MCS calorimeter (MicroCal) at 25 °C. Membranes (1.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) or purified RibU-His (4.25 μm in gel filtration buffer) was added to the MCS cell. Riboflavin (140 μm) was dissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (for vesicles), or in gel filtration buffer (for purified protein) and titrated into the cell. Data were analyzed using the MicroCal software provided (15Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Titration—Measurements were performed on a Spex Fluorolog 322 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon) at 25 °C in a 1-ml stirred cuvette. For fluorescence titration experiments, 0.1–1.8 μm purified RibU-His was used, and solutions of riboflavin, roseoflavin, FMN, or FAD were added in 1–2-μl steps. For riboflavin, FMN, and FAD, the excitation and emission wavelengths were 435 and 523 nm, respectively. Titrations in the absence of protein were performed as reference. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Flow Dialysis—Flow dialysis was performed essentially as described by Veldhuis et al. (16Veldhuis G. Vos E.P. Broos J. Poolman B. Scheek R.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1959-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in a 0.38-ml cell. Membranes (0.4 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) or purified RibU-His (1–2 μm in gel filtration buffer) was added to the dialysis cell. Tritiated riboflavin (stock solution 120 μm) was titrated into the cell. Titrations in the absence of protein were performed as reference. Data Analysis—Fluorescence titration and flow dialysis data were analyzed essentially as described by Veldhuis et al. (16Veldhuis G. Vos E.P. Broos J. Poolman B. Scheek R.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1959-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The measured signals (fluorescence or scintillation counts) were subtracted from the signals of the reference titrations, and the differences were plotted against the final concentration of added substrate. Curve fitting (OriginLab) was performed to find the best values for p, n0, and Kd using Equation 1,[ES]=p×(n+s+Kd2-(n+S+Kd)2-4×n×s2)Eq. 1 in which n is the concentration of binding sites in the cell; s is the final substrate concentration added; Kd is the dissociation constant; p is an instrument response factor; [ES] is the concentration of RibU-substrate complex. Dilution of the concentration of binding sites by the titration of substrate was taken into account as shown in Equation 2,n=n0(S0-SS0)Eq. 2 in which n0 is the concentration of binding sites at the start of the titration, and s0 is the concentration of substrate in the stock solution. In the analysis of the flow dialysis data, corrections were made to account for the amount of substrate dialyzed from the cell (16Veldhuis G. Vos E.P. Broos J. Poolman B. Scheek R.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1959-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of His-tagged RibU—The riboflavin transporter RibU from L. lactis was tagged with a C-terminal His10 tag and expressed in L. lactis NZ9000. Strikingly, membranes isolated from the cells expressing the histidine-tagged transporter (RibU-His) were bright yellow, whereas typically membrane vesicles from L. lactis are white. RibU-His was solubilized from the membranes with the detergent DDM and purified using nickel-Sepharose and gel filtration chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed that the protein was more than 99% pure (Fig. 1A), and the yield was ∼2 mg per liter of culture. The integrity of the purified His-tagged transporter (24.4 kDa) was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B). Identification of the Bound Substrate—Just like the membrane vesicles isolated from the RibU-His-expressing cells, the purified protein was also yellow. The absorption spectrum in the visible region of the purified protein had two peaks with maxima at 361 and 464 nm, respectively, and the latter peak had well defined shoulders at 441 and 486 nm (not shown, but compare Fig. 3A). The spectrum differed from the spectrum of riboflavin (dissolved in the same buffer), either because the spectral properties of riboflavin had changed when the molecule bound to the transporter or because there was a different yellow molecule bound to RibU-His. We used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to reveal the source of the yellow color. MALDI-TOF MS can be used to analyze membrane proteins directly in detergent solution without the need for extensive removal of impurities such as detergents, salt, and buffer (13Cadene M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A and B, shows mass spectra of riboflavin (376 Da in the oxidized form) and purified yellow RibU-His, respectively, in the m/z range of singly charged riboflavin. The two spectra look very similar and have peaks at m/z values of 377, 378, and 379 corresponding to the following three riboflavin species: oxidized and protonated riboflavin ([376 + 1H]+), the protonated riboflavin radical ([376 + 2H]+), and protonated reduced riboflavin ([376 + 3H]+), as reported previously by Ohashi and Itoh (17Ohashi Y. Itoh Y. Curr. Org. Chem. 2003; 7: 1605-1611Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The peak at m/z value of 379 also contained a contribution of the α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix, a spectrum of which is shown in Fig. 2C. The spectra conclusively demonstrate that riboflavin is bound to the purified RibU-His. Two other small molecules were found in the spectrum of RibU-His, Tris (m/z 122.1) and a sodium ion adduct of DDM (m/z 533.2) (spectra not shown).FIGURE 2Identification of the bound substrate to purified RibU-His by mass spectrometry.

Dialysis to remove riboflavin from the protein proved extremely inefficient and time consuming, and therefore a protocol was worked out to produce substrate-free RibU at the expression stage. We used a mutant of L. lactis NZ9000 with a disrupted ribA gene, which codes for 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate synthase (10Burgess C. O'Connell-Motherway M. Sybesma W. Hugenholtz J. van Sinderen D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 5769-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), an essential enzyme in the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway (3Bacher A. Eberhardt S. Fischer M. Kis K. Richter G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Because riboflavin is required for growth of L. lactis, the ribA mutant is completely dependent on the uptake of riboflavin from the environment. The ribA mutant was grown to the mid-exponential phase in rich medium (M17) containing riboflavin. The recombinant His-tagged RibU was not expressed at this stage, but the chromosomal copy of RibU was present for the uptake of riboflavin from the medium. Cells were then centrifuged, washed with buffer, and transferred to chemically defined medium from which riboflavin had been omitted. The cultivation was continued in chemically defined medium, and at the same time the expression of His-tagged RibU was induced with nisin A. The cells continued to grow until all residual riboflavin had been depleted. Membrane vesicles prepared from these cells expressed His-tagged RibU at similar levels as membrane vesicles prepared from cells grown in rich medium (not shown), but they were colorless indicating that riboflavin-free RibU-His had been produced. The absence of bound riboflavin was confirmed by absorption spectroscopy of the purified protein (Fig. 3A). Absorption and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra of riboflavin were recorded in the presence of increasing amounts of purified riboflavin-free RibU-His (Fig. 3A). Binding of riboflavin to RibU-His resulted in a hypsochromic shift of the absorption peak at 372 to 361 nm and a bathochromic shift of the maximum at 444 to 464 nm. Both shifts were accompanied by a reduction in the intensity. In addition, well defined shoulders appeared at 486 and 441 nm. As expected, the spectrum of riboflavin when bound to RibU-His looked very similar to the spectrum of yellow RibU-His purified from cells grown in rich medium (spectrum not shown), again confirming that riboflavin had been co-purified with the transporter. A similar titration was performed with roseoflavin, an inhibitor of riboflavin transport in L. lactis (4Burgess C.M. Slotboom D.J. Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H. Poolman B. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2752-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The absorption maximum at 505 nm shifted bathochromically to 518 nm, and the shift was accompanied by an increased intensity (Fig. 3B). Fig. 4A shows fluorescence emission spectra of riboflavin (0.2 μm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of RibU-His. At the emission wavelength of 523 nm, 94% of the riboflavin fluorescence was quenched when the molecule was bound to RibU-His. The small emission peak at 512 nm that remained at a high protein:riboflavin ratio was not caused by riboflavin fluorescence as it was also seen in the buffer without protein and riboflavin (not shown). The tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum of RibU-His had a maximum at 342 nm (Fig. 4B), and the fluorescence was quenched by the binding of both riboflavin and roseoflavin (Fig. 4B for riboflavin). Saturating concentrations of riboflavin and roseoflavin quenched 82 and 72% of the tryptophan fluorescence, respectively, and resulted in a red shift of the emission peak of 2–3 nm. Binding Parameters—Three independent methods were used to determine the dissociation constant and the binding stoichiometry of RibU-His and riboflavin: isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (15Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar), fluorescence titration (7Fischer M. Haase I. Feicht R. Richter G. Gerhardt S. Changeux J.P. Huber R. Bacher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and flow dialysis (16Veldhuis G. Vos E.P. Broos J. Poolman B. Scheek R.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1959-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the calculation of the binding stoichiometry, an accurate value of the protein concentration was required. We used A280 measurements and an ϵ280 of 1.14 ml·mg-1 ·cm-1, which was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Fig. 5 shows the results of the ITC of purified RibU-His, from which an apparent dissociation constant of 1.8 ± 0.7 nm was calculated and a binding stoichiometry of 0.85 molecules of riboflavin per protein molecule. Given the possibility that a fraction of the purified protein may be inactive and possible inaccuracy in the determination of the protein concentration (±20% for quantitative amino acid analysis), we conclude that there is one riboflavin-binding site per protein molecule. Flow dialysis using tritiated riboflavin (not shown) yielded very similar values (Table 1). Because ITC requires relatively large concentrations of protein (>1 μm) and the affinity of RibU-His for riboflavin is very high, the determination of the dissociation constant was not very accurate. Fluorescence titration, which is a more sensitive method, allowed the used of protein concentrations as low as 100 nm, which yielded a more accurate value for the dissociation constant of 0.6 nm (Fig. 6 and Table 1). Roseoflavin and FMN also bound with high affinity to the transporter, but FAD did not (Table 1). This is consistent with previous in vivo transport experiments, in which it was found that roseoflavin and FMN inhibit uptake of radiolabeled riboflavin by L. lactis cells and that both compounds are likely to be transported into the cells by RibU (4Burgess C.M. Slotboom D.J. Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H. Poolman B. van Sinderen D. J.

Inset, fluorescence of riboflavin when titrated to the protein solution (open squares) or to buffer (open circles). The fluorescence difference between the two curves was calculated and plotted against the riboflavin concentration (main graph). From this plot the Kd and binding stoichiometry were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ITC was also used to determine the binding parameters in membrane vesicles expressing riboflavin-free RibU-His. The Kd values in membrane vesicles were similar to the ones determined in detergent-solubilized RibU-His (Table 1). In the membrane vesicles 5.3 nmol of binding sites for riboflavin were found per mg of membrane protein. Because there is one binding site for riboflavin per RibU molecule (see above), the expression level of active RibU in the membrane vesicles was more than 10% of total membrane protein. This is consistent with Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels of membrane vesicles expressing RibU, which showed huge overexpression levels of RibU. Mutagenesis of Tryptophan Residues—RibU contains three tryptophan residues, Trp-68, Trp-79, and Trp-97. Each tryptophan was mutated to tyrosine, and the riboflavin dissociation constants were determined by fluorescence titration (cf. Fig. 6). Also the quenching of the remaining tryptophan residues by riboflavin binding was measured in the mutants. The riboflavin dissociation constants of the W79Y and W97Y mutants (Kd of 0.8 nm each) were very similar to the wild-type value (Table 1), indicating that Trp-79 and Trp-97 are not involved in substrate binding. In contrast, the riboflavin dissociation constant of the W68Y mutant had changed dramatically (Kd of 81 nm; Table 1). In contrast to the wild-type protein (Fig. 4B), the tryptophan fluorescence of the W97Y mutant was quenched to completion by riboflavin binding (Fig. 4D). From this we conclude that the residual tryptophan fluorescence (∼18%) of the wild-type protein saturated with riboflavin can be attributed to Trp-97. The result also demonstrated that the fluorescence of tryptophans 68 and 79 was completely quenched upon riboflavin binding. Consistently, the fluorescence of the W68Y mutant was quenched to a much lesser extent by riboflavin binding than the wild-type protein (Fig. 4C). But the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence and the quenching behavior of mutant W79Y were very similar to the wild-type protein (data not shown) indicating that tryptophan 79 only marginally contributes to the total tryptophan fluorescence of RibU. Binding of riboflavin to the transporter RibU results in marked changes in the absorption spectrum of the flavin (Fig. 3). The spectral characteristics of flavins bound to proteins contain information on the properties of the binding pocket. The spectrum of riboflavin bound to RibU has very well resolved absorption bands at 441, 464, and 486 nm, indicating a nonpolar environment of the flavin (18Ghisla S. Massey V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Harbury H.A. Lanoue K.F. Loach P.A. Amick R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1959; 45: 1708-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also the red shift of the absorption maximum from 444 to 464 nm and the decreased intensity of the peak at 361 nm are signs of a hydrophobic binding pocket (20Choi J.D. Mccormick D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Nishikimi M. Kyogoku Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The spectral changes are reminiscent of the changes that occur when riboflavin binds to hen egg RfBP, a soluble storage protein for the vitamin in egg white (20Choi J.D. Mccormick D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Nishikimi M. Kyogoku Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22White H.B. Merrill A.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1988; 8: 279-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of hen egg RfBP has been published (23Monaco H.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), although the coordinates are not present in the Protein Data Bank. In the crystal structure the binding pocket of riboflavin is hydrophobic with the isoalloxazine moiety of riboflavin stacked between the parallel aromatic rings of the side chains of a tryptophan and a tyrosine residue. Binding of riboflavin to hen egg RfBP results in an almost complete quenching of the riboflavin fluorescence, which is attributed to the π-stacking of the isoalloxazine ring and the aromatic residues. In addition, the tryptophan fluorescence of RfBP is quenched by ∼85% when riboflavin or riboflavin analogues are bound (20Choi J.D. Mccormick D.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Nishikimi M. Kyogoku Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which has been attributed to the presence of 5 out the 6 tryptophans in RfBP in the vicinity (<4.5 Å) of riboflavin (23Monaco H.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). π-Stacking of riboflavin with aromatic residues and concomitant quenching of the riboflavin fluorescence have also been seen in other riboflavin-binding proteins (e.g. in 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase and dodecin (24Bieger B. Essen L.O. Oesterhelt D. Structure (Cambridge). 2003; 11: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Gerhardt S. Haase I. Steinbacher S. Kaiser J.T. Cushman M. Bacher A. Huber R. Fischer M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 1317-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). Binding of riboflavin to RibU also resulted in quenching of both riboflavin and tryptophan fluorescence to similar extents as observed for RfBP (Fig. 4). Moreover, the riboflavin dissociation constants of RfBP and RibU are very similar (1.3 and 0.6 nm, respectively). We therefore speculate that the riboflavin-binding sites in RibU and RfBP may be similar, and that both binding pockets are very hydrophobic as indicated by the features of the absorption spectra. It must be noted that no sequence similarity exists between RfBP and RibU. The emission maximum of the tryptophan fluorescence of the apoprotein (342 nm) indicates that the tryptophans are in a polar environment when riboflavin is not bound. RibU has three tryptophan residues, Trp-68, Trp-97, and Trp-79, located at the C-terminal ends of putative membrane-spanning segments 2 and 3 and at the N-terminal end of segment 3, respectively. None of these is completely conserved in the family of RibU-like proteins (4Burgess C.M. Slotboom D.J. Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H. Poolman B. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2752-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but Trp-68 and Trp-97 are located in regions of well conserved aromatic residues, and we hypothesized that their fluorescence may be quenched by riboflavin. Mutagenesis of each of the tryptophan residues to tyrosine revealed that Trp-79 and Trp-97 are not involved in riboflavin binding, but the properties of the W68Y mutant changed dramatically compared with the wild-type protein. The dissociation constant changed over 100-fold to 81 nm. It is likely that that tryptophan 68 is stacked with isoalloxazine ring in the binding pocket of RibU, because the tryptophan fluorescence of Trp-68 was quenched to completion by binding of the substrate. The affinity of RibU-His for riboflavin is very high (Kd 0.6 nm), which ranks it among secondary transporters with the highest known affinity for their substrate. For comparison, lactose permease LacY has a substrate affinity that is 6 orders of magnitude lower (26Sahin-Toth M. Akhoon K.M. Runner J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). High affinity binding to RibU is probably necessary to scavenge riboflavin from the environment in which it is present at low concentration (nanomolar range) (2Bowman B.B. Mccormick D.B. Rosenberg I.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1989; 9: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The affinity of RibU for its substrate is comparable with the riboflavin binding affinity (Kd 5–20 nm) measured in membrane vesicles of B. subtilis (27Cecchini G. Perl M. Lipsick J. Singer T.P. Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7295-7301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very likely the binding of riboflavin to B. subtilis membranes is mediated by YpaA, a homologue of RibU (5Kreneva R.A. Gel'fand M.S. Mironov A.A. Yomantas Y.A. Kozlov Y.I. Mironov A.S. Perumov D.A. Russ. J. Genet. 2000; 36: 972-974Google Scholar). The high binding affinity of RibU and riboflavin poses a challenge for the release of riboflavin in the cytoplasm and necessitates the internal concentration of free riboflavin to be kept low. This is very likely achieved by metabolic trapping of riboflavin by flavin kinases/FAD synthases that convert the vitamin to FMN and FAD (27Cecchini G. Perl M. Lipsick J. Singer T.P. Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7295-7301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Technically, the high affinity brings about difficulties for in vitro transport assays in isolated membrane vesicles or in liposomes reconstituted with the protein. Because the transporter catalyzes facilitated diffusion (4Burgess C.M. Slotboom D.J. Geertsma E.R. Duurkens R.H. Poolman B. van Sinderen D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2752-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), no accumulation of substrate in the vesicle lumen will occur in the absence of metabolic trapping, and therefore transport is easily overshadowed by binding. Similar problems have been observed for example with the high affinity nickel transporter HoxN (28Eitinger T. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to establish that the substrate riboflavin is co-purified with RibU-His. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is used routinely to analyze the integrity of purified membrane proteins (Fig. 1B) (13Cadene M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The advantage of MALDI over other ionization techniques in the analysis of membrane proteins is that impurities (in particular the detergent needed to keep the membrane protein solubilized) do not have to be removed completely (13Cadene M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which makes rapid and routine measurements possible. To our knowledge the work presented here is the first example in which the technique has been used successfully to identify the substrate bound to a membrane transport protein. Identification of the substrates of membrane transport proteins is becoming increasingly important as genomics projects have revealed large numbers of putative transporters with no known substrates. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry provides a generic technique to identify substrates bound to purified membrane proteins. The requirement that the substrate is co-purified with the transporter may be easily met for high affinity binding systems such as RibU, but proteins that bind their substrates with lower affinity may lose the substrate during the purification. Nonetheless, theoretical calculations have shown that substantial amounts of substrates may be co-purified with proteins regardless of their binding affinity, provided that the protein concentrations are kept high throughout the purification (10–20-fold higher than the dissociation constant) (29Veldhuis G. Mechanistics of the Mannitol Transporter from Escherichia coli.. University of Groningen, 2006Google Scholar). Large amounts of membrane proteins of high concentration are routinely purified for crystallization purposes, and therefore MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry may provide a general tool for substrate identification in structural genomics projects in which membrane proteins of unknown function are being crystallized.

HCV infection is supported by viral strategies to evade the innate antiviral response wherein the viral NS3·4A protease complex targets and cleaves the interferon promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) adaptor protein to ablate signaling of interferon α/β immune defenses. Here we examined the structural requirements of NS3·4A and the therapeutic potential of NS3·4A inhibitors to control the innate immune response against virus infection. The structural composition of NS3 includes an amino-terminal serine protease domain and a carboxyl-terminal RNA helicase domain. NS3 mutants lacking the helicase domain retained the ability to control virus signaling initiated by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiation antigen 5 and suppressed the downstream activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through the targeted proteolysis of IPS-1. This regulation was abrogated by truncation of the NS3 protease domain or by point mutations that ablated protease activity.

Treatment of HCV-infected cells with an NS3 protease inhibitor prevented IPS-1 proteolysis by the HCV protease and restored RIG-I immune defense signaling during infection. Thus, the NS3·4A protease domain can target IPS-1 for cleavage and is essential for blocking RIG-I signaling to IRF-3 and NF-κB, whereas the helicase domain is dispensable for this action.

There are nearly 200 million people worldwide with chronic HCV infection, and it is a major cause of hepatitis and liver disease. Moreover, HCV is associated with the development of liver cancer and is currently the leading indication for liver transplants (1Alter H.J. Seeff L.B. Semin.

HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae family of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. The 9.6-kilobase genome of HCV encodes a single polyprotein that is post-translationally processed into at least 10 structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins by a combination of host and viral proteases (3Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Reesink H.W. Hepatitis C Virus. Karger Publisher, Basel, Switzerland1998: 55-85Google Scholar). In addition to their primary role in HCV genome replication and virion maturation, various HCV proteins have been shown to antagonize host immune defenses. HCV control of the innate antiviral response and interferon (IFN) α/β antiviral defenses may provide a cellular foundation for viral persistence (4Gale Jr., M. Foy E.M. Nature. 2005; 436: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The innate antiviral response to RNA virus infection is triggered when intermediates of viral replication, including viral RNA or protein products, are recognized by specific cellular pathogen recognition receptors (5Saito T.

NS3·4A cleaves IPS-1 at Cys-508, thereby releasing it from the mitochondrial membrane and preventing its downstream activation of immune effectors (27Loo Y.M. Owen D.M. Li K. Erickson A.K. Johnson C.L. Fish P.M. Carney D.S. Wang T. Ishida H. Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Saito T. Lee W.M. Hagedorn C.H. Lau D.T. Weinman S.A. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6001-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, the NS3·4A structural motifs and features that direct IPS-1 cleavage and loss of RIG-I and MDA5 signaling have not been defined. NS3·4A is a complex, bifunctional molecule (Fig. 1) that is essential for NS protein processing and viral RNA replication (28Bartenschlager R. J. Viral. Hepat. 1999; 6: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Rosenberg S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of NS3 contains a serine protease that non-covalently binds its cofactor, NS4A. NS4A is a small peptide necessary for efficient processing of the HCV polyprotein by NS3 and is thought to be involved in tethering the complex to intracellular membranes (30Wolk B. Sansonno D. Krausslich H.G. Dammacco F. Rice C.M. Blum H.E. Moradpour D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2293-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 31De Francesco R. Pessi A. Steinkuhler C. Antivir. Ther. 1998; 3: 99-109PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of NS3 possesses a DEXD/H box helicase with nucleoside triphosphatase activity believed to participate in RNA unwinding during viral RNA replication (32Kwong A.D. Kim J.L. Lin C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 171-196PubMed Google Scholar). Its helicase activity was found to be positively modulated by the protease domain and NS4A (33Kuang W.F. Lin Y.C.

Virol. 2005; 79: 8687-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Conversely, conserved motif VI of the helicase domain has been shown to affect protease activity (33Kuang W.F. Lin Y.C. Jean F. Huang Y.W. Tai C.L. Chen D.S. Chen P.J. Hwang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Fukuda K. Umehara T. Sekiya S. Kunio K. Hasegawa T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, structural studies of full-length NS3 indicate that the carboxyl terminus of the helicase domain may interact with the protease active site (39Yao N. Reichert P. Taremi S.S. Prosise W.W. Weber P.C. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (369) Google Scholar), suggesting a structural and functional interconnectivity of the two domains. NS3 also encodes an arginine-rich region shown to bind other host proteins (40Borowski P. Oehlmann K. Heiland M. Laufs R. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Borowski P. zur Wiesch J.S. Resch K. Feucht H. Laufs R. Schmitz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30722-30728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). NS3·4A interaction with its cellular targets could, therefore, occur through a variety of processes mediated by its helicase or protease domains. Several peptidomimetic NS3·4A protease active site inhibitors are in preclinical development as HCV antiviral drugs (42Tan S.L. He Y. Huang Y. Gale Jr., M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Future use of these compounds could represent an alternative or supplement to the current treatment regimen for HCV infection, IFN-α and ribavirin combination therapy, which is only effective in about 50% of patients (43Feld J.J. Hoofnagle J.H. Nature. 2005; 436: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). NS3·4A protease inhibitors may also exhibit immunomodulatory properties by removing the protease-dependent blockade to the innate antiviral response during HCV replication (23Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 25Foy E. Li K. Sumpter Jr., R. Loo Y.M. Johnson C.L. Wang C. Fish P.M.

A. 2005; 102: 2986-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), although the impact of IPS-1 in this process is not known. The current study was undertaken to define the domain structure and function of NS3·4A that regulates the host cell innate antiviral response. Expression Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—pFLAG NS3·4A and pFLAG NS3 were generated as described (23Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Constructs (Fig. 1) containing NS3 helicase domain truncations at amino acids (aa) 1206 (protease domain alone, Prot), 1238, 1486, and 1501 as well as a protease domain deletion (NS3 aa 1207-1658, Hel) were made as follows. NS3 mutants were cloned by PCR (with primers containing a 5′ HindIII site and a 3′ XbaI site) using BD Advantage-HF 2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences) into pCR2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). These constructs were then subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Sigma). A protease active site mutant (NS3·4A S1165A) and deletion of an arginine-rich region (aa 1487-1501; NS3·4A Δ1487-1501) were constructed using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strat-agene). Because NS4A forms part of the protease active site and is indispensable for full protease activity (31De Francesco R. Pessi A. Steinkuhler C. Antivir. Ther. 1998; 3: 99-109PubMed Google Scholar), a scheme was devised allowing expression of NS4A with the NS3 mutants. Expressing NS4A from a separate plasmid was not sufficient to result in efficient protease activity (data not shown). To circumvent this problem we created a primer containing an aminoterminal KpnI site, 12 amino acids of NS4A (aa 21-32; which intercalate into the NS3 protease active site), and a flexible linker (GSGS) region and subcloned this into the HindIII sites of the pFLAG NS3 1026-1206, creating a fully functional, single-chain (SC) NS3·4A protease domain (SC Protease). This strategy was similar to that described by Taremi et al. (44Taremi S.S. Beyer B. Maher M. Yao N. Prosise W. Weber P.C. Malcolm B.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The flexible linker was also subcloned into pFLAG NS3 (SC NS3), pFLAG NS3 1026-1238 (SC NS3 1026-1238), pFLAG NS3 1026-1486 (SC NS3 1026-1486), and pFLAG NS3 1026-1501 (SC NS3 1026-1501) to generate the SC constructs indicated in parentheses. NS3·4A, NS3·4A S1165A, and the SC Protease were subcloned into pEF1/Myc-His B (Invitrogen) to allow high efficiency expression of each. NS3·4A and NS3·4A S1165A were cut with HindIII, blunt-ended with Kleenow fragment, digested with XbaI, and subcloned into the EcoRV and XbaI site of pEF1/Myc-HisB. The SC Protease was subcloned into the SacI and XbaI sites of pEF1/Myc-His B. Primer sequences for all constructs are available upon request. Plasmids and Transfection—pFLAG NS4A, pFLAG NS5A, and pFLAG NS5A·B were previously described (23Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M.

Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Results were calculated relative to Renilla luciferase values. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of NF-κB DNA binding activity was conducted on UNS3·4A and UNS3 nuclear extracts as described (46Fredericksen B. Akkaraju G.R. Foy E. Wang C. Pflugheber J. Chen Z.J. Gale Jr., M. Viral Immunol. 2002; 15: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in the presence (-NS3·4A) or absence (+NS3·4A, +NS3) of 1 mg/ml tetracycline, and protease inhibitor (20 μm SCH6 or 10 μm ITMN-C) or Me2SO (mock treatment) was added to the media for 24 h. Cells were then mock-infected or infected with 100 hemagglutinin units/ml of Sendai virus, and infection was allowed to proceed 18 h. As a positive control for NF-κB activation, some wells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 30 min with 20 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α in serum-free media. Antibody supershifts were performed using antibodies against NF-κB p50 or p65 subunits (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). NF-κB consensus and mutant oligonucleotides were obtained from Santa"
https://openalex.org/W2054080005,"When erythrocytes are exposed to hypoxia, hemoglobin (Hb) stabilizes in the T-state by capturing 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This process could reduce the intracellular pool of glycolytic substrates, jeopardizing cellular energetics. Recent observations suggest that hypoxia-induced activation of glycolytic enzymes is correlated with their release from Band III (BIII) on the cell membrane. Based on these data, we developed a mathematical model of erythrocyte metabolism and compared hypoxia-induced differences in predicted activities of the enzymes, their products, and cellular energetics between models with and without the interaction of Hb with BIII. The models predicted that the allostery-dependent Hb interaction with BIII accelerates consumption of upstream glycolytic substrates such as glucose 6-phosphate and increases downstream products such as phosphoenolpyruvate. This prediction was consistent with metabolomic data from capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry. The hypoxia-induced alterations in the metabolites resulted from acceleration of glycolysis, as judged by increased conversion of [13C]glucose to [13C]lactate. The allostery-dependent interaction of Hb with BIII appeared to contribute not only to maintenance of energy charge but also to further synthesis of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which could help sustain stabilization of T-state Hb during hypoxia. Furthermore, such an activation of glycolysis was not observed when Hb was stabilized in R-state by treating the cells with CO. These results suggest that Hb allostery in erythrocytes serves as an O2-sensing trigger that drives glycolytic acceleration to stabilize intracellular energetics and promote the ability to release O2 from the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2117403783,"Embryogenesis and asexual reproduction are commonly considered to be coordinated developmental processes, which depend on accurate progression through a defined sequence of developmental stages. Here we report a peculiar developmental scenario in a simple chordate, Botryllus schlosseri, wherein a normal colony of individuals (zooids and buds) is regenerated from the vasculature (vascular budding) through a sequence of morphologically abnormal developmental stages. Vascular budding was induced by surgically removing buds and zooids from B. schlosseri colonies, leaving only the vasculature and the tunic that connects them. In vivo imaging and histological sections showed that the timing and morphology of developing structures during vascular budding deviated significantly from other asexual reproduction modes (the regular asexual reproduction mode in this organism and vascular budding in other botryllid species). Subsequent asexual reproduction cycles exhibited gradual regaining of normal developmental patterns, eventually leading to regeneration of a normal colony. The conversion into a normal body form suggests the activation of an alternative pathway of asexual reproduction, which involves gradual regaining of normal positional information. It presents a powerful model for studying the specification of the same body plan by different developmental programs."
https://openalex.org/W2067277192,"Green fluorescent proteins (GFP) are widely used in biology for tracking purposes. Although expression of GFP is considered to be innocuous for the cells, deleterious effects have been reported. We recently demonstrated that expression of eGFP in muscle impairs its contractile properties (Agbulut, O., Coirault, C., Niederlander, N., Huet, A., Vicart, P., Hagege, A., Puceat, M., and Menasche, P. (2006) Nat. Meth. 3, 331). This prompted us to identify the molecular mechanisms linking eGFP expression to contractile dysfunction and, particularly, to test the hypothesis that eGFP could inhibit actin-myosin interactions. Therefore, we assessed the cellular, mechanical, enzymatic, biochemical, and structural properties of myosin in the presence of eGFP and F-actin. In vitro motility assays, the maximum actin-activated ATPase rate (Vmax) and the associated constant of myosin for actin (Km) were determined at 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:3 myosin:eGFP molar ratios. At a myosin:eGFP ratio of 1:0.5, there was a nearly 10-fold elevation of Km. As eGFP concentration increased relative to myosin, the percentage of moving filaments, the myosin-based velocity, and Vmax significantly decreased compared with controls. Moreover, myosin co-precipitated with eGFP. Crystal structures of myosin, actin, and GFP indicated that GFP and actin exhibited similar electrostatic surface patterns and the ClusPro docking model showed that GFP bound preferentially to the myosin head and especially to the actin-binding site. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that expression of eGFP in muscle resulted in the binding of eGFP to myosin, thereby disturbing the actin-myosin interaction and in turn the contractile function of the transduced cells. This potential adverse effect of eGFP should be kept in mind when using this marker to track cells following transplantation.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) 2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; HMM, heavy meromysin; ASA, accessible surface area.2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; HMM, heavy meromysin; ASA, accessible surface area. and its variants are widely used to visualize organs, cell populations, protein localizations, and subcellular processes in in vitro and in vivo studies. In particular, in cell transplantation studies, these reporter proteins are used to quantify engraftment of transplanted cells, monitor their phenotypic changes and correlate these findings with their functional effects (2Brazelton T.R. Nystrom M. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3Nygren J.M. Jovinge S. Breitbach M. Sawen P. Roll W. Hescheller J. Taneeran J. Fleischmann B.K. Jacobsen S.E. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The GFP reporter proteins emit fluorescence without any external treatment, which allows visualization of gene expression within living cells. Although expression of GFP is considered to be innocuous for the cells, cytotoxic effects involving apoptotic mechanisms have been demonstrated in several in vitro studies (4Liu H.S. Jan M.S. Chou C.K. Chen P.H. Ke N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 5Hanazono Y. Dunbar C.E. Emmons R.V. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 20: 1313-1319Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that transgenic expression of GFP caused a dilated cardiomyopathy in two independent transgenic mouse lines (6Haung W.Y. Aramburu J. Douglas P.S. Izumo S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 482-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and dose-dependent co-expression of eGFP and β-galactosidase in the cytoplasm of forebrain neurons resulted in growth retardation, weakness, and premature lethality (7Krestel H.E. Mihaljevic A.L.A. Hoffman D.A. Schneider A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 17: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that cytoplasmic expression of eGFP in muscle cells impairs their contractile function (1Agbulut O. Coirault C. Niederlander N. Huet A. Vicart P. Hagege A. Puceat M. Menasche P. Nat. Meth. 2006; 3: 331Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, we demonstrated that although eGFP-transduced (using a lentiviral vector, ppt-PGK-eGFP-WPRE) rat myoblasts actively proliferate, differentiate, and fuse to form multinucleated myotubes in culture, the percentage of spontaneously contracting myotubes in eGFP-transduced cells was two times lower compared with their non-transduced counterparts. In addition, using a rat model of myocardial infarction, after myocardial transplantation of eGFP- or non-transduced myoblasts, we found that eGFP-transduced skeletal myoblasts yielded a significantly poorer echocardiographic recovery of left ventricular function than their non-transduced counterparts. These data were deemed to be consistent with previous findings of Huang et al. (6Haung W.Y. Aramburu J. Douglas P.S. Izumo S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 482-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) that the transgenic expression of GFP can cause a dilated cardiomyopathy. The present study was designed to identify the molecular mechanisms linking eGFP expression to contractile dysfunction and, more specifically, to test the hypothesis that eGFP could inhibit actin-myosin interactions. To gain further insights into potential interactions between GFP and myosin, we assessed the cellular (electromechanical coupling), mechanical (in vitro motility assay), enzymatic (actin-activated ATPase rate), biochemical (co-precipitation), and structural properties of myosin in the presence of eGFP and F-actin. Isolation, Preparation, and Transduction of Skeletal Myoblasts—Myoblasts were expanded from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats, as previously described (8Al Attar N. Carrion C. Ghostine S. Garcin I. Vilquin J.T. Hagege A.A. Menasche P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and transduced with a third-generation lentiviral vector (ppt-PGK-eGFP-WPRE) expressing eGFP cDNA under control of a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter by using a multiplicity of infection of 25 in the presence of 2 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After a 10-h incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Two days later the cells were harvested by trypsination. The percentage of eGFP-expressing myogenic cells was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter using anti-CD56 (BD Biosciences) and desmin (Dako) antibodies. Electromechanical Coupling of Cultured Myotubes—Myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes in 2% fetal calf serum. The cells were then loaded with 5 μm fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 10–15 min, transferred to the stage of a fast-acquisition epifluorescence confocal microscope, and superfused with HEPES-buffered Hanks' solution supplemented with 2 mm Ca2+. The field was illuminated at 488 nm (Argon laser). Fluo-4 emission fluorescence was recorded through a dichroic mirror (cutoff 510 nm) and a long pass emission filter (cutoff 520 nm) set on a motorized filter wheel. The images were recorded every 30 ms using a confocal PerkinElmer Ultraview microscope coupled to a CCD camera (Coolsnap, Princeton) and digitized on line by a computer (Metamorph software, Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). To calculate the frequency and synchronization of Ca2+ spikes in the myotubes, regions of interest were selected in cells and the average pixel intensity was plotted as a function of time. To estimate cell shortening, a regions of interest was set at the border of the cell so that each contraction resulted in a negative fluorescence signal. Cells featuring shortening were also counted in the culture dish on the stage of an inverted microscope. All experiments were performed at 35 ± 2 °C and were repeated three times. In Vitro Motility Assays—In vitro motility assays were performed using purified rabbit heavy meromyosin (HMM) and phalloidin-labeled rabbit F-actin (9Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 10Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). HMM (containing two myosin heads that are the functional motor domain of myosin) was obtained by a proteolytic digestion with α-chymotrypsin of skeletal myosin according to the method of Margossian and Lowey (9Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). G-actin was extracted as described by Pardee and Spudich (10Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) from acetone powder prepared from the residues of rabbit muscles after myosin extraction. After polymerization, F-actin was labeled by incubation with phalloidin Fluo-Probes 547 (Interchim, France) as described by Kron and Spudich (11Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Motility assays were recorded at 29 °C as previously described (12Coirault C. Lambert F. Pourny J.C. Lecarpentier Y. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In brief, HMM was diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in myosin buffer (300 mmol/liter KCl, 25 mmol/liter imidazole, 4 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 1 mmol/liter EGTA, pH 7.4). eGFP (Clontech) was infused into the flow cell along with myosin at the following molar ratios: 1:0.5 myosin:eGFP (×0.5), 1:1 myosin:eGFP (×1), and 1:3 myosin:eGFP (×3). Control samples had no added eGFP. Unbound myosin was washed out with myosin buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Actin buffer consisting of 25 mmol/liter KCl, 25 mmol/liter imidazole, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 4 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter dithiothreitol was then infused into the flow cell with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Unlabeled F-actin filaments were used to eliminate non-functional myosin molecules (13Sellers J.R. Cuda G. Wang F. Homsher E. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 39: 23-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Motility of actin filaments was initiated by adding 2 mm MgATP with an oxygen-scavenger enzyme system (20 mmol of dithiothreitol, 0.02 mg/ml catalase, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 3 mg/ml glucose). The movement of actin filaments was observed after a stabilization period of 5 min under a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200, 100/1.30 lens, Jena, Germany) with an intensified camera (Hamamatsu C 2400, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and recorded on videotape. The percentage of moving filaments and the mean velocity of each filament were analyzed using N. J. Carters free-ware RETRAC program. This protocol was chosen after preliminary experiments showing that the timing of eGFP infusion did not influence the results. Actin-activated ATPase Assays—Actin-activated ATPase activity was determined at 29 °C as previously described (14Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Briefly, myosin diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in actin buffer was mixed with eGFP at the molar ratios specified. Actin was added to a final concentration of 0, 5, 10, and 30 μmol/liter and the reaction was started with 2 mmol/liter MgATP. Malachite green reagent was used to determine Pi production. Observed ATPase rates were corrected for ATP hydrolysis in the absence of actin. The maximum actomyosin ATPase activity (Vmax, s-1) and the association constant of myosin for actin (Km, μmol) were determined from a double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot of the ATPase rate versus actin concentration. Co-precipitation Assay—Six histidine (His6)-tagged recombinant eGFP, skeletal muscle myosin (HMM), cardiac muscle myosins or different myosin:eGFP mixtures (1:1) were incubated with nickel-coated agarose beads (HIS-Select Nickel Affinity assay, Sigma) in reaction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m sodium chloride, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8). The presence of His6 residues in recombinant eGFP allows to interact specifically with nickel-coated agarose beads, whereas myosin alone does not. Following centrifugation (3,000 × g for 30 s) and two washings with reaction buffer, the binding proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole. After removing the nickel-coated agarose beads by centrifugation, the proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Following migration, the gels were silver stained. Western blot analysis was carried out using antimyosin heavy chain antibody (MHC-s, Novocastra, Newcastle, United Kingdom). Antibody reacting bands were visualized following development with peroxidase-labeled horse anti-mouse Ig (Vector Labs, CA) and a chemiluminescent detection system (Super Signal, Pierce Biotechnology). Rat cardiac muscle myosin was prepared by standard methods (15Tyska M.J. Hayes E. Giewat M. Seidman J.G. Warshaw D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8533-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. Electrostatic potential was calculated with GROMOS96 implementation of the Swiss PDB viewer. Models of association of eGFP with myosin were generated by the fully automatic ClusPro protein-protein docking server (20Comeau S.R. Gatchell D.W. Vajda S. Camacho C.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W96-W99Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). First, a rigid body docking is performed, using ZDOCK (21Chen R. Li L. Weng Z. Proteins. 2003; 47: 80-87Crossref Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) based on the fast Fourier transform correlation techniques. ZDOCK uses a scoring function based on shape complementarities, electrostatic potentials, and desolvation terms. Second, filtering is performed using empirical free energy functions and pairwise root mean square deviation clustering. The ligand with the most neighbors is the cluster center, which is then minimized by the CHARMM algorithm in the presence of the receptor. Models were visualized using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD, 22Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (37521) Google Scholar) for docking models and Deep View (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9507) Google Scholar) for electrostatic potential. Energy computations were in vacuo done with the GRO-MOS96 (43B1 parameters set without reaction field) implementation of Swiss PDB viewer. The accessible surface area (ASA) of the complexes is calculated according to Lee and Richards (24Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar). With a probe sphere radius of 1.4 Å, the ASA was defined as the surface mapped out by the center of the probe as if it were rolled around the van der Waals surface of the protein. The program is used to calculate the ASA of each protomer in the complex and then the complete complex. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. The mean velocity was calculated for each filament. The effect of eGFP on the number of sliding filaments, velocities, and enzymatic properties was assessed by using analysis of variance. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and the Fisher test. A p value of less than 0.05 was required to rule out the null hypothesis. To determine the contractile properties of eGFP-transduced and non-transduced skeletal myotubes, we performed electromechanical recordings of excitation-contraction coupling in an in vitro setting (Fig. 1). Ca2+ transients were recorded in both Fluo-4-loaded non-transduced and eGFP-expressing myotubes. We found that the same percentage of both eGFP-transduced and non-transduced cultured myotubes featured spontaneous calcium transients. However, whereas calcium transients were translated into contractions in 39 ± 1% of the non-transduced cells, this percentage was lower (21 ± 1%) in the eGFP-transduced subset, thereby providing evidence, at the single cell level, for an eGFP-induced impairment of electromechanical coupling (n = 9/group, analysis of variance, p < 0.001). We postulated that this excitation-contraction impairment could be due to an inhibition of actin-myosin interactions by the nonspecific sarcomeric binding of the fluorescent protein. To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed both the mechanical (in vitro motility assay) and enzymatic (actin-activated ATPase rate) properties of myosin in the presence of eGFP. In vitro motility assays were performed using skeletal myosin (HMM), phalloidin-labeled rabbit F-actin filaments, and recombinant eGFP. Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of increasing amounts of eGFP on actin filament sliding over myosin. As eGFP concentration increased relative to myosin, the percentage of moving filaments decreased by 27 ± 5% compared with that seen in the group with no added eGFP (controls) (Fig. 2a) (from 91 ± 1% at baseline (control) to 66 ± 4% moving filaments at 1:1 myosin:eGFP ratio, p < 0.05). At 1:3 myosin:eGFP ratios, only 9 ± 3% of actin filaments were still in movement (Fig. 2a). In the presence of a myosin:eGFP ratio of 1:1, the actin filament velocity was 28% slower than the control rate (3.3 ± 0.1 versus 2.4 ± 0.1 μms-1 in control and 1:1 myosin:eGFP ratio, respectively, p < 0.05). Increasing the myosin:eGFP ratio to 1:3 induced further decreases in sliding velocity (1.6 ± 0.1 μms-1, p < 0.05 versus control). No significant changes in filament velocity and percentage of moving filaments were observed at a myosin:eGFP ratio of 1:0.5 (Fig. 2, a and b). Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to determine the maximum actin-activated ATPase rate (Vmax, in s-1) and the associated constant of myosin for actin (Km, in μm) values (Fig. 3, a–c). The actin-activated ATPase rate was determined using purified myosin, F-actin, and eGFP. The presence of a myosin:eGFP ratio of 1:0.5 was associated with a nearly 10-fold elevation of Km for actin compared with control myosin (80 ± 9.0 versus 8 ± 3 μm, p < 0.05), whereas Vmax did not significantly differ between these 2 groups (16.5 ± 2.0 s-1 in control versus 23.2 ± 3.0 s-1 in 1:0.5). As the eGFP concentration increased relative to myosin, Vmax decreased dramatically, reaching 6.2 ± 1.8 s-1 and 0.5 ± 0.1 s-1 at 1:1 and 1:3 myosin:eGFP ratios, respectively (p < 0.05). Compared with control, there were no significant changes in Km at myosin:eGFP ratios of 1:1 and 1:3 (17 ± 6 and 3 ± 1 μm, respectively) (Fig. 3b).FIGURE 3Myosin-eGFP interaction: actin-activated ATPase activity. Myosin was incubated with eGFP at 1:0 (Control), 1:0.5 (0.5x), 1:1 (1x), and 1:3 (3x) myosin:eGFP molar ratios. Actin at increasing concentrations was incubated with myosin and eGFP and Lineweaver-Burk plots (a) were used to determine the apparent binding affinity to actin (Km)(b) and maximum actin-activated ATPase rate (Vmax, in s-1) (c). Values are mean ± S.E., *, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also used a histidine-select nickel affinity assay to determine whether myosin co-precipitated with eGFP (Fig. 4). Our results demonstrated that when mixed with eGFP, the myosin was detected by gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). In contrast, when myosin interacts with nickel-coated agarose beads without eGFP, no myosin was detected. It should be noted that these results are identical with skeletal (HMM) and whole cardiac myosin monomers. These results indicate that myosin co-precipitated with eGFP and also underlined that eGFP bound preferentially to the HMM part of myosin. Finally, crystal structures of myosin (2MYS), actin (1ATN), and GFP (1EMA) obtained from the Protein Data Bank were analyzed to gain further insights into myosin and GFP interactions. We first found that GFP and actin proteins exhibited similar electrostatic surface patterns (Fig. 5, a and b). It is important to note that actin exhibits mainly negative electrostatic surface potential patterns at the myosin-binding site, whereas myosin exhibits a positive electrostatic surface pattern at the actin-binding site. Therefore, the rigid-body docking program ZDOCK filtered and ranked by ClusPro was used to establish docking models of actin-myosin and GFP-myosin. ZDOCK takes into account the electrostatic potential as well as shape complementarities. To confirm our docking model, we first compared our actin-myosin docking model with the model of actin-myosin complex constructed from electron microscopy images (19Mendelson R. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8533-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5c). Our results showed that the docking model was close to the electronic microscopy model with a root mean square deviation value of about 17 Å. After validation of our docking model, the same protocol was used to establish the model of myosin-GFP complex that is presented in Fig. 5d. Energetic and surface analysis of the complex myosin-GFP and actin-myosin are given on Table 1. Interface ASA of the complex is slightly higher for actin-myosin complex than for the myosin-GFP (Table 1). In particular, residues 538–561 of myosin are involved in interaction with both actin and GFP. Knowing the residues involved in the interaction, we calculated the energy associated to electrostatic interactions compared with other non-bonded interactions for these residues. Our results showed that the main stabilizing forces of both complexes are the electrostatic ones that confirm the importance of these forces for actin-myosin and myosin-GFP complex formation.TABLE 1Interface ASA and energy of electrostatic and others in the models of myosin-GFP and actin-myosin complexes After determination of residues involved at the interface of the complexes, the energy associated to these residues was calculated using the GROMOS96 implementation of Swiss PDB viewer.Interface ASANon-bondedElectrostaticÅ2KJ/molComplex myosin-GFPGFP795–417–734Myosin762–22–192Complex actin-myosinActin1070–420–1009Myosin102796–165 Open table in a new tab In the present study we have examined how eGFP reporter gene expression in muscle cells impaired muscular contractile function. To identify the molecular mechanisms involved, we analyzed (i) the ex vivo contractile performance and calcium signals in eGFP expressing skeletal myoblasts, (ii) the in vitro effects of purified recombinant eGFP on myosin function, and (iii) the crystal structures of myosin, actin, and GFP. Taken together, we showed that excitation-contraction uncoupling and impaired contractile function of the muscle cells were related to eGFP competition with actin for the myosin-binding site. GFP and its variants are widely used in a variety of experiments in cell biology. When the GFP gene is co-transfected with a gene of interest, it serves as a marker of co-transfection. In addition, transplanted cells expressing GFP can be easily identified in host animals. GFP has also been used as an intracellular indicator. When the GFP gene is used as a tag by fusing it with a gene of interest, the localization of the passenger protein can be determined. Although GFP and its variants are particularly attractive, in each situation care must be taken and the cellular and molecular effects of these reporter proteins must be carefully investigated. In fact, some studies have reported deleterious effects of GFP expression in in vitro (4Liu H.S. Jan M.S. Chou C.K. Chen P.H. Ke N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 5Hanazono Y. Dunbar C.E. Emmons R.V. Hum.

Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) demonstrated cytotoxic effects of GFP expression in NIH3T3, BHK-21, Huh-7, and HepG2 cell lines. In their study, different cell lines were transfected with three GFP-containing plasmids, under the control of the SV40 promoter, and the cells expressing GFP were found to die within a few days. Moreover, it has been reported that transgenic overexpression of GFP caused a dilated cardiomyopathy in two independent transgenic mouse lines (6Haung W.Y. Aramburu J. Douglas P.S. Izumo S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 482-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and dose-dependent co-expression of eGFP and β-galactosidase in the cytoplasm of forebrain neurons resulted in growth retardation, weakness, and premature lethality (7Krestel H.E. Mihaljevic A.L.A. Hoffman D.A. Schneider A. Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 17: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many studies have used GFP and its variants without reporting toxic effects. In one striking example, eGFP was ubiquitously and constitutively expressed in the mouse under control of the chicken β-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer without any detected abnormality (25Okabe M. Ikaxa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2251) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that only heterozygous mice were presented in this study and it can thus be speculated that the number of copies in this case was insufficient to cause any deleterious effects. In our study, the skeletal myoblasts were transduced with a third generation lentiviral vector expressing eGFP cDNA under control of a ubiquitous phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Lentiviral vectors are highly effective vectors for transgene integration and expression, suggesting that a high expression of eGFP was obtained in our myoblasts. Zielske et al. (26Zielske S.P. Lingas K.T. Li Y. Gerson S.L. Mol. Ther. 2004; 9: 923-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in an human immunodeficiency virus-based vector, transgene expression and number of copies per cell were highly variable from one cell to the next. Taken as a whole, these observations strongly suggest that the deleterious effects of GFP are manifest in a dose-dependent fashion. GFP fusion proteins modulate the expression and subcellular localization of GFP within muscle cells. On the one hand, GFP fused to myosin heavy chain or myosin light chain has been extensively used to examine the contractile cytoskeleton in living striated muscle cells (27Moores S.L. Sabry J.H. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Wang Q. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when these fused proteins are overexpressed in the C2C12 muscle cell line, no disturbance of the contractile machinery is reported. GFP-myosin purified from these cells exhibits the same ATPase activities and in vitro motility as wild-type myosin (27Moores S.L. Sabry J.H. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Wang Q. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4227-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data suggest that myosin function is not modified provided that GFP is placed away from the actin-binding site and nucleotide-binding regions of the molecule. On the other hand, we demonstrated that the presence of eGFP markedly affected myosin function, as evidenced by severe changes in both the mechanical and enzymatic properties of myosin. It is important to remind that acto-myosin interaction involves different steps, whose regulations are not necessarily coordinated (31Bobkov A.A. Bobkova E.A. Lin S.H. Resiler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2285-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 32Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 33Spudich J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The rate of ATPase is inversely correlated to the overall time cycle duration, whereas the filament velocity, analogous to the unloaded shortening velocity seen in muscle fibers (32Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 34Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is thought to be limited by the rate of actin-myosin dissociation (33Spudich J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Huxley A.F. Prog. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1957; 7: 255-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, thin filaments move over a motility surface at similar speeds over a wide range of myosin densities, providing that enough myosin heads are attached at any time to give continuous movement (32Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Thus, modifications of myosin properties can be associated with a lack of correlation between ATPase measurements in solution and the myosin velocity in in vitro motility assays (31Bobkov A.A. Bobkova E.A. Lin S.H. Resiler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2285-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Bobkova E.A. Bobkov A.A. Levitsky D.I. Resiler E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the presence of a myosin:eGFP ratio of 1:0.5, our results indicated an apparent reduction in the binding affinity to actin (increased Km) associated with normal sliding velocity and maximum ATPase activity. Thus, at a myosin:eGFP ratio of 1:0.5, eGFP competitively inhibited the apparent binding affinity of myosin to actin, thereby suggesting that actin and eGFP competed for binding to the same myosin active site, i.e. the actin-binding site. It was likely that at the low myosin:eGFP molar ratio, reduction of functional myosin, i.e. myosin available for acto-myosin interactions was low enough so that myosin density remains sufficient to ensure continued movement of the thin filament. As the eGFP concentration increased relative to myosin, Vmax decreased dramatically with no significant changes in Km. This behavior reflected non-competitive inhibition of actin and eGFP at higher eGFP concentrations, thereby suggesting that several eGFP molecules nonspecifically bind to myosin and inactivate it. As the number of myosin heads available to ensure continual movement has became insufficient, reduced velocity in in vitro motility assays occurred. It was also possible that the slow cycling and noncycling myosins inhibited motility of the fast cycling myosin by exerting a viscous drag force on actin filaments (32Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 34Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural modeling of myosin-GFP and actin-myosin complexes shows that docking takes place preferentially on the same binding site of the myosin head, which confirmed that GFP may compete with actin for the same site of myosin. Our results showed that the main stabilizing forces of both complexes are the electrostatic ones. In addition, our structural results are consistent with our actin-activated ATPase assay that confirmed that eGFP competes with actin for the active site of myosin. Addition of eGFP in the reaction decreases binding of actin to myosin, which results in an impairment of excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle cells. These findings are consistent with those of Huang et al. (6Haung W.Y. Aramburu J. Douglas P.S. Izumo S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 482-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) showing that overexpression of soluble GFP in the cytoplasm of cardiac cells induced dilated cardiomyopathy. In this earlier study, GFP expression was driven by an α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter. It is thus possible that in the absence of fusion of GFP with intracellular proteins, GFP, a soluble protein, was expressed and distributed freely throughout the cytosol. This situation could have a potentially toxic effect at high GFP expression levels, whereas GFP fused with other proteins restricted its localization to a cellular compartment, thereby limiting its toxicity. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro experiments, involving electromechanical coupling, in vitro motility assays, determination of the actin-activated ATPase rate, and co-precipitation and structural analysis, provide compelling evidence that eGFP markedly affects myosin function via competition of eGFP with actin for myosin-binding sites, thereby causing excitation-contraction uncoupling and impaired contractile function of the muscle cells. Our results do not intend to detract from the use of GFP transgenic models where the number of DNA copies is expected to be smaller than after stable cell transfection and thus to have less impact on the contractile machinery of the cells. They simply raise a cautionary word about the interpretation of the functional outcomes of cell transplantation using eGFP-transduced grafts for the purpose of cell tracking.

T lymphocytes express Gαi2 and Gαi3, two members of the Gαi/o protein family, but whether these two Gαi proteins have distinguishable roles guiding T cell migration remains largely unknown because of a lack of member-specific inhibitors. This study details distinct Gαi2 and Gαi3 effects on chemokine receptor CXCR3-mediated signaling. Our data showed that Gαi2 was indispensable for T cell responses to three CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, as the lack of Gαi2 abolished CXCR3-stimulated migration and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) incorporation. In sharp contrast, T cells isolated from Gαi3 knock-out mice displayed a significant increase in both GTPγS incorporation and migration as compared with wild type T cells when stimulated with CXCR3 agonists. The increased GTPγS incorporation was blocked by Gαi3 protein in a dose-dependent manner. Gαi3-mediated blockade of Gαi2 activation did not result from Gαi3 activation, but instead resulted from competition or steric hindrance of Gαi2 interaction with the CXCR3 receptor via the N terminus of the second intracellular loop. A mutation in this domain abrogated not only Gαi2 activation induced by a CXCR3 agonist but also the interaction of Gαi3 to the CXCR3 receptor. These findings reveal for the first time an interplay of Gαi proteins in transmitting G protein-coupled receptor signals. This interplay has heretofore been masked by the use of pertussis toxin, a broad inhibitor of the Gαi/o protein family.

These findings reveal for the first time an interplay of Gαi proteins in transmitting G protein-coupled receptor signals. This interplay has heretofore been masked by the use of pertussis toxin, a broad inhibitor of the Gαi/o protein family. Heterotrimeric G proteins consist of α, β, and γ subunits that couple to seven transmembrane receptors called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Ab, antibody; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PTX, pertussis toxin; S1P1, sphingosine 1-phosphate 1; KO, knock-out; WT, wild type; IFN, interferon; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; HA, hemagglutinin; ConA, concanavalin A. The G protein resides attached to the intracellular face of the plasma membrane in an inactive form consisting of the Gα subunit bound to GDP, a structure that is stabilized by interaction with the βγ dimer. Agonist binding to the receptor provokes a conformation change that facilitates the interaction of the Gα subunit to the receptor. Upon interaction with the receptor, Gα protein becomes activated, causing GDP exchange for GTP. This activation to the high energy Gα-GTP results in dissociation of the α and βγ subunits and propagation of downstream signaling by both the Gα-GTP and the βγ subunits. The GTP-binding proteins are classified by the signaling events they instigate, of which there are four major families as follows: Gαi/o, Gαq/11, Gα12/13, and Gαs (1Wilkie T.M. Gilbert D.J. Olsen A.S. Chen X.N. Amatruda T.T. Korenberg J.R. Trask B.J. de Jong P. Reed R.R. Simon M.I. Jenkins N. Copeland N. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Members of the Gαi/o family, including Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαo, Gαgust, and Gαt, can all be irreversibly uncoupled from receptors by pertussis toxin (PTX) (3Kaslow H.R. Burns D.L.

PTX catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of a specific cysteine residue at position –4 from the C terminus of the α subunits, and thus blocks downstream pathways by preventing receptor interaction (5Sunyer T. Monastirsky B. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The bacterial toxin has proven to be an excellent tool in dissecting the essential role of Gαi proteins in chemotaxis, proliferation, and differentiation of various cells (3Kaslow H.R. Burns D.L.

However, it cannot distinguish unique properties of individual Gαi/o protein family members. Investigation of the details of GPCR and G protein interactions has drawn great attention in the past decade, because the interactions dictate the specificity and amplitude of a GPCR-stimulated cellular response, and GPCRs are targets for more than 30% of the current marketed drugs (8Wise A. Gearing K. Rees S. Drug Discov. Today. 2002; 7: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The primary PTX substrates evident in T lymphocytes are the 40–41-kDa α subunits of the Gαi2 and Gαi3 proteins (9Beals C.R. Wilson C.B. Perlmutter R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7886-7890Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Kim S.Y. Ang S.L. Bloch D.B. Bloch K.D. Kawahara Y. Tolman C. Lee R. Seidman J.G. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4153-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The importance of PTX-sensitive proteins in lymphocyte trafficking came initially from the unique phenotype of lck-PTX-transgenic mice that expressed the PTX catalytic S1 subunit in thymocytes and peripheral T cells under the control of an lck promoter (11Chaffin K.E. Perlmutter R.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The transgenic mice had 2–4-fold more mature CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes in the thymus than did control mice and few or no T cells in the peripheral lymphoid tissues because of a defect in thymic emigration (11Chaffin K.E. Perlmutter R.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thymocyte emigration appears to be controlled by either Gαi3 or Gαi2, because null mutation of either of them does not affect this process significantly (12Rudolph U. Finegold M.J. Rich S.S.

Gαi2-deficient mice display impairment in lymph node development in several anatomic locations and in Peyer's patch formation (12Rudolph U. Finegold M.J. Rich S.S. Harriman G.R. Srinivasan Y.

The mice develop inflammatory bowel disease, at least in part, due to a lack of transforming growth factor-β responses in T cells that causes Th1-skewed hyperimmune responses in the colon (12Rudolph U.

In this study, we investigate unique properties of Gαi2 and Gαi3 in chemotaxis of activated T cells induced by CXCR3 ligands, because expression of the CXCR3 receptor has been associated with pathophysiology of Th1-type autoimmune diseases in both humans and experimental models (17Balashov K.E.

The receptor has the following three known ligands: monokine-induced IFN-γ (MIG)/CXCL9, IFN-γ-inducible 10-kDa protein (IP-10)/CXCL10, and IFN-γ-inducible T cell α-chemoattractant/CXCL11. These three chemokines exhibited discernible biological effects in vivo and in vitro (20Hancock W.W. Gao W. Csizmadia V. Faia K.L. Shemmeri N. Luster A.D. J. Exp.

Interestingly, we found that Gαi3 was negatively involved in the CXCR3-mediated signaling. This translated to cellular responses, where a lack of Gαi3 significantly enhanced T cell migration toward CXCR3 agonists. Gαi3 appears to hinder Gαi2 activation via the N terminus of the second intracellular loop. A mutation in this region abolished both activation of Gαi2 and the binding of Gαi3 to the receptor. This work begins to unravel an interplay between individual Gαi proteins that has previously been masked by the use of PTX. Animals—Gαi2-knock-out (KO), Gαi3-KO, and wild type (WT) control mice on the mixed 129Sv/C57BL/6 background were generated by gene targeting and backcrossed with C57BL/6 (B6) mice for six times as described (12Rudolph U.

Both female and male mice were used at 4–6 weeks of age unless otherwise indicated. The mice were housed in conventional cages at the animal facilities of the Massachusetts General Hospital in accordance with institutional guidelines. T Cell Preparation—Single-cell suspensions prepared from lymph nodes and spleens were treated with a mixture of rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies (Abs) against CD19, CD32, and CD16 followed by depletion of Ab-bound cells with BioMag goat anti-rat IgG (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) per the manufacturer's instructions. This preparation isolated an ∼90% pure population of T cells. CXCR3 expression on these T cells was induced by stimulation for 2 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with 2.0 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA) in a complete RPMI 1640 medium (10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol). The cells were continuously cultured for 2 more days in the medium with replenishment of 15% ConA supernatant, which gave rise to a maximal level of CXCR3 expression. Cell Membrane Preparation—Cell membrane was prepared as described with some modifications (26Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, T cells stimulated with or without ConA as above were collected, suspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm PMSF), and Dounce-homogenized. In some cases, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml PTX for 1 h at 37°C before suspension in hypotonic buffer and homogenization. Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The remaining supernatant was spun at 32,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C to pellet the cell membrane that was then suspended in membrane solubilization buffer (20 mm glycine, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm PMSF). The suspended cell membrane was left on ice for at least 2 h with periodic vortexing and then frozen until use. GTPγS Assay—Cell membrane equivalents of 20 μg of protein were first incubated with the indicated concentrations of chemokines on ice for 1 h to prime Gαi activation by the receptor (27Sklar L.A.

G protein activation was initiated by placing samples at room temperature for 2 h in the presence of 0.3 nm [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a GTP-binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with fresh 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm GDP (28Harrison C. Traynor J.R. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 489-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Activation of Gαi proteins at room temperature instead of 37 °C minimizes background radioactive incorporation (28Harrison C. Traynor J.R. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 489-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The concentrations used for each CXCR3 ligand were empirically determined based on the most robust migratory response and our preliminary tests. All chemokines were obtained from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Where indicated, a myristoylated Gαi3 protein or control Gαo protein (Calbiochem) at varying concentrations was preincubated with the cell membrane for 1 h on ice to allow the added Gα protein to interact with the βγ subunit in the membrane prior to chemokine stimulation (27Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To determine the Gαi protein in association with the receptor, 20 μg/ml monoclonal Ab specific for Gαi2 (IgG2b, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or an isotype-matched control Ab was added to the samples, along with the chemokine to block Gαi2 protein activation (29Spiegel A.M. Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 536-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The samples were then transferred to a 96-well plate and suctioned through a glass fiber filter by a TomTec cell harvester (model MACH 3 M, Hamden, CT). The filters were washed five times with a cold GTP washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2) and dried, and radioactive count was determined on a 1450 MicroBeta scintillation counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). Percentages of specific GTPγS incorporation in activated T cell membranes were calculated as ((counts/min of sample) – (counts/min of background control))/((counts/min control without a stimulus) – (counts/min of background control)) × 100, where background controls contained 1,000 times excess cold GTPγS relative to radioactive [35S]GTPγS. Migration Assays—The Transwell system with 3-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) was used for all transmigration assays, because T cells are relatively small in size. This pore size significantly reduced the basal levels of T cell migration in our study. T cells at 3 × 106 cells/ml in Aim-V medium (Invitrogen) were added to the upper chamber at 0.3 ml per well, with the indicated concentrations of chemokines in 0.6 ml of Aim-V medium in the lower chamber. Freshly isolated T cells or T cells activated by ConA for 4 days were allowed to migrate for 4–6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Atthe end of the migration, the cells in the lower chamber were collected and counted on a hemocytometer. Western Blot Analysis—To examine Gαi2 expression in T cell membranes, T cells with or without stimulation were collected and lysed in cold nondenaturing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture), followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min to remove nuclear fragments and unbroken cells. Crude cell membrane was pelleted from the supernatant by centrifugation at 32,000 × g for 25 min. Protein samples of ∼100 μg were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-Gαi2 monoclonal Ab (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Gαi2 protein was visualized by incubation of the membrane with sheep anti-mouse Ab conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) followed by reaction with SuperSignal West Pico ECL reagents (Pierce) and exposure to Kodak film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For assessment of Gαi3 protein expression, Gαi2 protein was first depleted by anti-Gαi2-specific Ab because of cross-reaction of anti-Gαi3 Ab with Gαi2 protein and similar molecular mass of these two G proteins. Briefly, T cell membranes prepared above were incubated for 1 h on ice with anti-Gαi2 Ab-conjugated protein G-agarose beads that had been treated previously with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the depletion was repeated three times. The resultant Gαi2-depleted T cell membranes were subjected to Western blotting analysis using anti-Gαi3 Ab (BIOMOL International LP) as detailed above. The same membranes were re-probed, after stripping, with anti-G protein pan-β subunit Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for equal protein loading controls. Flow Cytometry—To determine chemokine receptor expression, T cells with or without stimulation with ConA or transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with specific Abs followed by analysis on a FACSCalibur cytometer equipped with a CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). A murine CXCR3-specific Ab (clone 4c4) was a generous gift from Dr. Dominic Picarella (Millenium Pharmaceuticals) (30Hancock W.W. Lu B. Gao W. Csizmadia V. Faia K. King J.A. Smiley S.T. Ling M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1515-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-conjugated rat anti-mouse Abs specific for CCR7 or CXCR4 and mouse anti-human CXCR3 Ab were purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA), R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), or Pharmingen, respectively. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Gαi2 and Gαi3 proteins were synthesized and 35S-labeled by the TnT® Quick-Coupled in Vitro Transcription/Translation Systems per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). In brief, 1 μg of a Gαi2 or Gαi3 plasmid was mixed with the rabbit reticulocyte lysate provided, 100 μm myristic acid, and [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) for 75 min at 30 °C. The resulting product was verified by SDS-PAGE on the basis of the size and compared in the presence or absence of the specific plasmid. Immunoprecipitation—To study CXCR3-associated Gαi proteins, COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA plasmids containing either WT or mutated CXCR3 receptors or a control HA-tag·S1P1 (sphingosine 1-phosphate 1) receptor using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Three mutants were as follows: 1) an R149N-CXCR3 that had asparagine (Asn) substitution for arginine (Arg) at position 149; 2) LLL-CXCR3 generated by replacement of alanines for leucines (Leu) at positions 332–334 in the C terminus; and ST(–)-CXCR3 constructed by substitution of all serines (Ser) and threonines (Thr) in the C terminus with alanines (24Colvin R.A.

The transfected cells were lysed, and the cell membrane was prepared and suspended in a GPCR solubilization buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm PMSF in phosphate-buffered saline) as described (24Colvin R.A.

Cell membranes with equivalent of 60 μg of protein were incubated with 3 μl of in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled Gαi2 or Gαi3 for 1 h on ice to allow the added Gαi protein to interact with the βγ subunit in the membrane, after which the cell membrane was either left unstimulated or stimulated for 2 h on ice by indicated chemokines and activated at room temperature as described (27Sklar L.A. Vilven J. Lynam E. Neldon D. Bennett T.A. Prossnitz E. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The stimulated membranes were then cross-linked for 2 h on ice with 20 μm dithiobis-sulfosuccinimidyl propionate (Pierce). The cross-linker was quenched by the addition of 50 μm Tris, pH 7.5, for 15 min on ice. To the chemokine-stimulated membranes, anti-CXCR3 Ab or control Ab was added, and the Ab-bound receptor was pulled down by pre-cleaned protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen). For HA-S1P1-transfected cells, immunoprecipitation using anti-HA Ab was carried out in place of anti-CXCR3 Ab. The resultant beads were washed extensively with a cold GPCR washing buffer (1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline). Radioactivity of the resultant beads was quantified by scintillation counting on the 1450 MicroBeta scintillation counter to determine the amount of 35S-Gαi2 or 35S-Gαi3 in association with the CXCR3 receptor. Statistical Analysis—The Student's two-tailed t test was used to analyze the significance of experimental groups compared with relevant controls. Altered Migration toward CXCR3 Ligands of Gαi2-orGαi3-deficient T Cells—CXCR3 agonists induce chemotactic responses of activated T cells in vitro with a potency of CXCL11 > CXCL10 > CXCL9 in a PTX-sensitive manner (24Colvin R.A.

Luster A.D. Barrett T.A. Fryer J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand whether the varying responses evoked by these agonists resulted from activation of different Gαi proteins, we tested the role of Gαi2 and Gαi3 in the migration of activated T cells toward CXCL9, CXCL10, or CXCL11 (36Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Stimulation of WT T cells with increasing concentration gradients of CXCR3 ligands elicited a weak chemotactic response to CXCL9 (data not shown) but vigorous responses to CXCL10 or CXCL11 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A, B, and E), mirroring previous investigations (37Lu B. Humbles A. Bota D. Gerard C. Moser B. Soler D. Luster A.D. Gerard N.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, migration toward these three individual chemokines was all reduced to control levels in cells lacking Gαi2 over a wide range of agonist concentrations tested (Fig. 1, A, B, and E). The lack of chemotactic responses toward CXCR3 agonists was not due to aberrant cell viability or migration of these cells, because they migrated similarly as WT counterparts in response to CCL19 or CCL21 (data not shown), two ligands for the CCR7 receptor (Fig. 1H). These results indicate that CXCR3-mediated migration depends predominantly on Gαi2, irrespective of the ligands. Unexpectedly, the cell migration toward CXCL9 and CXCL11 was not attenuated but instead drastically increased in the absence compared with presence of Gαi3 (Fig. 1, A and E). The migration toward CXCL10 was also increased, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 1, B and E). However, such increased chemotaxis could not be induced by CCL21 (data not shown) or CCL19 in the cells, regardless of whether or not the cells were activated (Fig. 1, G and H). We also observed no augmented chemotactic response in Gα –/–i3 cells stimulated with CXCL12, a ligand for another Gαi-dependent receptor CXCR4. In fact, CXCL12-provoked chemotaxis was diminished in a lack of either Gαi2 or Gαi3 (Fig. 1F). The inflammatory chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1α were unable to elicit a significant migratory response given our T cell activation conditions (data not shown). Together, these data stress that the increased migration toward CXCR3 agonists in the absence of Gαi3 is receptor-specific. Gαi2 and CXCR3 Expression in T Cells—The opposing responses of Gαi2- and Gαi3-deficient T cells to CXCR3 ligands argue for Gαi3 antagonizing the function of Gαi2. To conclude this, we must rule out that the increased migration toward CXCR3 agonists in Gα –/–i3 cells resulted from increased expression of Gαi2 that could potentially provide a compensatory mechanism to offset the lack of Gαi3 (38Haunerland N.H. Spener F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 328-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A clearly showed that Gαi2 expression was not increased in activated Gα –/–i3 T cells compared with WT T cells (lanes 3 versus 1, lower panel), as was the case for Gαi3 expression in activated Gα –/–i2 T cells (lanes 5 versus 1, lower panel). Neither Gαi2 nor Gαi3 expression was increased in freshly isolated KO T cells compared with WT T cells (Fig. 2A, top panel). We also detected comparable levels of the CXCR3 receptor on these three groups of T cells (Fig. 2B). The expression of other receptors, including CCR7 on stimulated and unstimulated T cells and CXCR4 on resting T cells, was also comparable in these cells, despite some variations (Fig. 2B). To exclude another possibility that the increased chemotactic response was ascribed to coupling of the CXCR3 receptor to other G protein family members in the absence of Gαi3, the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PTX overnight before they were assayed for chemotaxis. The pretreatment ablated CXCR3-mediated chemotactic responses in both WT and Gαi3-deficient T cells (Fig. 1, C and D), confirming involvement of PTX-sensitive Gαi2 protein only in the increased migratory response in the absence of Gαi3. Our investigation thus concludes that Gαi3 participates as an inhibitor in CXCR3-stimulated signaling, and null mutation of Gαi3 directly accounts for the increased migration of Gα –/–i3 T cells toward CXCR3 ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2092770107,"O-Linked N-acetylglucosaminylation termed O-GlcNAc is a dynamic cytosolic and nuclear glycosylation that is dependent both on glucose flow through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and on phosphorylation because of the existence of a balance between phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc. This glycosylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification, which probably plays an important role in many aspects of protein functions. We have previously reported that, in skeletal muscle, proteins of the glycolytic pathway, energetic metabolism, and contractile proteins were O-GlcNAc-modified and that O-Glc-NAc variations could control the muscle protein homeostasis and be implicated in the regulation of muscular atrophy.In this paper, we report O-N-acetylglucosaminylation of a number of key contractile proteins (i.e. myosin heavy and light chains and actin), which suggests that this glycosylation could be involved in skeletal muscle contraction. Moreover, our results showed that incubation of skeletal muscle skinned fibers in N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, in a concentration solution known to inhibit O-GlcNAc-dependent interactions, induced a decrease in calcium sensitivity and affinity of muscular fibers, whereas the cooperativity of the thin filament proteins was not modified. Thus, our results suggest that O-GlcNAc is involved in contractile protein interactions and could thereby modulate muscle contraction.

Because of the existence of the UDP-GlcNAc-peptide-β-GlcNAc transferase, which transfers the monosaccharide into proteins (2Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

The half-life of the monosaccharide is shorter than the half-life of the protein backbone (5Roquemore E.P. Chevrier M.R. Cotter R.J. Hart G.W.

Mounier Y. Michalski J.C. Bastide B. J. Appl. Physiol. 2006; 100: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as well as in the glucose metabolism (33Yki-Järvinen H. Virkamaki A. Daniels M.C. McClain D. Gottschalk W.R. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 449-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the O-GlcNAc modification of myosin heavy chain (MHC) could be its implication in protein-protein interaction, resulting in polymerization of the thick filament, or its involvement in the development of the muscle contraction by interacting with other contractile proteins. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was (i) to define whether other contractile proteins could be O-GlcNAc-modified and (ii) to determine a potential role of O-GlcNAc post-translational modification in skeletal muscle contraction. Biochemicals—Agarose-immobilized wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), GlcNAc-immobilized beads, and all chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma; sequencing grade modified trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI); the mixture of antiproteases was from Amersham Biosciences; Zip-TipC18 pipette tips were from Millipore (Bedford, MA); Vivaspin concentrators were from Vivascience (Hannover, Germany); the nitrocellulose sheet was from Advantec MFS (Pleasanton, CA); and the MicroBCA protein assay reagent kit was from Pierce. Animals and Muscle Preparation—Experiments were carried out on skeletal muscles of adult male Wistar rats. The experiments as well as the maintenance conditions of the animals received authorization from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Education (Veterinary Service of Health and Animal Protection, authorization 03805). Soleus (a typical slow postural muscle), extensor digitorum longus (EDL, a typical fast muscle), and gastrocnemius (a mixed composition of fibers) muscles were freshly removed from male Wistar rats (n = 10) anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (3 mg·kg-1), quickly frozen, and pulverized in liquid nitrogen. All samples were kept at -80 °C until analyzed. Contractile Protein Preparation—Muscle powder was resuspended in a 5 m EDTA solution, pH 7.0, containing antiproteases. Sample was homogenized for 5 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. Pellet was washed twice using a 50 mm KCl solution containing anti-proteases and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. Purification of O-GlcNAc-modified Proteins—The pellet of contractile proteins described above was resuspended in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, antiproteases, pH 7.8), homogenized by ultrasonic waves (Cell Disruptor B-30). Protein quantification was performed using the MicroBCA protein assay. Isolation of O-GlcNAc proteins was obtained by passing contractile proteins through a WGA-immobilized column. For each experiment, 500 μg of contractile proteins were used. The column was washed with 50 column volumes of binding buffer, followed by washing with 10 column volumes of binding buffer containing 0.2 m GalNAc. Elution was finally performed with 20 column volumes of 0.2 m GlcNAc in the same buffer. Fractions were desalted and concentrated using centrifugation on a Vivaspin concentrator. Samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer just prior to their electrophoretic analysis. To determine the glycosylation of the muscle biopsies, a similar protocol was applied using the batch technique. For this, 500 μg of proteins were incubated in the presence of 50 μl of WGA-agarose beads. After 1 h of incubation followed by centrifugation, the supernatant was eliminated, and four washes of beads were realized with the binding buffer. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF analysis was performed according to Ref. 31Cieniewski-Bernard C. Bastide B. Lefebvre T. Lemoine J. Mounier Y. Michalski J.C. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2004; 3: 577-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar. Briefly, SDS-PAGE bands corresponding to proteins purified on WGA affinity chromatography were excised from the gel. Gel pieces were destained using a solution of 30 mm potassium ferricyanide, 100 mm sodium thiosulfate, and washed with water. Proteins were reduced at 56 °C for 30 min with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 and submitted to alkylation in 55 mm iodoacetamide in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 for 30 min. Gel pieces were washed with 0.1 m NH4HCO3 for 15 min and were then dehydrated and shrunk with acetonitrile in a vacuum centrifuge. For “in-gel” digestion, gel pieces were rehydrated in the digestion buffer containing 0.1 m NH4HCO3, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5 ng/μl trypsin at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and the gel pieces were covered with the digestion buffer without trypsin. Digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C. After “in gel” trypsic digestion, peptides were extracted by the addition of 50 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3, gel pieces were shaken for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. Two successive extractions were performed with acetonitrile/HCOOH/water solution (45/10/45, v/v/v) for 20 min. The last extraction was realized with acetonitrile/HCOOH (95/5, v/v) for 20 min with shaking. Extracts were pooled and dried. Samples were desalted using Zip-TipC18 pipette tips, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water prior to the mass spectrometry analysis. Protein identification was carried out using peptide mass fingerprinting on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager DE-STR PRO). Peptide mass fingerprint spectra were recorded in reflectron positive ion mode. On average, 150–200 laser shots were accumulated per spectrum. Each spectrum was internally calibrated using the monoisotopic mass of the fragments resulting from trypsin autoproteolysis at 842.5100, 1045.5642, and 2211.1046 Da, respectively. Proteins were identified with an error tolerance of 50 ppm using the MS-Fit module of the Protein Prospector program (available on the World Wide Web at prospector.ucsf.edu/) from the NCBI and Swiss-Prot data bases. Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Analyses were performed on a Q-Star Pulsar mass spectrometer (hybrid quadrupole liquid chromatography/MS/MS mass spectrometer; PE Sciex Instruments) fitted with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Peptide solution was sprayed from gold-coated “medium-length” borosilicate capillaries (Protana). A potential of -800 V was applied to the capillary tip. The focusing potential was set at -220 V, and the declustering potential varied between -15 and -50 V. For the recording of conventional mass spectra, TOF data were acquired by accumulation of 10 multiple channel acquisition scans over mass ranges of m/z 500–2000. In the collision-induced dissociation MS/MS analyses, multiple charged ions were fragmented using nitrogen as a collision gas (4 × 10-5 torr, 1 torr = 133.3 pascals) with a collision energy between -40 and -55 eV, according to the sample, to obtain optimal fragmentation. The collision-induced dissociation spectra were recorded on the TOF analyzer over a range of m/z 150–2000. All signals were resolved monoisotopically. Confirmation of the Glycosylation Type of Contractile Proteins by Immunoblotting—Contractile proteins (30 μg) of soleus and EDL muscles were separated using a linear SDS-PAGE gradient gel (10–20%) and were electroblotted on nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were saturated for 45 min with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-Tween buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 8.0). RL2 anti-O-GlcNAc monoclonal antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C at a dilution of 1:1000. Three washes of 10 min each were performed with TBS-Tween. Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the detection was carried out using the Western lightning chemiluminescence reagents kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry Analysis— Contractile proteins of soleus and EDL muscles were separated using a linear SDS-PAGE gradient gel (10–20%) and were then transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. We cut off of the membrane individually each protein band corresponding to the different contractile proteins and submitted them to a reductive β-elimination (0.1 n NaOH, 1 m BH4Na) for 18 h at 45 °C. The reaction was stopped on ice by the addition of acetic acid to bring it to pH 5–6. Methylborates were eliminated by co-distillation with methanol followed by evaporation under N2. Dried samples containing alditols were treated with acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 4 h. Peracetylated alditols were then extracted in chloroform. Chloroformic phase was analyzed by gas chromatography on a 30 m × 0.32-mm BPX 70 column, with a cyanopropyl (polysilphenylene-siloxane) stationary phase. A peracetylglucosaminitol standard was analyzed using the same conditions. For gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, the gas chromatography separation was performed on a Carlo Erba GC 8000 gas chromatograph equipped with a 25 m × 0.32-mm CP-Sil5 CB low bleed/MS capillary column and 0.25-μm film phase (Chrompack France, Les Ullis, France). The temperature of the Ross injector was 260 °C, and the samples were analyzed using the following temperature program: 90 °C for 3 min, next 5 °C/min up to 260 °C, followed by a plateau of 20 min at 260 °C. The column was coupled to a Finnigan Automass II mass spectrometer. Analyses were performed in the EI mode (ionization energy 70 eV; source temperature 150 °C) and in the positive CI mode, in the presence of ammonia (ionization energy 150 eV, source temperature 100 °C). A reference standard sample of peracetylated glucosaminitol was used to secure these identifications. Skinning Procedure and Isometric Tension Determination— Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (3 mg·kg-1), and muscles were immediately removed. After removal, the biopsies were immediately chemically skinned by exposure to a skinning solution containing EGTA, 10 mm MOPS, 170 mm potassium propionate, 2.5 mm MgAc, and 5 mm K2 EGTA (34Mounier Y. Holy X. Stevens L. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 415: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This procedure permeabilized the sarcolemmal and transverse tubular membranes and allowed the application of activating solutions of various calcium and strontium concentrations (pCa and pSr, with pCa = -log[Ca2+] and pSr =-log[Sr2+]) directly to the contractile proteins. The skinned biopsies were stored at -20 °C in a 50:50 (v/v) glycerol/skinned solution (storage solution) for up to 2 months. Protease inhibitors, leupeptin and pepstatin, were added to the storage solution (10 μg·ml-1) to prevent loss of contractile proteins and preserve fiber tension (35Reiser P.J. Kasper C.E. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C605-C613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solutions—The composition of all solutions was calculated by the Fabiato computer program (36Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 157: 378-417Crossref Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The program calculation was used with stability constants listed for Ca2+ (37Orentlicher M. Brandt P.W. Reuben J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: C127-C134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for Sr2+ (38Moisescu D.G. Thieleczek R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 546: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to keep a final ionic strength at 200 mm. pH was adjusted to 7.0, and ATP was added to each solution at a final concentration of 2.5 mm. The following solutions were used for the experimental procedure: a washing solution (W) composed of 10 mm MOPS, 185 mm potassium propionate, and 2.5 mm MgAc; a relaxing solution (R) identical to the skinning solution; and pCa-activating solutions consisting of W solution added to various concentrations of free Ca2+ from CaCO3, buffered with EGTA and added in proportions to obtain the different pCa values (7.0 to 4.2). In order to eliminate a hypothetic influence of the sarcoplasmic reticulum on the tension developed by the myofilaments, each fiber was bathed for 20 min at the beginning of an experiment in a Brij solution made up of R solution with 2% Brij 58 (polyoxyethylene 20 cetyl ether). Experimental Protocol—For each experiment, a 5-mm fiber segment was isolated from the skinned biopsy of soleus. A silk thread was tied at each extremity, allowing the mounting of the fiber in an experimental chamber with constant stirring, initially filled with R solution. The fiber was held at one end by small fixed forceps and at the other end by a clamp connected to a strain gauge (force transducer Fort 10 (World Precision Instruments), sensitivity 10 V/g). The resting sarcomere length was measured by means of a helium/neon laser (Spectra Physics) directed perpendicular to the long axis of the fiber. Next, the fiber was stretched to ∼120% of resting length to allow maximal isometric tension development upon ionic activation. The resulting sarcomere length (2.6 ± 0.04 μm) was subsequently regularly controlled and readjusted if necessary. The output of the force transducer was amplified and recorded on a graph recorder (Gould model 6120). Force Measurements and Effects of GlcNAc on Calcium Properties—All experiments were performed in a thermostatically controlled room (20 ± 1 °C). In our study, two experimental protocols were used. In the first protocol, single fibers were bathed for 1 h in the R solution. Next, the same fibers were bathed for 1 h in the R solution containing 0.2 m GlcNAc, 0.2 m GalNAc, or 0.2 m glycerol. The muscular fibers were incubated in a solution of free N-acetyl-d-glucosamine to suppress protein-protein interactions through the O-GlcNAc moiety. It is known that incubation of free GlcNAc allows a rise in protein-protein interaction depending on the O-GlcNAc moiety (39Verbert A. Montreuils J. Bouquelet S. Cacan R. Debray H. Fournet B. Michalski J.C. Spik G. Strecker G. Methods on Glycoconjugates: A Laboratory Manual. Harwood Academic Publishers, Chur, Switzerland1995Google Scholar). The concentration 0.2 m was chosen, since it is the optimal concentration to elute glycoproteins bearing O-GlcNAc by affinity chromatography on immobilized WGA, a lectin that recognizes N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. In the second protocol, single fibers were submitted to two successive baths of 1 h each. One set of experiments corresponded to two baths in 0.2 m glycerol, and another set corresponded to a first bath in 0.2 m GalNAc followed by a second bath in 0.2 m GlcNAc. After preliminary bathings according to the two protocols described above or in the absence of bathing (control experiments), each single fiber was bathed in W solution to eliminate EGTA traces from the previously applied R solution. Next, the fiber was activated at a level P with various pCa solutions (from 7.0 to 4.8, with a step ordinarily equal to 0.2 pCa units). Each steady state submaximal tension P was followed immediately by a maximum contraction Po ensured by pCa 4.2 solution that contained enough calcium to saturate all troponin C sites. The tensions P were expressed as a percentage of the maximal tension Po and reported as tension/pCa (T/pCa) relationships. Finally, the fiber was relaxed in R solution. All solutions contained the tested molecules (i.e. GlcNAc, GalNAc, or glycerol) except for the control experiments. For some experiments, fibers were washed, and a new control T/pCa relationship was performed to determine the reversibility of the effects observed in the presence of GlcNAc. Fibers were rejected if force declined during a sustained contraction or decreased by more than 20% during the whole experiment and if T/pCa were not completely achieved. The T/pCa relationship provided information about the affinity of the contractile apparatus for Ca2+ that was represented by the pCa50 value (50% of maximal Ca2+ tension responses). Two other important parameters could be determined from the T/pCa relationship: the threshold for activation by Ca2+ as an indicator of the calcium sensitivity of the contractile system and the steepness of the T/pCa reflecting the cooperativity between the different regulatory proteins within the thin filament. The steepness of the T/pCa was determined by the Hill coefficients n1 and n2, calculated according to the following equation (40Brandt P.W. Cox R.N. Kawai M. Robinson T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 79: 997-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar): P/Po = (([Ca2+]/K)n/(1 + ([Ca2+]/K)n)), where P/Po is the normalized tension and K is the apparent dissociation constant (pK =-log K = pCa50). n1 corresponds to P/Po > 50%, and n2 corresponds to P/Po < 50%. Curves were fitted with the Hill parameters (n1 for P/Po > 50%, and n2 for P/Po < 50%) according to the relation y = (1/(1 + 10-n × (pCa50 - pCa))) × 100. Electrophoresis—All fibers were dissolved in 20 μl of SDS lysis sample buffer and stored at -20 °C until electrophoretic analysis. The samples were heated at 90 °C for 3 min just prior to the electrophoresis. A 10–20% linear gradient SDS-PAGE was used to obtain a good separation of the contractile proteins. Proteins were silver-stained. Statistical Analysis—All of the data were reported as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of the difference between means was determined using the t test. Differences at or above the 95% confidence level were considered significant. In order to specifically study the O-GlcNAc modification of contractile proteins, we performed an enrichment of contractile proteins from a total extract of skeletal muscles before the purification of O-GlcNAc proteins by affinity chromatography. Skeletal muscle powder was homogenized in a high ionic solution allowing an extraction of contractile proteins (41Toursel T. Bastide B. Stevens L. Rieger F. Mounier Y. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 162: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A pellet of contractile proteins was obtained by this protocol. Electrophoretic analysis of this pellet allowed easy identification of myosin heavy and light chains (essential and regulatory light chain), actin, and tropomyosin isoforms as previously reported (42Stevens L. Sultan K.R. Peuker H. Gohlsch B. Mounier Y. Pette D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1044-C1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kischel P. Bastide B. Stevens L. Mounier Y. J. Appl.

Contractile proteins obtained as described above from soleus (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3) and EDL (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 6) muscles were purified by WGA-immobilized affinity chromatography to retain O-GlcNAc-modified proteins. Fractions corresponding to flow-through (lanes 1 and 4), GalNAc wash (lanes 2 and 5), and GlcNAc elution (lanes 3 and 6) were analyzed on 10–20% SDS-PAGE after silver staining (Fig. 2). The proteins that were retained in the WGA-immobilized affinity chromatography were also present in the flow-through fractions (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 4), indicating that only a fraction of the contractile protein"

However, it remains to be determined how dynein is regulated to accomplish its varied roles. The dynein complex contains six subunits, including three classes of light chains. The two isoforms of the DYNLT (Tctex1) family of light chains, DYNLT1 and DYNLT3, have been proposed to link dynein to specific cargoes. However, no specific binding partner had been found for the DYNLT3 light chain. We find that DYNLT3 binds to Bub3, a spindle checkpoint protein. Bub3 binds exclusively to DYNLT3 and not to the other dynein light chains. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that Bub3 interacts with the cytoplasmic dynein complex. DYNLT3 is present on kinetochores at prometaphase, but not later mitotic stages, demonstrating that this dynein light chain, like Bub3 and other checkpoint proteins, is depleted from the kinetochore during chromosome alignment. Knockdown of DYNLT3 with small interference RNA increases the mitotic index, in particular, the number of cells in prophase/prometaphase. These results demonstrate that dynein binds directly to a component of the spindle checkpoint complex through the DYNLT3 light chain. Thus, DYNLT3 contributes to dynein cargo binding specificity. These data also suggest that the subpopulation of dynein, containing the DYNLT3 light chain, may be important for chromosome congression, in addition to having a role in the transport of checkpoint proteins from the kinetochore to the spindle pole.

Cytoplasmic dynein 1 is a large multisubunit ATPase that moves toward the minus ends of microtubules. It is involved in multiple important cellular processes, including mitosis, nuclear migration, Golgi and centrosome localization, organelle transport, and viral transport (1Vallee R.B. Williams J.C.

This dynein complex has a molecular mass greater than 1 MDa and contains two identical heavy chains, each containing motor domains that generate the force necessary to move along the microtubule (3Koonce M.P.

The cytoplasmic dynein cargo binding domain consists of five subunits that assemble into the complex as dimers: the intermediate chain, light intermediate chain, and three classes of light chains; DYNLL, DYNLT, and DYNLRB. 2The cytoplasmic dynein 1 light chain subunit nomenclature is as follows. There are three functionally distinct light chain families in the cytoplasmic dynein complex and each family has at least two members (or isoforms). The names of the light chains all begin with DYN for dynein, followed by L for light chain, then additional letters that designate the families. The family names are based on the old common name of the first identified member of each family: DYNLT (T for the Tctex1 family); DYNLRB (RB for the Roadblock family); and DYNLL (L for the LC8 family). The different members (or isoforms) of the families are distinguished by adding numbers to the name, for example DYNLT1 and DYNLT3 are the two members of the DYNLT light chain family. In the text, a light chain polypeptide subunit is identified at first mention with its formal name followed by the old common name in parentheses, for example DYNLT3 (previously called rp3). This nomenclature has been endorsed by the Human Genome Organization Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and the International Committee on Standardized Nomenclature for Mice (2Pfister K.K. Fisher E.M.

Thus, a dynein complex contains either DYNLT1 or DYNLT3 but not both.

Although this hypothesis is supported by the report that both DYNLT3 and DYNLT1 bind to the herpes simplex virus 1 caspid protein (16Douglas M.W. Diefenbach R.J. Homa F.L. Miranda-Saksena M.

To gain insight into the cargo binding function of the DYNLT3 light chain, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel DYNLT3 binding proteins. One of the putative DYNLT3 interacting proteins was Bub3, a component of the spindle checkpoint complex (17Sudakin V. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J.

Cell. 1991; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The spindle checkpoint is a signal transduction pathway that blocks mitosis until all kinetochores are attached to spindle microtubules (reviewed in Ref. 19Rieder C.L. Maiato H.

Bub3 is a conserved essential component of the checkpoint, and it is a scaffold that promotes interactions between the other spindle checkpoint proteins, including Bub1, Mad2, Cdc20, and BubR1/Mad3 (17Sudakin V.

These experiments have shown that some of the proteins have important roles early in mitosis, prior to their involvement in the checkpoint complex. For example, when Bub1 is depleted, cells are more likely to have misaligned chromosomes, and this defect has been linked to the role of Bub1 in maintaining centromeric cohesion (33Meraldi P. Sorger P.K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1621-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 34Tang Z. Sun Y. Harley S.E. Zou H. Yu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Williams B. Goldberg M. Sunkel C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein is thought to contribute to the inactivation of the spindle checkpoint by transporting checkpoint proteins from kinetochores to the spindle poles along the newly attached kinetochore microtubules (27Howell B.J.

We find that the cytoplasmic dynein light chain DYNLT3 binds to Bub3 in vivo and in vitro and that Bub3 does not bind to the related light chain DYNLT1 or any other dynein light chains. We further show that GST 4The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GSH, glutathione-Sepharose; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NRK, normal rat kidney cell; HA, hemagglutinin. -Bub3 binds to the dynein complex and that Bub3 and Mad2 co-immunoprecipitate with dynein from mitotic cell extracts. DYNLT3 co-localizes with Bub3 at kinetochores in prometaphase but not at later mitotic stages. siRNA knockdown of the DYNLT3 light chain results in a 3-fold increase in the mitotic index and an increase in the number of cells in prophase/prometaphase. Our data thus strongly support the hypothesis that the two DYNLT light chain family members contribute to the differential regulation of dynein cargo binding and that the interaction of Bub3 and DYNLT3 links a checkpoint protein complex to a subpopulation of dynein. Plasmids—pBluescript-SK-DYNLT3 encoding mouse DYNLT3 (Open Biosystem) served as a template for the PCR amplification. To minimize auto-activation by DYNLT3 in yeast two-hybrid assays (16Douglas M.W. Diefenbach R.J. Homa F.L. Miranda-Saksena M. Rixon F.J. Vittone V. Byth K. Cunningham A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28522-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar),3 a flexible linker, -Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-, was inserted in front of the open reading frame of DYNLT3 by PCR, and the product was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech). For expression of the rat DYNLT1, DYNLT3, DYNLL1 (previously called LC8a), DYNLL2 (previously called LC8b), DYNLRB1 (previously called Roadblock1), and DYNLRB2 (previously called Road-block2) light chains in cultured mammalian cells, their entire coding regions were individually cloned into the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech). Human DYNLT3-GFP was made by subcloning the DNA fragment into pEGFP vector (Clontech). An His6 N-terminal tag was added to human DYNLT3 by cloning it into pET-14b (Novagen Inc.). The entire coding region for human Bub3 was PCR-amplified using Bub3-p3×FLAG-CMV (the gift of Dr. Tim Yen, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) as a template. The PCR product was cloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of GST pGEX4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse Bub3 N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–166) isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen was excised from NotI sites of the Gal4 activation domain vector, pVP16, and subcloned into the GST fusion vector, pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), GST-Bub3NT. All constructs were sequenced to confirm gene sequence and correct reading frame. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—DYNLT3 in pGBKT7 vector was used to screen ∼1 × 106 clones from a mouse embryonic cDNA library constructed in pVP16 vector (35Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) (the gift of Dr. Ian Macara, University of Virginia). The yeast strain (AH109) used for the screening assay contained both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under control of a Gal4-responsive upstream activation site. Bait and library vectors were co-transformed into AH109 and positive interactions initially identified by growth of cells on media lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (referred to as -His) with 5 mm 3-AT, an inhibitor of histidine synthase, at 30 °C for 3–4 days. Positive colonies obtained from the screen were confirmed by β-galactosidase activity assay. To minimize the number of false positives and to increase the likelihood of obtaining pure clones, the initial isolates were grown in -His media with 30 mm 3-AT. Inserts from individual positive clones were isolated by direct PCR screening using flanking primers specific for the pVP16 plasmid. All of the PCR products were sequenced, and potential DYNLT3-interacting clones were identified using NCBI Blast. The colony inhibition assay using 3-AT described previously (36Aguilar R.C. Ohno H. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27160-27166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used to confirm the specificity of the putative interactions. Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—Bacterial expression of GST-recombinant proteins was carried out using Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as host cells. To minimize the formation of inclusion bodies, protein expression continued for 10–12 h at 18 °C before harvesting by centrifugation. After lysis, soluble proteins were purified by using a glutathione-Sepharose (GSH) affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified GST fusion proteins were kept on beads in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), including protease inhibitors (described below) and were directly used for binding assay experiments. GST fusion protein concentrations were estimated by comparing the intensity of the GST fusion protein to a series of different concentration bovine serum albumin protein standards. Expression of the His-tagged DYNLT3 in bacteria was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). GST Pull-down Experiments—The GST pull-down assays between GST-Bub3 and overexpressed light chains were performed and described previously (37Lo K.W. Kan H.M. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9552-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Lo K.W. Pfister K.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 392: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, at least 10 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins prebound to GSH beads were incubated with 100–120 mg of the cell lysates in appropriate binding buffers. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the pelleted beads were washed extensively with the binding buffers and subsequently boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were first resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Buffer A (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin) was used to characterize the interaction between GST fusion proteins and the overexpressed light chains. Buffer B (50 mm PIPES, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 3 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin) was used to characterize the interaction between GST fusion proteins and endogenous dynein subunits. For the direct in vitro binding assay, 10 μg of GST or GST-tagged proteins prebound to GSH beads were incubated with 1 ml of bacterial lysates containing His-DYNLT3 in the buffer A. After incubation at 4 °C for overnight, the beads were extensively washed with the buffer A, and the bound proteins were subsequently released by boiling with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The released proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected on Western blots. PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (37Lo K.W. Kan H.M. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9552-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Lo K.W. Pfister K.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 392: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 (monkey kidney) and NRK (normal rat kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% calf serum (HyClone). LLCPK (porcine kidney epithelial) cells were cultured in F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection, cells were transfected with the FuGENE 6 transfection kit (Roche Applied Science) or the nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems), following the manufacturers' instructions. Transfected cells were allowed to grow for 24–36 h. Transfections were performed at 80% confluence. Immunoprecipitation—A mitotic NRK cell lysate was prepared by the method of Nakagawa (39Nakagawa J. Kitten G.T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 449-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 2 mm thymidine for 10–12 h to arrest the cells in S phase. The cells were then arrested in mitosis by incubating with (1.7 μm) nocodazole for another 12 h. The mitotic cells were harvested by a “shake-off” procedure. The cells were washed and then lysed in Buffer B by repeated passages through a needle. The mitotic extract was recovered by ultracentrifugation of the lysed cells. To obtain an interphase extract, unsynchronized NRK cells were harvested by scraping. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and then used for immunoprecipitation with antibodies, as indicated, and protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After extensively washing the beads with Buffer B, the precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. siRNA—DYNLT3 siRNA mixture containing (5′-GCAAGCAUCGUUGAACAAUCUAUAG-3′,5′-CUAUAGAUUGUUCAACGAUGCUUGC-3′,5′-GGCUUCAAUGCUGAGGAAGCACAUA-3′, 5′-GGCUAACGUCGAGGAACGACUUAUA-3′, and 5′-UAUGUGCUUCCUCAGCAUUGAAGCC-3′) and control siRNA (5′-UAUAAGUCGUUCCUCGACGUUAGCC-3′) were synthesized by Invitrogen. siRNA transfections were carried out in 2 × 106 NRK cells using the nucleofector according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells, in the solution V, were co-transfected with 3 μg of DYNLT3 siRNA or control siRNA and 0.5 μg of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to ensure that cells expressing GFP were co-transfected with siRNA. Cells were allowed to recover for 48 h before subsequent manipulations.

LLCPK cells were grown on coverslips, transfected with DYNLT3 fusion proteins and processed for immunocytochemistry (44Topper L.M. Bastians H. Ruderman J.V. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells extracted with 1% TX-100 in PHEM (50 mm PIPES, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) for 1 min, and immediately transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde in PHEM for 20 min. Cells were then rinsed in PBS and blocked with normal goat serum and fish scale gelatin in Tris-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted in normal goat serum for 1 h. For secondary fluorescence staining, anti-rabbit, -human, and -mouse Cy3 or fluorescein isothiocyanate antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used. Coverslips were incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.1 μg/ml) for 30 s and mounted using Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). For prometaphase kinetochore staining, cells were also preincubated with 0.17 μm nocodazole for 20 min prior to processing. Images of cells were acquired with a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a CoolSnapES charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics) controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). MetaMorph and Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems) were used to process all images. Cytoplasmic Dynein Light Chain, DYNLT3, Interacts with the Spindle Checkpoint Protein, Bub3—In preliminary experiments using DYNLT3 in pairwise yeast two-hybrid assays it was found that DYNLT3 fused to the DNA binding domain was a strong auto-activator of histidine synthase (16Douglas M.W. Diefenbach R.J. Homa F.L. Miranda-Saksena M. Rixon F.J. Vittone V. Byth K. Cunningham A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28522-28530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).3 Therefore, to use a yeast two-hybrid library screen to identify DYNLT3 binding partners, it was first necessary to engineer a construct that minimized the auto-activation. We found that adding a flexible linker -Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-between the DNA binding domain and DYNLT3 reduced the auto-activation to very low levels (data not shown). The screening of a mouse embryonic library resulted in the isolation of 99 independent clones. 51 clones from the primary isolate were identified as strong interactors with the β-galactosidase activity assay. Of these, 27 were able to grow in -His medium with high concentration of 3-AT (30 mm). Sequence analysis of these 27 clones indicated that 9 were membrane associated proteins, 6 were novel proteins, and 11 were enzymes/structural proteins. DYNLT3 was also identified in the screen consistent with the finding that it forms homodimers (10Chuang J.Z. Milner T.A. Sung C.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5501-5512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One candidate DYNLT3 binding partner identified in the yeast two-hybrid library screen was the N-terminal portion of mouse Bub3 (amino acids 1–166). The strong specificity of the interaction of the two proteins was confirmed by using the full-length human Bub3 in a pair-wise yeast two-hybrid screen with DYNLT3 (Fig. 1A) in a colony inhibition assay (36Aguilar R.C. Ohno H. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27160-27166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The specificity was further confirmed by assaying for the independent expression of β-galactosidase in the transformants (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate that the interaction between Bub3 and DYNLT3 observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay was not mediated by a third yeast protein, the ability of bacterially expressed DYNLT3 and Bub3 to interact was examined. GST-Bub3 was purified from a bacterial expression system and mixed in vitro with His-tagged DYNLT3 also from a bacterial expression system. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, the His-DYNLT3 binds to and co-pellets with GST-Bub3 demonstrating that the purified proteins interact directly. We next sought to determine if Bub3 interacted with the other DYNLT family member, DYNLT1. DYNLT1 and DYNLT3 were tagged with the Myc epitope and individually expressed in COS7 cells. The cells were lysed and incubated with GST-Bub3 bound to GSH beads in a pull-down assay. The data presented in Fig. 2 show that Bub3 bound exclusively to DYNLT3. The same approach was used to show that Bub3 does not interact with any of the other dynein light chains, further demonstrating the specificity of the interaction between DYNLT3 and Bub3 (Fig. 2). Bub3 and Mad2 Bind to the Cytoplasmic Dynein Complex—To demonstrate that the DYNLT3 light chain is a link between Bub3 and the dynein complex, we employed two approaches. GST-Bub3 and GST were incubated with lysates from mitotic normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, and the bound prot"
https://openalex.org/W2112161053,"L-type calcium channels are composed of a pore, alpha1c (Ca(V)1.2), and accessory beta- and alpha2delta-subunits. The beta-subunit core structure was recently resolved at high resolution, providing important information on many functional aspects of channel modulation. In this study we reveal differential novel effects of five beta2-subunits isoforms expressed in human heart (beta(2a-e)) on the single L-type calcium channel current. These splice variants differ only by amino-terminal length and amino acid composition. Single-channel modulation by beta2-subunit isoforms was investigated in HEK293 cells expressing the recombinant L-type ion conducting pore. All beta2-subunits increased open probability, availability, and peak current with a highly consistent rank order (beta2a approximately = beta2b > beta2e approximately = beta2c > beta2d). We show graded modulation of some transition rates within and between deep-closed and inactivated states. The extent of modulation correlates strongly with the length of amino-terminal domains. Two mutant beta2-subunits that imitate the natural span related to length confirm this conclusion. The data show that the length of amino termini is a relevant physiological mechanism for channel closure and inactivation, and that natural alternative splicing exploits this principle for modulation of the gating properties of calcium channels."

Homotrimeric HSF binds to heat shock elements (HSEs) consisting of three inverted repeats of the sequence nGAAn. Sequences consisting of four or more nGAAn units are bound cooperatively by two HSF trimers. We show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells oligomerization-defective Hsf1 is not able to bind HSEs with three units and is not extensively phosphorylated in response to stress; it is therefore unable to activate genes containing this type of HSE. Several lines of evidence indicate that oligomerization is a prerequisite for stress-induced hyperphosphorylation of Hsf1. In contrast, oligomerization and hyperphosphorylation are not necessary for gene activation via HSEs with four units. Intragenic suppressor screening of oligomerization-defective hsf1 showed that an interface between adjacent DNA-binding domains is important for the binding of Hsf1 to the HSE. We suggest that Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSEs with different structures are regulated differently; HSEs with three units require Hsf1 to be both oligomerized and hyperphosphorylated, whereas HSEs with four or more units do not require either.

Oligomer formation increases the selectivity of protein-DNA interactions by causing the proteins to bind the more complex sequence consisting of the short units recognized by each DBD. The ability of these transcription factors to activate transcription is also regulated by protein-protein interactions among the monomers (1Kadonaga J.T.

A helix-turn-helix DBD and two hydrophobic repeat regions, HR-A and HR-B, are HSF motifs that are conserved from yeast to humans. The DBD recognizes a 5-bp sequence, 5′-nGAAn-3′, and HR-A/B mediates interactions between three monomers to form a trimer via a triple-stranded coiled-coil.

The target genes of Hsf1 contain the “perfect type” HSE, which consists of three contiguous inverted repeats of the nGAAn unit (3P type, nTTCnnGAAnnTTCn), as well as an HSE containing one (gap type, nTTCnnGAAn(5 bp)nGAAn) or two (step type, nGAAn(5 bp)nGAAn(5 bp)nGAAn) gaps between the repeating units (8Yamamoto A.

The three nGAAn units of these HSEs are bound by a single Hsf1 trimer, whereas HSEs consisting of four or five contiguous units (4P or 5P type) are bound by two Hsf1 trimers in a cooperative manner (12Bonner J.J.

In the present study, we examined the functional domains of yeast Hsf1 by analyzing the ability of Hsf1 derivatives lacking various regions to activate transcription. The oligomerization function of the HR-A/B region was found to be required for heat- or ethanol-induced transcription of genes containing HSEs with three, but not four, nGAAn units. Oligomerization-defective Hsf1 inhibited activation of the genes at two steps, HSE binding and stress-induced hyperphosphorylation. Analysis of extragenic multicopy suppressor genes showed a connection between oligomerization and hyperphosphorylation, and analysis of intragenic suppressor mutations showed that DBD-DBD interactions were important for HSE binding. These observations suggest that the number of nGAAn units is a critical determinant of the regulatory pathway used by Hsf1. Plasmids and Yeast Strains—The wild type HSF1 gene was cloned into a yeast centromeric plasmid containing a TRP1 marker (YCp-TRP1) (19Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Sakurai H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The detailed structures of the hsf1 derivatives are shown in Figs. 1A,2A, and 3A. Nucleotide substitution mutations were introduced into YCp-TRP1-HSF1 by site-directed mutagenesis (13Hashikawa N. Mizukami Y. Imazu H. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3936-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In YCp-TRP1-hsf1-gcn4, the HR-A/B region was substituted with the dimerization domain of Gcn4 (amino acids 250–279) (38O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 39Drees B.L. Grotkop E.K. Nelson H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For protein cross-linking analysis, HSF1 was subcloned into a multicopy plasmid (YEp-TRP1). For chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, three copies of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sequence were added upstream of the HSF1 translation initiation site. The HSF1 promoter-HA3-HSF1 construct was cloned into an integration plasmid containing a LEU2 marker (YIp-LEU2). These plasmids were introduced into yeast strain HS126 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 hsf1::HIS3 YCp-URA3-HSF1), and hsf1 mutant cells were constructed by plasmid shuffling (19Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A multicopy plasmid bearing WSC1 and a centromeric plasmid bearing MKK1S386P were previously described (20Imazu H. Sakurai H. Eukaryot.

Cells were grown in YPD medium consisting of 1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose.FIGURE 2Characterization of hsf1 cells containing mutations in HR-A/B. A, amino acid sequence of HR-A/B (amino acids 333–425). The hydrophobic repeats consist of a characteristic seven-residue repeat, a-b-c-d-e-f-g, with hydrophobic residues at positions a and d. Helix B contains additional hydrophobic residues at positions e and g. Hsf1-Am contains L351P, I354K, and Q358P substitutions, and Hsf1-Bm contains L393P, F397P, and L400K substitutions.

For lanes 1–8, cells containing YEp-TRP1-HSF1 were grown at 28 (lanes 1–4) or 39 °C for 15 min (lanes 5–8), and extracts were incubated without (lanes 1 and 5) or with 1.0 (lanes 2 and 6), 2.0 (lanes 3 and 7), or 4.0 (lanes 4 and 8) mm EGS. For lanes 9–14, cells containing YEp-TRP1-hsf1-A/BΔ, YEp-TRP1-hsf1-Am, or YEp-TRP1-hsf1-Bm were grown at 28 °C, and extracts were incubated without (lanes 9, 11, and 13) or with (lanes 10, 12, and 14) 4.0 mm EGS. Samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Hsf1 serum as a probe. The positions of molecular mass markers are shown to the left in kilodaltons. Ovals between the panels indicate positions of the Hsf1 monomers, dimers, and trimers. D, mRNA levels in hsf1 cells under stress conditions. Wild type HSF1 and hsf1 mutant cells were grown at 28 °C in the absence (C, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10) or presence of 8% ethanol for 30 min (Et, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) or were grown at 39 °C for 15 min (HS, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). Total RNA was prepared from the cells and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. E, mRNA levels of HSE-CYC1-lacZ reporters in hsf1-A/BΔ cells. Wild type HSF1 and hsf1-A/BΔ cells carrying the indicated HSE-CYC1-lacZ reporters were grown at 28 °C in the absence (control) or presence of 8% ethanol for 30 min (Ethanol) or were grown at 39 °C for 15 min (Heat Shock). The lacZ mRNA levels were normalized to control ACT1 mRNA as 100% and expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Substitution of the trimerization domain with a dimerization domain.

Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, random nucleotide alterations were introduced into the region encoding amino acids 67–481 of hsf1-A/Bm by error-prone PCR, and the mutated genes were cloned into a YCp-TRP1 vector. The mutant library was used to transform strain HS133 (MATα ade2 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3 can1 hsf1::HIS3 YCp-URA3-hsf1-AR1Δ-ba1 LEU2::SSA4-lacZ), which exhibits a temperature-sensitive growth defect (19Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown at 37 °C. One hsf1-A/Bm suppressor allele contained substitutions of valine to alanine at amino acid 203 (V203A) and lysine to arginine at amino acid 440 (K440R); the V203A substitution was responsible for the suppression (data not shown). RNA Analysis—Cells grown at 28 °C were treated with 8% ethanol for 30 min or were heat-shocked at 39 °C for 15 min. Total RNA was prepared from the cells and analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, as described previously (13Hashikawa N. Mizukami Y. Imazu H. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3936-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. Hsf1 Protein Analysis—For analysis of the phosphorylated form of Hsf1, cells were disrupted by vortexing with glass beads in SDS sample buffer, and extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-Hsf1 serum (19Hashikawa N. Sakurai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3648-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For protein cross-linking analysis, cells containing the multicopy plasmid of HSF1 were grown at 28 °C to an optical density of 1.5 at 600 nm. Cells were disrupted as above in a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Ten microliters of cleared extract (80 μg of protein) was mixed with 1 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide containing varying concentrations of ethylene glycol bis-(succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine to 75 mm. Samples were then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Hsf1 serum. All experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Cells containing the integration plasmid of HA-HSF1 were grown to an optical density of 2.0 at 600 nm and treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was carried out as described (41Sakurai H. Hashikawa N. Imazu H. Fukasawa T. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), using an anti-HA antibody (Invitrogen). DNA was prepared from immunoprecipitates and input chromatin samples (1% of each chromatin sample used for immunoprecipitation) and was subjected to PCR. The PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and quantified by GelPro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics). All experiments were performed at least three times with similar results. The following regions relative to the translation initiation site were amplified by PCR: –334 to +26 of HSP78, –386 to –93 of BTN2, –485 to –133 of HSP10, –449 to –8 of CPR6, –230 to +18 of CUP1, –417 to –165 of HSC82, –339 to +46 of SSA3, and –211 to +83 of GAL7. HR-A/B of Hsf1 Affects the Heat Shock Response of Target Genes—The DBD and the N-terminal linker segment are essential for Hsf1 to function to support cell viability (42Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 43Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 44Flick K.E. Gonzalez Jr., L. Harrison C.J. Nelson H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether other regions affect the activator function of Hsf1, we constructed cells expressing deletion derivatives of Hsf1 (Fig. 1A). In HSF1 wild type cells, a temperature shift from 28 to 39 °C caused accumulation of transcripts from the Hsf1 target genes HSP78, HSP10, CUP1, and SSA3, as determined with an RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1B). Deletion of various regions did not significantly affect the heat-induced mRNA levels of HSP78, which contains the 4Ptt-type HSE that consists of four continuous inverted repeats of the nGAAn unit in a tail-to-tail orientation (nTTCnnGAAnnTTCnnGAAn) (13Hashikawa N. Mizukami Y. Imazu H. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3936-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of other genes containing HSEs of the 3P type (three continuous units, HSP10), gap type (CUP1), and step type (SSA3) increased by almost normal amounts in cells expressing most of the Hsf1 derivatives but not in those with the Hsf1-A/BΔ and Hsf1-CTMΔ constructs. This is in agreement with our previous observation that the CTM is necessary for the heat shock response via the HSEs consisting of three nGAAn units, but not four or more units (13Hashikawa N. Mizukami Y. Imazu H. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3936-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and indicates that although some Hsf1 domains are not essential for the activator function, the HR-A/B and CTM are necessary for gene-specific transcription. Trimerization of Hsf1 Is Necessary for a Subset of Target Genes to Respond to Stress—The HR-A/B region of Hsf1 consists of two α-helical coiled-coils, A and B, (Fig. 2A) and has a role in homotrimer formation (16Sorger P.K. Nelson H.C. Cell. 1989; 59: 807-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 45Peteranderl R. Nelson H.C.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3559-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results (42Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 44Flick K.E. Gonzalez Jr., L. Harrison C.J. Nelson H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hsf1-A/BΔ cells exhibited a growth defect at elevated, but not normal, temperatures (Fig. 2B). We analyzed trimer formation of Hsf1 and Hsf1-A/BΔ proteins by treating cell extracts with the chemical cross-linker EGS and immunoblotting with anti-Hsf1 serum. In the absence of EGS, wild type Hsf1 protein was detected as a band on the gel with a relative molecular mass of 130 kDa (Fig. 2C, lane 1). The predominant bands that emerged by treatment with 2.0 and 4.0 mm EGS were homodimers and homotrimers of Hsf1, respectively, as judged by their mobilities (lanes 3 and 4). Heat shock of the cell culture from 28 to 39 °C had no substantial effect on oligomer formation (lanes 5–8). Hsf1-A/BΔ was unable to trimerize, as shown by the absence of the slowly migrating proteins in the EGS-treated extract (lane 10). The hydrophobic amino acids in coiled-coil sequences are involved in the protein-protein interactions between monomers (47Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). To test the need for HR-A/B for Hsf1 function, we changed three hydrophobic residues in each helix to a helix-destabilizing residue (proline) or a hydrophilic residue (lysine) to create Hsf1-Am and Hsf1-Bm (Fig. 2A). Neither protein was able to support cell growth at 38 °C (Fig. 2B) or form homotrimers (Fig. 2C, lanes 11–14). In hsf1-A/BΔ, hsf1-Am, and hsf1-Bm cells, genes containing the 4Ptt-type HSE (BTN2, HSP42, and HSP78) were activated by heat shock (Fig. 2D, lanes 5, 8, and 11). In contrast, these mutations abolished the activation of genes that contained the 3P-type (APA1 and HSP10), gap-type (CPR6 and CUP1), or step-type (FSH1 and SSA3) HSEs. Treatment of the cells with ethanol caused an increase of mRNAs from various Hsf1 target genes in a DNA microarray analysis (48Alexandre H. Ansanay-Galeote V. Dequin S. Blondin B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and Hsf1 is directly involved in the ethanol response of ERO1 (which encodes endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin) (49Takemori Y. Sakaguchi A. Matsuda S. Mizukami Y. Sakurai H. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2005; 275: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Many Hsf1 targets were activated by the addition of 8% ethanol to the HSF1 cell culture (Fig. 2D, lane 3). It is not clear why transcription of HSP10, CPR6, and SSA3 was not strongly induced by ethanol treatment. Similar to their heat shock response, Hsf1-A/BΔ, Hsf1-Am, and Hsf1-Bm failed to mediate the ethanol stress signal to genes containing the 3P-, gap-, and step-type HSEs, but not the 4Ptt-type HSE (Fig. 2D, lanes 6, 9, and 12). Transcription of several Hsf1 target genes is also regulated by other stress-responsive transcription factors, including Msn2 and Msn4 (50Trott A. Morano K.A. Hohmann S. Mager P.W.H. Topics in Current Genetics. Vol. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 71-119Google Scholar). To verify the role of trimerization on HSE-specific activation by Hsf1, we constructed reporter genes containing various HSEs placed upstream of the CYC1 promoter-lacZ fusion (HSE-CYC1-lacZ) (13Hashikawa N. Mizukami Y. Imazu H. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3936-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In HSF1 cells, insertion of the 4Ptt-, 3P-, gap-, and step-type HSEs increased the mRNA levels from the reporter genes under heat or ethanol stress conditions (Fig. 2E). In hsf1-A/BΔ cells, transcription of HSE4Ptt-CYC1-lacZ was activated in response to stress; however, reporter genes containing the 3P-, gap-, and step-type HSEs were completely inactive. These results show that trimerization is required for stress-induced transcription via HSEs containing three nGAAn units. Note that under normal conditions, the HSE4Ptt-CYC1-lacZ mRNA was elevated in hsf1-A/BΔ cells compared with HSF1 cells. The constitutive transcription of HSP42, HSP78, and BTN2 was slightly increased in trimerization-defective mutants (see supplemental data). It has been shown by Nieto-Sotelo et al. (43Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) that the HR-A/B region is involved in repression of Hsf1 at non-shock temperatures. Dimerization Domain of Gcn4 Substitutes for the Trimerization Domain of Hsf1—To analyze the relationship between the trimerization defect and phenotypic changes, the HR-A/B region of Hsf1 was replaced with the dimerization domain of the transcriptional activator Gcn4 (Fig. 3A) (38O'Shea E.K.

Cells expressing Hsf1-gcn4 recovered almost normal growth at 38 °C although the protein predominantly formed dimers in the cross-linking assay (Fig. 3, B and C). In hsf1-gcn4 cells, all of the genes analyzed were normally activated by heat or ethanol treatment (Fig. 3D, lanes 4–6). The dimerization domain of Gcn4 was functionally indistinguishable from the authentic trimerization domain of Hsf1, suggesting that oligomerization rather than some unknown HR-A/B function is required for gene activation. However, the possibility remains that in yeast cells Hsf1-gcn4 forms a homotrimer when it binds to the HSE, because a recombinant polypeptide of the Hsf1 DBD-Gcn4 dimerization domain fusion forms a dimer in solution but forms a trimer in the presence of the HSE (39Drees B.L.

Oligomerization Is Necessary for Stress-induced Hyperphosphorylation of Hsf1—Similar to the hsf1 mutations that are defective in oligomerization, the hsf1-CTMΔ and hsf1-ba1 mutations of the CTM inhibited transcriptional activation via HSEs containing three nGAAn units (see Fig. 1B and Fig. 3D, lanes 7–9) (13Hashikawa N.

https://openalex.org/W2049027585,"The nonhomologous end joining pathway for DNA double strand break repair requires Ku to bind DNA ends and subsequently recruit other nonhomologous end joining factors, including the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex, to the break site. Ku loads at a break by threading the DNA ends through a circular channel in its structure. This binding mechanism explains both the high specificity of Ku for ends and its ability to translocate along DNA once loaded. However, DNA in cells is typically coated with other proteins (e.g. histones), which might be expected to block the ability of Ku to load in this manner. Here we address how the nature of a protein obstruction dictates how Ku interacts with a DNA end. Ku is unable to access the ends within an important intermediate in V(D)J recombination (a complex of RAG proteins bound to cleaved recombination targeting signals), but Ku readily displaces the linker histone, H1, from DNA. Ku also retains physiological affinity for nucleosome-associated ends. Loading onto nucleosome-associated ends still occurs by threading the end through its channel, but rather than displacing the nucleosome, Ku peels as much as 50 bp of DNA away from the histone octamer surface. We suggest a model where Ku utilizes an unusual characteristic of its three-dimensional structure to recognize certain protein-occluded ends without the extensive remodeling of chromatin structure required by other DNA repair pathways.

Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). This manner of binding makes Ku highly specific for DNA ends but requires that the ends must be accessible through 360°. In cells, DNA is generally coated with proteins (e.g. histones and other chromatin-associated proteins) that might be expected to block the ability of Ku to load on DNA ends and thus impair NHEJ. Here we have shown that Ku displays a variety of responses to protein obstructions at DNA ends. Ku is unable to bind a class of RAG (recombination activating gene) protein-bound DNA ends generated during V(D)J recombination. In contrast, Ku can displace certain proteins (e.g. histone H1) from DNA and retains the ability to load on nucleosome-associated ends by peeling up to 50 bp of DNA away from the nucleosome surface. We therefore suggest Ku may be specifically suited to loading on protein-obstructed DNA ends, ultimately facilitating the recruitment of the NHEJ machinery without requiring extensive remodeling of chromatin structure at broken ends. Purified Proteins—Bulk histones were purified from 5 liters of HeLa cells as described previously (17Schnitzler G. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Briefly, a nuclear pellet was isolated and homogenized, and genomic DNA was sheared by sonication. The clarified supernatant was then applied to a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated in 0.6 m NaCl. The column was washed extensively with the equilibration buffer to deplete linker histones and non-histone proteins, and fractions primarily containing core histones were eluted with 2 m NaCl. This eluent was then applied to a S200 gel filtration column equilibrated in 2 m NaCl to further deplete linker histones and ensure the proper stoichiometry of the core histone octamer. Histone H1 was a gift from Dr. Yi Zhang. Recombinant core RAG1 and RAG2 maltose-binding protein fusions and recombinant Ku were obtained as previously described in Refs. 18McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C.

Antibody supershifts required an additional 10-min room temperature incubation step with either 0.2 μg of the monoclonal antibody to Ku or 1 μl of a polyclonal antisera recognizing the maltose binding domain fused to recombinant RAG proteins.

A, the footprinting substrate consists of a 187-bp DNA fragment where the previously described positioning sequence locates the nucleosome at one end, leaving a 40-bp linker of naked DNA whose end is fluorescently labeled and blocked by a biotin-streptavidin complex. PstI digestion produces a 40-bp fragment that marks the boundary between the nucleosome and naked DNA (panel B, lane M). B and C, 80 nm singly (lanes 1-3) or doubly (lane 4) blocked nucleosomes were incubated with 0 nm (lane 1), 120 nm (lane 2), or 240 nm Ku (lanes 3-4) at 25 °C for 10 min followed by a 5-min 37 °C incubation.

Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), nucleosomes were reconstituted on positioning sequences by salt dialysis using a DNA to histone ratio determined empirically for each DNA preparation such that reconstitutions contained less than 5% free DNA. The quality of reconstitutions was monitored by EMSA. Nucleosomes used for footprinting were also purified by preparative electrophoresis using a Mini-prep cell (Bio-Rad) (22Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 23-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Native mononucleosomes were obtained by resuspending HeLa nuclei in 10 ml of micrococcal nuclease digestion buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and digestion with 0.02 units/μl of micrococcal nuclease (USB) at 37 °C for 8 min (17Schnitzler G. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 21.5-1-215-12Google Scholar). After addition of NaCl to 0.6 m, the suspension was dounced to extract soluble chromatin and subsequently pelleted. The resulting supernatant was separated on a 5-30% sucrose gradient. As mononucleosomes derived from this digestion are rich in linker histones (17Schnitzler G. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 21.5-1-215-12Google Scholar), we excluded mononucleosome-containing fractions and further digested pooled oligonucleosome-containing fractions with 1.5 units/μl micrococcal nuclease at 0 °C for 40 min to generate core mononucleosomes. Mononucleosomes were further purified on a second sucrose gradient. EMSA—DNA-protein complexes were assembled prior to EMSA by incubation of the DNA and proteins in a standard reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 145 mm NaCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA), except for experiments using the signal end complex (SEC), which used the following buffer: 25 mm MOPS, pH 7, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.125 ng/μl of supercoiled DNA plasmid. The resulting complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 300 V for 1 h through a 16-cm, 1/3× Tris borate-EDTA, 3.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. EMSAs containing antibody supershifts used the following antibodies: α-Ku (Ab-3; Neomarkers), α-MBP (New England Biolabs), and α-histone H1 (clone B419; Biomeda) purified by batch adsorption with hydroxyapatite beads. In Fig. 4, the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated from quantified (using ImageQuant; GE Healthcare) EMSA experiments according to the equation, Kd = [Kufree]*[DNAfree]/[Ku:DNA]. When 50% of the substrate is bound, [Ku:DNA] = [DNAfree], thus Kd = [Kufree]. Because the total amount of Ku was kept in large excess over total DNA (>40-fold for experiments in Fig. 4) and [Kufree] = [Kutotal] - [Ku:DNA], [Kufree] was further approximated as [Kutotal] (also see Ref. 23Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction-shifted species (determined from EMSAs) was plotted against the log of Ku's concentration. The resulting binding curves were best fit with a sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) regression line (GraphPad Prism version 4.03 (Trial) for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego CA) to determine apparent Kds and associated error. Analysis of the Protein Composition of Ku-Nucleosome Complexes—Large-scale 50-μl EMSA reactions were generated by incubating 80 nm nucleosome or free DNA with either 60, 120, or 240 nm Ku in our standard EMSA buffer at 25 °C for 10 min. Reactions were then incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before separating the formed complexes as described above. Ku-nucleosome and Ku-DNA complexes were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and subsequently excised. Complexes were then electro-eluted from the gel and their protein components concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The relative amounts of Ku and histone H3 in each of the excised complexes were determined by semiquantitative Western analysis probing with a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against native, recombinant human Ku and a polyclonal antibody against histone H3 (Ab1791; Abcam) using fluorescent detection and a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare). Western blots were quantified using ImageQuantTL (GE Healthcare), and the ratio of Ku70 (Ku80 is overexposed) to H3 was determined for nucleosome-containing complexes (Fig. 5B, species IV, V, and VI). Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting—Footprinting experiments utilize an asymmetrically positioned nucleosome substrate containing a single 40-bp linker DNA (24Schwanbeck R. Xiao H. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39933-39941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The DNA end of this linker was labeled with a bodipy 630 fluorophore (Integrated DNA Technologies) and blocked with a biotin-streptavidin complex (Fig. 6A). Footprinting reactions were conducted in 15 μl of 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA by incubating 80 nm nucleosome with 120 or 240 nm Ku at 25 °C for 10 min. Reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before being placed on ice. Nucleosomes were twice treated at 4 °C with 3.5 μl of 3% hydrogen peroxide, 3.5 μl of a 2-mm ammonium iron(II) sulfate and 4 mm EDTA mixture, and 3.5 μl of 20 mm sodium ascorbate at 5-min intervals before reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl of 400 mm thiourea (24Schwanbeck R. Xiao H. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39933-39941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Reactions were acidified by addition of 5 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, and nicked DNA was purified through a minElute reaction clean-up column (Qiagen). Eluted DNA was electrophoresed on an 8% urea-PAGE sequencing gel at 1800 V and 40 watts for either 1.5 (Fig. 6B) or 4 h (Fig. 6C). Protein Modeling—The SPOCK modeling program (25Christopher J.A. SPOCK: The Structural Properties Observation and Calculation Kit (Program Manual). The Center for Macromolecular Design, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX2004Google Scholar) was used to dock the crystal structures of the core nucleosome (Protein Data Bank accession 1AOI) and Ku bound to DNA (accession 1JEY) by multiple alignments of the phosphodiester backbone of residues 2-12 in chain C of 1JEY with the backbone of 10 consecutive residues in chain I of 1AOI. Iterative alignments were made, advancing target phosphate positions in the nucleosome in single nucleotide steps, until steric clashes were minimized to generate the docked structure model shown in Fig. 8, where residues 2-12 in chain C of 1JEY are aligned with residues 10-20 in chain I of 1AOI. Ku Displaces Histone H1 from DNA Ends—Binding of protein to DNA fragments has been shown in vitro to inhibit the ability of XRCC4-Ligase IV to join DNA ends (26Jones J.M. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12926-12931Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Kysela B. Chovanec M. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ku and DNA-PKcs are required to relieve the specific inhibition caused by the presence of the linker histone H1 (27Kysela B. Chovanec M. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting Ku may play roles in recognizing H1-occluded DNA ends and making these ends accessible to DNA-PKcs and XRCC4-ligase IV. To address this possibility, we incubated a radiolabeled 31-bp DNA duplex with a large excess (500-fold) of the linker histone. This generates H1-DNA complexes with heterogeneous mobility (Fig. 1, lane 11), including aggregates that remain in the well (species III). Addition of Ku to these reactions results in progressive redistribution of the H1-bound DNA into two species (species V and VI). Species V is heterogenous, and its mobility can be reduced by antibodies to either H1 or Ku, indicative of the presence of at least one molecule of both. Species VI is more abundant at higher concentrations of Ku and is consistent with DNA where Ku has mostly evicted H1; the mobility of a large proportion of this species resists addition of the α-H1 antibody, and its mobility is equivalent to DNA saturated by Ku only (compare lanes 8-10 to 15-17). Eviction of H1 occurs even when the Ku concentration is one-fiftieth the concentration of H1. Ku is thus remarkably effective at clearing DNA of histone H1. Ku Threads on Nucleosome-associated DNA Ends—We next addressed whether the ability of Ku to load on H1-occluded ends could be generalized to other physiologically relevant protein-DNA complexes. The nucleosome is the protein occlusion that Ku is most likely to encounter near a DSB produced by exogenous DNA-damaging agents (e.g. ionizing radiation). We therefore addressed whether Ku could load on DNA ends in the context of “linker-less” mononucleosomes purified from bulk cellular chromatin (Fig. 2, species I). To obtain these core nucleosomes, oligonucleosome fragments lacking linker histones were first purified by sucrose gradient and subsequently subjected to exhaustive micrococcal nuclease digestion, generating a mononucleosome containing 147 bp of DNA (17Schnitzler G. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 21.5-1-215-12Google Scholar) 3S. A. Roberts and D. A. Ramsden, unpublished data.. We then assessed whether Ku could bind these mononucleosomes by EMSA. Consistent with previous reports (5Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28Park E.J. Chan D.W. Park J.H. Oettinger M.A. Kwon J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), incubation of Ku with either native or reconstituted mononucleosomes shifts the mobility of the nucleosome in a manner dependent on Ku concentration (Fig. 2, species II and III), arguing Ku binds to nucleosome-associated ends. Given the way Ku loads on naked DNA ends (threading of ends through a central channel), Ku must either have altered how it binds DNA ends or loading of Ku involves some form of nucleosome remodeling. We employed a series of homogeneously positioned mononucleosome substrates (e.g. Figs. 2 and 3) and a previously described end-blocking strategy (15Yoo S. Kimzey A. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20034-20039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4679-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) to address this issue in greater detail. Ku can bind if one but not both ends of a naked DNA fragment are blocked by terminal biotin-streptavidin complexes (Fig. 3A). We therefore reconstituted singly positioned mononucleosomes containing biotin appended to one or both DNA ends. Importantly, as with naked DNA, Ku requires at least one unblocked end before it can shift the equivalent nucleosome substrate (Fig. 3B). Antibodies to Ku further reduced the mobility of candidate Ku-bound nucleosome species, confirming Ku is stably retained in these species (Fig. 3C). Ku thus loads on nucleosome-associated DNA ends the same way it loads on naked DNA, by threading DNA ends through its channel. The singly blocked nucleosome substrate was then used to determine the extent to which nucleosome association reduces the affinity of Ku for DNA ends. In accordance with previous estimates (2Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ku displays an apparent Kd of 0.34 ± 0.02 nm for the first molecule binding a naked DNA end (Fig. 4A).

Subsets of these endosomal proteins possess a highly selective PI3P binding zinc finger motif belonging to the FYVE domain family. We have identified a single FYVE domain-containing protein in Plasmodium falciparum which we term FCP. Expression and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that key residues are involved in specific binding to PI3P. In contrast to FYVE proteins in other organisms, endogenous FCP localizes to a lysosomal compartment, the malaria parasite food vacuole (FV), rather than to cytoplasmic endocytic organelles. Transfections of deletion mutants further indicate that FCP is essential for trophozoite and FV maturation and that it traffics to the FV via a novel constitutive cytoplasmic to vacuole targeting pathway. This newly discovered pathway excludes the secretory pathway and is directed by a C-terminal 44-amino acid peptide domain. We conclude that an FYVE protein that might be expected to participate in vesicle targeting in the parasite cytosol instead has a vital and functional role in the malaria parasite FV.

We conclude that an FYVE protein that might be expected to participate in vesicle targeting in the parasite cytosol instead has a vital and functional role in the malaria parasite FV. Malaria parasites inflict a tremendous global burden on the health and productivity of human kind. Among the species predominantly infective to humans, Plasmodium falciparum stands out as responsible for more than half of all infections and for causing the most severe forms of the disease resulting in the death of more than 1.5 million people annually (1Danis M. Gentilini M. Rev. Prat. 1998; 48: 254-257PubMed Google Scholar). Malaria parasites circulate in the human host by repeated invasion and development within the human erythrocyte. During the 48-h cycle of development, parasites endocytose 80-90% of the host cell cytosol and hemoglobin. Specialized proteases are believed to traffic to vesicles containing hemoglobin to initiate the digestion of hemoglobin on route to its final destination, the lysosomal compartment, or parasite food vacuole (FV) 6The abbreviations used are: FV, food vacuole; EEA1, early endosomal autoantigen-1; AD, activation domain; BD, DNA binding domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BFA, brefeldin A; Cvt, cytoplasmic to vacuole trafficking; TGN, trans-Golgi network; HRPII, histidine-rich protein II; PI3P, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-phosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. (2Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the endocytic process is characterized by morphologically distinct parasite structures including specialized structures for the uptake of hemoglobin (cytostomes), hemoglobin-containing vesicles, and a single FV (3Atkinson C.T. Aikawa M. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 351-368PubMed Google Scholar), the contribution of protein components to the endocytic pathway required for membrane trafficking, molecular signaling, effector protein recruitment, and formation of these structures remains unknown. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) plays a fundamental regulatory role in endocytic systems of higher eukaryotes (4Pfeffer S. Cell. 2003; 112: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D.

Rab5, a universally conserved component of early endosomes, recruits the type III PI 3-kinase in mammals and yeast. Hence, the product of this kinase, PI3P, is found in the early endosomes of mammals and is likewise restricted to the endocytic pathway in yeast (6Gillooly D.J. Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 120: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Various other endosomal regulatory proteins bind PI3P and thereby localize to endocytic compartments in yeast and mammals (9Birkeland H.C. Stenmark H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 282: 89-115PubMed Google Scholar). Many among these including the early endosomal autoantigen-1 (EEA1) contain a highly selective PI3P binding zinc finger motif belonging to the FYVE domain family (conserved in Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1) (9Birkeland H.C. Stenmark H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 282: 89-115PubMed Google Scholar). Although P. falciparum appears limited with regard to Rab5 effectors and other endocytic machinery, it does possess a phosphatidylinositol biosynthetic pathway (10Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We, therefore, asked if P. falciparum possesses functional FYVE domain proteins. Using a bioinformatics approach we identified a single FYVE domain-containing protein encoded in the parasite genome. Surprisingly, this protein did not localize to endocytic structures as would be predicted for an FYVE domain family protein but, rather, localized discreetly to the lumen of the FV, a lysosomal compartment characterized by the presence of hemozoin (a crystallized heme byproduct of hemoglobin digestion). By identifying the domain responsible for targeting to the FV, we not only explain this unexpected result but identify a new direct trafficking pathway between the parasite cytosol and the parasite FV. In Vitro Cultivation of P. falciparum—P. falciparum strain 3D7 (obtained from MR4) was employed in experiments contributing to Figs. 4 and 5, whereas strain FCR3 (a gift from Dr. Kasturi Haldar) was used to obtain Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9. Parasites were maintained in 5% CO2 (for FCR3) or 90% N2, 5% CO2, and 5% O2 for (3D7) in leukocyte-free erythrocytes of blood group A+ (American Red Cross) at 5% hematocrit and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, sodium bicarbonate (2 g·liter-1), gentamicin (1 μg·ml-1), 92 μm hypoxanthine and contained 10% human serum, type AB as described (11Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Parasite synchronization was achieved by isolation of late stage trophozoites on Percoll sorbitol gradients as described (12Kutner S. Breuer W.V. Ginsburg H. Aley S.B. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 125: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) followed by reintroduction into culture with fresh red blood cells. Four hours after the first detection of ring stage parasites, cultures were treated with 5% sorbitol (13Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar) to lyse all remaining late stage parasites. This yielded highly synchronous cultures.FIGURE 5FCP localizes to the FV but does not traffic via the classical or alternate secretory pathways. A, immunofluorescence using anti-FCP revealed a discrete localization to the parasite FV. Ring stage parasites were treated either with 5 μg·ml-1 BFA (anti-FCP + BFA) or solvent as control (anti-FCP) for 12 h before immunofluorescence microscopy. BFA treatment did not alter FV localization of FCP. B, as a control experiment, parasites treated with BFA (anti-HRPII + BFA) or without BFA (anti-HRPII) were stained using antisera against a known secreted protein, HRPII. HRPII was localized predominantly to the cytoplasm of the host infected erythrocyte (anti-HRPII). BFA treatment resulted in a significant loss in erythrocyte localization of HRPII and a concomitant increase in the parasite cytoplasm (anti-HRPII + BFA). C, trophozoite-infected erythrocytes were treated with saponin to separate the erythrocyte and parasitophorous vacuole contents (Sup) from the parasite material (Pellet), and immunoblotting was performed for FCP. FCP was found in the pellet fraction rather than the concentrated supernatant fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6FCP localizes to the lumen of the FV.

For yeast 2-hybrid analysis, FCP cDNA was appropriately digested and ligated into yeast two-hybrid vectors pACT-2 and pGBT-9 (Invitrogen) between the BamHI and XhoI sites of pACT-2 and EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBT-9. Ligations were made in-frame and downstream of the GAL4 activation domain (AD) or DNA binding domain (BD) to obtain pAD-FCP and pBD-FCP. The cDNA sequence of cloned FCP was identical to that of the putative gene (Pf14_0574) represented in the 3D7 P. falciparum genome data base. For GFP expression studies in Plasmodium, the eGFP gene of pEGFP-C2 (Invitrogen) was replaced with the GFP-M2 gene of pHDGFP (14Kadekoppala M. Kline K. Akompong T. Haldar K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2328-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This yielded the plasmid pGFP-M2-C2. Subsequently FCP was subcloned from the yeast expression vector pBD-FCP into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGFP-M2-C2 such that the gene fusion was in-frame and downstream of GFP-M2. Domain deletions were constructed from pBD-FCP and converted to GFP-M2 gene fusions by ligation between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGFP-M2-C2. FCP-Δ-c-coil was obtained by digestion of pBD-FCP with BglII and BamHI followed by blunt ending and self-ligation. This removed the entire C terminus including the complete coiled-coil domain. FCP-Δ-FYVE was obtained by digestion of pBD-FCP with KpnI and BglII followed by blunt ending and self-ligation. This deleted only the FYVE domain and kept the N terminus and remainder of FCP inframe. FCP-Δ-c44 was obtained by digestion of pBD-FCP with StyI and BamHI followed by blunt ending and self-ligation. This removed the C-terminal conserved domain encoding the final 44 amino acids of FCP. Transfer to pGFP-M2-C2 yielded the following plasmid constructs: pGFP-F-Δ-c-coil, pGFP-F-Δ-FYVE, and pGFP-F-Δ-c44. To explore the function of the C-terminal 44 amino acids, pGFP-44aa was constructed by PCR amplification of the C-terminal 132 bp encoding the 44-amino acid peptide using forward and reverse primers bearing EcoRI and SalI sites, respectively, and cloning into the EcoR1 and SalI sites of pGFP-M2-C2. Primers (GFPM2-ATTB1, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTAAAAATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC-3′, and GFP-ATTB2, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTGATCAGTTATCTAGATCCGG-3′) flanking the GFP gene fusion cassettes in the above plasmids, which contained 5′ attB1 and attB2 recombination sites, respectively, were used to PCR amplify all GFP-gene fusions such that they were suitable for cloning into pDONR-21 (Invitrogen) using the BP reaction and Gateway™ recombination cloning system (Invitrogen). Subsequent LR reactions (Invitrogen) with the Plasmodium Gateway™ destination vector pHH1-DR0.28-DEST (15Skinner-Adams T.S. Hawthorne P.L. Trenholme K.R. Gardiner D.L. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 17-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Prof. Tina Skinner-Adams, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Australia) resulted in the following Plasmodium GFP expression vectors: EXP-GFPM2, EXP-GFP-FCP, EXP-GFP-FCPΔ-c-coil, EXP-GFP-FCPΔ-c44, EXP-GFP-FCPΔ-FYVE, EXP-GFP-44aa. These expression vectors all utilize the Plasmodium HSP86 5′-untranslated region as a constitutive promoter for the expression of the GFP gene fusions. For protein expression studies, FCP cDNA was cloned in PQE-UA vector (Qiagen) to facilitate its expression as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Recombinant Protein Expression in E. coli and Anti-FCP Antiserum Production—BL21-RIL E. coli (Stratagene) was transformed with PQE-FCP plasmid or its variants. Cultures were grown in LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Recombinant protein was induced at mid-logarithmic phase (A600 value of 0.6) by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside either at 37 °C for 4 h or at 18 °C for 14 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min and suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 6 m urea, 500 mm NaCl) followed by sonication. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 12 h at 4 °C. After washes in buffer A, recombinant His6-tagged proteins were eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 m urea. Eluted proteins were renatured by dialysis against buffer containing reduced amounts (4 to 0 m) of urea. Refolded recombinant proteins were analyzed by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE, and a protein band of the expected molecular mass of 37 kDa was detected by Coomassie staining. To confirm the identity of the recombinant protein, the 37-kDa protein band was excised and subjected to tryptic digest and mass spectrometric analysis by the Institute of Molecular Medicine, The Chatterjee Group, New Delhi (supplemental Fig. S1). To raise anti-sera against FCP, 100 μg of recombinant FCP was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and used to raise antisera in mice and rabbits. Dot-blot Phosphoinositide Binding Assays—Dot-blot assays were performed as described previously (16Jensen R.B. La Cour T. Albrethsen J. Nielsen M. Skriver K. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, various phosphoinositides were serially diluted and spotted on nitro-cellulose membrane and air-dried for 2 h. Subsequently, the membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 h. The membrane was incubated with recombinant His6-FCP (0.5 μg/ml) or its variants diluted in blocking buffer for 12 h at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 5 times with buffer A before3hof incubation with anti-His6 antibody (BD Biosciences). Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG, and phosphatidylinositol-bound protein was detected by chemiluminescence. Yeast Two-hybrid Growth Assays—Yeast two-hybrid liquid culture growth assays were performed as previously described (17Hoppe H.C. Ngo H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Yeast were transformed with all possible paired plasmid combinations as well as with individual plasmids as controls, and protein-protein interactions were determined based on growth in His-dropout medium. Stringency was further assessed in increasing concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-trizol. Immunoblotting and Immunolocalization—For immunoblot experiments described in Fig. 5, parasite material was separated from erythrocytes and parasitophorous vacuole-derived material by lysis in 0.1% saponin analogous to a previously published procedure (33Klemba M. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43000-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). An equal number of parasites fractionated into a pellet or concentrated supernatant was denatured by boiling in 2% SDS, applied to SDS-PAGE, and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit anti-FCP and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Blots were developed using a WestDura ECL kit (Pierce). For immunofluorescence, parasitized red blood cells were spread on slides and fixed in methanol for 10 min. Subsequently, slides were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 12 h at 4 °C and incubated with a 1:50 dilution of mouse anti-FCP antisera. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were stained with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Texas Red. Cells were visualized on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Control experiments were performed using preimmune bleeds. For immunoelectron microscopy, parasites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (EM Polysciences Inc.), 0.1% glutaraldehyde (EM Polysciences Inc.), and 0.25 m HEPES, pH 7.4, embedded in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% bovine skin gelatin (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C in cryo-protectant containing 10% polyvinylpyrolidone and 2.7 m sucrose. Subsequently, parasite blocks were applied to pins, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subjected to ultra thin sectioning in a liquid nitrogen-cooled cryo-ultramicrotome. Sections were applied to nickel-coated grids, incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit anti-FCP IgG at 25 °C, and stained with gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Electron micrographs were obtained digitally by a CCD camera using a Philips Techni Bio-Twin electron microscope. Parasite Transfection, Localization, and Dominant Negative Effects—Transient transfections of malaria parasites with EXP-GFP vectors (see above details) were performed by a modification of the previously described preloading technique (18Deitsch K. Driskill C. Wellems T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). 200 μl of packed red blood cells were washed once in incomplete cytomix (19van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 202902 Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) (containing 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6) and then resuspended to 400 μl in ice-cold incomplete cytomix. Red blood cells were then preloaded with 50 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation in a ECM630 Electro Cellular Manipulator™ (BTX) at settings of 310 V, 25 ohms, and 950 microfarads. To ensure synchronous transfections and facilitate morphological interpretation of potential dominant negative effects, cultures were synchronized as described above. Subsequently, late stage parasites were once again purified by Percoll sorbitol gradient as described above and then added to preloaded red blood cells and cultured for 40-46 h before microscopic analysis for GFP expression and morpho-logical detail. Microscopy was performed at 1000× magnification using a Nikon Optiphot II microscope equipped with epifluorescence and Nomarski optics or at 1000× using a Zeiss Axioscope with epifluorescence. FV localization was verified by photography of cells under simultaneous fluorescence and bright field phase contrast at low light levels. Images were collected by CCD camera, labeled in Adobe PhotoShop 6.0 (Adobe), and arranged in Adobe Illustrator 10 (Adobe). Plasmodium Encodes a Single FYVE Domain Protein—Sequence alignment of FYVE domains yielded the consensus sequence R(R/K)HHCR, which was used to search the P. falciparum genome data base. This revealed only a single FYVE domain-containing protein (Pf14_0574). Analysis by SOCKET (20Walshaw J. Woolfson D.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1427-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) indicated the presence of a coiled-coil domain (residues 163-266) downstream of the FYVE zinc finger domain (residues 42-92). Thus, we named the protein FCP for FYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein. An additional gene (PF13_0055), annotated as encoding a potential FYVE domain, more closely resembled a RING domain and, hence, was not investigated further. Sequencing of FCP cDNA confirmed a lack of introns, and comparison of the amino acid sequence with other orthologous counterparts indicated that FCP was highly conserved with 70-80% amino acid identity within the malaria parasite genus Plasmodium (Fig. 1A). Additional searches indicated that at least two potential FYVE domain-containing proteins exist in the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii. TBLASTN searches excluding the FYVE domains of other family members including EEA1, Hrs, YOT1, Fab1, and Vac1 failed to identify genes encoding proteins of significant homology in P. falciparum. This provided the first indication that FCP might not function in the same fashion as the endosomal FYVE proteins of higher eukaryotes. X-ray crystal structures for Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vps27p, Drosophila melanogaster Hrs, and human EEA1 have further defined the secondary and tertiary structure of the FYVE domain as containing a core fold similar to that of the RING domain (21Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). FCP encodes all of the conserved residues and attributes known to be required for PI3P binding by other FYVE domain proteins. Among these are eight invariant zinc-coordinating cysteine residues arranged in four CXXC motifs, an upstream WXXD motif, and a downstream RVC motif, each intimately involved in PI3P binding (Fig. 1B). In addition, the glycine residue immediately adjacent to the second pair (CXXC) of zinc-coordinating cysteines is invariant among all known FYVE domain proteins and is believed to provide flexibility required for formation of the core fold of the domain (Fig. 1B). The R(R/K)HHCR consensus sequence is known to be the principal site of PI3P binding (Fig. 1B). FCP Specifically Interacts with PI3P—To better understand phosphoinositide interactions with FCP, we performed lipid dot-blot assays using recombinant wild type and site-directed mutants of FCP. Wild type FCP bound specifically to PI3P (Fig. 2B). Deletion of the FYVE domain (data not shown) resulted in a complete loss of phosphoinositide binding as did a site-directed substitution K55A (Fig. 2B), which resides within the conserved motif R(R/K)HHCR (Figs. 1B and 2A). The crystal structure of the EEA1 FYVE domain bound to inositol 1,3-diphosphate has revealed that amino acid residues form a coordination network with the 1′ and 3′ phosphates of PI3P, and it has been hypothesized that these residues may lend specificity to FYVE-PI3P interaction (22Dumas J.J. Merithew E. Sudharshan E. Rajamani D. Hayes S. Lawe D. Corvera S. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 947-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To test this we replaced all flanking arginines (Arg-52, Arg-54, and Arg-59) with neutral alanine residues. This three-amino acid substitution resulted in a loss in specificity for PI3P as indicated by increased binding to phosphoinositides, PI 3,4,5-triphosphate and PI 4,5-diphosphate. This loss in PI3P binding specificity demonstrated that indeed a critical interaction does exist between these basic residues and the 1′ and 3′ phosphates of PI3P (Figs. 2, A and B). FCP Self-associates—Several FYVE proteins have been shown to dimerize by virtue of a coiled-coil domain, thereby increasing their avidity for PI3P (23Hayakawa A. Hayes S.J. Lawe D.C. Sudharshan E.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For example, EEA1 dimerizes when bound by Rab5 and then simultaneously binds two PI3P molecules in the early endosome (25Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). In this way EEA1 is believed to participate in tethering of opposing vesicular and target membranes during the homotypic fusion of early endosomes (26Woodman P.G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we employed a yeast two-hybrid growth assay (17Hoppe H.C. Ngo H.M. Yang M. Joiner K.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Yeast expression plasmids were constructed by fusing the yeast GAL4 AD or GAL4 DNA BD to the N terminus of FCP. Persistent growth of yeast in HIS-medium in increasing concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-trizol indicates an interaction between bait and target proteins, each fused to AD or BD, respectively.

We have previously identified a chloroplast homolog of GrpE in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, termed CGE1. CGE1 exists as two isoforms, CGE1a and CGE1b, which are generated by temperature-dependent alternative splicing. CGE1b contains additional valine and glutamine residues in its extreme NH2-terminal region. Here we show that CGE1a is predominant at lower temperatures but that CGE1b becomes as abundant as CGE1a at elevated temperatures. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CGE1b had a ∼25% higher affinity for its chloroplast chaperone partner HSP70B than CGE1a. Modeling of the structure of CGE1b revealed that the extended α-helix formed by GrpE NH2 termini is 34 amino acids longer in CGE1 than in Escherichia coli GrpE and appears to contain a coiled coil motif. Progressive deletions of this coiled coil increasingly impaired the ability of CGE1 to form dimers, to interact with DnaK at elevated temperatures, and to complement temperature-sensitive growth of a ΔgrpE E. coli strain. In contrast, deletion of the four-helix bundle required for dimerization of E. coli GrpE did not affect CGE1 dimer formation. Circular dichroism measurements revealed that CGE1, like GrpE, undergoes two thermal transitions, the first of which is in the physiologically relevant temperature range (midpoint ∼45 °C). Truncating the NH2-terminal coiled coil shifted the second transition to lower temperatures, whereas removal of the four-helix bundle abolished the first transition. Our data suggest that bacterial GrpE and chloroplast CGE1 share similar structural and biochemical properties, but some of these, like dimerization, are realized by different domains.

Our data suggest that bacterial GrpE and chloroplast CGE1 share similar structural and biochemical properties, but some of these, like dimerization, are realized by different domains. Molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 family essentially consist of two domains, an NH2-terminal ATPase domain and a COOH-terminal substrate-binding domain. In the ATP-bound state, Hsp70s have a low affinity for substrates; in the ADP-bound state, affinity for substrates is high (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar and 2Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). The conversion between both states is regulated by cochaperones; J-domain proteins, which also supply Hsp70s with specific substrates, normally trigger ATP hydrolysis and thus catalyze the conversion of Hsp70s into the ADP-bound state with high affinity for substrate (3Liberek K.

Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Nucleotide exchange factors, like Bag1 for eukaryotic-type Hsp70s or GrpE for bacterial Hsp70s of the DnaK type, mediate the exchange of ADP by ATP and thus catalyze the reconversion of Hsp70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state with low affinity for substrate (3Liberek K.

GrpE-type nucleotide exchange factors are required only by DnaK-type Hsp70s, which contain a conserved region within their ATPase domain, allowing them to bind nucleotides with particularly high affinity and to hydrolyze ATP at high rates (6Brehmer D. Rüdiger S. Gässler C.S. Klostermeier D. Packschies L. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Such DnaK-type Hsp70s exist not only in bacteria but also in mitochondria and chloroplasts, where their GrpE-type cochaperones are termed MGE1 (7Laloraya S. Gambill B.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and CGE1 (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), respectively. The Hsp70 partner of CGE1 in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas is called HSP70B (9Drzymalla C. Schroda M.

To catalyze nucleotide exchange, GrpEs interact with their Hsp70 partners as dimers (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A.

According to the crystal structure of Escherichia coli GrpE in complex with the ATPase domain of DnaK, it is only one GrpE molecule of the dimer that contacts DnaK (13Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). E. coli GrpE consists of four domains (Refs. 13Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 4), which in the following are listed from the COOH to the NH2 termini: (i) the β-sheet domain, which contributes most contacts with the DnaK ATPase domain (by introducing a conformational change in the DnaK nucleotide-binding cleft, it mediates nucleotide exchange); (ii) the four-helix bundle, to which each GrpE monomer contributes two short α-helices and which serves as a dimerization platform (15Gelinas A.D.

We have reported previously that by a temperature-dependent alternative splicing process, the gene encoding the chloroplast GrpE homolog CGE1 gives rise to two transcripts termed CGE1a and CGE1b (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The CGE1b transcript contains six additional nucleotides coding for valine and glutamine, which are the fourth and fifth NH2-terminal residues of mature CGE1b. In this study, we demonstrate that the CGE1 NH2-terminal region strongly affects the biochemical properties of the protein; first, valine-glutamine in CGE1b increased its affinity for HSP70B, and second, dimerization and functionality of CGE1 in vivo required a coiled coil domain situated at the NH2 terminus of the protein. Strains and Culture Conditions—Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was grown mixotrophically in TAP medium (21Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 26-27Google Scholar) on a rotatory shaker at 25 °C and ∼30 microeinsteins m-2 s-1. Wild type strain 137c (mt-) was used for the experiments of Fig. 1, and cw15 strain CF185 (22Schroda M. Vallon O. Wollman F.-A. Beck C.F.

A, HSP70B isolated from Chlamydomonas (7 nm) was mixed with CGE1a and CGE1b (42 nm each) in the absence of ATP and incubated for 30 min. After 10% of the reaction mixture had been removed as input control, HSP70B was immunoprecipitated, and precipitating proteins were separated on an SDS-14% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting. Incubations and immunoprecipitations were entirely carried out at 23 or 37 °C, respectively. B, the experiment was performed as that in A at 23 °C, but the ratio of CGE1a to CGE1b proteins that were mixed with HSP70B was increased as indicated. C, Chlamydomonas cells were grown for 16 h at 37 °C or incubated at 41 °C for 4 h. Cells were depleted from ATP, and soluble proteins were isolated. After removing 1% as input control, HSP70B was immunoprecipitated, and precipitating proteins (IP) were separated on an SDS-14% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting. D, ATP-depleted soluble cell extracts from Chlamydomonas cells that were grown at 23 °C or incubated at 41°C for 2 h (upper panel), or 40 ng of purified CGE1a (a), CGE1b (b), or a mixture of both (a + b) (lower panel) were separated on native 8-14% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Polyacrylamide Electrophoreses and Gel Blot Analyses—SDS-PAGE and gel blot analyses were performed as described earlier (23Liu C.

Cloning, Expression, and Purification of CGE1 Derivatives, DnaK, and HSP70B—The coding regions of CGE1b, Δ9, Δ16, Δ25, Δ45, and Δ71, were amplified by PCR from cDNA clone AV391963 (encoding CGE1b) with 5′ primers 5′-GGCTCGTCGTTTTGGCTCTTCGAACGCGGCTG-3′,5′-GGACTAGTGCTCTTCCAACGCCCCTGCTGAGGAGGCGGC-3′,5′-GGACTAGTGCTCTTCCAACGCTACCCCCCTGGAGCGTGC-3′, 5′-GGACTAGTGCTCTTCCAACGCTCTGGACAGCGAGACC-3′,5′-CTTGGCTCTTCGAACGCTGAGATGGGTCGC-3′,5′-GGACTAGTGCTCTTCCAACGCCAAGGACCAGTACC-3′, and 3′ primer T7. For ΔHB, primers 5′-GGCTCGTCGTTTTGGCTCTTCGAACGCGGCTG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCGAGTTAGCCGCGCACGCTGTCGGTGA-3′ were used. For CGE1a, primers 5′-GGCTCGTCGTTTTGGCTCTTCGAACGCGGCTG-3′ and T7 were used with pMS213 (cDNA clone encoding CGE1a) as a template (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PCR products were digested with SapI and XhoI and cloned into SapI-XhoI-digested pTYB11 (NEB, Frankfurt, Germany), giving pMS300 (1a), pMS301 (1b), pMS365 (Δ9), pMS367 (Δ16), pMS369 (Δ25), pMS295 (Δ45), pMS412 (Δ71), and pMS413 (ΔHB). Correct cloning was verified by sequencing. CGE1 derivatives were expressed as fusion proteins in E. coli ER2566 and purified by chitin affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEB) but including a wash step with 5 mm ATP. Pure proteins were dialyzed three times against 2 liters of KH buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl) or 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, concentrated in Amicon Ultra-4 tubes (Millipore, Molsheim, France), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. HSP70B (BEc) also was isolated by chitin affinity chromatography as described previously (26Willmund F. Schroda M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2310-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but the protein expressed here did not contain a hexahistidine tag. HSP70B (BCr) and DnaK were isolated by CGE1 affinity chromatography as described previously (23Liu C. Willmund F. Whitelegge J.P. Hawat S. Knapp B. Lodha M. Schroda M. Mol. Biol.

The purity of the BCr preparation was checked by nano-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of tryptically digested BCr protein as described previously (28Schmidt M. Gessner G. Luff M. Heiland I. Wagner V. Kaminski M. Geimer S. Eitzinger N. Reissenweber T. Voytsekh O. Fiedler M. Mittag M. Kreimer G.

Of the 91 peptides identified for Chlamydomonas HSP70s, 95% were from HSP70B, and 1-2%, respectively, were from endoplasmic reticulum-resident BIP1/2, cytosolic HSP70A, and mitochondrial HSP70C. The construction of vectors for the expression of CGE1 derivatives in strain OD212 was as follows. The CGE1b coding region was amplified by PCR from pMS205 (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (contains the CGE1b cDNA with coding regions for NH2- and COOH-terminal hexahistidine tags in expression vector pQE-9 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)) with primers 5′-CAGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGTACGTATCGCATC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTAACC-3′. The 777-bp PCR product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into EcoRI-HindIII-digested pQE-9, giving pMS397. Next, the coding regions of the CGE1 derivatives were PCR-amplified with primers 5′-GGATCCCAGGTTTACGTACAGAAC-3′ and 5′-TTGGGTAACCCTCCTCAGAGCTAGCCGCAGGGCCGT-3′ using pMS300, pMS301, pMS367, pMS369, and pMS295 as templates. PCR products were then digested with SnaBI and BstEII and ligated into SnaBI-BstEII-digested pMS397, generating pMS399 (1a), pMS400 (1b), pMS401 (Δ16), pMS402 (Δ25), and pMS398 (Δ45). To remove regions coding for COOH-terminal histidine tags, the latter constructs were digested with BstXI and BlpI, and a ∼1-kb BstXI-BlpI fragment from BstXI-BlpI-digested pMS301 was inserted, giving pMS404 (1a), pMS405 (1b), pMS406 (Δ16), pMS407 (Δ25), and pMS403 (Δ45). pMS408 (Δ9) was constructed by ligating a ∼500-bp PCR product (using primers 5′-CAGAATTCATTAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACTATGTACGTATCGCATC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTAACC-3′ on pMS365) digested with SnaBI and BstXI into SnaBI-BstXI-digested pMS404. Correct cloning was verified by sequencing. Glutaraldehyde Cross-links—Proteins were incubated in KMH buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2) for 10-30 min. Then glutaraldehyde (0.05-0.1%) was added, and the incubation was continued for another 10-20 min. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of one volume of 2× Laemmli buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) containing 400 mm glycine. Immunoprecipitations and Native Dimer Assays—For affinity assays, 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 ng of HSP70B, 15 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 0.75 units of apyrase in KMH buffer were incubated at 23 °C for 15 min. Mixtures were then diluted to 100 μl with KMH buffer containing 100 ng of CGE1b, CGE1a as indicated, and 250 μg of bovine serum albumin. After further incubation for 30 min, 200 μl of KMH and 40 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads coupled with 20 μl of polyclonal anti-HSP70B serum (as described in Ref. 8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) were added. After mixing for 1 h on an overhead shaker, beads were washed four times with KMH and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, and proteins were eluted by boiling for 45 s after the addition of one volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. For immunoprecipitations from cell extracts, Chlamydomonas cells from a 300-ml culture with a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml had been grown overnight at 37 °C or subjected to heat shock at 41 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication on ice in 4 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10 μm carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone, and 5 units of apyrase). Lysates were loaded onto a sucrose cushion (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.6 m sucrose) and centrifuged in a TI50 rotor for 30 min at 152,000 × g and 4 °C. 2 ml of the supernatant were incubated with 100 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads coupled with 200 μl of polyclonal anti-HSP70B serum. After mixing for 1 h on an overhead shaker, beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, and proteins were eluted by boiling after the addition of one volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. Quantification of CGE1a/b bands was done from scanned ECL films using the QuantityOne-4.5.1 program (Bio-Rad). For dimerization assays, 1 μm CGE1a, 1 μm CGE1b, or a 0.5 μm concentration of both was incubated in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol for 30 min at 23 °C. The reaction mixture was then diluted 10-fold in 50 mm BisTris 2The abbreviation used is: BisTris, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane. -HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 m ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 15% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.004% Ponceau-S, and 10% of the mix was loaded onto a native gel. Homology Modeling of CGE1b—As a template for homology modeling, the structure of the E. coli GrpE dimer bound to its HSP70 chaperone partner DnaK was used (13Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M.

Pairwise alignment of CGE1b and GrpE was done based on a multiple alignment of CGE1 with GrpE homologs of bacterial and mitochondrial origins (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction of the NH2-terminal region of CGE1, which is not conserved between CGE1 and GrpE, was done with the programs JPRED, PHD, PROF, PSIpred, PSSP, and SSpro accessed via the Columbia metamask (available on the World Wide Web at cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/submit_meta.html). Tropomyosin (29Whitby F.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins. 2000; 38: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 1C1G, amino acids 70-122 of chain A and 355-407 of chain B) as an appropriate template for the modeling of the CGE1 NH2-terminal region was found by using the hydrophobic pattern identified in this region as a query for BLAST-P. Pairwise alignment of CGE1b and Tropomyosin was done on the basis of similar hydrophobicity. 20 series of 100 models each with plausible alternative alignments (including an α-helical restraint for Ala1-Ala12 and Ala222-Ala233, respectively, based on secondary structure prediction) was generated with the MODELLER 7v06 software within InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The five models with highest ranking (based on probability density function and energy values) and best root mean square values as determined by ProFit (A. C. R. Martin; available on the World Wide Web at www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/) were tested with the Procheck version 3.5.4 program (30Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar) and checked manually. The model chosen was then energy-minimized three times using the CHARMM force field in InsightII. During the first minimization (600 steps and 0.001 final convergence) the backbone and the region between Arg24-Glu221 and Ala295-Glu442 were fixed. During the second minimization (again 600 steps and 0.001 final convergence), only the region Arg24-Glu221 and Ala295-Glu442 was fixed. The entire model was fixed during the final minimization (30 steps). Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism was measured with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) using a thermostated cuvette with a 1-mm path length. Temperature was controlled with a programmable water bath. At fixed temperatures (25 °C), three spectra between 300 and 190 nm (bandwidth 1 nm) were recorded every 0.1 nm at a scan speed of 200 nm min-1 and averaged. For these experiments, proteins had been dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, and proteins were used at a concentration of 10 μm. Time courses of temperature-induced conformational changes were followed by continuously monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm (bandwidth 1 nm). The cuvette was heated by 0.5 °C min-1, and measurements were taken once every 2 min. For these experiments, proteins had been dialyzed against KH buffer, and proteins were used at 20 μm concentration. Temperature-dependent Alternative Splicing of CGE1 Transcripts Leads to the Differential Accumulation of CGE1a and CGE1b Isoforms—The recently available Chlamydomonas genome sequence (available on the World Wide Web at genome.jgi-psf.org/Chlre3/Chlre3.home.html) allowed us to elucidate that the CGE1 gene consists of eight exons and seven introns and that it is the first CGE1 intron that is alternatively spliced (Fig. 1A). Alternative splicing was shown to be temperature-dependent (i.e. CGE1a represented 60-80% of the CGE1 message at 25 °C but declined to ∼30% in favor of CGE1b after a 40-min heat shock) (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test whether temperature-dependent changes in CGE1 message composition also were reflected at the protein level, we subjected Chlamydomonas cells to different temperature treatments and analyzed the cellular accumulation of CGE1a and CGE1b protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, CGE1a was much more abundant than CGE1b at 15 and 25 °C. However, CGE1b levels increased slightly at 30 °C, and CGE1b became equally abundant as CGE1a at 37 and 41 °C. We were surprised to see that we could separate CGE1a and CGE1b by SDS-PAGE, since the two proteins differ only by 227.3 Da, the mass of valine and glutamine. To verify that the CGE1 double band observed in Fig. 1B originated from the CGE1a/b isoforms, we compared the migration pattern of CGE1 from heat-shocked Chlamydomonas cells with that of purified CGE1a/b proteins that had been heterologously expressed in E. coli. The masses of heterologously expressed CGE1a and CGE1b determined by mass spectrometry were 23812.0 and 24040.0, respectively, which matched the masses calculated from the amino acid sequences (23812.19 and 24039.46, respectively). As presented in Fig. 1C, also purified CGE1a and CGE1b could be separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and they co-migrated exactly with the two isoforms from Chlamydomonas cells. We conclude that the temperature-dependent alternative splicing of the CGE1 transcript leads to a temperature-dependent accumulation of CGE1a and CGE1b proteins. HSP70B Purified from E. coli Does Not Interact with CGE1, but HSP70B Purified from Chlamydomonas Does—According to current knowledge, GrpE-type proteins do not have any enzyme activities by themselves, but they act as cochaperones for Hsp70s (14Harrison C. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hence, if the differential accumulation of the CGE1a/b isoforms was of any biological significance, it was expected to be by interaction with HSP70B, the chloroplast Hsp70 partner of CGE1 (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Since we intended to study possible effects of CGE1a/b on HSP70B in vitro, we first purified HSP70B. This we did from E. coli cells that heterologously expressed HSP70B (BEc) and from Chlamydomonas cell extracts (BCr; Fig. 2A) (23Liu C. Willmund F. Whitelegge J.P. Hawat S. Knapp B. Lodha M. Schroda M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Willmund F. Schroda M. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2310-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Next, we used glutaraldehyde cross-linking to test whether our HSP70B preparations were capable of interacting with CGE1 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2B, most of purified CGE1a existed as dimers, as expected from previous observations with native gels (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, CGE1a readily formed a complex with BCr that was disrupted by ATP. In contrast, CGE1a did not interact with BEc. Interestingly, BEc and BCr cross-linked in the absence of CGE1 already displayed different migration properties; whereas BEc migrated as oligomers, dimers, and as a compact species of ∼50 kDa, BCr appeared not to form oligomers or dimers but mainly occurred as the compact ∼50-kDa species and as a less compact ∼70-kDa species. Since the latter vanished entirely upon the addition of CGE1a in the absence of ATP but reappeared upon the addition of ATP, it appears to be this less compact ∼70-kDa species of HSP70B that is able to interact with CGE1. In summary, recombinant CGE1a efficiently formed dimers and formed ATP-sensitive complexes with HSP70B isolated from Chlamydomonas but not with recombinant HSP70B from E. coli. Apparently, recombinant HSP70B stably assumed nonfunctional conformations. CGE1b in Vitro and in Vivo Has a Higher Affinity for HSP70B than CGE1a—We suggested previously that the CGE1a/b isoforms may differ in their affinity for HSP70B (8Schroda M. Vallon O. Whitelegge J.P. Beck C.F. Wollman F.-A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2823-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we used HSP70B isolated from Chlamydomonas, mixed it with equal amounts of CGE1a and CGE1b in the absence of ATP, immunoprecipitated HSP70B from the mixture, and assayed how much CGE1a/b coprecipitated with HSP70B. Although crude, the advantage of this assay was that it required only small amounts of the precious BCr. The assay was performed at 23 °C and at 37 °C to monitor possible temperature effects. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, little but reproducibly more CGE1b than CGE1a coprecipitated with HSP70B at 23 °C. At 37 °C, the affinity of both CGE1a and CGE1b for HSP70B was dramatically reduced compared with 23 °C, but also at 37 °C CGE1b had a higher affinity f"
https://openalex.org/W2001110953,"In plants, 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase/7,8-dihydropteroate synthase (mitHPPK/DHPS) is a bifunctional mitochondrial enzyme, which catalyzes the first two consecutive steps of tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis. Mining the Arabidopsis genome data base has revealed a second gene encoding a protein that lacks a potential transit peptide, suggesting a cytosolic localization of the isoenzyme (cytHPPK/DHPS). When the N-terminal part of the cytHPPK/DHPS was fused to green fluorescent protein, the fusion protein appeared only in the cytosol, confirming the above prediction.

In contrast to mitHPPK/DHPS, which was ubiquitously expressed, the cytHPPK/DHPS gene was exclusively expressed in reproductive tissue, more precisely in developing seeds as revealed by histochemical analysis of a transgenic cytHPPK/DHPS promoter-GUS line. In addition, it was observed that expression of cytHPPK/DHPS mRNA was induced by salt stress, suggesting a potential role of the enzyme in stress response.

Folates play a crucial role as cofactors in a number of onecarbon transfer reactions. These reactions are essential for DNA synthesis and the methylation cycle occurring in all organisms (for review see Refs. 1Appling D.R.

During this process, dihydropterin is first activated by an ATP-dependent enzyme, hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) and then combined to p-ABA by dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) to produce dihydropteroate. The latter compound condenses with a molecule of glutamate, to yield dihydrofolate (H2FGlu). This step is catalyzed by dihydrofolate synthase (DHFS). H2FGlu is thereafter reduced to H4FGlu by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and this is followed by the addition of a polyglutamate chain by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (2Scott J. Rebeille F. Fletcher J. J. Sci. Food Agr. 2000; 80: 795-824Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Hanson A.D. Gregory J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Animals cannot de novo synthesize folates because of the lack of the first three essential enzymatic activities, HPPK, DHPS, and DHFS. Therefore, they have to rely on dietary folate intake, which makes plants one of the main sources of folates in human diet. A unique feature of plant folate biosynthesis is its fairly complex compartmentalization. The pathway itself has been shown to reside in the mitochondria (5Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Jourdain A. Nakamura S. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas dihydropterin and p-ABA, the initial substrates for the pathway, are respectively synthesized in the cytosol (6Basset G.

Both dihydropterin and p-ABA must be imported in the mitochondria to be combined (Fig. 1) through the first two steps of H4FGlun biosynthesis. There is a great extent of variability among the enzymes supporting these initial reactions. In bacteria, HPPK and DHPS are separate proteins, whereas they are always part of a multifunctional enzyme in eukaryotes. In pea plants, these two activities are supported by a bifunctional enzyme only detected in mitochondria (5Neuburger M. Rébeillé F. Jourdain A. Nakamura S. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9466-9472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Rébeillé F. Macherel D. Mouillon J-M. Garin J. Douce R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and genomic experiments strongly suggested a single copy gene (10Rébeillé F. Macherel D. Mouillon J-M. Garin J. Douce R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A single copy gene coding for the mitochondrial DHFS was also found in Arabidopsis (11Ravanel S. Cherest H. Jabrin S. Grunwald D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Douce R. Rébeillé F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15360-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), indicating that mitochondria comprise the most probable unique site for H2FGlu synthesis in plants. The mitochondria are also a key compartment for folate synthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, because the trifunctional enzyme supporting dihydroneopterin aldolase (DHNA), HPPK, and DHPS activities was recently shown to be associated with the mitochondrial membranes (12Guldener U. Koehler G.J. Haussmann C. Bacher A. Kricke J. Becher D. Hegemann J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3811-3828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Searches of the near complete Arabidopsis genomic sequence (13GI A Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7006) Google Scholar) have revealed two genes encoding HPPK/DHPS. Although the first gene obviously coded for a protein-orthologue of the earlier characterized mitochondrial HPPK/DHPS from pea (mitHPPK/DHPS), the second gene apparently lacked the potential transit peptide, suggesting a cytosolic localization of the enzyme (cytHPPK/DHPS). Here, we present evidence for the presence in Arabidopsis of a functional cytosolic HPPK/DHPS with an expression almost exclusively located in developing seeds during normal development and induced in young seedlings upon salt stress. Its role in H4FGlun biosynthesis as well as in stress response is discussed. Microbial Strains and Plant Material—Escherichia coli strains DH-5α and BL-21AI (Invitrogen) were used for plasmid manipulations and protein expression, respectively. The strains were grown on a standard Luria-Bertani medium (Invitrogen). A S. cerevisiae FOL1 knock-out strain Y26466 (a derivative of BY4743) (Mat a/α; his3Δ1/his3Δ1; leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0/LYS2; MET15/met15Δ0; ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0; YNL256w::kanMX4/YNL256w) was used for complementation experiments and was obtained from the EuroSCARF (Frankfurt, Germany) collection. The diploid Y26466 strain was maintained on a synthetic SD medium supplemented with essential amino acids (BD Biosciences Clontech) and 2% glucose as a carbon source. The haploid Y26466 was obtained after initiation of sporulation of the diploid followed by random spore analysis as described (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1994Google Scholar). The haploid Y26466 was propagated on the same medium as the diploid strain, supplemented with 25 mg/liter G-418 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mg/liter 5-CHO-H4FGlu (Sigma-Aldrich). Yeast transformation was carried out according to the standard protocol (14Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1994Google Scholar). Agrobacterium tumefaciens—GV3101(pMP90) was used for delivery of T-DNA from binary vectors into plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (ecotype Columbia-0) were grown in soil at 20 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark regime. Plant transformation was done using the “floral dip” method (15Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potential transformants were selected in vitro on ½MS medium containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands). Transformation was confirmed by PCR amplification of the T-DNA inserts with stoser 77 and attB2 adapter (Invitrogen) primers using genomic DNA as template. Sequences of all primers used in this study are shown in Table 1. Homozygous transgenic plants were selected by segregation analysis of the kanamycin resistance marker in T1 and T2 generations on selective medium.

The following gene-specific nested primer sets (Table 1) were used in combination with the universal primer mix provided in the kit: 1) 5′-RACE: stoser 19 and stoser 36; 3′-RACE: stoser 18 and stoser 37. Poly(A) RNA isolated from leaves of 3-week-old Arabidopsis plants was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by mRNA extraction with PolyATtract® mRNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI). Advantage® 2 cDNA Polymerase Mix was used for PCR. The longest PCR fragments representing the cDNA ends were cloned with help of the pGEM®-T Easy Vector System (Promega) and sequenced. For cloning of the full-length cDNA Gateway® Technology (Invitrogen) was used. First, the cDNA was amplified with stoser 54 and stoser 55 primers, which contained 12-bp attB recombination sequence extensions, using the same template as in RACE. Then, the PCR product was re-amplified with attB adaptor primers (Invitrogen) and cloned by the BP recombination reaction into pDONR221 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was used as the entry clone. Similarly, the full-length cDNA of AtFOLB1 was amplified with stoser 46 and stoser 47 primers. The destination vectors were: 1) pYES-DEST52 (Invitrogen) and pADH1 for expression in yeast and 2) pDEST17 for expression in E. coli. Likewise, a 672-bp-long N-terminal fragment of cytHPPK/DHPS was amplified with stoser 54 and stoser 75 primers and cloned into pDONR221. Further it was recombined by the LR recombination reaction with the pK7FWG2 binary vector (16Karimi M. Inze D. Depicker A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 193-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar) to produce a cytHPPK/DHPS-GFP fusion construct. Stoser 77 and stoser 78 primers were used for amplification of the cytHPPK/DHPS gene promoter from Arabidopsis Col-0 genomic DNA (isolated with NucleoSpin® Plant Kit, Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). A forward primer (stoser 77) was located 1.2 kb upstream of the 5′ untranslated region, and a reverse primer (stoser 78) was located in the second exon of gene to produce an in-frame translational fusion with the reporter. The amplified fragment was cloned in pDONR221 and sequenced. The binary vector pKGWFS7 (16Karimi M. Inze D. Depicker A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 193-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2629) Google Scholar) bearing a chimeric GFP-GUS reporter was used as a destination vector. The LR recombination reaction resulted in a plant transformation construct, Pr-GFP-GUS. Sequence Analysis—For the sequence analysis GCG (Genetic Computer Group Inc., Madison, WI) software was used. Pairwise amino acid sequence similarities were calculated using the GAP program. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out with a Multiple Sequence Alignment program at the web BCM Search Launcher server. For the homology searches a BLAST program was used, whereas cellular localization predictions were made with the PSORT, PREDOTAR, and TargetP programs at the PSORT, PREDOTAR, and TargetP web servers, respectively. Phylogenetic Analysis—A multiple sequence alignment was created with ClustalW (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Transient Expression Assay in Arabidopsis Protoplasts—Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from rosette leaves of 3-week-old plants grown in soil. Protoplast isolation and transient expression assay were essentially as described previously. 3Sheen, J. (2002) A Transient Expression Assay Using Arabidopsis Mesophyll Protoplasts, Department of Genetics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. Microscopic Analysis of GFP and GUS Reporters—For the protoplast GFP fluorescence study, transfected protoplasts were transferred to W5 (154 mm NaCl, 125 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MES (pH 5.7)) medium 16 h after transformation and microscopically examined with an epifluorescence microscope. Prior to microscopic analysis, the protoplasts were stained for 15 min with 50 nm MitoTracker Orange fluorescence dye (Invitrogen). An Olympus BX-61 epifluorescence microscope (Olympus Optical, Hamburg, Germany) was used, equipped with a UPlanApo 60×/0.9 objective. The following filter combinations have been used to detect the fluorescence: 1) excitation 460-480 nm, emission 495-540 nm, and dichromatic filter 485 nm for GFP fluorescence detection; 2) excitation 480-550 nm, emission >590 nm, and dichromatic filter 570 nm for MitoTracker and chloroplast autofluorescence detection. The images were processed using a deconvolution plug-in to CellF imaging software (Olympus). For histochemical analysis of GUS expression, different plant tissues were submerged in 90% ice-cold acetone for 30 min, washed twice with 1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 15 min at room temperature under gentle shaking, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in the GUS-staining solution (0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.5 mm Fe(CN)2, 0.5 mm Fe(CN)3, 0.1% Tween-20, 2 mm X-GlcA (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands). Subsequently, plant tissue samples were incubated overnight in 70% ethanol at 4 °C followed by clearing overnight in CLP solution (21Beeckman T. Engler G. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 12: 37-42Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar) at room temperature. After CLP (chloral hydrate/phenol/lactic acid, 2:1:1 (v/v/v)) treatment the samples were incubated overnight and mounted in lactic acid. Finally, they were examined using bright field microscopy (Eclipse 80i microscope, Nikon Instech Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan, with CFI Plan Fluor 20×/0.5 or CFI Plan Fluor 40×/0.75 objectives equipped with a DS-5MC digital camera). Expression and Purification of cytHPPK/DHPS from E. coli—Cytosolic HPPK/DHPS was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal His6 fusion protein. To increase solubility of the fusion protein, it was co-expressed with GroESL chaperones, delivered on the pT-groE plasmid (22Yasukawa T. Kaneiishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For the large scale purification, a 1.5-liter bacterial culture was grown. For cell lysis, CelLytic™ BII bacterial cell lysis extraction reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. After removing cellular debris by centrifugation and addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m, the lysate was incubated with 1.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 3 h. Subsequently, the resin was washed four times with a solution containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl, and the protein was eluted in 6 ml of the elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole) and concentrated using Centricon Centrifugal Filter devices (Millipore) to a final volume of 2 ml. The protein was further purified on NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) to exchange the elution buffer for storage buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). In Vitro HPPK/DHPS Activity Determination—These activities were estimated at 30 °C. All the solutions were maintained under a stream of argon to minimize the oxidation of the various dihydropterin substrates. The HPPK plus DHPS activity was estimated according to Mouillon et al. (26Mouillon J.M. Ravanel S. Douce R. Rébeillé F. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The standard reaction medium (medium A) contained, in a total volume of 120 μl: 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, and various amounts of the purified protein. 2 μl of 2 mm [14C]p-ABA (1.85 GBq.mmol-1, MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) were added to the assay medium, and then the reaction was started by the addition of 100 μm dihydropterin. After various times of incubation, the reaction was blocked by the addition of 3 μl of a 10 mm sulfanilamide solution. Then, 100 μl of the assay medium was injected in a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography system (Merck 655A-11 Liquid Chromatograph, equipped with a Shandon, Zorbax ODS Z225 5-μm column) coupled with a Berthold (LB 506D) scintillation counter, as described earlier (10Rébeillé F. Macherel D. Mouillon J-M. Garin J. Douce R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The high-performance liquid chromatography conditions were: solvent A, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6; solvent B, acetonitrile; B increased linearly of 0.8% every min; flow rate 1 ml®min-1. Within these experimental conditions, excess of [14C]p-ABA was not retained in the column, whereas [14C]dihydropteroate, the final product of the reaction, was eluted after 18 min of chromatography. Analysis of Gene Expression by RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from different organs (with the exception of roots) of 5-week-old A. thaliana ecotype Columbia plants grown on soil under a 16-h light/8-h dark regime using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). For root total RNA, roots of 3-week-old seedlings grown in vitro on ½MS plates were extracted. First strand cDNA was synthesized by a SuperScript™ First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and used as a template for semiquantitative RT-PCR. To avoid genomic DNA contamination, total RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, prior to first strand synthesis. Negative controls lacking RT were included. 19, 21, and 24 cycles of RT-PCR were carried out with JumpStart®REDTaq®DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich). The amplification products were detected by Southern blotting on Hybond+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes were prepared with the Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Results of the hybridization were visualized and quantified using a Storm 860 Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of PCR products within the given range of cycles confirmed exponential amplification. Stoser 18 and stoser 19 primers were used for amplification of cytHPPK/DHPS; mitHPPK/DHPS was amplified with stoser 20 and stoser 21. Ubi-5 gene, which was used as a housekeeping gene control, was amplified with UBI5F and UBI5R primers. Southern Blotting and Hybridization—Total DNA has been isolated from Arabidopsis leaves using Invisorb Spin Plant Mini Kit (Invitek, Invitek Gesellschaft für Biotechnik & Biodesign mbH, Berlin, Germany). One microgram of total plant DNA was digested overnight with 10 units of EcoRV restriction enzyme. The digested DNA was resolved in 0.7% agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized essentially as described above. Primers stoser 54 and stoser 36 were used to amplify a 300-bp fragment of the gene, which was used as a probe. Salt Stress Treatment—Three-week-old seedlings of in vitro grown or the aerial parts of fully developed flowering Arabidopsis plants (6 weeks old) were soaked in a 150 mm solution of NaCl or KCl or in water (negative control). Samples were taken after 2 and 4 h, and total RNA was extracted as mentioned above. For RT-PCR of cytHPPK/DHPS (stoser 18 and stoser 19 primers), mitHPPK/DHPS (stoser 20 and stoser 21), and Pr-GFP-GUS (stoser 54 and GFP-SEQ primers) 25, 30, and 35 cycles were run; whereas for ubiquitin (UBI5-F and UBI5-R primers) and DREB2A (stoser 117 and stoser 118 primers) 15, 20, and 25 cycles were performed, to assure exponential amplification. The amplification products were resolved by electrophoresis in an agarose gel and detected and quantified by ethidium bromide fluorescence using the Kodak Electrophoresis Documentation and Analysis System (Kodak Digital Science, Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Determination of Folate Levels—Mature dry seeds or 2-week-old in vitro grown plants, treated with NaCl as above, were used for folate level determination by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection essentially as described (23Zhang G-F. Storozhenko S. Van Der Straeten D. Lambert W.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2005; 1078: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Salt Stress Tolerance Test—Salt stress tolerance has been carried out as described (24Magome H. Yamaguchi S. Hanada A. Kamiya Y. Oda K. Plant J. 2004; 37: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Essentially, 2-week-old in vitro grown Arabidopsis seedlings were transferred to a fresh ½MS medium, containing 100 mm, 150 mm, and 170 mm NaCl. The survival rate has been monitored for 2 weeks after the transfer. Seed Germination Rate Assay—Arabidopsis seeds were germinated on ½MS medium (control) and after addition of 10 mm H2O2, 300 mm mannitol, or 150 mm NaCl. This was preceded by stratification on the above mentioned media in darkness at 4 °C for 4 days. The germinated seeds were scored for radicle emergence after different time intervals. A total of 90 seeds was scored at each time point. Accession Numbers of the Sequences Used in This Study—cytHPPK/DHPS cDNA sequence has been deposited in the EMBL sequence data base under accession number AJ866732; mitHPPK/DHPS from pea has the accession number CAA69903. HPPK/DHPS Is Encoded by Two Different Genes in Arabidopsis—Mining the Arabidopsis genome data base for genes homologous to pea HPPK/DHPS has revealed two highly similar sequences, At1g69190 and At4g30000, the deduced protein sequences of which shared 80% identical and 87% similar amino acids. Both of them were around 66% identical and 76% similar to HPPK/DHPS from pea. The deduced protein sequence of At4g30000 contained the full-length HPPK and DHPS domains and a long N-terminal extension, predicted to be a mitochondrial transit peptide. This gene is likely an orthologue of the mitochondrial HPPK/DHPS described from pea (10Rébeillé F. Macherel D. Mouillon J-M. Garin J. Douce R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the At1g69190 gene was predicted to contain a single exon encoding a shorter protein that lacked a part of the N-terminal portion of the mature HPPK domain, rendering it potentially non-functional. To verify the data base predictions, 5′- and 3′-RACE experiments were undertaken. The predicted initial exon was completed, revealing the missing portion of the HPPK domain. Furthermore, the gene had an additional exon at the 5′-end, containing the 5′-untranslated region and a start codon (Fig. 2A). In the 5′-untranslated region preceding the start codon, the presence of an in-frame stop codon confirmed that the full-length coding sequence was reconstituted. The corresponding cDNA encoded a protein of 484 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 54,053 Da. The deduced protein sequence did not show any obvious putative transit peptide (Fig. 2B) suggesting a cytosolic location of the enzyme. In summary, Arabidopsis contains two HPPK/DHPS genes, one being a putative orthologue of the earlier characterized mitochondrial HPPK/DHPS (mitHPPK/DHPS) from pea, and a novel gene, whose product possibly is localized in the cytosol. This protein was designated as cytosolic HPPK/DHPS (cytHPPK/DHPS). Intracellular Localization of cytHPPK/DHPS—To confirm cytosolic localization of the enzyme, a chimeric protein was constructed containing the first 224 amino acids of cytHPPK/DHPS fused to GFP. The fusion protein was transiently expressed in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts, and GFP fluorescence was detected with a wide-field epifluorescence microscope. As shown in Fig. 3 (A, E, and I) the signal was spread throughout the cytosol and in the nucleus in a very similar fashion as for free GFP (Fig. 3, C, G, and K). To visualize the mitochondria, the protoplasts were stained with MitoTracker orange, and the fluorescence was recorded in the orange region of the spectrum. As seen in Fig. 3 (B, F, D, and H) the pattern of the mitochondrial staining was discrete (dotted to dashed) and totally different from the continuous, network-like signal observed for cytHPPK/DHPS-GFP or free GFP. Similarly, the chloroplasts were localized by autofluorescence in the red range of the spectrum. Clearly, the GFP fluorescence was localized around and between the chloroplasts, which were seen as dark spots in the GFP fluorescence image. These data strongly suggest that cytHPPK/DHPS was targeted to the cytosol, as postulated from the in silico analysis of the sequence. Functionality of cytHPPK/DHPS—To demonstrate cytHPPK/DHPS functionality, a S. cerevisiae mutant devoid of HPPK/DHPS activity was complemented with the Arabidops"
https://openalex.org/W2029531377,"The results presented here demonstrate that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) Tyr-861 is the predominant tyrosine phosphorylation site stimulated by hyperosmotic stress in a variety of cell types, including epithelial cell lines (ileum-derived IEC-18, colon-derived Caco2, and stomach-derived NCI-N87), FAK null fibroblasts re-expressing FAK, and Src family kinase triple null fibroblasts (SYF cells) in which c-Src has been restored (YF cells). We show that hyperosmotic stress-stimulated FAK phosphorylation in epithelial cells is inhibited by Src family kinase inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 and that it does not occur in SYF cells. Unexpectedly, hyperosmotic stress-induced phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397, Tyr-576, and most dramatically at Tyr-861 was completely insensitive to the F-actin-disrupting agents, latrunculin A and cytochalasin D. Finally, we show that in FAK null cells exposed to hyperosmotic stress or growth factor withdrawal, re-expression of wild type FAK restored cell survival, whereas re-expression of FAK mutated from tyrosine to phenylalanine at position 861 (FAKY861F) did not. Our results indicate that FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation is required for mammalian cell survival of hyperosmotic stress. Furthermore, the results suggest that FAK is an upstream regulator (rather than downstream effector) of F-actin reorganization in response to hyperosmotic stress. We propose that FAK/c-Src bipartite enzyme is a sensor of cytoplasmic shrinkage, and that the phosphorylation on FAK Tyr-861 by Src and subsequent reorganization of F-actin can initiate an anti-apoptotic signaling pathway that protects cells from hyperosmotic stress.

A successful response to an increase in environmental osmolarity is of fundamental importance to cell survival as evidenced by the remarkable conservation of osmotic stress-response pathways from yeast to humans. For example, mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and its yeast homologue, Hog1, are similarly activated when mammalian cells and yeast are exposed to hyperosmotic stress (1Bell L.M.

Although the conservation of this signaling response to hyperosmotic stress is remarkable, there are compelling reasons to suggest that metazoan cells have evolved additional survival strategies. Metazoan cells, unlike yeast, which have the protection of a rigid cell wall and a conspicuous absence of latent cytoplasmic pro-apoptotic enzymes, will undergo much larger volume contraction and will be at much higher risk of triggering apoptosis under hyperosmotic conditions. In particular, epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces experience marked hyperosmolar environments under normal and pathological conditions (3Vernia P. Gnaedinger A. Hauck W. Breuer R.I. Dig. Dis.

However, the upstream signaling molecules responsible for sensing hyperosmolarity and mounting an anti-apoptotic response to hyperosmotic stress, at least in part by promoting F-actin organization to resist cell shrinkage, remain incompletely characterized.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, FAK also plays a role in preventing apoptosis triggered by hyperosmotic stress (34Lunn J.A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45266-45278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether exposure to hyperosmotic stress preferentially stimulates the phosphorylation of distinct tyrosine residues of FAK. Nor is it known if specific FAK tyrosine phosphorylations play a role in protecting cells from hyperosmotic stress-triggered apoptosis. Here we determined whether hyperosmotic stress stimulates phosphorylation of specific FAK tyrosine residues in epithelial cells derived from rat intestinal crypts (IEC-18), human colonic carcinoma (Caco2), and human gastric carcinoma (NCI-N87). We found that exposure to hyperosmotic stress induced a striking and selective increase in the phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-861 in all cell types examined. Surprisingly, disruption of F-actin in these cells failed to prevent hyperosmolar-stimulated FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397, Tyr-576, and most dramatically at Tyr-861. Finally, wild type FAK (FAK WT), but not FAK in which Tyr-861 was mutated to Phe (FAK861F), re-expressed in FAK null cells, promoted cell survival both in the face of hyperosmotic stress and of growth factor depletion. Collectively, these results indicate that FAK activation and specifically phosphorylation of Tyr-861 are sensors of hyperosmotic stress, lying upstream of the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that FAK signaling from phosphorylated Tyr-861 plays a critical role in the response of epithelial cells to withstand hyperosmotic stress. Cell Culture—IEC-18 cells were maintained in DMEM with 5% FBS between 50 and 80% confluency. For the experiments, 100% confluent monolayer cultures were serumstarved overnight prior to stimulation. Caco2 cells (BBE1 strain) were maintained between 40 and 80% confluency in DMEM supplemented with human transferrin and 10% FBS. NCI-N87 cells were maintained at 40–70% confluency in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and human apotransferrin. Cells were grown to 90% confluency and were serum-starved for 1 h. FAK null (FAK-/-) (43Tsugane S. Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and FAK re-expressing (GFP-FAK WT and GFP-FAK 861F) fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM with 4 mm l-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and 4.5 g/liter glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. 1 × 104 cells/35-mm dish were plated, and experiments were performed at 5 days (90% confluency). SYF and YF cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. 1 × 104 cells/35-mm dish were plated, and experiments were performed approximately on day 4 or 5 (90% confluency). All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. cDNA Plasmid and Retroviral Transfection Methods—To generate the MSCV-FAK-GFP construct, we first engineered an intermediate vector named pFAK-EGFP. This construct contained the complete coding sequence of mouse FAK cloned upstream from the GFP coding sequence. Briefly, the mouse FAK coding sequence was obtained by PCR using pT7-7-FAK (ATCC number 63207) as template. The forward primer, with the sequence 5′-GGAAGATCTCCGCCACCATGGCAGCTGCTTATCTTGACCCAAAC-3′, contained a BglII restriction site followed by an artificial Kozak sequence and the first 27 nucleotides of the FAK sequence. The reverse primer, with the sequence 5′-CGCGGATCCGCTCCGTGTGGCCGTGTCTGCCCTAGC-3′, contained a BamHI site followed by a mutated stop codon and a sequence complementary to the last 22 coding nucleotides of the FAK sequence. The PCR product was restricted with BglII-BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Consequently, a DNA fragment bearing the FAK-GFP coding sequence was excised from pFAK-EGFP with KpnI-AflI, Klenow-treated to fill-in the ends, and cloned into the MSCV-IRES-GFP vector whose IRES-GFP sequence was eliminated by restriction with XhoI and bluntended by Klenow treatment. FAK[Y861F]GFP mutant constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR (QuikChange II XL kit, Stratagene). Using MSCV-FAK-GFP as template, Tyr-861 was converted to phenylalanine by using the mutagenic primers 5′-ACCAACACATCTTTCAGCCTGTGGG (forward) and 5′-TGGTTGTGTAGAAAGTCGGACACCC (reverse). All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis, and the products of expression were analyzed by Western blot using murine monoclonal antibodies against the GFP epitope (Clontech) and a polyclonal antibody against FAK. For retrovirus production, logarithmically growing Phoenix ecotropic cells were transfected with MSCV-IRES-GFP (as control), MSCV-FAK-GFP, or mutant MSCV-FAK-861F-GFP, using Lipofectamine Plus following the manufacturer's protocol. Virus-containing supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and used immediately. Re-expression of FAK WT and FAK 861F into FAK Null Cells— Logarithmically growing FAK-/- fibroblasts were incubated with the virus-containing supernatants in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene for 5 h. Cells were collected 48–72 h later, and GFP-positive fractions were FACS-sorted using a FACStar PLUS machine (BD Biosciences). GFP-positive cells were propagated, and multiple aliquots were frozen. A fresh batch of cells was restarted every 2 months. Following sorting, GFP-positive FAK-/- cells were maintained as described above. Cell Stimulation with Peptide Agonists—Confluent IEC-18 cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM and equilibrated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of angiotensin II in DMEM. The stimulation was terminated by aspirating the medium and lysing the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5% mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell Stimulation by Hypertonicity—Fully confluent IEC-18, Caco-2, or NCI-N87 cells were washed twice with DMEM (IEC-18) or DMEM/F12 (Caco-2 and NCI-N87) and equilibrated in the same media at 37 °C for at least 30 min, and then the media were exchanged for 0.45 m sucrose, 0.6 m sorbitol, or 0.45 m urea in DMEM at 37 °C for the times indicated in figure legends. The stimulation was terminated by rapid rinsing in ice-cold PBS followed by aspirating the medium and solubilizing the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer as above or in 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cell Survival Assay—FAK null fibroblasts from the ATCC were transfected with either WT FAK-GFP or FAK 861F-GFP using a lentiviral transfection system described previously (35Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 48 h after infection, comparable transfection efficiencies (25–30%) were confirmed by direct fluorescent microscopy. Transfected cells were further cultured at 37 °C for 10 days without refeeding. Cells were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik cell staining kit from Dade Bhering Inc., Newark, NJ. Remaining cells were counted using a ×10 lens on a Nikon TMS microscope. Apoptosis Assay—FAK null fibroblasts from the ATCC were transfected with either WT FAK-GFP or FAK 861F-GFP using a lentiviral transfection system described previously (35Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After FACS sorting for GFP-positive cells, cells transfected with FAK WT or FAK 861F were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h in DMEM containing 450 mm sorbitol. They were then washed five times with DMEM and incubated a further 18 h. Cells were then assayed for apoptotic nuclei (multifragmented by intensely staining) by staining with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) for 20 min following the manufacturer's instructions. Imaging was done on a Zeiss Axioskope microscope using the 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter. Western Blotting—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in PBST, pH 7.2, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-397 antibody (0.1 μg/ml), anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-576 antibody (0.1 μg/ml), anti-FAK-Tyr(P)-861 antibody (0.1 μg/ml), or anti-FAK C20 antibodies. They were then incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse) at 1:5000 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing four times with PBST, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL detection reagents and photographic film. Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washing five times in PBS, they were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min at room temperature. After washing five times in PBS, cell were blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma) and 2% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then stained with AlexaFluor-546-phalloidin (Invitrogen) 1:40 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing six times in PBS, cells were imaged with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop) and a Zeiss water-immersion objective (Achroplan 40/0.75 w, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany). AlexaFluor-594 signals were observed with HI Q filter sets for rhodamine isothiocyanate (Chroma Technology). For each cell type, the same exposure settings were used for all images. Images were captured as uncompressed 12-bit TIFF files with a SPOT-cooled (-12 °C) single CCD color digital camera (three-pass method) driven by SPOT version 2.1 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS2. Materials—Angiotensin II, bradykinin, sucrose (ultra-pure), urea, and sorbitol (ultra-pure) were all obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (NA 934) and sheep anti-mouse antibody and ECL reagents were from GE Healthcare. Anti-FAK antibody C20was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies to FAK Tyr-397, FAK Tyr-576, and FAK Tyr-861 or total FAK (C20) were obtained from BIOSOURCE. Cytochalasin D and latrunculin A were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other reagents used were of the highest grade available. Hyperosmotic Stress Stimulates Selective FAK Phosphorylation at Tyr-861—To determine whether hyperosmotic stress triggers preferential phosphorylation of FAK tyrosines, we examined basal and hyperosmotic stress-stimulated FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397, Tyr-576, and Tyr-861 in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells (36Quaroni A. Isselbacher K.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 1353-1362PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of these cells were washed in serum-free DMEM and then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The medium was then replaced with DMEM or with DMEM containing 0.45 m sucrose for either 10 or 15 min. Other cultures were left in DMEM alone or in DMEM to which 50 nm angiotensin II was added for 5 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies that detect the phosphorylated state of FAK at Tyr-397, Tyr-576, and Tyr-861 or with an antibody against the FAK C terminus. The results shown in Fig. 1A (1st lane (-)) show a high level of basal FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 whereas that on FAK Tyr-861 is low. Replacement of the medium (Fig. 1A, 4th lane (contr.)) did not affect basal FAK phosphotyrosine levels. Exposure to 0.45 m sucrose for either 10 or 15 min (Fig. 1A, 2nd and 3rd lanes) failed to stimulate any detectable increase over basal high FAK Tyr(P)-397 and caused a modest increase in FAK Tyr(P)-576 in IEC18 cells. In contrast, hyperosmotic stress induced a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-861 in these cells. For comparison, we show that the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonist, angiotensin II at 50 nm (Fig. 1A, 5th lane (AngII)) only stimulated a modest increase in FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation over base line in confluent IEC-18 cells. We then tested the stimulated FAK tyrosine phosphorylation at residues 397, 576, and 861 in response to increasing osmolarity. Confluent IEC-18 monolayers were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in DMEM alone or DMEM containing increasing concentrations of sorbitol. As shown in Fig. 1B, cell exposure to as little as 100 mm sorbitol for 15 min was sufficient to increase FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-861. To confirm that the band detected in Western blots of whole cell lysates from hyperosmotic sucrose-treated IEC-18 cells was FAK-phosphorylated at Tyr-861, we first immunoprecipitated, with an anti C-terminal FAK antibody (C20), cell lysates from cultures of these cells exposed to DMEM containing 0.45 m sorbitol for 15 min, and then the immunoprecipitates were Western-blotted with the anti-FAK Tyr(P)-861 antibody or C20 antibody. Fig. 1C substantiates that FAK immunoprecipitated from IEC-18 cells stimulated by hyperosmotic stress shows a dramatic increase in FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation (lane 2, top panel). Quantification of phosphorylated FAK species normalized to total FAK from whole cell lysates of IEC-18 cells, under control or after 15 min of hyperosmotic 0.45 m sorbitol (see Fig. 1D), demonstrates that hyperosmotic stress stimulated an ∼5-fold increase in FAK Tyr(P)-861 but did not produce any significant change in FAK phosphorylation at either Tyr-397 or FAK Tyr(P)-576. These data strongly suggest that FAK is phosphorylated preferentially on Tyr-861 under hyperosmotic stress. Hyperosmotic Stress Stimulates FAK Tyr-861 Phosphorylation in Human Colonic (Caco2) and Gastric (NCI-N87) Epithelial Monolayers—Next, we determined whether the striking stimulation of FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation in response to hyperosmotic stress in ileal crypt-derived IEC-18 cells also occurs in other epithelial monolayers, including the highly differentiated human colorectal cancer cell line Caco2 (BBE1 strain) or the well differentiated gastric cancer line NCI-N87. Confluent Caco2 cells were treated with DMEM alone or DMEM containing 0.45 m sucrose for 5 or 15 min. For comparison, parallel cultures were treated with DMEM containing 5 ng/ml heparin-bound epidermal growth factor or 50 nm lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) each for 5 min. As shown in Fig. 2A, basal phosphorylation (1st lane) of FAK Tyr-861 (3rd blot) is negligible in Caco2 monolayers. Hyperosmotic stress induced a marked increase in FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation by 15 min but did not significantly affect phosphorylation of FAK at either Tyr-397 or Tyr-576. Monolayers of NCI-N87 cells were washed twice with DMEM/F12 and then equilibrated at 37 °C for 2 h. They were then incubated a further 30 min in DMEM/F12 alone or DMEM/F12 containing 0.45 m sorbitol. Results shown in Fig. 2B again show that hyperosmotic stress dramatically stimulated FAK Tyr-861 in NCI-N87 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that hyperosmotic stress preferentially stimulates FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-861 in a variety of epithelial cell models. Hyperosmotic Stress Induces FAK Tyr-861 Phosphorylation via Cell Shrinkage—Studies of tyrosine kinase activation by hyperosmotic stress have demonstrated a requirement for an osmotic gradient between the intracellular and extracellular compartments and concomitant cell shrinkage as a result of water efflux from the cells (37Szaszi K. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 38Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32289-32298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We examined whether cell shrinkage was also necessary for FAK Tyr(P)-861 phosphorylation induced by hyperosmotic stress. We compared FAK tyrosine phosphorylation induced by hypertonic urea, which is membrane-permeable, with that induced by hypertonic sucrose or sorbitol, both of which are membrane-nonpermeable. Monolayers of IEC-18 cells were incubated in DMEM or DMEM containing 100 or 450 mm sucrose, DMEM containing 450 mm urea, or DMEM containing 450 mm sorbitol for 15 min. Fig. 3 again shows that FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and Tyr-576 was only modestly increased by the membrane-nonpermeable solutes sucrose and sorbitol at 0.45 m, whereas 0.45 m membrane-permeable urea did not elicit any increase in the phosphorylation of these sites. Sucrose and sorbitol, both at 0.45 m, strongly stimulated FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation, whereas 0.45 m urea diminished FAK phosphorylation at this site. These results indicate that hyperosmotic stress induces FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-861 via cell shrinkage. The Hyperosmotic Stress-induced Phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-861 Is Inhibited by the Selective Src Family Inhibitors PP2 and SU6656—In view of the close functional relationship between Src family kinases and FAK, we determined whether hyperosmotic stress stimulates c-Src kinase activation in IEC-18 cells. Monolayers of these cells were exposed to DMEM alone or DMEM containing various concentrations of sorbitol, sucrose, or urea for 15 min. The cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blot using a phospho-specific antibody to c-Src Tyr-418, which reflects Src kinase activation (40Sun G. Ramdas L. Wang W. Vinci J. McMurray J. Budde R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A, upper panel, shows that 450 mm sucrose or sorbitol, but not urea, induced strong Src Tyr-418 phosphorylation. These results suggest that Src, like FAK, responds to cell shrinkage because of increased extracellular osmolarity. We next tested the role of Src family kinase activity in hyperosmotic stress-induced FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation. Confluent monolayers of IEC-18 cells were pretreated for 30 min in the presence or absence of PP2, a selective Src family inhibitor, or SU6656, another structurally distinct Src family kinase inhibitor. The cells were then exposed to DMEM or DMEM containing 0.45 m sucrose for 15 min in the absence or presence of the corresponding Src kinase inhibitor. As seen in the Western blot in Fig. 4B, 5th and 6th lanes, pretreatment of IEC-18 cells with either of the two distinct selective Src family kinase inhibitors markedly attenuated FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation induced by hyperosmotic sucrose. Hyperosmotic Stress Induces FAK Tyr-861 Phosphorylation in YF but Not SYF Fibroblasts—To substantiate that Src family kinase activity is required for hyperosmotic stress-induced FAK Tyr-861 phosphorylation, we determined hyperosmotic stress-induced FAK tyrosine phosphorylation in the Src/Yes/Fyn-/- (SYF) and Yes/Fyn-/- (YF) fibroblast cell lines (41Klinghoffer R.A.

While other chromogranin A-derived peptides negatively modulate hormone secretion, the role of betagranin in pancreatic β-cells is so far unknown. We have recently shown that pancreatic islet betagranin levels are down-regulated in obese, leptin-deficient mice. In the present study, we have investigated the distribution of betagranin in primary mouse islets and cells of the MIN6 line and have evaluated its effects on insulin secretion. We showed that betagranin co-localizes with insulin within secretory granules and strongly inhibited insulin secretion in response to both glucose and potassium, by blocking the influx of calcium. The data demonstrated a hitherto unknown inhibitory effect of betagranin on insulin secretion.

Betagranin is a 21-kDa peptide of the insulin granule, closely related to chromogranin A (CgA) 4The abbreviations used are: CgA, chromogranin A; KRHB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer; [Ca2+]c, cytosolic calcium concentration; KATP, ATP-dependent potassium channel. 4The abbreviations used are: CgA, chromogranin A; KRHB, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer; [Ca2+]c, cytosolic calcium concentration; KATP, ATP-dependent potassium channel. of the adrenal medulla (1Hutton J.C. Hansen F. Peshavaria M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 188: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It corresponds to the N-terminal fragment of CgA and results from post-translational proteolytic processing (2Hutton J.C. Davidson H.W. Grimaldi K.A. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CgA is an acidic glycoprotein that is ubiquitously expressed in the secretory granules of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells. Secretion of CgA and CgA-derived peptides in response to secretagogues usually parallels the secretion of the resident hormone (3Hendy G.N. Bevan S. Mattei M.G. Mouland A.J. Clin. Invest. Med. 1995; 18: 47-65PubMed Google Scholar). CgA contains multiple sites with two adjacent basic residues that are potential sites for proteolytic processing. The extent of CgA processing is highly tissue-specific (4Watkinson A. Jonsson A.C. Davison M. Young J. Lee C.M. Moore S. Dockray G.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Betagranin is most abundant in parathyroid, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas (5McVicar C.M. Cunningham R.T. Harriott P. Johnston C.F. Buchanan K.D. Curry W.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2001; 13: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the latter tissue, it is derived from CgA by a pathway indistinguishable from that converting proinsulin into insulin (2Hutton J.C. Davidson H.W. Grimaldi K.A. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both betagranin (rat CgA 1–128) and pancreastatin (rat CgA 281–332) are localized within the insulin-containing β-cells, and represent the major and stable end products of CgA processing. Betagranin is released with insulin in response to insulinotropic stimuli, whereas pancreastatin is mainly released in the form of a 45 kDa intermediate, reflecting its slower conversion (6Arden S.D.

The role of betagranin in β-cells is still unknown. Other CgA-derived peptides are thought to function as modulators of endocrine cell secretory activity via autocrine, paracrine, or hormonal mechanisms (7Iacangelo A.L. Eiden L.E. Regul. Pept. 1995; 58: 65-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Feldman S.A. Eiden L.E. Endocr. Pathol. 2003; 14: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Pancreastatin inhibits insulin secretion (9Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchas J.D.

Leptin deficiency results in severe obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia, a syndrome resembling type 2 diabetes. Initially discovered for its central role in hypothalamic regulation of food intake and energy expenditure, meanwhile leptin has also been shown to have multiple peripheral actions (13Houseknecht K.L.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: S152-S158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study investigated the distribution of betagranin in mouse insulin-producing cells and its effects on insulin secretion. Our results demonstrate that betagranin inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting an autocrine negative role in the control of insulin release. Materials—MIN6 cells were obtained from Prof. P. Halban (University of Geneva). The mouse insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Mercodia (Uppsala, Sweden) was used for quantification of secreted insulin. A detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad) was used to quantify the amount of total protein in samples. Endotoxin levels were measured using the kinetic chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate test from Charles River Endosafe (Kent, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit antiserum raised against a C-terminal synthetic betagranin peptide (CAE VPS RDT ME) was obtained from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Rabbit anti-calreticulin antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. K. H. Krause (Geneva University Hospital). Mice Treatment—Wild-type female C57BL/6 mice and C57Bl/6 lep/lep mice were given a standard diet (B+K Universal, Hull, UK) and water ad libitum. Groups of six mice were injected (intraperitoneal) daily during 10 days with 1 mg/kg body weight recombinant mouse leptin (PeproTech, London). Controls received 10 ml/kg body weight saline. Food intake and bodyweight were measured daily. Mice were killed with an overdose of carbon dioxide. Pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion as described in Ref. 17Pallett A.L. Morton N.M. Cawthorne M.A. Emilsson V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar. Islets were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until analysis. All animal studies were approved by the local ethical review committee and were carried out in accordance with the United Kingdom government regulations and the National Institutes of Health guidelines on the care and welfare of laboratory animals. Isolation of Pancreatic Islets—lslets of Langerhans were isolated from control C57Bl/6 mice by collagenase digestion and Ficoll purification, as described previously (21Meda P. Bosco D. Chanson M. Giordano E. Vallar L. Wollheim C. Orci L. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The freshly isolated islets were immediately fixed for either immunofluorescence or immunoelectron microscopy, as described below. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were either stained with the fluorescent stain Deep Purple (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) or transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). For Western blot analysis, anti-betagranin (1:2000) and anti-calreticulin (1:5000) polyclonal rabbit antibodies were used. Horse-radish-peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000) was used as secondary antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Roche Applied Science). For protein identification by mass spectrometry, bands were excised from Deep Purple-stained SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed using a 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) as described in Ref. 23Scherl A.

Methods. 2005; 60: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. Cell Culture—MIN6 cells (passage 11–21) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 71 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Cells were passaged and harvested using trypsin/EDTA. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Immunoelectron Microscopy—For immunolabeling, pellets of freshly trypsinized cells and isolated pancreatic islets were washed twice in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and fixed 5 min at room temperature in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and then 60 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (all fixatives diluted in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). The cells were washed three times in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, embedded in 12% (w/v) gelatin, and cooled on ice. Small blocs of gelatin-embedded cells were infused with 2.3 m sucrose, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned with a cryoultramicrotome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), as reported previously (24Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 25Bosco D. Meda P. Morel P. Matthey-Doret D. Caille D. Toso C. Buhler L.H. Berney T. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Single immunolabeling for betagranin was carried out using a rabbit polyclonal serum (Eurogentec) diluted 1:50, and revealed with a goat anti-rabbit IgG serum coupled to 10 nm gold particles diluted 1:20 (British Biocell International, Cardiff, Wales). Double immunolabeling for betagranin and insulin was performed using the conditions described above plus a mouse monoclonal against insulin (courtesy of Dr. M. J. Storch), diluted 1:100, and revealed with a goat anti-mouse IgG serum coupled to 15-nm gold and diluted 1:20 (British Biocell International). Controls included exposure of the sections to only the gold-conjugated goat antibodies against either rabbit or mouse IgGs, whichever appropriate. None of these incubations resulted in a sizable, specific staining of the sections. All cryosections were screened and photographed in a CM10 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Immunofluorescence—MIN6 and pancreatic islets were fixed for 60 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, washed three times in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and processed for immunofluorescence labeling as previously described (26Calabrese A. Zhang M. Serre-Beinier W. Caton D. Mas C. Satin L.S. Meda P. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), using the same antibodies against betagranin and insulin described above for immunoelectron microscopy, but now diluted 1:100 and 1:400, respectively. As secondary antibodies, we used a goat antibody against rabbit IgGs coupled to Texas Red and diluted 1:200 and a rabbit antibody against mouse IgGs coupled to fluorescein and diluted 1:200, respectively. Controls included exposure of the cells and islet sections to only the secondary appropriate antibody. None of these incubations resulted in a sizable, specific staining of the sections. Immunolabelings were screened and photographed using a LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss). Recombinant Mouse Betagranin—Betagranin (mouse CgA 1–133) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with a N-terminal His-tag placed in front of a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site (27Wang H. Tiirola M.A. Puhakka J.A. Kulomaa M.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Nickel affinity-purified betagranin was renatured by dialysis in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione (28Andrades J.A. Wu L.T. Hall F.L. Nimni M.E. Becerra J. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For removal of the His-tag, betagranin was cleaved with His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Betagranin was then purified by subtractive nickel affinity chromatography followed by an anion exchange Q column (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). An aliquot of purified recombinant betagranin was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of phosphate-buffered saline. Insulin Secretion Assay—For static measurements of insulin release, MIN6 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells per well in 24-well cell culture plates. After 3 days of culture, cells were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRHB: 125 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 2.8 mm glucose. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in KRHB containing 2.8 mm glucose, followed by a second 1-h incubation in KRHB containing either 2.8 or 25 mm glucose or 50 mm potassium in the absence or presence of various concentrations of recombinant betagranin. The supernatant was recovered and the amount of insulin quantified by mouse insulin ELISA. Insulin secretion was expressed as percentage of the first 1-h basal insulin secretion of the corresponding well. For time course analysis, aliquots of 5 μl were taken from the supernatant during the second 1-h incubation period after 5, 10, and 60 min. In initial experiments, the total protein content of MIN6 cells in each well at the end of the static incubation was measured to show equal cell load and growth. Cell viability for each well was measured to demonstrate the absence of cell toxicity linked to betagranin exposure. Measurements of Cytosolic Calcium Concentrations—MIN6 cells (seeding density: 1 × 106/2 ml) were grown on glass coverslips (diameter: 25 mm) for 3 days. After preincubation for 2 h at 37 °C in KRHB containing 2.8 mm glucose, cells were loaded with 2 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in KRHB containing 2.8 mm glucose for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, placed in a thermostatic chamber (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) at 37 °C, and equilibrated for 5 min in KRHB containing 2.8 mm glucose. Cells were incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of 125 nm betagranin. Then, cells were first stimulated with 16.7 mm glucose, followed by 16.7 mm glucose supplemented with 20 mm KCl. For the above incubations, betagranin and secretagogues were added to the medium via a pipette. Finally, cells were washed by perfusion of the chamber with KRHB containing 2.8 mm glucose using a gravity feed inlet and a peristaltic pump outlet and stimulated as above. Cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]c) were monitored as described in Ref. 29Frieden M. James D. Castelbou C. Danckaert A. Martinou J.C. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22704-22714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were imaged on an Axiovert S100 TV microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Feldbach, Switzerland) and alternatively excited at 340 and 380 nm. Fluorescence emission at 510 nm was detected using a cooled, 16-bit, CCD back-illuminated frame transfer camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). Image acquisition and analysis were performed with the Metafluor 6.2 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Glucose- and potassium-induced changes in [Ca2+]c were quantified by averaging the ratios of the fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm of the most intense peak of each trace minus its base line (2.8 mm glucose) value. Insulin Secretion from Perfused Pancreas—Pancreases from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared and perfused as described (30Grodsky G.M. Fanska R.E. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 39: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Pancreases were perfused with a buffer (113 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm KCl, 2.3 mm calcium gluconate, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 29 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, 3% (w/v) dextran, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) containing 2.8 mm glucose for 40 min. The perfusate was introduced at 4.5 ml/min via the celiac artery, the portal vein serving as the outlet. Pancreases were perfused then subjected to the experimental protocol so that they received sequentially, perfusion buffer plus 2.8 mm glucose for 20 min, 5.6 mm glucose for 10 min, 5.6 mm glucose plus 10 nm betagranin for 10 min, 5.6 mm glucose for 10 min, 16.7 mm glucose for 10 min, 16.7 mm glucose plus 10 nm beta-granin for 10 min, 16.7 mm glucose for 10 min, and 5.6 mm glucose for 10 min. Samples of effluent were collected every minute and stored at -20 °C until assayed for insulin content by radioimmunoassay. Betagranin Is Decreased in Pancreatic Islets of lep/lep Mice and Restored upon Leptin Treatment—By Western blot analysis, we found that betagranin was strongly decreased in islets of lep/lep mice compared with lean controls (Fig. 1A). Treatment of the leptin-deficient mice with mouse leptin for 10 days resulted in a markedly reduced food intake and bodyweight compared with those of the saline treated mice (data not shown). These changes were paralleled by restoration of control betagranin levels in lep/lep mice. Betagranin Co-localizes with Insulin in Pancreatic Islets— Immunolabeling of ultrathin cryosections showed that both betagranin (Fig. 1B) and insulin were expressed in large dense core secretory granules (Fig. 1C). However, while insulin was detected throught the dense core crystal of the granules (Fig. 1B), betagranin immunoreactivity was most abundant at its periphery (Fig. 1C). Dual immunolabeling using gold particles of different size confirmed that betagranin (as assessed by small particles) and insulin (as assessed by large particles) co-localized within the very same secretory granules (Fig. 1D). Double immunofluorescence labeling further showed that the co-localization of betagranin and insulin could be observed in virtually all β-cells of isolated mouse islets (Fig. 1, E–G). Betagranin Is Expressed in MIN6 Cells and Co-localizes with Insulin—Following incubation in 25 mm glucose, Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of betagranin in total MIN6 cell lysates and culture supernatants (Fig. 2). Betagranin secretion from MIN6 cells was modulated by glucose as shown by the lack of immunodetectable protein in supernatants of cultures in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose. MIN6 cell lysates also featured a band at the apparent molecular weight of ∼90 kDa, representing chromogranin A, the precursor of betagranin. Immunolabeling of ultrathin cryosections showed that betagranin immunoreactivity was confined to cell compartments that also contained insulin, including Golgi apparatus (Fig. 3A), as well as immature (Fig. 3A) and mature secretory granules (Fig. 3, B and C). In the latter type of granules, where betagranin was most abundant, the protein was found localized at the periphery of the dense core formed by the insulin-Zn2+ crystals (Fig. 3B), a location that became more apparent where only betagranin was immunolabeled using antibodies conjugated to small diameter gold particles (Fig. 3C). In contrast, no labeling was observed over nuclei, mitochondria and cell membranes (Fig. 3A). Double immunofluorescence labeling further showed that the co-localization of betagranin and insulin could be observed in virtually all cells of monolayer MIN6 cultures (Fig. 3, D–F). Double immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the co-localization of betagranin and insulin in MIN6 (Fig. 3, D–F). Recombinant Betagranin—The expression of betagranin with a His-tag in E. coli allowed for an efficient purification of the protein. The integrity of the N terminus after proteolytic cleavage of the His-tag was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing (data not shown). The purified protein preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). A major band was observed at the apparent molecular mass expected for betagranin (21 kDa). Two minor bands around 45 and 66 kDa were also observed. Analysis by tandem mass spectrometry identified all three bands as betagranin (data not shown), indicating that the major band is the betagranin monomer and that the two minor bands correspond to betagranin dimers and trimers, respectively. Western blot analysis with anti-betagranin antibodies revealed the same oligomeric pattern (Fig. 4B). The endotoxin concentration in the protein preparation was 0.2 ng/ml as determined by the limulus amebocyte lysate test. Betagranin Inhibits Insulin Secretion in MIN6 Cells—Exposure of MIN6 cultures to recombinant betagranin significantly reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in a dose-dependent manner over a 1-hour period (Fig. 5A). Betagranin at the concentration of 125 nm inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release by ∼75%. Moreover, when betagranin was washed out from the medium after a 30-min incubation, MIN6 cells regained normal glucose responsiveness (data not shown). 125 nm betagranin inhibited potassium-stimulated insulin release by ∼70% (Fig. 5B). In contrast, betagranin did not affect basal insulin secretion (Fig. 5C). To investigate the dynamic of the inhibitory effect of beta-granin, a time course analysis was performed. Fig. 6 shows the time-dependent effect of betagranin on stimulated insulin secretion. At the concentration of 125 nm, betagranin significantly reduced both glucose- and potassium-stimulated insulin release by roughly 40% already after 5 min. This effect remained stable after 10 min and significantly increased after 60 min. The inhibitory activity of betagranin was not affected by dialysis of the protein (data not shown). Betagranin Inhibits the Calcium Response of MIN6 Cells— The Ca2+ response to glucose and potassium was examined in control cells and in cells exposed to 125 nm betagranin (Fig. 7A). Control cells showed oscillations of [Ca2+]c upon elevation of the glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16.7 mm, whereas cells exposed to betagranin only slightly increased their [Ca2+]c until a plateau was reached. Here, [Ca2+]c oscillations were never observed. Stimulation by potassium induced a rapid and strong transient elevation in [Ca2+]c in control cells. In the presence of betagranin, a more sustained but much lower increase in [Ca2+]c was observed. The quantitative analysis of 30 traces from three independent experiments shown in Fig. 7B demonstrated that betagranin strongly inhibits glucose- and potassium-stimulated calcium influx in MIN6 cells. In addition, when betagranin was washed out via perfusion of the chamber, the cells exhibited a close to normal calcium response toward glucose and potassium (data not shown). Betagranin Inhibits Insulin Secretion in the Perfused Pancreas—Isolated rat pancreases were perfused with a low (5.6 mm) and a high (16.7 mm) glucose containing buffer in the absence and presence of 10 nm betagranin. As shown in Fig. 8, when perfused with glucose alone, the pancreas showed the normal increase in insulin release with increasing glucose concentrations. Furthermore, insulin output readily decreased when glucose was lowered at the end of the experiment. During the addition of betagranin to the perfusate, insulin levels rapidly dropped irrespectively of whether insulin output was stimulated by 5.6 or 16.7 mm glucose. This effect was fully reversible. As evaluated by measuring the areas under the curve, betagranin reduced insulin secretion by ∼60% under stimulation by 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 8B). The N-terminal sequence of CgA, which encodes betagranin, is highly conserved among species, suggesting an important, specific biological function (8Feldman S.A. Eiden L.E. Endocr. Pathol. 2003; 14: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells, betagranin is produced via the post-translational proteolytic processing of CgA and is co-secreted with insulin in response to insulinotropic stimuli. Still, betagranin role in β-cells has remained unknown so far. Using a proteomic approach, Sanchez et al. (12Sanchez J.C. Converset V. Nolan A. Schmid G. Wang S. Heller M. Sennitt M.V. Hochstrasser D.F. Cawthorne M.A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the levels of betagranin in pancreatic islets are significantly down-regulated in leptin-deficient lep/lep mice compared with wild-type mice, a finding that prompted the present study on the distribution and secretory effects of the peptide. Using Western blot analysis, we confirmed the down-regulation of betagranin in pancreatic islets of lep/lep mice. Moreover, we showed that treatment of leptin-deficient mice with leptin completely restored normal betagranin levels. Using nanomolar concentrations of recombinant betagranin, we demonstrated that the peptide strongly inhibits insulin secretion of MIN6 cells, in response to both glucose and potassium. A comparable effect was also observed in an in vitro perfused rat pancreas model, consistent with the inhibitory role of other CgA-derived fragments on the secretion of insulin and other hormones (8Feldman S.A. Eiden L.E. Endocr. Pathol. 2003; 14: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchas J.D. Nature. 1986; 324: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 31Drees B.M. Rouse J. Johnson J. Hamilton J.W. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3381-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For technical reasons, our experiments tested a recombinant mouse betagranin in a mouse cell line and in the rat pancreas, limiting the comparison between the two models. However, the very high homology between mouse and rat betagranin (90% amino acid identity) probably legitimates this approach. Another issue is raised by our use of recombinant betagranin. We investigated the activity of this protein by measuring its endotoxin contaminants. At the highest betagranin concentration used in our secretion assays (125 nm), we found that the endotoxin concentration was 4000-fold lower than that reported to have an effect on insulin secretion (32Vives-Pi M. Somoza N. Fernandez-Alvarez J. Vargas F. Caro P. Alba A. Gomis R. Labeta M.O. Pujol-Borrell R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 133: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dialysis did not affect the activity of betagranin, thereby excluding that the secretory effects we observed were due to small molecular weight molecules. Eventually, betagranin wash out experiments demonstrated the reversibility of the inhibitory effect of betagranin in both MIN6 cell cultures and the perfused pancreas, indicating that betagranin inhibited insulin secretion without compromising cell viability. In static incubation experiments, betagranin inhibited both glucose- and potassium-stimulated insulin secretion, indicating that it did not interfere with either glucose uptake or the production of metabolic coupling factors required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, the inhibitory effect of the peptide was rapid in both MIN6 cell cultures and in the perfused pancreas. The rapidity of the inhibitory effect and its reversibility suggest that betagranin binds to the β-cell surface, possibly on ATP-dependent potassium channels (KATP) and/or on voltage-dependent calcium channels of the L-type. An effect on KATP channels, which may be maintained in an opened configuration by betagranin, would interfere with β-cell depolarization, thus explaining the observed inhibition of calcium influx in MIN6 and, consequently, the inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Upon stimulation with high potassium, an effect on voltage-dependent calcium channels would be required. Such an effect is supported by recent studies with betagranin/vasostatin-derived small synthetic peptides, which have shown that the peptides exert negative inotropic effects in the isolated frog and rat heart (33Ghia J.E. Crenner F. Rohr S. Meyer C. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Aunis D. Angel F. Regul. Pept. 2004; 121: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Tota B. Mazza R. Angelone T. Nullans G. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Aunis D. Helle K.B. Regul. Pept. 2003; 114: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Cerra M.C. De Iuri L. Angelone T. Corti A. Tota B. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2006; 101: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), probably via an action of the peptides on L-type calcium channels. A further mechanism involving a specific membrane receptor, as it has been shown for other physiological inhibitors of insulin secretion (36Sharp G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is also conceivable for betagranin. Although high affinity binding sites have been reported on parathyroid cells (37Russell J. Gee P. Liu S.M. Angeletti R.H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and on calf aortic smooth muscle cells (11Angeletti R.H. Aardal S. Serck-Hanssen G. Gee P. Helle K.B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1994; 152: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), classical betagranin/vasostatin receptors remain to be identified in β-cells. Alternatively, it has been proposed that betagranin/vasostatin exerts its biological activity by hydrophobic binding to membrane phospholipids and thereby perturbing the structural microenvironment required for the proper functioning of classical membrane receptors (38Maget-Dana R. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Helle K.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 971: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Blois A. Holmsen H. Martino G. Corti A. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Helle K.B. Regul. Pept. 2006; 134: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on the inhibition of insulin secretion we observed, these membrane receptors could be those for other known physiological inhibitors of insulin secretion (36Sharp G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1781-C1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and betagranin could affect their calcium channel gating properties. Alternatively, it is conceivable that betagranin interacts with the plasma membrane and directly affects the proper functioning of calcium channels. It remains to be analyzed whether the reported effects on the plasma membrane microenvironment show a time course and reversibility that is compatible with the inhibitory effect of betagranin on insulin secretion. At any rate, our results clearly demonstrate an inhibitory effect of recombinant betagranin on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro, raising the question of whether such an effect is likely to represent the action of endogenous betagranin in vivo. First, we definitively demonstrate the presence of endogenous betagranin within secretory granules of pancreatic islets and MIN6 cells and show that betagranin co-localizes there with insulin. Second, we confirmed that endogenous betagranin is secreted by β-cells in response to glucose. Third, we document that nanomolar concentrations of recombinant betagranin inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion. Even though the concentrations we tested are slightly higher than the plasma concentrations of chromogranin A measured in healthy individuals (40Stridsberg M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 482: 319-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the presumably higher intra-islet concentrations are those which, most likely, are relevant to account for the inhibition of secretion. While the intra-islet concentrations of betagranin are not known, they may be estimated to reach values in the nanomolar range just after exocytosis. The perfused pancreas is considered as a model that mimics physiologic conditions more closely than cultures of MIN6 cells. In this model, inhibition of second phase secretion was achieved with concentrations of betagranin ∼10-fold lowered than those that were used in static incubations of MIN6 cells. In addition, preliminary experiments have also shown slight inhibition of first phase insulin secretion (data not shown). The latter needs further confirmation and validation to understand the precise mechanisms of action and was beyond the scope of this study. These features, and the fact that the N-terminal sequence of CgA, which encodes betagranin, is highly conserved among species, suggest that betagranin may represent an autocrine negative-feedback loop controlling insulin release of β-cells. A similar mechanism has been described for the highly conserved C-terminal CgA fragments catestatin and parastatin in catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla and in the secretion of parathyroid hormone from the parathyroid glands (41Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 42Fasciotto B.H. Trauss C.A. Greeley G.H. Cohn D.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In our experiments, recombinant betagranin was added to the incubation medium. Although this setting favors a mechanism of action via a target on the β-cell surface, the experiments do not rule out the possibility that endogenous, intracellular betagranin may inhibit the exocytosis of insulin-containing granules by virtue of its localization within these organelles. Interestingly, the expression of betagranin within pancreatic islets was modulated by leptin (Fig. 1A). The decrease in beta-granin expression in leptin-deficient lep/lep mice could indirectly result from a generalized leptin insufficiency and its associated metabolic abnormalities. Alternatively, leptin could promote betagranin expression via direct actions on the β-cell. The analysis of the actual mechanism involved was beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that betagranin contributes to the inhibitory action of leptin on insulin secretion (12Sanchez J.C. Converset V. Nolan A. Schmid G. Wang S. Heller M. Sennitt M.V. Hochstrasser D.F. Cawthorne M.A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence suggests a direct effect of leptin on β-cell insulin secretion. Thus, leptin has been reported to inhibit insulin secretion from tumor-derived β-cell lines (15Kulkarni R.N. Wang Z.L. Wang R.M. Hurley J.D. Smith D.M. Ghatei M.A. Withers D.J. Gardiner J.V. Bailey C.J. Bloom S.R. J. Clin.

Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 2001; 25: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Leptin-mediated activation of KATP channels and phosphodiesterase 3B, as well as reduction in glucose transport, has been demonstrated (43Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Leech C.A. Holz G.G. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1087-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 46Harvey J. McKenna F. Herson P.S. Spanswick D. Ashford M.L. J.

Cheung A.T. Riedel M.J. Light P.E. Cheeseman C.I. Kieffer T.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). While these appear to be acute effect of leptin, the modulation of betagranin expression by leptin may represent a more long term effect. In conclusion, betagranin is a consistent component of insulin-containing secretory granules, and recombinant betagranin is a potent inhibitor of glucose-stimulated insulin. The rapidity and the reversibility of the inhibitory effect on the one hand, and the reversible blocking of the MIN6 calcium response on the other hand, suggest an effect of the peptide on some ion channels of the β-cell surface. Because betagranin is naturally secreted by β-cells, the inhibition of insulin secretion by endogenous betagranin may represent an additional autocrine negative feedback loop whereby insulin release from β-cells is controlled.
