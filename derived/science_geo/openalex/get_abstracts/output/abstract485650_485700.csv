https://openalex.org/W2046271789,"A committed precursor to innate lymphoid cell lineages, but not classical natural killer and lymphoid tissue inducer cells, is derived from common lymphoid precursors and distinguished by high levels of expression of the transcription factor PLZF. Knowledge of the developmental pathways and lineage relationships of the precursors to innate lymphocytes is important because these cells serve key protective functions in infection and homeostasis at mucosal barriers, and because of their crosstalk with epithelium and microbiota. This study identifies a committed common lymphoid-derived precursor to innate lymphoid cell (ILC) lineages. The progenitor cells, termed ILCPs (innate lymphoid cell precursors), are distinct from classical natural killer (NK) and lymphoid tissue inducer cells, thus demonstrating that similar functional programs arise independently in different lineages of innate lymphocytes. The findings also imply the presence of highly specialized innate lymphoid lineages within what was previously regarded as a broader NK-cell population. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) specialize in the rapid secretion of polarized sets of cytokines and chemokines to combat infection and promote tissue repair at mucosal barriers1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Their diversity and similarities with previously characterized natural killer (NK) cells and lymphoid tissue inducers (LTi) have prompted a provisional classification of all innate lymphocytes into groups 1, 2 and 3 solely on the basis of cytokine properties10, but their developmental pathways and lineage relationships remain elusive. Here we identify and characterize a novel subset of lymphoid precursors in mouse fetal liver and adult bone marrow that transiently express high amounts of PLZF, a transcription factor previously associated with NK T cell development11,12, by using lineage tracing and transfer studies. PLZFhigh cells were committed ILC progenitors with multiple ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 potential at the clonal level. They excluded classical LTi and NK cells, but included a peculiar subset of NK1.1+DX5− ‘NK-like’ cells residing in the liver. Deletion of PLZF markedly altered the development of several ILC subsets, but not LTi or NK cells. PLZFhigh precursors also expressed high amounts of ID2 and GATA3, as well as TOX, a known regulator of PLZF-independent NK and LTi lineages13. These findings establish novel lineage relationships between ILC, NK and LTi cells, and identify the common precursor to ILCs, termed ILCP. They also reveal the broad, defining role of PLZF in the differentiation of innate lymphocytes."

TDP-43 is a major component of the cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and some types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The importance of TDP-43 in disease is underscored by the fact that dominant missense mutations are sufficient to cause disease, although the role of TDP-43 in pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic mRNP granules that undergo bidirectional, microtubule-dependent transport in neurons in vitro and in vivo and facilitate delivery of target mRNA to distal neuronal compartments. TDP-43 mutations impair this mRNA transport function in vivo and in vitro, including in stem cell-derived motor neurons from ALS patients bearing any one of three different TDP-43 ALS-causing mutations. Thus, TDP-43 mutations that cause ALS lead to partial loss of a novel cytoplasmic function of TDP-43."
https://openalex.org/W2129299900,"There is accumulating neural evidence to support the existence of two distinct systems for guiding action selection, a deliberative “model-based” and a reflexive “model-free” system. However, little is known about how the brain determines which of these systems controls behavior at one moment in time. We provide evidence for an arbitration mechanism that allocates the degree of control over behavior by model-based and model-free systems as a function of the reliability of their respective predictions. We show that the inferior lateral prefrontal and frontopolar cortex encode both reliability signals and the output of a comparison between those signals, implicating these regions in the arbitration process. Moreover, connectivity between these regions and model-free valuation areas is negatively modulated by the degree of model-based control in the arbitrator, suggesting that arbitration may work through modulation of the model-free valuation system when the arbitrator deems that the model-based system should drive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2092418241,"Global maps constructed using climate-change velocities to derive spatial trajectories for climatic niches between 1960 and 2100 show past and future shifts in ecological climate niches; properties of these trajectories are used to infer changes in species distributions, and thus identify areas that will act as climate sources and sinks, and geographical barriers to species migrations. To survive in a changing climate, a species may need to move in order to stay in an area with a constant average temperature. Such mobility would depend on an ability to keep pace with a moving climate — and on the absence of physical barriers to migration. These authors use the velocity of climate change to construct a global map of how ecological climate niches have shifted in recent decades and go on to predict changes in species distribution to the end of this century. The map indicates areas that will act as climate sources and sinks, and geographical barriers likely to impede species migration. The data show that geographical connections and physical barriers — mostly coasts — have profound effects on the expected ability of organisms to track their preferred climate. This work underlines the importance of migration corridors linking warmer and cooler areas as a means of maintaining biodiversity. The reorganization of patterns of species diversity driven by anthropogenic climate change, and the consequences for humans1, are not yet fully understood or appreciated2,3. Nevertheless, changes in climate conditions are useful for predicting shifts in species distributions at global4 and local scales5. Here we use the velocity of climate change6,7 to derive spatial trajectories for climatic niches from 1960 to 2009 (ref. 7) and from 2006 to 2100, and use the properties of these trajectories to infer changes in species distributions. Coastlines act as barriers and locally cooler areas act as attractors for trajectories, creating source and sink areas for local climatic conditions. Climate source areas indicate where locally novel conditions are not connected to areas where similar climates previously occurred, and are thereby inaccessible to climate migrants tracking isotherms: 16% of global surface area for 1960 to 2009, and 34% of ocean for the ‘business as usual’ climate scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5)8 representing continued use of fossil fuels without mitigation. Climate sink areas are where climate conditions locally disappear, potentially blocking the movement of climate migrants. Sink areas comprise 1.0% of ocean area and 3.6% of land and are prevalent on coasts and high ground. Using this approach to infer shifts in species distributions gives global and regional maps of the expected direction and rate of shifts of climate migrants, and suggests areas of potential loss of species richness."

https://openalex.org/W2030194678,"Most cases of neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic, hindering the use of genetic mouse models to analyze disease mechanisms. Focusing on the motor neuron (MN) disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we therefore devised a fully humanized coculture model composed of human adult primary sporadic ALS (sALS) astrocytes and human embryonic stem-cell-derived MNs. The model reproduces the cardinal features of human ALS: sALS astrocytes, but not those from control patients, trigger selective death of MNs. The mechanisms underlying this non-cell-autonomous toxicity were investigated in both astrocytes and MNs. Although causal in familial ALS (fALS), SOD1 does not contribute to the toxicity of sALS astrocytes. Death of MNs triggered by either sALS or fALS astrocytes occurs through necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis involving receptor-interacting protein 1 and the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. The necroptotic pathway therefore constitutes a potential therapeutic target for this incurable disease."
https://openalex.org/W2018133573,"The element abundance ratios of four low-mass stars with extremely low metallicities indicate that the gas out of which the stars formed was enriched in each case by at most a few, and potentially only one low-energy, supernova. Such supernovae yield large quantities of light elements such as carbon but very little iron. The dominance of low-energy supernovae is surprising, because it has been expected that the first stars were extremely massive, and that they disintegrated in pair-instability explosions that would rapidly enrich galaxies in iron. What has remained unclear is the yield of iron from the first supernovae, because hitherto no star is unambiguously interpreted as encapsulating the yield of a single supernova. Here we report the optical spectrum of SMSS J031300.36- 670839.3, which shows no evidence of iron (with an upper limit of 10^-7.1 times solar abundance). Based on a comparison of its abundance pattern with those of models, we conclude that the star was seeded with material from a single supernova with an original mass of ~60 Mo (and that the supernova left behind a black hole). Taken together with the previously mentioned low-metallicity stars, we conclude that low-energy supernovae were common in the early Universe, and that such supernovae yield light element enrichment with insignificant iron. Reduced stellar feedback both chemically and mechanically from low-energy supernovae would have enabled first-generation stars to form over an extended period. We speculate that such stars may perhaps have had an important role in the epoch of cosmic reionization and the chemical evolution of early galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W1994975196,"Human populations have undergone major changes in population size in the past 100,000 years, including recent rapid growth. How these demographic events have affected the burden of deleterious mutations in individuals and the frequencies of disease mutations in populations remains unclear. We use population genetic models to show that recent human demography has probably had little impact on the average burden of deleterious mutations. This prediction is supported by two exome sequence data sets showing that individuals of west African and European ancestry carry very similar burdens of damaging mutations. We further show that for many diseases, rare alleles are unlikely to contribute a large fraction of the heritable variation, and therefore the impact of recent growth is likely to be modest. However, for those diseases that have a direct impact on fitness, strongly deleterious rare mutations probably do have an important role, and recent growth will have increased their impact."
https://openalex.org/W1989872688,"Oligonucleotides are designed to target RNA using base pairing rules, but they can be hampered by poor cellular delivery and nonspecific stimulation of the immune system. Small molecules are preferred as lead drugs or probes but cannot be designed from sequence. Herein, we describe an approach termed Inforna that designs lead small molecules for RNA from solely sequence. Inforna was applied to all human microRNA hairpin precursors, and it identified bioactive small molecules that inhibit biogenesis by binding nuclease-processing sites (44% hit rate). Among 27 lead interactions, the most avid interaction is between a benzimidazole (1) and precursor microRNA-96. Compound 1 selectively inhibits biogenesis of microRNA-96, upregulating a protein target (FOXO1) and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Apoptosis is ablated when FOXO1 mRNA expression is knocked down by an siRNA, validating compound selectivity. Markedly, microRNA profiling shows that 1 only affects microRNA-96 biogenesis and is at least as selective as an oligonucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1974548955,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) detect extracellular protons produced during inflammation or ischemic injury and belong to the superfamily of degenerin/epithelial sodium channels. Here, we determine the cocrystal structure of chicken ASIC1a with MitTx, a pain-inducing toxin from the Texas coral snake, to define the structure of the open state of ASIC1a. In the MitTx-bound open state and in the previously determined low-pH desensitized state, TM2 is a discontinuous α helix in which the Gly-Ala-Ser selectivity filter adopts an extended, belt-like conformation, swapping the cytoplasmic one-third of TM2 with an adjacent subunit. Gly 443 residues of the selectivity filter provide a ring of three carbonyl oxygen atoms with a radius of ∼3.6 Å, presenting an energetic barrier for hydrated ions. The ASIC1a-MitTx complex illuminates the mechanism of MitTx action, defines the structure of the selectivity filter of voltage-independent, sodium-selective ion channels, and captures the open state of an ASIC."
https://openalex.org/W1999359706,"This study shows that activation of cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors in the olfactory bulb increases odor detection and food intake in hungry mice. The authors show that this function is mediated by CB1-dependent attenuation of excitatory corticofugal synaptic transmission onto inhibitory granule cells and disinhibition of mitral cells in the main olfactory bulb. Hunger arouses sensory perception, eventually leading to an increase in food intake, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We found that cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors promote food intake in fasted mice by increasing odor detection. CB1 receptors were abundantly expressed on axon terminals of centrifugal cortical glutamatergic neurons that project to inhibitory granule cells of the main olfactory bulb (MOB). Local pharmacological and genetic manipulations revealed that endocannabinoids and exogenous cannabinoids increased odor detection and food intake in fasted mice by decreasing excitatory drive from olfactory cortex areas to the MOB. Consistently, cannabinoid agonists dampened in vivo optogenetically stimulated excitatory transmission in the same circuit. Our data indicate that cortical feedback projections to the MOB crucially regulate food intake via CB1 receptor signaling, linking the feeling of hunger to stronger odor processing. Thus, CB1 receptor–dependent control of cortical feedback projections in olfactory circuits couples internal states to perception and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2042411936,"Delivery of HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies by adeno-associated virus vectors—termed vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP)—has been shown to protect mice or macaques from intravenous infection by HIV or SIV, respectively. David Baltimore and colleagues now report that VIP is also effective at preventing HIV infection after vaginal challenge in humanized mice, suggesting that the approach might limit mucosal transmission between humans. The vast majority of new HIV infections result from relatively inefficient transmission1,2 of the virus across mucosal surfaces during sexual intercourse3. A consequence of this inefficiency is that small numbers of transmitted founder viruses initiate most heterosexual infections4. This natural bottleneck to transmission has stimulated efforts to develop interventions that are aimed at blocking this step of the infection process5. Despite the promise of this strategy, clinical trials of preexposure prophylaxis have had limited degrees of success in humans, in part because of lack of adherence to the recommended preexposure treatment regimens6,7. In contrast, a number of existing vaccines elicit systemic immunity that protects against mucosal infections, such as the vaccines for influenza8 and human papilloma virus9. We recently demonstrated the ability of vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP) to prevent intravenous transmission of HIV in humanized mice using broadly neutralizing antibodies10. Here we demonstrate that VIP is capable of protecting humanized mice from intravenous as well as vaginal challenge with diverse HIV strains despite repeated exposures. Moreover, animals receiving VIP that expresses a modified VRC07 antibody were completely resistant to repetitive intravaginal challenge by a heterosexually transmitted founder HIV strain11, suggesting that VIP may be effective in preventing vaginal transmission of HIV between humans."
https://openalex.org/W2006814548,"Recent modeling of spike-timing-dependent plasticity indicates that plasticity involves as a third factor a local dendritic potential, besides pre- and postsynaptic firing times. We present a simple compartmental neuron model together with a non-Hebbian, biologically plausible learning rule for dendritic synapses where plasticity is modulated by these three factors. In functional terms, the rule seeks to minimize discrepancies between somatic firings and a local dendritic potential. Such prediction errors can arise in our model from stochastic fluctuations as well as from synaptic input, which directly targets the soma. Depending on the nature of this direct input, our plasticity rule subserves supervised or unsupervised learning. When a reward signal modulates the learning rate, reinforcement learning results. Hence a single plasticity rule supports diverse learning paradigms."

https://openalex.org/W2078663366,"During early development of female mouse embryos, both X chromosomes are transiently active. X gene dosage is then equalized between the sexes through the process of X chromosome inactivation (XCI). Whether the double dose of X-linked genes in females compared with males leads to sex-specific developmental differences has remained unclear. Using embryonic stem cells with distinct sex chromosome compositions as a model system, we show that two X chromosomes stabilize the naive pluripotent state by inhibiting MAPK and Gsk3 signaling and stimulating the Akt pathway. Since MAPK signaling is required to exit the pluripotent state, differentiation is paused in female cells as long as both X chromosomes are active. By preventing XCI or triggering it precociously, we demonstrate that this differentiation block is released once XX cells have undergone X inactivation. We propose that double X dosage interferes with differentiation, thus ensuring a tight coupling between X chromosome dosage compensation and development."
https://openalex.org/W2023365921,"We present a method to label and trace the lineage of multiple neural progenitors simultaneously in vertebrate animals via multiaddressable genome-integrative color (MAGIC) markers. We achieve permanent expression of combinatorial labels from new Brainbow transgenes introduced in embryonic neural progenitors with electroporation of transposon vectors. In the mouse forebrain and chicken spinal cord, this approach allows us to track neural progenitor's descent during pre- and postnatal neurogenesis or perinatal gliogenesis in long-term experiments. Color labels delineate cytoarchitecture, resolve spatially intermixed clones, and specify the lineage of astroglial subtypes and adult neural stem cells. Combining colors and subcellular locations provides an expanded marker palette to individualize clones. We show that this approach is also applicable to modulate specific signaling pathways in a mosaic manner while color-coding the status of individual cells regarding induced molecular perturbations. This method opens new avenues for clonal and functional analysis in varied experimental models and contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2134324976,"Expression of Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) can reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) can also be used for reprogramming, suggesting that factors present in oocytes could potentially augment OSKM-mediated induction of pluripotency. Here, we report that two histone variants, TH2A and TH2B, which are highly expressed in oocytes and contribute to activation of the paternal genome after fertilization, enhance OSKM-dependent generation of iPSCs and can induce reprogramming with Klf4 and Oct3/4 alone. TH2A and TH2B are enriched on the X chromosome during the reprogramming process, and their expression in somatic cells increases the DNase I sensitivity of chromatin. In addition, Xist deficiency, which was reported to enhance SCNT reprogramming efficiency, stimulates iPSC generation using TH2A/TH2B in conjunction with OSKM, but not OSKM alone. Thus, TH2A/TH2B may enhance reprogramming by introducing processes that normally operate in zygotes and during SCNT."
https://openalex.org/W1970728400,"Pancreatic β cells are of great interest for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. A number of strategies already exist for the generation of β cells, but a general approach for reprogramming nonendodermal cells into β cells could provide an attractive alternative in a variety of contexts. Here, we describe a stepwise method in which pluripotency reprogramming factors were transiently expressed in fibroblasts in conjunction with a unique combination of soluble molecules to generate definitive endoderm-like cells that did not pass through a pluripotent state. These endoderm-like cells were then directed toward pancreatic lineages using further combinations of small molecules in vitro. The resulting pancreatic progenitor-like cells could mature into cells of all three pancreatic lineages in vivo, including functional, insulin-secreting β-like cells that help to ameliorate hyperglycemia. Our findings may therefore provide a useful approach for generating large numbers of functional β cells for disease modeling and, ultimately, cell-based therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2083197283,"Bacteria are thought to cope with fluctuating environmental solute concentrations primarily by adjusting the osmolality of their cytoplasm. To obtain insights into the underlying metabolic adaptations, we analyzed the global metabolic response of Escherichia coli to sustained hyperosmotic stress using nontargeted mass spectrometry. We observed that 52% of 1,071 detected metabolites, including known osmoprotectants, changed abundance with increasing salt challenge. Unexpectedly, unsupervised data analysis showed a substantial increase of most intermediates in the ubiquinone-8 (Q8) biosynthesis pathway and a 110-fold accumulation of Q8 itself, as confirmed by quantitative lipidomics. We then demonstrated that Q8 is necessary for acute and sustained osmotic-stress tolerance using Q8 mutants and tolerance rescue through feeding nonrespiratory Q8 analogs. Finally, in vitro experiments with artificial liposomes showed that mechanical membrane stabilization is a principal mechanism of Q8-mediated osmoprotection. Thus, we find that besides regulating intracellular osmolality, E. coli enhances its cytoplasmic membrane stability to withstand osmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2059322850,"Decision-making research has often focused on decisions between two options. The authors adapted a decision-making model to account for a third, unavailable option, and they found that decision-making was more difficult with a poorer, and not better, third alternative. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity predicted individual variation in decision-making with multiple options. Despite widespread interest in neural mechanisms of decision-making, most investigations focus on decisions between just two options. Here we adapt a biophysically plausible model of decision-making to predict how a key decision variable, the value difference signal—encoding how much better one choice is than another—changes with the value of a third, but unavailable, alternative. The model predicts a surprising failure of optimal decision-making: greater difficulty choosing between two options in the presence of a third very poor, as opposed to very good, alternative. Both investigation of human decision-making and functional magnetic resonance imaging–based measurements of value difference signals in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) bore out this prediction. The vmPFC signal decreased in the presence of low-value third alternatives, and vmPFC effect sizes predicted individual variation in suboptimal decision-making in the presence of multiple alternatives. The effect contrasts with that of divisive normalization in parietal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2116468206,"Sensory systems do not work in isolation; instead, they show interactions that are specifically uncovered during sensory loss. To identify and characterize these interactions, we investigated whether visual deprivation leads to functional enhancement in primary auditory cortex (A1). We compared sound-evoked responses of A1 neurons in visually deprived animals to those from normally reared animals. Here, we show that visual deprivation leads to improved frequency selectivity as well as increased frequency and intensity discrimination performance of A1 neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vitro that in adults visual deprivation strengthens thalamocortical (TC) synapses in A1, but not in primary visual cortex (V1). Because deafening potentiated TC synapses in V1, but not A1, crossmodal TC potentiation seems to be a general property of adult cortex. Our results suggest that adults retain the capability for crossmodal changes whereas such capability is absent within a sensory modality. Thus, multimodal training paradigms might be beneficial in sensory-processing disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2016716381,"The action potential activity of single cortical neurons can evoke measurable sensory effects, but it is not known how spiking parameters and neuronal subtypes affect the evoked sensations. Here, we examined the effects of spike train irregularity, spike frequency, and spike number on the detectability of single-neuron stimulation in rat somatosensory cortex. For regular-spiking, putative excitatory neurons, detectability increased with spike train irregularity and decreasing spike frequencies but was not affected by spike number. Stimulation of single, fast-spiking, putative inhibitory neurons led to a larger sensory effect compared to regular-spiking neurons, and the effect size depended only on spike irregularity. An ideal-observer analysis suggests that, under our experimental conditions, rats were using integration windows of a few hundred milliseconds or more. Our data imply that the behaving animal is sensitive to single neurons' spikes and even to their temporal patterning."
https://openalex.org/W1964468906,"The adult mammalian brain is continuously supplied with adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) and hippocampus, where they are thought to be important for circuit coding and plasticity. However, direct evidence for the actual involvement of these neurons in neural processing is still lacking. We recorded the spiking activity of adult-born periglomerular neurons in the mouse OB in vivo using two-photon-targeted patch recordings. We show that odor responsiveness reaches a peak during neuronal development and then recedes at maturity. Sensory enrichment during development enhances the selectivity of adult-born neurons after maturation, without affecting neighboring resident neurons. Thus, in the OB circuit, adult-born neurons functionally integrate into the circuit, where they acquire distinct response profiles in an experience-dependent manner. The constant flow of these sensitive neurons into the circuit provides it with a mechanism of long-term plasticity, wherein new neurons mature to process odor information based on past demands."
https://openalex.org/W2080497992,"Triple negative breast cancers are a heterogeneous group of tumors characterized by poor patient survival and lack of targeted therapeutics. Androgen receptor has been associated with triple negative breast cancer pathogenesis, but its role in the different subtypes has not been clearly defined. We examined androgen receptor protein expression by immunohistochemical analysis in 678 breast cancers, including 396 triple negative cancers. Fifty matched lymph node metastases were also examined. Association of expression status with clinical (race, survival) and pathological (basal, non-basal subtype, stage, grade) features was also evaluated. In 160 triple negative breast cancers, mRNA microarray expression profiling was performed, and differences according to androgen receptor status were analyzed. In triple negative cancers the percentage of androgen receptor positive cases was lower (24.8% vs 81.6% of non-triple negative cases), especially in African American women (16.7% vs 25.5% of cancers of white women). No significant difference in androgen receptor expression was observed in primary tumors vs matched metastatic lesions. Positive androgen receptor immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with tumor grade (p<0.01) and associated with better overall patient survival (p = 0.032) in the non-basal triple negative cancer group. In the microarray study, expression of three genes (HER4, TNFSF10, CDK6) showed significant deregulation in association with androgen receptor status; eg CDK6, a novel therapeutic target in triple negative cancers, showed significantly higher expression level in androgen receptor negative cases (p<0.01). These findings confirm the prognostic impact of androgen receptor expression in non-basal triple negative breast cancers, and suggest targeting of new androgen receptor-related molecular pathways in patients with these cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2083659467,"L-Myc, a paralogue of the proto-oncogene c-Myc, is shown to regulate dendritic cell homeostasis and functionality; unlike c-Myc, L-Myc is not repressed by interferons and its expression allows for optimal dendritic cell proliferation and T-cell priming in the presence of inflammation. The Mycl1 gene, the third Myc family proto-oncogene to have been discovered, was identified in 1985 in human small-cell lung carcinoma. Its true in vivo function has remained unclear. Now, using knock-in reporter/knockout allele mice, Kenneth Murphy and colleagues show that Mycl1 is expressed exclusively by dendritic cells in the immune system. Unlike c-Myc, the L-Myc transcription factor is not repressed by interferons, and its expression allows for optimal dendritic cell proliferation and T-cell priming in the presence of inflammation. The transcription factors c-Myc and N-Myc—encoded by Myc and Mycn, respectively—regulate cellular growth1 and are required for embryonic development2,3. A third paralogue, Mycl1, is dispensable for normal embryonic development but its biological function has remained unclear4. To examine the in vivo function of Mycl1 in mice, we generated an inactivating Mycl1gfp allele that also reports Mycl1 expression. We find that Mycl1 is selectively expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) of the immune system and controlled by IRF8, and that during DC development, Mycl1 expression is initiated in the common DC progenitor5 concurrent with reduction in c-Myc expression. Mature DCs lack expression of c-Myc and N-Myc but maintain L-Myc expression even in the presence of inflammatory signals such as granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor. All DC subsets develop in Mycl1-deficient mice, but some subsets such as migratory CD103+ conventional DCs in the lung and liver are greatly reduced at steady state. Importantly, loss of L-Myc by DCs causes a significant decrease in in vivo T-cell priming during infection by Listeria monocytogenes and vesicular stomatitis virus. The replacement of c-Myc by L-Myc in immature DCs may provide for Myc transcriptional activity in the setting of inflammation that is required for optimal T-cell priming6."
https://openalex.org/W2088653554,"NADPH oxidase5 (Nox5) is a novel Nox isoform which has recently been recognized as having important roles in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, fetal ventricular septal defect and cancer. The activity of Nox5 and production of reactive oxygen species is regulated by intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation. However, the kinases that phosphorylate Nox5 remain poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the phosphorylation of Nox5 is PKC dependent, but this contention was based on the use of pharmacological inhibitors and the isoforms of PKC involved remain unknown. Thus, the major goals of this study were to determine whether PKC can directly regulate Nox5 phosphorylation and activity, to identify which isoforms are involved in the process, and to understand the functional significance of this pathway in disease. We found that a relatively specific PKCα inhibitor, Ro-32-0432, dose-dependently inhibited PMA-induced superoxide production from Nox5. PMA-stimulated Nox5 activity was significantly reduced in cells with genetic silencing of PKCα and PKCε, enhanced by loss of PKCδ and the silencing of PKCθ expression was without effect. A constitutively active form of PKCα robustly increased basal and PMA-stimulated Nox5 activity and promoted the phosphorylation of Nox5 on Ser490, Thr494, and Ser498. In contrast, constitutively active PKCε potently inhibited both basal and PMA-dependent Nox5 activity. Co-IP and in vitro kinase assay experiments demonstrated that PKCα directly binds to Nox5 and modifies Nox5 phosphorylation and activity. Exposure of endothelial cells to high glucose significantly increased PKCα activation, and enhanced Nox5 derived superoxide in a manner that was in prevented by a PKCα inhibitor, Go 6976. In summary, our study reveals that PKCα is the primary isoform mediating the activation of Nox5 and this maybe of significance in our understanding of the vascular complications of diabetes and other diseases with increased ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W2021217214,"Virtually all stages of the visual system exhibit adaptation: neurons adjust their responses based on the recent stimulus history. While some of these adjustments occur at specific stages, others may be inherited from earlier stages. How do adaptation effects cascade along the visual system? We measured spatially selective adaptation at two successive stages in the mouse visual system: visual thalamus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). This form of adaptation affected both stages but in drastically different ways: in LGN it only changed response gain, while in V1 it also shifted spatial tuning away from the adaptor. These effects, however, are reconciled by a simple model whereby V1 neurons summate LGN inputs with a fixed, unadaptable weighting profile. These results indicate that adaptation effects cascade through the visual system, that this cascading can shape selectivity, and that the rules of integration from one stage to the next are not themselves adaptable."
https://openalex.org/W2156261247,"Basal-like breast cancer is a highly aggressive tumour subtype associated with poor prognosis. Aberrant activation of NF-κB signalling is frequently found in triple-negative basal-like breast cancer cells, but the cause of this activation has remained elusive.Here we report that α-catenin functions as a tumour suppressor in E-cadherin-negative basal-like breast cancer cells by inhibiting NF-κB signalling. Mechanistically, α-catenin interacts with the IκBα protein, and stabilizes IκBα by inhibiting its ubiquitylation and its association with the proteasome. This stabilization in turn prevents nuclear localization of RelA and p50, leading to decreased expression of TNF-α, IL-8 and RelB. In human breast cancer, CTNNA1 expression is specifically downregulated in the basal-like subtype, correlates with clinical outcome and inversely correlates with TNF and RELB expression. Taken together, these results uncover a previously undescribed mechanism by which the NF-κB pathway is activated in E-cadherin-negative basal-like breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1975214275,"The renal stroma is an embryonic cell population located in the cortex that provides a structural framework as well as a source of endothelial progenitors for the developing kidney. The exact role of the renal stroma in normal kidney development hasn't been clearly defined. However, previous studies have shown that the genetic deletion of Foxd1, a renal stroma specific gene, leads to severe kidney malformations confirming the importance of stroma in normal kidney development. This study further investigates the role of renal stroma by ablating Foxd1-derived stroma cells themselves and observing the response of the remaining cell populations. A Foxd1cre (renal stroma specific) mouse was crossed with a diphtheria toxin mouse (DTA) to specifically induce apoptosis in stromal cells. Histological examination of kidneys at embryonic day 13.5-18.5 showed a lack of stromal tissue, mispatterning of renal structures, and dysplastic and/or fused horseshoe kidneys. Immunofluorescence staining of nephron progenitors, vasculature, ureteric epithelium, differentiated nephron progenitors, and vascular supportive cells revealed that mutants had thickened nephron progenitor caps, cortical regions devoid of nephron progenitors, aberrant vessel patterning and thickening, ureteric branching defects and migration of differentiated nephron structures into the medulla. The similarities between the renal deformities caused by Foxd1 genetic knockout and Foxd1DTA mouse models reveal the importance of Foxd1 in mediating and maintaining the functional integrity of the renal stroma."
https://openalex.org/W1991026593,"Abnormal GABAergic interneuron density, and imbalance of excitatory versus inhibitory tone, is thought to result in epilepsy, neurodevelopmental disorders, and psychiatric disease. Recent studies indicate that interneuron cortical density is determined primarily by the size of the precursor pool in the embryonic telencephalon. However, factors essential for regulating interneuron allocation from telencephalic multipotent precursors are poorly understood. Here we report that Olig1 represses production of GABAergic interneurons throughout the mouse brain. Olig1 deletion in mutant mice results in ectopic expression and upregulation of Dlx1/2 genes in the ventral medial ganglionic eminences and adjacent regions of the septum, resulting in an ∼30% increase in adult cortical interneuron numbers. We show that Olig1 directly represses the Dlx1/2 I12b intergenic enhancer and that Dlx1/2 functions genetically downstream of Olig1. These findings establish Olig1 as an essential repressor of Dlx1/2 and interneuron production in developing mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1998069454,"Temperature is hypothesized to contribute to increased pathogenicity and virulence of many marine diseases. The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of matrix population modelling for epidemiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2032726624,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with depressed cardiac contractile function and progression to heart failure. Cardiac myosin-binding protein C, a cardiac-specific myofilament protein, is proteolyzed post-MI in humans, which results in an N-terminal fragment, C0-C1f. The presence of C0-C1f in cultured cardiomyocytes results in decreased Ca(2+) transients and cell shortening, abnormalities sufficient for the induction of heart failure in a mouse model. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the association between C0-C1f and altered contractility in human cardiac myofilaments in vitro. To accomplish this, we generated recombinant human C0-C1f (hC0C1f) and incorporated it into permeabilized human left ventricular myocardium. Mechanical properties were studied at short (2 μm) and long (2.3 μm) sarcomere length (SL). Our data demonstrate that the presence of hC0C1f in the sarcomere had the greatest effect at short, but not long, SL, decreasing maximal force and myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. Moreover, hC0C1f led to increased cooperative activation, cross-bridge cycling kinetics, and tension cost, with greater effects at short SL. We further established that the effects of hC0C1f occur through direct interaction with actin and α-tropomyosin. Our data demonstrate that the presence of hC0C1f in the sarcomere is sufficient to induce depressed myofilament function and Ca(2+) sensitivity in otherwise healthy human donor myocardium. Decreased cardiac function post-MI may result, in part, from the ability of hC0C1f to bind actin and α-tropomyosin, suggesting that cleaved C0-C1f could act as a poison polypeptide and disrupt the interaction of native cardiac myosin-binding protein C with the thin filament."

Furthermore, visual stimulation strongly modulates the bipolar cell projective field, in opposite direction for different cell types. In this way, the context from distant parts of the visual field can control the routing of signals in the inner retina. The retina has two synaptic layers to encode visual stimuli into a series of spike trains (Masland, 2012Masland R.H. The neuronal organization of the retina.Neuron. 2012; 76: 266-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). First, in the outer retina, photoreceptors convert light into electrical signals and send them to bipolar cells. Horizontal cells apply a level of gain control and lateral inhibition at this synaptic layer (Wu, 1994Wu S.M. Synaptic transmission in the outer retina.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 141-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Second, in the inner retina, bipolar cells transmit the signals to ganglion cells, modified by intricate interactions with amacrine cells (Baccus, 2007Baccus S.A. Timing and computation in inner retinal circuitry.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 271-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ganglion cell population comprises many distinct types and each type’s visual response properties are thought to derive from a specific combination of bipolar and amacrine cell signals (Vaney et al., 2012Vaney D.I. Sivyer B. Taylor W.R. Direction selectivity in the retina: symmetry and asymmetry in structure and function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 194-208PubMed Google Scholar). The diversity of these interactions in the inner retina is one of the least understood aspects of retinal processing. As in other sensory systems, a central tool in studying circuitry of the retina has been the measurement of receptive fields. A neuron’s receptive field spells out how its visual responses arise from the convergence of receptor signals. By comparing receptive fields of neurons along the processing chain, one gains insight into how the circuit is structured (Gollisch and Meister, 2010Gollisch T. Meister M.

For a more complete assessment of circuit function, it would be useful also to know the neuron’s “projective field,” namely how its signals diverge to all downstream partners (Lehky and Sejnowski, 1988Lehky S.R.

By simultaneously recording from multiple ganglion cells while controlling the activity of individual bipolar cells intracellularly, we explored how bipolar cells distribute their signals to the subsequent ganglion cell population in the salamander retina. This signal flow is subject to some clear anatomical constraints: many bipolar cell types have axon terminals only at specific laminae of the inner plexiform layer (Pang et al., 2004Pang J.-J. Gao F.

The neuronal organization of the retina.Neuron. 2012; 76: 266-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, Siegert et al., 2009Siegert S. Scherf B.G. Del Punta K.

Therefore, direct synaptic connections should be limited to only certain pairings of cell types. However, the full projective field includes polysynaptic connections as well. We will show that this leads to considerably broader spread of bipolar cell signals than expected from laminar connectivity alone, both regarding the cell types involved and the spatial extent of signal flow. Furthermore, the projective field of a given bipolar cell can be modulated profoundly by distant visual stimuli that are outside its receptive field. Bipolar cells occupy a special place in retinal circuitry: they are the only link from the outer retina to the inner retina. How does the signal of a given bipolar cell diverge into the population of ganglion cells at the output of the retina? To address this question, we manipulated the membrane potential of an individual bipolar cell intracellularly and simultaneously recorded the spiking activity of many nearby ganglion cells in the isolated salamander retina. The goal was to observe the influence of one bipolar cell on all the retina’s output neurons, involving not only direct synaptic connections but the entire circuit of the inner retina. Following prior usage, we term this the “projective field,” and we will refer to the influence of a bipolar cell on a specific ganglion cell—which may be polysynaptic—as its “projection” to that neuron. Because the intracellular recordings in the inner nuclear layer were performed blind, we also encountered a good number of amacrine cells and subjected them to the same analysis. These results will serve as useful reference points for some of the following sections. Depolarization or hyperpolarization of a bipolar cell frequently produced changes in spiking of ganglion cells (Figure 1). In most cases, ganglion cell spikes were evoked when a bipolar cell was depolarized from the resting potential (Figure 1E) or returned from hyperpolarization to the resting potential, indicating a sign-preserving projection between the two neurons. Less frequently, we observed sign-inverting projections, where the ganglion cell fired on hyperpolarization of the bipolar cell (Figure 1F). These must be mediated by inhibitory amacrine cells, because direct synaptic transmission from bipolar cells is excitatory (Masland, 2012Masland R.H. The neuronal organization of the retina.Neuron. 2012; 76: 266-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), even though some bipolar cells express the transmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) along with glutamate (Yang and Wang, 1999Yang C.Y. Wang H.H. Anatomical and electrophysiological evidence for GABAergic bipolar cells in tiger salamander retina.Vision Res. 1999; 39: 3653-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is reassuring that these methods of pairwise recording of bipolar and ganglion cells reveal not only direct synaptic connections but also indirect effects that pass through amacrine cell circuits. In this study, we begin by analyzing the general properties of the bipolar cell projective field, such as its spatial profile and dynamics. With pharmacological tools, we assess the contribution of intervening circuitry to the spatial extent of the projective field, including amacrine cell inhibitory networks and gap junction electrical networks. In the second part, we classify the bipolar and ganglion cells into distinct response types and determine more specifically how the projections are constrained by the identities of source and target neuron. Finally, we investigate how the bipolar cell projective field changes depending on the context from visual stimulation. To map the bipolar cell projective field, we first measured the distance and the projection strength for each recorded pair of bipolar and ganglion cells. Specifically, the distance between the cells was taken as the separation between their receptive field centers (obtained from white-noise analysis; e.g., Figures 1A–1D). The projection strength was calculated as the difference of the ganglion cell firing rates in response to bipolar cell depolarization and hyperpolarization, normalized by the pooled SD across trials (Equation 2; e.g., Figures 1E and 1F). In each case, we evaluated whether the projection was statistically different from zero. The resulting projective field of bipolar cells showed several prominent features (Figures 2 and 3). First, the projection strength could have different signs and values even at the same distance. Thus, the same bipolar cell sent both sign-preserving and sign-inverting signals to different ganglion cells (Figure 2A). In general, however, sign-preserving projections from bipolar cells dominated in our data set (Figure 3A–3D), regardless of the baseline ganglion cell firing properties (Figure S1 available online). By contrast, amacrine cells primarily showed sign-inverting projections to ganglion cells (Figures 2B and 3E–3H), as expected from their roles as inhibitory interneurons. Thus, the paucity of sign-inverting projections from bipolar cells is not due to any difficulty in detecting ganglion cell inhibition; instead, it seems that monosynaptic connections are simply easier to detect than disynaptic projections that require the excitation of an intervening interneuron.Figure 3Polarity, Strength, and Range of the Projective FieldShow full caption(A) Population data of the projection strength as a function of the distance between bipolar and ganglion cells (black, significant; gray, nonsignificant).(B) Density of bipolar cell projections as a function of distance (solid, significant; dotted, nonsignificant; this convention applies to all subsequent plots of this kind).

(E–H) Population data for the amacrine cell projective field, displayed as in (A)–(D). No significant sign-preserving projections were observed. Second, the bipolar projective field is sparse, meaning that at any given distance only a fraction of ganglion cells receive a significant projection. For sign-preserving projections, the probability was ∼50% for an immediately adjacent ganglion cell and decayed strongly with increasing distance (Figure 3B). For sign-inverting projections, the probability was more than 10-fold lower (Figure 3B). By contrast, amacrine cells had frequent sign-inverting projections to ganglion cells, again with a strong distance dependence (Figure 3F). Third, the projections involved significant dynamics. After the onset of a current pulse into the bipolar cell, the ganglion cell firing rate generally rose to a peak and then declined again (Figure 1E). We summarized the time dependence by measuring the latency of the peak. This peak latency varied dramatically across different projections, from ∼10 ms to ∼1 s (Figures 3C and 3D). One might expect that a weaker projection would have a longer latency, because it may take longer to depolarize the target neuron, but this was not the case: even at the same projection strength one found all possible latencies (Figure 3D). There was a small increase of latency with projection distance (Figure 3C), but again this correlation accounted for only a fraction of the range. We conclude that bipolar cells drive ganglion cells with a wide variety of dynamics (Asari and Meister, 2012Asari H. Meister M. Divergence of visual channels in the inner retina.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, the bipolar cell projections covered a surprisingly large distance. Averaging over the wide variation in projection strength even to adjacent ganglion cells, one can approximate the projection with a Gaussian profile (Figure 2A; Equation S3). These profiles ranged in diameter from 100 μm to more than 1 mm, with an average of 0.42 mm (Figures 2C and 2D). This was considerably larger than the bipolar cell receptive field diameter of 0.16 mm. It appears therefore that lateral signal flow extends considerably farther in the inner retina (from bipolar cells) than in the outer retina (to bipolar cells). In the following section, we will consider the circuits underlying this lateral distribution. How can a bipolar cell excite ganglion cells more than 1 mm away (Figure 3)? This distance exceeds what one expects for monosynaptic transmission, because the combined radius of bipolar cell axonic field and ganglion cell dendritic field is about 0.35 mm (Pang et al., 2004Pang J.-J.

Polysynaptic pathways must be involved, such as those through electrical synapses (Cook and Becker, 1995Cook J.E. Becker D.L. Gap junctions in the vertebrate retina.Microsc. Res.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4136-4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Here we took a pharmacological approach to examine how inner retinal circuits contribute to the bipolar cell projective field (Figures 4 and S2). We first blocked GABA and glycine transmission by applying 100 μM picrotoxin and 1.0 μM strychnine. This generally leads to an increase in the size of the ganglion cell receptive field (Cook and McReynolds, 1998Cook P.B. McReynolds J.S. Lateral inhibition in the inner retina is important for spatial tuning of ganglion cells.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) but does not substantially affect the bipolar cell receptive field in the salamander retina (Hare and Owen, 1990Hare W.A.

Physiol. 1990; 421: 223-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Hare and Owen, 1996Hare W.A. Owen W.G. Receptive field of the retinal bipolar cell: a pharmacological study in the tiger salamander.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 2005-2019PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these inhibitory transmission blockers work mainly on the inner retina (amacrine cells) but not on the outer retina (horizontal cells). Indeed, we found that they greatly suppressed the projection strength between amacrine cells and ganglion cells (Figure 4B). In contrast, we found a strong increase in the projection strength between bipolar cells and ganglion cells (Figures 4A and S2A–S2C). Many ganglion cells revealed responses to bipolar cell depolarization only after the loss of inhibition (Figure 4C), and no ganglion cells responded to bipolar cell hyperpolarization after the drug application. Little change was found, however, in the spatial extent of the sign-preserving signals from bipolar cells: even with inhibitory circuits blocked, the influence of bipolar cells extended over 1 mm (Figure 4C). On average, it appears that amacrine cells contribute to the projection strength but not to the spatial extent of the bipolar cell projective field. Specifically, we conclude that disinhibition via serial connections of amacrine cells (Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2010Eggers E.D. Lukasiewicz P.D. Interneuron circuits tune inhibition in retinal bipolar cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 103: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Manookin et al., 2008Manookin M.B. Beaudoin D.L. Ernst Z.R.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4136-4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) does not account for long-range sign-preserving projections (Figure 3). We next applied 100 μM meclofenamic acid to block gap junctions (Zhang and Wu, 2009Zhang A.-J. Wu S.M. Receptive fields of retinal bipolar cells are mediated by heterogeneous synaptic circuitry.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This drug produced a significant decrease of the bipolar cell projection strength (Figures 4D and S2D–S2F) and a loss of the most distant projections (Figure 4F). In contrast, the drug application had, on average, little effect on the projection strength of amacrine cells (Figure 4E). Although a change in projection strength cannot be distinguished strictly from a change in range, these results suggest that the signals from bipolar cells are distributed not only vertically by direct excitation of ganglion cells but also laterally through gap junction networks (Cook and Becker, 1995Cook J.E. Becker D.L. Gap junctions in the vertebrate retina.Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 31: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Wong-Riley, 1974Wong-Riley M.T. Synaptic orgnization of the inner plexiform layer in the retina of the tiger salamander.J. Neurocytol. 1974; 3: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In principle, this could occur through electrical coupling among bipolar cells (Arai et al., 2010Arai I. Tanaka M. Tachibana M. Active roles of electrically coupled bipolar cell network in the adult retina.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 9260-9270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or among ganglion cells or amacrine cells (Vaney, 1991Vaney D.I. Many diverse types of retinal neurons show tracer coupling when injected with biocytin or Neurobiotin.Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 125: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As elaborated below, OFF bipolar cells systematically had broader projections than ON bipolar cells, regardless of the target ganglion cell type (Figure 6A). Combined with evidence that OFF bipolar cells are more strongly coupled (Zhang and Wu, 2009Zhang A.-J. Wu S.M. Receptive fields of retinal bipolar cells are mediated by heterogeneous synaptic circuitry.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this favors an interpretation that invokes lateral signal spread among bipolar cells. The vertebrate retina contains 10–20 types of bipolar cells (McGuire et al., 1984McGuire B.A. Stevens J.K. Sterling P. Microcircuitry of bipolar cells in cat retina.J.

Because the dendrites of many ganglion cells are similarly stratified (Roska and Werblin, 2001Roska B. Werblin F.

The neuronal organization of the retina.Neuron. 2012; 76: 266-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), one expects that different bipolar cell types have different projective fields and that those projective fields should be selective for specific ganglion cell types. In the present experiments, the need for simultaneous recording prohibited a morphological analysis of each target cell. Instead, we classified the neurons based on their physiological properties, namely the characteristics of their visual responses. We then analyzed how the projective field depends on the identities of the source bipolar and target ganglion cell. Specifically, we examined the following properties at the population level: the projection density, namely the probability of observing a projection between two types; the strength of the projection; and its spatial extent (Figures 5, 6, S3, and S4). We first sorted both bipolar and ganglion cells into four subgroups each, based on the polarity and kinetics of their visual responses (Figure S3). At the most basic level, we found significant projections for almost every combination of bipolar and ganglion cell type (Figures 5A and 5B). Some functional types appeared more frequently in these recordings than others; in particular, the ON cell types are comparatively rare for both bipolar and ganglion cells in the salamander retina (Segev et al., 2006Segev R.

Relation between light responses and dendritic branching in the salamander ganglion cells.Exp. Biol. 1986; 45: 81-90PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we observed significant projections for all pairings of cell types except from slow ON bipolar cells to ON ganglion cells. To examine finer projection patterns between bipolar cells and ganglion cells, we subdivided each of the cell types (Figure S3) based on the receptive field sizes, direction selectivity (Vaney et al., 2012Vaney D.I. Sivyer B. Taylor W.R. Direction selectivity in the retina: symmetry and asymmetry in structure and function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 194-208PubMed Google Scholar), or object motion sensitivity (Ölveczky et al., 2003Ölveczky B.P. Baccus S.A. Meister M.

A retinal circuit that computes object motion.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6807-6817Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here we omitted ON cell types from the analysis due to scarcity of data. All-to-all projection patterns were found even after such finer cell-type classification (Figures 5C–5E). These observations reinforce prior findings of substantial crosstalk among bipolar cell signals (McGuire et al., 1986McGuire B.A. Stevens J.K. Sterling P. Microcircuitry of beta ganglion"
https://openalex.org/W2039884703,"Sensory systems adjust continuously to the environment. The effects of recent sensory experience-or adaptation-are typically assayed by recording in a relevant subcortical or cortical network. However, adaptation effects cannot be localized to a single, local network. Adjustments in one circuit or area will alter the input provided to others, with unclear consequences for computations implemented in downstream circuits. Here, we show that prolonged adaptation with drifting gratings, which alters responses in the early visual system, impedes the ability of area MT neurons to integrate motion signals in plaid stimuli. Perceptual experiments reveal a corresponding loss of plaid coherence. A simple computational model shows how the altered representation of motion signals in early cortex can derail integration in MT. Our results suggest that the effects of adaptation cascade through the visual system, derailing the downstream representation of distinct stimulus attributes."

Therefore, traffic of HAS to/from the plasma membrane is crucial for the synthesis of HA. In this study, we have identified Rab10 GTPase as the first protein known to be involved in the control of this traffic. Rab10 colocalized with HAS3 in intracellular vesicular structures and was co-immunoprecipitated with HAS3 from isolated endosomal vesicles. Rab10 silencing increased the plasma membrane residence of HAS3, resulting in a significant increase of HA secretion and an enlarged cell surface HA coat, whereas Rab10 overexpression suppressed HA synthesis. Rab10 silencing blocked the retrograde traffic of HAS3 from the plasma membrane to early endosomes. The cell surface HA coat impaired cell adhesion to type I collagen, as indicated by recovery of adhesion following hyaluronidase treatment. The data indicate a novel function for Rab10 in reducing cell surface HAS3, suppressing HA synthesis, and facilitating cell adhesion to type I collagen.

HA, unlike all other vertebrate sugar polymers, is synthesized directly into the extracellular space by a family of transmembrane glycosyltransferases called hyaluronan synthases (HAS1–3) (5.Weigel P.H.

Transcriptional and post-translational regulation of hyaluronan synthesis.FEBS J. 2011; 278: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The intracellular traffic of HASs is another facet of post-translational processes, which can significantly affect the enzymatic activity of HASs and thereby control HA synthesis. To explore the mechanisms involved in the trafficking of HAS, we subjected cytoplasmic vesicles immunoprecipitated with a GFP-HAS3 antibody to mass spectrometric screening for associated proteins. Several proteins belonging to the vesicular trafficking machinery were identified, including Rab10, a member of the Rab family, comprising more than 60 proteins. They are master regulators of several aspects of intracellular traffic like transporting cargos from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane (12.Hutagalung A.H. Novick P.J. Role of Rab GTPases in membrane traffic and cell physiology.Physiol. Rev. 2011; 91: 119-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 13.Schwartz S.L. Cao C. Pylypenko O. Rak A. Wandinger-Ness A. Rab GTPases at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3905-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Because Rab10 GTPase was one of the most prominent proteins found in our screen for HAS3-associated proteins, we focused on it in this work. It turned out that Rab10 was indeed functionally important in the traffic of HAS3 but, unexpectedly, promoted depletion of HAS3 from plasma membrane. This enhancement of reverse traffic or endocytosis of a specific cargo is a completely novel function for Rab10. We show that Rab10 is a suppressor of HA synthesis and suggest that trafficking of HAS to/from plasma membrane forms a more important regulatory step in HA synthesis than previously anticipated.

MCF7 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and co-transfected with HAS3-Myc and EGFP-Rab10 using ExGen 500 transfection reagent (Fermentas, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the steps during cell lysis and fractionation were done at 4 °C, unless stated otherwise. Nearly confluent cells were washed twice and scraped off in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were pelleted down at 200 × g and resuspended in cold lysis buffer with no detergent (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8, with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and sonicated (Heilscher Ultrasonics, D-70184, Stuttgart, Germany). The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, 1000 × g for 10 min, and 6400 × g for 15 min to remove intact cells, nuclei, and mitochondria, respectively. Part of the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was mixed with 62% sucrose solution to make 40.6% PNS sucrose mix. In the ultracentrifuge tube, a gradient of 50% sucrose, 40.6% PNS mix, 35% sucrose, and 25% sucrose solutions and lysis buffer was prepared and then centrifuged in a Sorvall ultracentrifuge with a TH641 rotor at 154,000 × g for 18 h. 22 fractions were collected, beginning from the topmost layer of the gradient (labeled 1–22 in Fig. 1). The fractions were tested for specific organelle markers (calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum), Rab5 and Rab7 (endosomes), pan-cadherin (plasma membrane), and Golgin 97 (Golgi)) in Western blots. Fractions corresponding to endosomes, plasma membrane, and Golgi were pooled together, and 100–500 μg of protein samples, estimated by BCA assay (Pierce, Thermo Scientific), were taken from each pool for co-immunoprecipitation. The fractions were precleared overnight with normal mouse IgG conjugated with protein A/G magnetic beads (Ademtech, 33600 Pessac, France). The precleared samples were incubated overnight with c-Myc antibody and immunoprecipitated with protein A/G magnetic beads. The beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, and diluted with 0.5 m Tris-HCl, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The eluted samples were heated with 4× SDS sample buffer at 65 °C for 15 min and stored at −20 °C. The samples were subjected to immunoblotting with c-Myc and anti-GFP antibodies. MDCK cells with stable, high expression of EGFP-HAS3 was chosen for mass spectrometry to ensure a sufficiently high signal (14.Rilla K. Pasonen-Seppänen S. Kärnä R. Karjalainen H.M. Törrönen K.

The result of immunoprecipitation was confirmed by Western blot with anti-GFP antibody, and the rest of the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Trypsin digests were prepared using sequencing grade trypsin (Sigma) and extracted, and the mass spectra were analyzed using an LC-electrospray ionization-MS/MS system, as described previously (19.Piltti J. Häyrinen J. Karjalainen H.M. Lammi M.J.

The MASCOT search algorithm was used via Mascot-script online (21.Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data.Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar), and a SwissProt database search (version 2010_12) was utilized. Other parameters set for the MS/MS ion search were the same as discussed previously (19.Piltti J. Häyrinen J. Karjalainen H.M. Lammi M.J. Proteomics of chondrocytes with special reference to phosphorylation changes of proteins in stretched human chondrosarcoma cells.Biorheology. 2008; 45: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein hits were selected based on the p value (p < 0.05) for extensive homology, calculated by the MASCOT algorithm. The identified protein hits were screened according to the Mascot score of the matched peptides, and the sequence coverage of the proteins was calculated. Protein fractions from sucrose gradient centrifugation or co-immunoprecipitation were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Whatman), blocked with 3 or 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1× TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with the primary antibodies, anti-GFP (1:1000), anti-calnexin (1:1000), anti-pan-cadherin (1:500), anti-Golgin 97 (1:1000) and anti-c-Myc antibody (1:500) diluted in 1% BSA-TBST, anti-Rab5 (1:1000) diluted in TBST, and anti-Rab7 (1:1000) diluted in 5% BSA-TBST. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the infrared secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Dylight 680 (1:5000) and anti-goat Alexa Fluor 680 (1:5000), diluted in 1% BSA-TBST, and washed three times with TBST. The protein bands in the blots were visualized on a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The Rab10 and scrambled siRNAs were obtained from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium), with the sequences given in Table 1. About 250,000 MCF7 cells were seeded on 6-well plates and grown until 50% confluence, treated with 30 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h later, the cells were lysed; total RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH); and the cDNAs were synthesized using the Verso cDNA kit (Thermo Scientific). The quantitative real-time PCR was performed with Fast Start Universal SYBR Green mix (Roche Applied Science) using the Stratagene Mx3000P real-time PCR system (Agilent Technologies). Relative mRNA expression levels were compared by using the 2−ΔΔC(T) method, with GAPDH as a control.

The cells were harvested and lysed, and PNS was obtained as described above. The amount of protein in all of the lysate samples was quantified by a BCA assay. 100 μl of cell lysate/well was added in a 96-well plate, and the GFP fluorescence was measured in a microplate reader equipped with a 355-nm UV lamp and 485/535-nm (excitation/emission) filters. The samples were also subjected to Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody. 2 × 105 MCF7-EGFP-HAS3 cells were plated on 6-well plates, as duplicates, and treated with siRNAs, as described above. 24 h after siRNA transfection, the growth medium was replaced with one containing 0.25 μg/ml doxycycline to induce the expression of EGFP-HAS3. After 24 h, the media from the treated groups were collected and stored at −20 °C for later assays of HA, and the cell numbers were counted to express the HA content as ng/10,000 cells. The amount of HA secreted into growth medium was determined by an enzyme-linked sorbent assay, as described before (22.Hiltunen E.L. Anttila M. Kultti A. Ropponen K. Penttinen J. Yliskoski M.

The fluorescent images were obtained with ×40 numerical aperture 1.3 and ×63 numerical aperture 1.4 oil objectives (512 × 512-pixel resolution) on a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal module (Carl Zeiss Microimaging). For live cell imaging, a Zeiss XL-LSM S1 incubator with temperature and CO2 control was used. DRAQ5 nuclear staining (2 μm, Biostatus Ltd., Leicestershire, UK) was used to evaluate the transfection efficiency and to count the total number of cells in a field. The MCF7 cells were co-transfected with 6Myc-HAS3 and EGFP-Rab10 or EGFP (mock transfection) using ExGen 500 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same method was followed for mRFP-HAS3. 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, for 1 h and washed five times with PB. The fixed cells were permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1% BSA, blocked with 1% BSA for 20 min, and incubated overnight with anti-c-Myc primary antibody (1:100) in 1% BSA at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated with Texas Red-labeled secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:500 in PB) for 1 h and washed with PB. The cells were then incubated with DRAQ5 for 5 min, washed with PB, and stored at 4 °C. MCF7 cells were transfected with EGFP-HAS3 or EGFP (mock) and fixed with 4% PFA, and the cells were stained with anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody (1:100 in 1% BSA-PB) and Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1:500 in PB). The stained cells were then imaged with a ×40 oil objective for colocalization analysis. For colocalization analysis, images were taken with a ×63 or ×40 oil objective, and the analysis was done with BioImageXD software (23.Kankaanpää P. Paavolainen L. Tiitta S. Karjalainen M. Päivärinne J. Nieminen J. Marjomäki V. Heino J. White D.J. BioImageXD: an open, general-purpose and high-throughput image-processing platform.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), unless otherwise specified. The autothreshold function was used to process and analyze the colocalized pixels. Pearson's correlation coefficient (Rr) was used to measure the degree of colocalization, with 10–15 images/group. The colocalized images are shown as 8-bit or 1-bit representations. MCF7 cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids as follows: EGFP-Rab10 and HAS3 with the N-terminal mCherry, EGFP-Rab10 and the HAS3 with the C-terminal mCherry, and EGFP (mock) and mCherry-HAS3. 24 h later, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA and mounted with an antifade reagent, Mowiol® 4-88 (Sigma). To measure FRET efficiency, regions Of interest (ROIs) were randomly positioned inside the cells and also outside the cells for background subtraction. mCherry was photobleached using a 555-nm laser at 100% strength, with 25 iterations, and then second pictures of both fluorophores were taken. Images were analyzed using Fiji (24.Bastiaens P.I. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Söling H.D. Jovin T.M. Imaging the intracellular trafficking and state of the AB5 quaternary structure of cholera toxin.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency (E) was calculated for each pixel in the bleached area using the equation, E% = (IDonor postbleach − IDonor prebleach)/IDonor postbleach × 100, where IDonor represents the intensity of EGFP fluorescence. For each ROI, FRET efficiency was calculated from the average fluorescence intensities of the donor before and after bleaching the acceptor and corrected with the change in EGFP fluorescence intensity outside the bleached area. Means and S.E. of the efficiencies were calculated for each combination of the fluorophores. Microscopic images were processed with ZEN 2009 software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH). In some experiments, cell numbers were counted using the ImageJ program (Fiji, available on the World Wide Web). For image presentation, Adobe Photoshop Elements version 9 software (Adobe Systems) was used. Images were brightness/contrast-adjusted, and in some cases non-linear adjustment was used uniformly across the control and treated groups to better show the cellular features of interest. For visualization of HA surface coat on live cells, HA-binding complex (HABC) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 or AlexaFluor 647 was used as described previously (25.Rilla K. Tiihonen R. Kultti A. Tammi M. Tammi R. Pericellular hyaluronan coat visualized in live cells with a fluorescent probe is scaffolded by plasma membrane protrusions.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2008; 56: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cells were imaged with a ×40 oil objective from 15 random fields. For quantitative analysis, the cells were also imaged with a ×20 objective from 15 random fields in each group with 1500–2200 cells, using z-stacks of 1.93-μm thickness. The mean intensity of HA coat (Alexa Fluor 568, red) from the images was quantified from the compressed z-stacks of 320 × 320-μm area, divided by the total number of positive cells, visualized by DRAQ5 nuclear staining. siRNA-treated MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with EGFP-HAS3 and Rpre-mRFP in a 3:1 ratio. 24 h later, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA. Individual cells from each treatment were imaged with the same acquisition settings, using a ×40 oil objective. The images were processed and analyzed with the ZEN 2009 software. ROIs were drawn around plasma membrane, marked with Rpre-mRFP, and the whole cell, and the integrated intensity in each of the ROIs was calculated. The plasma membrane residence index of EGFP-HAS3 was calculated as the ratio of integrated intensity in plasma membrane to the whole cell and expressed as a percentage. siRNA-treated MCF7 cells were transfected with Dendra2-HAS3. 24 h later, HA coat was stained with 2 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 647-labeled HABC (fHABC) for 0.5 h at 37 °C. The ROI was marked around the cell surface with HA coat as a reference, and Dendra2-HAS3 was photoconverted with 15% of the 405-nm laser power, 10 iterations, for 1 s. The time point after photoconversion was set as “0”, and time lapse images were taken for 16 min with 2-min intervals. The retrograde traffic of Dendra2-HAS3 away from the cell surface was analyzed with fHABC as the reference signal, and the results were expressed as -fold changes of Dendra2-HAS3/fHABC ratio from time point 0. siRNA-treated MCF7 cells were transfected with EGFP-HAS3 or mRFP-HAS3 and, 24 h later, treated with markers for clathrin-dependent and fluid phase endocytosis. For clathrin-dependent endocytosis, the cells were incubated with transferrin conjugated to fluorescein (Invitrogen), and the transferrin uptake assay was done as described previously (26.Boucrot E.

https://openalex.org/W2048835615,"The yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex is a transcription coactivator that contains a histone H2B deubiquitination activity mediated by its Ubp8 subunit. Full enzymatic activity requires the formation of a quaternary complex, the deubiquitination module (DUBm) of SAGA, which is composed of Ubp8, Sus1, Sgf11, and Sgf73. The crystal structures of the DUBm have shed light on the structure/function relationship of this complex. Specifically, both Sgf11 and Sgf73 contain zinc finger domains (ZnF) that appear essential for the DUBm activity. Whereas Sgf73 N-terminal ZnF is important for DUBm stability, Sgf11 C-terminal ZnF appears to be involved in DUBm function. To further characterize the role of these two zinc fingers, we have solved their structure by NMR. We show that, contrary to the previously reported structures, Sgf73 ZnF adopts a C2H2 coordination with unusual tautomeric forms for the coordinating histidines. We further report that the Sgf11 ZnF, but not the Sgf73 ZnF, binds to nucleosomal DNA with a binding interface composed of arginine residues located within the ZnF α-helix. Mutational analyses both in vitro and in vivo provide evidence for the functional relevance of our structural observations. The combined interpretation of our results leads to an uncommon ZnF-DNA interaction between the SAGA DUBm and nucleosomes, thus providing further functional insights into SAGA's epigenetic modulation of the chromatin structure."

They are clustered at inhibitory postsynapses via a tight interaction of their β subunits (GlyRβ) with the scaffolding protein gephyrin. In an attempt to isolate additional proteins interacting with GlyRβ, we performed pulldown experiments with rat brain extracts using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encompassing amino acids 378–455 of the large intracellular loop of GlyRβ as bait. This identified syndapin I (SdpI) as a novel interaction partner of GlyRβ that coimmunoprecipitates with native GlyRs from brainstem extracts. Both SdpI and SdpII bound efficiently to the intracellular loop of GlyRβ in vitro and colocalized with GlyRβ upon coexpression in COS-7 cells. The SdpI-binding site was mapped to a proline-rich sequence of 22 amino acids within the intracellular loop of GlyRβ. Deletion and point mutation analysis disclosed that SdpI binding to GlyRβ is Src homology 3 domain-dependent. In cultured rat spinal cord neurons, SdpI immunoreactivity was found to partially colocalize with marker proteins of inhibitory and excitatory synapses.

Each subunit consists of an extended N-terminal extracellular domain, four transmembrane domains, and a large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4. The β subunit (GlyRβ) provides for synaptic localization of the GlyRs by interacting with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin (5.Kneussel M. Hermann A. Kirsch J.

The gephyrin-binding motif (GBM) of GlyRβ is located in the large intracellular loop and has been shown to also be important for the anterograde and retrograde dendritic transport of GlyRs, in which gephyrin functions as an adaptor for kinesin-5 and the dynein light chains 1 and 2 (Dlc1/2), respectively (7.Fuhrmann J.C.

In addition to gephyrin, the trafficking proteins vacuolar protein sorting 35 (Vps35) and neurobeachin (Nbea) have been recently found to interact with GlyRβ involving loop residues adjacent to the GBM (10.del Pino I.

At the C terminus, Sdps contain an SH3 domain, which interacts with the GTPase dynamin and other proteins involved in vesicular transport. Of the three Sdp isoforms, SdpI is expressed in brain, SdpII ubiquitously, and SdpIII in skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and weakly in brain (14.Kessels M.M.

In an attempt to identify novel GlyRβ-binding proteins that interact with the predicted SBMs and might be implicated in the molecular organization of inhibitory glycinergic postsynapses, we performed proteomic screens using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing amino acids 378–455 of GlyRβ, i.e. the C-terminal portion of its large intracellular loop. Here, we report that SdpI and the two known splice variants of SdpII interact with the GlyRβ loop by recognizing an SBM that lies adjacent to but does not include the GlyRβ 378–426 region. Mapping experiments revealed that the SBM of GlyRβ interacts with the SH3 domain of SdpI. Upon miRNA-mediated knockdown of SdpI in cultured rat spinal cord neurons, we observed a reduction in both the size and number of postsynaptic GlyR clusters. Similar results were obtained with spinal cord cultures prepared from SdpI−/− mice. Our data indicate that SdpI participates in the trafficking and/or cytoskeletal anchoring of synaptic GlyRs.

After three washes with lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, the resin was incubated overnight with 0.8–1.0 ml of pre-cleared brainstem homogenate at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml. After five washes with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

https://openalex.org/W1983971168,"Birds still share many traits with their dinosaur ancestors, making them the best living group to reconstruct certain aspects of non-avian theropod biology. Bipedal, digitigrade locomotion and parasagittal hindlimb movement are some of those inherited traits. Living birds, however, maintain an unusually crouched hindlimb posture and locomotion powered by knee flexion, in contrast to the inferred primitive condition of non-avian theropods: more upright posture and limb movement powered by femur retraction. Such functional differences, which are associated with a gradual, anterior shift of the centre of mass in theropods along the bird line, make the use of extant birds to study non-avian theropod locomotion problematic. Here we show that, by experimentally manipulating the location of the centre of mass in living birds, it is possible to recreate limb posture and kinematics inferred for extinct bipedal dinosaurs. Chickens raised wearing artificial tails, and consequently with more posteriorly located centre of mass, showed a more vertical orientation of the femur during standing and increased femoral displacement during locomotion. Our results support the hypothesis that gradual changes in the location of the centre of mass resulted in more crouched hindlimb postures and a shift from hip-driven to knee-driven limb movements through theropod evolution. This study suggests that, through careful experimental manipulations during the growth phase of ontogeny, extant birds can potentially be used to gain important insights into previously unexplored aspects of bipedal non-avian theropod locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2008564925,"Long-term response of genomic selection can be improved by considering allele frequencies of selected markers or quantitative trait loci (QTLs). A previous formula to weight allele frequency of favorable minor alleles was tested, and 2 new formulas were developed. The previous formula used nonlinear weights based on square root of frequency of the favorable allele. The new formulas included a parameter δ to balance long- and short-term progress; one used square root and the other used simple linear weights. The formulas were tested by simulation of 20 generations (population size of 3,000 for each generation) with direct selection on 3,000 QTLs (100 per chromosome). A QTL distribution with normally distributed allele effects and a heavy-tailed distribution were tested. Optimum δ from simulation was applied to data from Holstein, Jersey and Brown Swiss dairy cattle to compare differences of adjusted and official genomic evaluations. From simulation, optimum δ was 0.4 for the heavy-tailed QTL distribution but only 0.1 or 0.2 for a normal distribution. The previous formula had slower response than unweighted selection in early generations and did not recover by generation 20. Long-term response was slightly greater with the new formulas than with unweighted selection; the linear formula may be best for routine use because of more progress in early generations compared to nonlinear formula. Official and adjusted U.S. evaluations based on actual genotypes and estimated marker effects were correlated by 0.994 for Holsteins and Jerseys and 0.989 for Brown Swiss using linear weighting of allele frequency, which was higher than nonlinear weighting. The difference between adjusted and official evaluations was highly correlated negatively with an animal’s average genomic relationship to the population. Thus, strategies to reduce genomic inbreeding may achieve almost as much long-term progress as selection of favorable minor alleles."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a devastating and universally fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons from the spinal cord and cortex. In recent years, there has been a seismic shift in understanding of the causes and mechanisms of ALS, with RNA-binding proteins and alterations in RNA metabolic processes emerging as powerful contributors to disease pathogenesis (Ling et al., 2013Ling S.C. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. Neuron. 2013; 79: 416-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). This shift has been fueled by the initial discovery that the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is a major component of the pathological inclusions found in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients (Neumann et al., 2006Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. et al.Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4462) Google Scholar) and that mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some cases of familial and sporadic ALS (Chen-Plotkin et al., 2010Chen-Plotkin A.S. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2010; 6: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The conjunction of genetics and pathology clearly implicates TDP-43 as central to ALS and now the race is on to unravel the mechanisms by which it contributes to disease. What is its normal function? How do disease-associated mutations or pathological mislocalization affect that function? Since TDP-43 contributes broadly to ALS (depleted from the nucleus and mislocalized to cytoplasmic inclusions in virtually all ALS cases), deciphering TDP-43’s normal cellular role and its role in disease could help to suggest novel and broadly applicable therapeutic strategies. TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed DNA- and RNA-binding protein, originally identified as a transcriptional repressor and splicing regulator. TDP-43 localizes primarily to the nucleus but can also be found in the cytoplasm, as it shuttles between the two compartments (Chen-Plotkin et al., 2010Chen-Plotkin A.S. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2010; 6: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, it has been shown to associate with mRNP granules, known as stress granules, which are transient sites of translational repression of mRNAs that form upon exposure to diverse environmental stresses (Li et al., 2013Li Y.R. King O.D. Shorter J. Gitler A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). ALS-linked mutations in TDP-43 can impair stress granule dynamics (Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010Liu-Yesucevitz L. Bilgutay A. Zhang Y.J. Vanderweyde T. Citro A. Mehta T. Zaarur N. McKee A. Bowser R. Sherman M. et al.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and alterations in stress granule form and function (e.g., assembly and disassembly) per se may well be a major component of ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases (Li et al., 2013Li Y.R. King O.D. Shorter J. Gitler A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, Ramaswami et al., 2013Ramaswami M. Taylor J.P. Parker R. Cell. 2013; 154: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, stress granules are not cell type specific and are present in all cell types, including neurons. Neurons also contain specialized types of mRNP granules that transport specific mRNA cargos from the cell body to axons and dendrites. In highly polarized neurons, with axons and dendrites that often terminate long distances from the soma, the transport of cellular supplies, including mRNA, to distal locations is incredibly important for normal cell function and defects in this process can lead to neuronal dysfunction. Given its already described role in stress granules, an intriguing question arises: could TDP-43 function in other types of mRNP granules, such as neuronal RNA transport granules, and could this role explain its involvement in ALS pathogenesis and motor neuron degeneration? TDP-43 had previously been shown to associate with multiple proteins that are part of mRNP granules (e.g., staufen, FMRP, SMN, and HuD), including neuronal transport granules (Freibaum et al., 2010Freibaum B.D. Chitta R.K. High A.A. Taylor J.P. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 1104-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). TDP-43 has also been shown to bind to the 3′ UTRs of many target mRNAs, further evidence for a role in regulating the stability or transport of those mRNAs (Tollervey et al., 2011Tollervey J.R. Curk T. Rogelj B. Briese M. Cereda M. Kayikci M. König J. Hortobágyi T. Nishimura A.L. Zupunski V. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which TDP-43 regulates the spatial distribution of target mRNAs and the impact of disease mutations remain unresolved. To define the role of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm, Alami et al., 2014Alami N.H. Smith R.B. Carrasco M.A. Williams L.A. Winborn C.S. Han S.S.W. Kiskinis E. Winborn B. Freibaum B.D. Kanagaraj A. et al.Neuron. 2014; 81 (this issue): 536-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar start out by using transgenic Drosophila that they engineered to express wild-type or mutant TDP-43 in motor neurons. Consistent with previous reports by others, they found wild-type TDP-43 was mainly localized to the nucleus. But they also found TDP-43 present in cytoplasmic granules that were distributed throughout the axon, even to distal parts of the axon and into the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Interestingly, two independent disease-associated mutations impaired TDP-43’s localization, preventing it from reaching the distal axons and NMJs. Because these TDP-43 transgenes were fluorescently labeled, they were next able to use in vivo imaging of Drosophila motor neurons to visualize TDP-43-containing granules transported up and down axons. These granules would move bidirectionally, often for long distances, pause for a bit, and then continue their journey. Compared to wild-type, the ALS-linked mutant TDP-43-containing granules were transported less efficiently; their movements were interrupted with more pauses, resulting in more retrograde movement. This impaired anterograde movement of the mutant TDP-43 granules explains their diminished ability to reach distal axons and the NMJ. Alami et al., 2014Alami N.H. Smith R.B. Carrasco M.A. Williams L.A. Winborn C.S. Han S.S.W. Kiskinis E. Winborn B. Freibaum B.D.

Again, using fluorescently tagged wild-type and mutant TDP-43, they visualized TDP-43 associating with cytoplasmic RNA transport granules and trafficking down the axons in a net anterograde direction. This process was less efficient (more pauses and direction reversals) with the TDP-43 mutants. Alami et al., 2014Alami N.H. Smith R.B. Carrasco M.A. Williams L.A. Winborn C.S. Han S.S.W. Kiskinis E.

Thus, the ability of TDP-43 to associate with cytoplasmic transport granules and traffic to distal parts of the axon in a net anterograde direction is conserved from flies to mice and disease-associated mutations cause a partial loss of this function. Alami et al., 2014Alami N.H. Smith R.B. Carrasco M.A. Williams L.A. Winborn C.S. Han S.S.W. Kiskinis E. Winborn B. Freibaum B.D.

Using this reagent, they visualized Nefl mRNA frequently localizing to TDP-43-containing granules within axons. But sometimes TDP-43 was absent from the Nefl-positive mRNP granules, allowing Alami et al., 2014Alami N.H. Smith R.B. Carrasco M.A. Williams L.A. Winborn C.S. Han S.S.W. Kiskinis E. Winborn B.

Remarkably, even though both types of granules contained Nefl mRNA, the TDP-43-containing granules exhibited predominantly anterograde movement, whereas the ones without TDP-43 moved in more of a retrograde fashion. Thus, it seems that TDP-43 selectively associates with granules involved in the anterograde transport of mRNA cargos within axons. Because the ALS-linked mutations affect this process, TDP-43 might also functionally participate in this transport rather than simply being a marker of the mRNP granules. The final piece to the puzzle was for the authors to validate their findings in human patient-derived cells. Alami et al., 2014Alami N.H. Smith R.B. Carrasco M.A. Williams L.A. Winborn C.S.

Using established protocols, they differentiated these cells into motor neurons and compared the kinematics of mRNA granule transport (using their novel mRNA “beacon” approach). Just like in the fly and mouse experiments, neurons harboring TDP-43 mutations exhibited impairments in the anterograde transport of NEFL-containing mRNP granules. These results reveal a specific cellular phenotype associated with TDP-43 mutation and suggest that, at least in part, one mechanism by which TDP-43 mutations can cause ALS is by loss of its cytoplasmic function. Additional gain-of-function and loss of nuclear function effects have been proposed and perhaps all contribute to disease to some extent (Figure 1). Using three diverse model systems (fly, mouse primary neurons, and neurons derived from human ALS patient iPS cells), Alami et al., 2014Alami N.H. Smith R.B. Carrasco M.A. Williams L.A. Winborn C.S.

They also develop a novel technique to visualize transport of specific TDP-43 mRNA cargos up and down axons in living neurons. Although it has been noted previously that TDP-43 can localize to the cytoplasm and interact with RNA-binding proteins involved in mRNP granule transport, the direct role, if any, for TDP-43 in the cytoplasm has remained enigmatic.

RNA granules—assemblies of RNAs and RNA-binding proteins—are emerging as key regulators of diverse RNA metabolic processes. Thus, dysfunction in RNA granule assembly or dynamics may be sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. If so, therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating RNA granule assembly, dynamics, or disassembly may be efficacious for ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases (Kim et al., 2013Kim H.J.

Axonal Transport of TDP-43 mRNA Granules Is Impaired by ALS-Causing MutationsAlami et al.NeuronFebruary 05, 2014In BriefAlami et al. show that TDP-43 is a component of RNA transport granules that support spatial distribution of mRNA targets to distal neuronal compartments. ALS mutations in TDP-43 selectively impair this function in Drosophila, mouse cortical neurons, and iPS-derived motor neurons from ALS patients. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
https://openalex.org/W2072077285,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a common treatment for recurrent or residual pituitary adenomas. The persistence of symptoms and treatment related complications may impair the patient's quality of life (QOL).The purpose of this study was to examine symptom distress, QOL, and the relationship between them among patients with pituitary tumors who had undergone SRS.This study used a cross-sectional design and purposive sampling. We enrolled patients diagnosed with pituitary tumors who had undergone SRS. Data were collected at the CyberKnife Center at a medical center in Northern Taiwan in 2012. A questionnaire survey was used for data collection. Our questionnaire consisted of 3 parts the Pituitary Tumor Symptom Distress Questionnaire, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument Short-Form (WHOQOL-BREF), and a demographic questionnaire.Sixty patients were enrolled in the study. The most common symptoms reported by patients after SRS were memory loss, fatigue, blurred vision, headache, sleep problems, and altered libido. The highest and lowest scores for QOL were in the environmental and psychological domains, respectively. Age was positively correlated with general health and the psychological domains. Level of symptom distress was negatively correlated with overall QOL, general health, physical health, and the psychological and social relationships domains. The scores in the psychological and environmental domains were higher in males than in females. Patients with ≤6 symptoms had better overall QOL, general health, physical health, and psychological and social relationships than those with >6 symptoms.Symptom distress can affect different aspects of patient QOL. Levels of symptom distress, number of symptoms, age, and gender were variables significantly correlated with patient QOL. These results may be utilized by healthcare personnel to design educational and targeted interventional programs for symptom management to improve patient QOL."
