https://openalex.org/W1877188956,"Longevity is regulated by the daf-2 gene network in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in the daf-2 gene, which encodes a member of the insulin receptor family, confer the life extension (Age) phenotype and the constitutive dauer (a growth-arrested larval form specialized for dispersal) formation phenotype. The Age phenotype is mutually potentiated by two life extension mutations in the daf-2 gene and the clk-1 gene, a homologue of yeast CAT5/COQ7 known to regulate ubiquinone biosynthesis. In this study, we demonstrated that the daf-2 mutation also conferred an oxidative stress resistance (Oxr) phenotype, which was also enhanced by the clk-1 mutation. Similar to the Age phenotype, the Oxr phenotype was regulated by the genetic pathway of insulin-like signaling from daf-2 to the daf-16 gene, a homologue of the HNF-3/forkhead transcription factor. These findings led us to examine whether the insulin-like signaling pathway regulates the gene expression of antioxidant defense enzymes. We found that the mRNA level of the sod-3 gene, which encodes Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), was much higher in daf-2 mutants than in the wild type. Moreover, the increased sod-3 gene expression phenotype is regulated by the insulin-like signaling pathway. Although the clk-1 mutant itself did not display Oxr and the increased sod-3 expression phenotypes, the clk-1 mutation enhanced them in the daf-2 mutant, suggesting that clk-1 is involved in longevity in two ways: clk-1 composes the original clk-1 longevity program and the daf-2 longevity program. These observations suggest that the daf-2 gene network controls longevity by regulating the Mn-SOD-associated antioxidant defense system. This system appears to play a role in efficient life maintenance at the dauer stage."
https://openalex.org/W2133188555,"Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by evolutionary conserved chromosomal proteins, termed ""cohesins."" Using an extension of chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have analyzed the distribution of cohesins Mcd1/ Sccl and Smc1 along yeast chromosome III. Both proteins occur preferentially at the same approximately 23 positions. Sites in a approximately 50 kb region around the centromere give especially intense signals. Prominent centric region binding appears to emerge from a more even distribution, probably by differential loss of cohesins along the chromosome arms. Cohesin binding peaks correspond closely to peaks of high local AT composition, a base composition periodicity of approximately 15 kb that is distinct from the approximately 50 kb periodicity of base composition isochores, consistent with axis association of cohesins. The methodology described can be used to analyze the distribution of any DNA-binding protein and, via microchips, along entire genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2126079531,"Disulfide bond formation is catalyzed in vivo by DsbA and DsbB. Here we reconstitute this oxidative folding system using purified components. We have found the sources of oxidative power for protein folding and show how disulfide bond formation is linked to cellular metabolism. We find that disulfide bond formation and the electron transport chain are directly coupled. DsbB uses quinones as electron acceptors, allowing various choices for electron transport to support disulfide bond formation. Electrons flow via cytochrome bo oxidase to oxygen under aerobic conditions or via cytochrome bd oxidase under partially anaerobic conditions. Under truly anaerobic conditions, menaquinone shuttles electrons to alternate final electron acceptors such as fumarate. This flexibility reflects the vital nature of the disulfide catalytic system."
https://openalex.org/W2031077971,"Xenopus 13S condensin converts interphase chromatin into mitotic-like chromosomes, and, in the presence of ATP and a type I topoisomerase, introduces (+) supercoils into DNA. The specific production of (+) trefoil knots in the presence of condensin and a type II topoisomerase shows that condensin reconfigures DNA by introducing an ordered, global, (+) writhe. Knotting required ATP hydrolysis and cell cycle-specific phosphorylation of condensin. Condensin bound preferentially to (+) supercoiled DNA in the presence of ATP but not in its absence. Our results suggest a mechanism for the compaction of chromatin by condensin during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2079539653,"Ligand-induced activation of surface receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is followed by a desensitization process involving endocytosis and receptor degradation. c-Cbl, a tyrosine phosphorylation substrate shared by several signaling pathways, accelerates desensitization by recruiting EGFR and increasing receptor polyubiquitination. Here we demonstrate that the RING type zinc finger of c-Cbl is essential for ubiquitination and subsequent desensitization of EGFR. Mutagenesis of a single cysteine residue impaired the ability of c-Cbl to enhance both down-regulation and ubiquitination of EGFR in living cells, although the mutant retained binding to the activated receptor. Consequently, the mutant form of c-Cbl acquired a dominant inhibitory function and lost the ability to inhibit signaling downstream to EGFR. In vitroreconstitution of EGFR ubiquitination implies that the RING finger plays an essential direct role in ubiquitin ligation. Our results attribute to the RING finger of c-Cbl a causative role in endocytic sorting of EGFR and desensitization of signal transduction.

Consistent with sorting to degradation, genetic studies inCaenorhabditis elegans attributed a negative regulatory role to Sli-1, the c-Cbl ortholog of worms (2Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This function is reminiscent of the action of c-Cbl downstream to the PGDFR (3Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and it depends on a catalytically intact kinase domain of EGFR. The present study addressed the structural motif of c-Cbl involved in ubiquitination of EGFR. Although the 120-kDa c-Cbl protein possesses no identifiable catalytic activity, its NH2-terminal half carries a novel phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PYB) (4Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), that presumably mediates binding to the activated receptor (5Galisteo M.L. Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Langdon W.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20242-20245Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of c-Cbl comprises several proline-rich tracts that allow constitutive binding of Src homology 3 (SH3)-containing proteins, such as Grb2, Nck, and the Cbl-associated protein, CAP (reviewed in Ref. 6Thien C.B.F. Langdon W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, the COOH terminus is involved in inducible interactions with SH2-containing proteins, such as the regulatory subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Vav. An evolutionarily conserved RING-type zinc finger domain separates the adaptor domains of c-Cbl. RING fingers (RFs) are zinc-binding domains that differ from other zinc finger motifs in terms of structure and the zinc ligation scheme (reviewed in Ref. 7Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Noteworthy is the fact that the two other family members of c-Cbl carry an intact RF (8Keane M.M. Riverolezcano O.M. Mitchell J.A. Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar, 9Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Banerjee P. Cuello M. Penninger J. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3365-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but oncogenic Cbl variants are defective in the RF (10Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.D. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar, 11Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our present study concentrated on the role the RF motif plays in Cbl-mediated degradation of EGFR. EGF was purchased from Sigma, and radioactive materials were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Rabbit anti-c-Cbl (C-15) antibodies, anti-EGFR, and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to phosphotyrosine were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A mAb to the active doubly phosphorylated form of Erk was from Sigma. The compositions of TBST, HNTG, binding-binding and solubilization buffers were as described (12Waterman H. Sabanai I. Geiger B. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13819-13827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin was radiolabeled by using IODO-GEN (Pierce) and Na125I. We have previously described the construction of c-Cbl, 70Z-Cbl, and v-Cbl in the pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) containing the HA sequence tag (13Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar). To generate C381A-Cbl (cysteine 381 mutated to an alanine), we used the Stratagene Quick-change mutagenesis kit. The ubiquitin-hemagglutinin A (Ub-HA) expression vector was a gift from Dirk Bohmann (EBI, Heidelberg, Germany). The protocols for transfection of CHO cells were exactly as described (1Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). A bacterial pGEX4T2 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for expression of GST-Cbl proteins. GST-fusion proteins were affinity-purified on gluthatione-agarose as described previously (13Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min) and analyzed either directly or after immunoprecipitation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (12Waterman H. Sabanai I. Geiger B. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13819-13827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Down-regulation of EGFR was assayed as described (12Waterman H. Sabanai I. Geiger B. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13819-13827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Forin vitro kinase assays, EGFR immunoprecipitates were incubated for 15 min on ice in HNTG containing 5 mmMnCl2 and 0.01 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The immobilized immunocomplexes were then washed and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Transfection of the indicated vectors was performed in triplicates with a reporter pSRE-Fluc plasmid (4 μg), containing one copy of the SRE cloned upstream to the Fos minimal promoter (nucleotides −53/+45) and the luciferase gene (14Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with EGF (20 ng/ml) or left untreated for 12 h. Whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in 30 μl of 1 × lysis buffer (Promega). Cellular debris were removed and a 10-μl aliquot mixed with 100 μl of luciferin buffer (0.1 m Tris acetic acid, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 74 mm luciferin, and 2.2 μm ATP). Light intensity was measured by using a luminometer. The results were normalized to protein concentrations. EGFR was immunoprecipitated from A-431 cell lysates with an agarose-immobilized mAb SG565 and used as a substrate. Following purification, agarose beads were extensively washed and resuspended in a buffer containing 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATPγS, and 125I-labeled ubiquitin (3 μg/ml). To deplete endogenous ATP, we added hexokinase (1 mg/ml) and 2-deoxyglucose (20 mm). Crude rabbit reticulocyte lysate (5 μl, from Promega) was added to the reactions. Reaction mixtures were supplemented with GST fusion proteins as indicated (5 μg) and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The beads were then extensively washed and EGFR eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to electrophoresis. The recently reported ability of c-Cbl to enhance degradation of the EGFR (1Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (3Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) can explain the phenotype of Sli-1 mutant worms (2Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), but they leave open the mechanism underlying increased ubiquitination and degradation. For several reasons we suspected that the RF domain of c-Cbl is involved in ubiquitination. First, the centrally located RF is flanked on both sides by functional adaptor domains, but its own activity is unknown. Second, the RF-defective oncogenic forms of c-Cbl, namely: the CAS NS-1 retrovirus-encoded v-Cbl (11Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and the 70Z-Cbl of pre-B cell lymphoma (10Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.D. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar), cannot mediate accelerated degradation of EGFR (1Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Third, the RFs of several proteins, for example the corresponding region of the DCC (deleted in colon cancer)-binding protein, Siah (15Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), can promote proteolysis via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To test involvement of the RF, we mutated cysteine 381, the first cysteine of the C3HC4zinc finger motif, to an alanine. This mutation is expected to completely disrupt site-1 of the cross-brace zinc ligation motif (7Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The ability of the mutant protein, which we denoted C381A-Cbl, to affect ligand-induced removal of EGFR from the cell surface (“down-regulation”) was compared with that of the wild type c-Cbl and its two oncogenic variants. CHO cells expressing no endogenous EGFR were co-transfected with an EGFR expression vector, along with Cbl-encoding plasmids. The results presented in Fig.1 A demonstrate that while c-Cbl overexpression caused remarkable acceleration of ligand-induced clearance of EGFR from the cell surface, the two oncogenic form of c-Cbl as well as the RF mutant could not enhance receptor disappearance (Fig. 1 A). To substantiate the effect on down-regulation, we examined the effect of C381A-Cbl on EGFR degradation and ubiquitination. In accord with our previous results, c-Cbl overexpression induced both limited degradation of EGFR and up-smearing of the protein band (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). Both C381A-Cbl and 70Z-Cbl were inactive. Western blotting with antibodies to epitope-tagged ubiquitin molecules confirmed that the up-smearing effect of c-Cbl was due to extensive ubiquitin ligation to EGFR (Fig.1 B, middle panel). As expected, both C381A-Cbl and 70Z-Cbl were unable to induce receptor ubiquitination. Moreover, the basal ubiquitination of EGFR was slightly decreased in the presence of 70Z-Cbl. Despite its inability to induce down-regulation, degradation, and ubiquitination, C381A-Cbl retained physical association with EGFR following ligand stimulation, as was shown by a co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). Likewise, both mutant Cbl proteins exhibited enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation. In addition, their basal phosphorylation was significantly higher than that of the wild type c-Cbl (Fig. 1 C), reminiscent of the elevated phosphorylation of EGFR in cells stably expressing 70Z-Cbl (16Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results obtained with the point-mutated Cbl protein indicate that the RF is critically involved in ligand-induced degradation of EGFR and in the preceding ubiquitination step. The ability of the RF mutant of c-Cbl to form a complex with EGFR (Fig.1 B) and to undergo ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C) implied that it may inhibit interaction of the wild type form of c-Cbl with ligand-stimulated EGFR. Ligand-induced ubiquitin ligation to EGFR was selected as a functional read-out of the interactions between c-Cbl and the activated receptor (1Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). CHO cells transiently co-overexpressing c-Cbl and EGFR exhibited ligand- and c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of EGFR (Fig.2, upper panel). This effect was significantly inhibited upon co-transfection with a plasmid encoding 70Z-Cbl, but the RF mutant induced a more dramatic inhibitory effect (Fig. 2, middle and lower panels). These differences in efficiency between C381A and 70Z-Cbl proteins may reflect disparate modes of action. Conceivably, the dominant negative effect of C381A-Cbl is due to its binding to EGFR via the uninterrupted phosphotyrosine-binding motif at its NH2 terminus (4Lupher Jr., M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), thereby blocking accessibility of the ubiquitination-competent wild type c-Cbl. However, other mechanisms of inhibition of the wild type protein cannot be excluded. For example, mutagenesis of the RF of Siah-1 abrogated DCC degradation but also stabilized Siah-1 and changed its subcellular localization (15Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Besides effects on protein stability and subcellular localization, RF mutagenesis may alter the protein oligomerization state, as is the case with the cancer-disposing mutant of the breast and ovarian cancer tumor suppressor protein, BRCA1. Replacement of one cysteine of the RF of BRCA1 increased proteolytic susceptibility and perturbed the oligomerization properties of BRCA1 in solution (17Brzovic P.S. Meza J. King M.C. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7795-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We currently investigate the relevance of these potential mechanisms to c-Cbl. Genetic analyses of Cbl/Sli-1 function inC. elegans (2Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) imply that Cbl proteins normally decrease the potency of EGF signaling through the Ras-MAPK pathway. Therefore we examined the effect of RF mutagenesis on transcriptional activity downstream to this pathway. The SRE of the Fos promoter integrates several signaling pathways, including the Ras-MAPK route (reviewed in Ref. 18Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Indeed, when EGFR was transiently expressed in CHO cells, a 2–3-fold stimulation of transcription from the SRE was observed following activation by EGF (Fig.3 A). Co-transfection with the wild-type form of c-Cbl completely blocked the effect of EGF. By contrast, the RF mutant, C381A-Cbl, has lost this negative function, and 70Z-Cbl further enhanced the effect of EGF on transcription from the SRE (Fig. 3 A). The disparate effects of the two mutants are reminiscent of the differences observed in other assays (Figs. 1and 2), and they may be attributed to the type of mutation. Whereas a single residue of the RF was replaced in C381A-Cbl, 17 residues, including Cys-381 and two tyrosines whose function is unknown (19Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), are deleted in 70Z-Cbl. We next assayed a signaling step preceding SRE transcription, namely MAPK activity. Western blotting of whole cell extracts with a mAb specific to the catalytically active, doubly phosphorylated form of the MAPK/Erk revealed rapid, but transient, stimulation in response to EGF treatment (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the effect on the SRE, overexpression of c-Cbl almost abolished basal and ligand-induced MAPK activity. Both C381A-Cbl and 70Z-Cbl were unable to block MAPK activation (Fig. 3 B). In fact, the two proteins weakly, but reproducibly, enhanced the effect of EGF, in accord with their inhibitory effect on down-regulation. It is worth noting that a previous work (16Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported on the ability of 70Z-Cbl to enhance recruitment of several components of the Ras-MAPK pathway (e.g. Grb2, Shc, and Sos1), but no effect on Erk activity was detectable. The involvement of the RF of c-Cbl in ubiquitination of EGFR in living cells (Figs. 1 and 2) and the recent influx of reports on the direct involvement of RFs in degradation of various substrates (15Hu G. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 21Kwon Y.T. Reiss Y. Fried V.A. Hershko A. Yoon J.K. Gonda D.K. Sangan P. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7898-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) prompted us to test C381A-Cbl in a cell-free system. To reconstitute in vitro a c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitin ligation reaction, we immunoprecipitated EGFR from human epidermoid A-431 carcinoma cells, where the receptor is highly overexpressed. The antibody-receptor complexes were extensively washed and then supplemented with bacterially expressed c-Cbl, 70Z-Cbl, or C381A-Cbl fused to GST. To follow its covalent ligation to EGFR we radiolabeled ubiquitin and supplemented the reaction mixture with a reticulocyte lysate, a well characterized rich source of ubiquitin-processing enzymes (22Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). Following incubation at 30 °C, removal of all reaction components but the substrate and electrophoretic separation, we observed the formation of a complex between the EGFR and 125I-ubiquitin molecules (Fig. 4, upper panel). No complex was formed in the absence of ATP, probably due to the necessity to activate ubiquitin by means of adenylation. As expected from our studies with living cells (Fig. 1), neither C381A-Cbl nor 70Z-Cbl were active in vitro, although control experiments verified proper expression and immunological reactivity of the corresponding GST fusion proteins (data not shown). To confirm that the catalytic activity was retained in all samples, we performed anin vitro kinase assay in the presence or absence of labeled ATP (Fig. 4, lower panel). Taken together, the results presented in Fig. 4 imply that the RF domain enables participation of c-Cbl in the three-step ubiquitination reaction (22Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). Regardless of the exact role of c-Cbl in the cascade of ubiquitin transfer reactions, our study clearly indicates that an intact RING finger domain is essential for this modification of EGFR. Taken together with previous reports, our present studies propose a structure-function picture of c-Cbl and its family members, Cbl-b (8Keane M.M. Riverolezcano O.M. Mitchell J.A. Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar) and Cbl-3 (9Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.A. Nau M.M. Banerjee P. Cuello M. Penninger J. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3365-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which share with c-Cbl an extremely well conserved RF. Thus, the NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of Cbl act as adaptor domains that bind a phosphotyrosine and SH2/3 proteins, respectively, whereas the intervening RF mediates ubiquitination of specific substrates. Because Cbl recruitment to all receptors, including antigen and growth factor receptors, is inducible and depends on receptor phosphorylation or association with phosphorylated proteins (reviewed in Ref. 6Thien C.B.F. Langdon W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it is likely that the phosphotyrosine-binding domain selects substrates for ubiquitination. Motifs located COOH-terminally to the RF, through their ability to recruit other proteins, either constitutively (e.g. Grb2) or in an inducible manner (e.g. Crk and 14-3-3) may regulate the RF-mediated ubiquitin ligation reaction. Potentially, Cbl regulation may also involve redistribution within the cytoplasm because a fraction of the protein translocates into EGFR-loaded endosomes upon activation by EGF (1Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). c-Cbl regulation may now be addressed by using the dominant negative mutant we described in this report. Moreover, the in vitro ubiquitination assay we established appears useful for studying c-Cbl and its mutants and homologues in a cell-free system (23Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lari S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Nature. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2039975110,"Erythropoietin (Epo) initiates its cellular response by binding to the Epo receptor, which triggers the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 5 protein. Cell culture studies of erythroid progenitors have suggested that Epo functions as a survival factor by repressing apoptosis at least in part through Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family. In this report, we examine whether Stat5 can induce transactivation of the bcl-x gene in response to Epo. Two Epo-responsive progenitor cell lines, HCD-57 and Bcl-2-transfected Ba/F3-Epo receptor (Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2), were used in this study. After Epo stimulation, we observed a correlation between expression ofbcl-x L and activation of Stat5 as assessed by the expression of oncostatin M, a direct target of Stat5, and the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat5. Moreover, a Stat binding element in the bcl-x promoter was found to be active in response to Epo, a finding that was further confirmed because mutagenesis of this sequence motif abrogated its promoter activity and overexpression of a dominant negative Stat5 protein blocked transactivation. When DNA-protein binding analyses were performed, we found that Stat5, not Stat1 or Stat3, was the protein bound to the bcl-x promoter in response to Epo. These data suggest that Epo-dependent activation of Stat5 is a transcriptional pathway that can be used by Epo-responsive progenitor cells to induce the expression of bcl-xLand consequently to inhibit apoptosis.

The intracellular molecular pathways that regulate the survival of primitive erythroid progenitors are still poorly understood.

Epo binds to a specific cell surface receptor that is expressed on erythroid progenitors (3Wognum A.W. Lansdorp P.M. Humphries R.K. Krystal G. Blood. 1990; 76: 697-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sawyer S.T. Krantz S.B. Goldwasser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5554-5562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Epo receptor associates with Jak2, a member of a subfamily of protein tyrosine kinases, which plays an important role in cytokine-dependent gene regulation. Activated Jak2, in turn, converts a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, Stat5, into its active form by tyrosine phosphorylation. The activated Stat5 translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA response elements in the promoter region of target genes and activates transcription (5Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar, 6Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 7Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the ability of interleukin-2 to signal activation of Stat5 in 32D lymphocytes is directly related to its ability to promote protection from apoptosis and long-term cell growth (8Zamorano J. Wang H.Y. Wang R. Shi Y. Longmore G.D. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3502-3512PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, growth factor-independent activation of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway in Nb2 lymphocytes protects these cells against apoptosis induced in the absence of growth factor (9Rui H. Xu J. Mehta S. Fang H. Williams J. Dong F. Grimley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that a member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis-regulatory proteins, Bcl-xL (10Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar), but not Bcl-2, is highly expressed in the erythroleukemic cell lines HEL and K562 (11Benito A. Silva M. Grillot D. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the constitutive expression of Bcl-xL protects cells from apoptosis induced by differentiation inducer agents. Furthermore, Epo maintains survival and represses apoptosis of HCD-57 erythroid progenitor cells through the expression of Bcl-xL(12Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This anti-apoptotic protein is down-regulated after Epo withdrawal in HCD-57 cells, and the cells undergo apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, when HCD-57 cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding Bcl-xL are cultured in the absence of Epo, the endogenous level of Bcl-xL is down-regulated, but the cells remain viable, further indicating that the expression of Bcl-xL is mediated by Epo and that this is an important mechanism to repress apoptosis in erythroid progenitors. The relevance of this association has been suggested in patients with polycythemia vera, in whom autonomous Epo-independent erythroid cells arise from monoclonal progenitors. These abnormal progenitor cells exhibit a deregulated expression of Bcl-xL that may contribute to bypass the need for the growth factor and may consequently explain their Epo-independent survival (13Silva M. Richard C. Benito A. Sanz C. Olalla Y. Fernandez-Luna J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 564-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The genomic organization and promoter region of the bcl-xgene have recently been determined (14Grillot D. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nuñez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar), which facilitates the analysis of the transcriptional factors involved in the expression ofbcl-x. In the present study, we have examined whether Epo induces the expression of bcl-xL through activation of Stat5 to better understand the molecular basis for the survival of erythroid progenitor cells. We have identified an Epo-responsive motif for the binding of a Stat protein (Stat binding element) in the untranslated 5′ region of the mouse bcl-xgene. Furthermore, we have shown that Stat5 binds to the Epo-responsive motif and that this motif is active in response to Epo because transient transfection experiments showed activity of a reporter gene in the presence of Epo that can be abrogated by mutagenesis of the Stat binding element or overexpression of a dominant negative Stat5 protein. These findings suggest that at least one of the molecular pathways that maintains the survival of erythroid progenitors may be triggered by the interaction of Epo with its specific receptor, which induces the expression of Bcl-xL through the binding of Stat5 to thebcl-x promoter. The murine Epo-dependent HCD-57 cell line was maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (12Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells stably expressing the Epo receptor (15Liboi E. Carroll M. D'Andrea A.D. Mathey-Prevot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11351-11355Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were transfected by electroporation (960 microfarads; 250 V) with 20 μg of the pSFFV-Neo plasmid containing bcl-2. Individual cell clones were selected for growth in the presence of G418 (1 mg/ml) and hygromycin B (1 μg/ml) by limiting dilution. Three individual clones expressing high levels of Bcl-2 were randomly selected and used by virtue of resistance to apoptosis. Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 clones were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Seromed Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, CA), 2 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 unit/ml recombinant murine Epo (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In some experiments, Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells were starved of Epo for 20 h and then treated with 100 μm aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) (Sigma) for 12 h. Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). To assess mRNA expression, a semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR method was used as described previously (12Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The generated cDNA was amplified by using primers for murine bcl-x, bax (12Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andoncostatin M (5′-TTGATTCAGGGGTCTGATGAC-3′ and 5′-AAATTAGTCATGTCCCTCCAAG-3′). The amplification profile was as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. After 25 amplification cycles, the expected PCR products (344 base pairs for bcl-xL, 194 base pairs for bax, and 658 base pairs for oncostatin M) were size fractionated onto a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Cells were cultured in the absence of Epo for 24 h and then stimulated for 30 min with Epo. For preparation of nuclear lysates, cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer (0.05% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μm iodoacetamide, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Pellets were resuspended in 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 2% glycerol, 40 mm Tris-base, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm ammonium molybdate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 15 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate and protease inhibitors. After the samples were spun, the supernatants were used as nuclear extracts. The expression of Stat5 and GATA-1 proteins in the nuclear fraction was determined by Western blotting as described previously (11Benito A. Silva M. Grillot D. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with mouse anti-Stat5 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or rat anti-GATA-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rat antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Bound antibody was detected by a chemiluminescence system (Tropix). Cells were cultured in the absence of Epo for 24 h and then stimulated for different time intervals with Epo and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Lysates were cleared of debris, and the supernatants were incubated with rabbit anti-Stat5b conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which recognizes both Stat5a and Stat5b. Proteins eluted from the agarose beads were electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (11Benito A. Silva M. Grillot D. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with mouse anti-Stat5 or mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (Transduction Laboratories), and bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (Tropix). Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells were cultured in the absence of serum and Epo for 24 h and then stimulated with 100 units/ml Epo for 30 min. Cells were lysed in 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm sodium molibdate and protease inhibitors. Whole cell lysates were spun, and the nuclear fractions were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.4 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm sodium molibdate and protease inhibitors. As described elsewhere (16Garcia R. Yu C.L. Hudnall A. Catlett R. Nelson K.L. Smithgall T. Fujita D.J. Ethier S.P. Jove R. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear extracts (5 μg of total protein) were incubated with a 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA probe (5′-TTTGGAGAAAGGCATTTCGGAGAAAAG-3′) from the promoter region of the mouse bcl-x gene (14Grillot D. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nuñez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar), thebcl-x probe carrying a mutated Stat binding site, or aβ-casein probe, which contains a consensus binding site for Stat5 (5′-AGATTTCTAGGAATTCAATCC-3′). Samples were run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 200 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Supershifts were performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for Stat5, Stat1, or Stat3 proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For competition assays, nuclear extracts containing equal amounts of total protein were pre-incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of either unlabeled bcl-x probe or unlabeled irrelevant DNA fragment. Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells were cultured in the absence of Epo for 20 h and then transfected by electroporation (270 V; 960 microfarads) with 50 μg of a luciferase reporter vector containing a 0.6-kb fragment of the bcl-xpromoter (pGL2-0.6R or pGL2-0.6L) (14Grillot D. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nuñez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar) and 2.5 μg of the pRL-TK vector (Promega, Madison, WI) used to normalize the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. When indicated, cells were co-transfected with pGL2-0.6R and 25 μg of a vector containing a truncated form of Stat5 that lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain (Stat5Δ750). The Stat5Δ750 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. B. Groner, Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Freiburg, Germany) (17Berchtold S. Moriggl R. Gouilleux F. Silvennoinen O. Beisenherz C. Pfitzner E. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30237-30243Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRI site of the pSFFV-Neo vector (11Benito A. Silva M. Grillot D. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated with or without 2 units/ml Epo for 16 h, and the luciferase activity was analyzed by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis of the pGL2-0.6R vector was carried out by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers 5′-AGGCATTGAGGATAAAAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTTTTATCCTCAATGCCT-3′. The 0.6R DNA insert was sequenced to verify the mutation. We have previously shown that Epo can function as a survival factor by repressing apoptosis through the expression of Bcl-xL (12Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Epo induces the expression of a number of genes through activation of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway (18Damen J.E. Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 1455-1459PubMed Google Scholar), we first studied whether the expression of bcl-xLcorrelated with the expression of oncostatin M, a member of the interleukin-6-related cytokine subfamily induced by Epo and a direct target of Stat5 (19Yoshimura A. Ichihara M. Kinjyo I. Moriyama M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). When two Epo-responsive cell lines, HCD-57 and Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2, were cultured in the absence of Epo, the levels of oncostatin M and bcl-xLmRNA were down-regulated by 24 h after Epo withdrawal as assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Fig.1). Re-addition of Epo to growth factor-starved cells up-regulated the expression of bothbcl-xL and oncostatin M. As shown in Fig. 1, the mRNA levels ofbcl-xL increased 1 h after the addition of Epo and continued to accumulate. At 16 h, the expression of bcl-x L was similar to that of control cells. The levels of oncostatin M mRNA started to increase within 15 min and reached a maximal level of expression at 30 min to 1 h, decreasing thereafter to baseline levels. To study whether the induction of bcl-xL requiresde novo protein synthesis, Epo-starved cells were pretreated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min, a dose that blocked more than 90% of protein synthesis within 15 min as determined by [35S]methionine incorporation analysis (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, oncostatin M mRNA levels were further elevated in cells treated with cycloheximide plus Epo relative to cells treated with Epo alone. In addition, a modest hyperinduction of bcl-x L mRNA was also observed in cells treated with cycloheximide plus Epo. Therefore, Epo induces the early expression of bcl-x L and oncostatin M in HCD-57 and Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells, and althoughbcl-x L follows a kinetics delayed relative to the rapid induction of oncostatin M, both genes are induced in a protein synthesis-independent manner. In contrast, the steady-state mRNA levels of bax, another bcl-2-family member that promotes apoptosis (20Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5823) Google Scholar), were not regulated by Epo stimulation or by treatment with cycloheximide plus Epo. The activation of a Jak2-Stat5 signaling pathway by ATA, a triphenylmethane derivative with anti-apoptotic properties, has been recently described in Nb2 lymphocytes (9Rui H. Xu J. Mehta S. Fang H. Williams J. Dong F. Grimley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells were starved of Epo for 20 h and then treated with ATA in the absence of Epo for a 12 h-period, the expression of both bcl-x L andoncostatin M was the same as that of cells stimulated with Epo (Fig. 2), indicating that the activation of the Jak2-Stat5 pathway correlates with the expression ofbcl-x L. To further ensure that treatment of Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells with Epo triggers the activation of Stat5, we studied the phosphorylation level and nuclear translocation of this transcription factor. As shown in Fig.3 A, in the absence of Epo, immunoprecipitated Stat5 remained unphosphorylated. However, after 10 min of Epo stimulation, Stat5 was tyrosine phosphorylated, and this level of phosphorylation was maintained or even increased in some experiments by 30 min after Epo stimulation. Furthermore, the expression of Stat5 was the same at all time points, indicating that the detection of phosphorylated Stat5 correlated with Epo stimulation (Fig. 3 A). Because tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 is normally followed by dimerization and nuclear translocation, we also examined the presence of Stat5 in the nucleus of Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Stat5 was translocated to the nucleus only in response to Epo, as assessed by Western blotting with an anti-Stat5 antibody. Stripping the membrane and reprobing with antibody against the nuclear factor GATA-1 showed that protein loading was similar in the samples (Fig. 3 B); consequently, the differences in nuclear expression of Stat5 were due to the stimulation with Epo. Although the results shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 were obtained with a single Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 clone, similar conclusions were reached with two other clones (data not shown).Figure 2Analysis of bcl-x L and oncostatin MmRNA in Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells treated with ATA .

The same filters were stripped and re-blotted with a monoclonal anti-Stat5 antibody. B, cells were cultured in the absence of Epo for 24 h and then stimulated for 30 min with Epo (+) or left untreated (−).

Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nuñez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar). This region contains a sequence upstream of the translation initiation codon in exon 2 consistent with a Stat binding element known as the interferon-γ activation site (GAS) (7Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). As shown by transfection with reporter constructs, the constitutive activity induced by a 3.2-kb genomic fragment upstream of exon 2 was mainly contained within a 0.6-kb 3′ sequence (0.6R) (Ref. 10Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar; Fig.4 A). To study the promoter activity of this fragment, which contained the Stat binding element, a 0.6R luciferase vector was transiently transfected into Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells. The constitutive expression of Bcl-2 allowed these cells to survive in the absence of Epo during a 20–24-h period, which was a critical step before the stimulation with Epo that minimized the activation of factors involved in Epo-mediated signal transduction. The same analysis was performed in three independent Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 clones, which yielded similar results (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows a representative experiment with one of these clones. The levels of luciferase activity detected in the Epo-stimulated cells were significantly higher than those observed in unstimulated cells (>2.5-fold) (Fig. 4 B). As a control, another construct containing a 0.6-kb 5′ fragment (0.6L) upstream of the 0.6R fragment was analyzed for luciferase activity in response to Epo. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the luciferase activity detected in Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells transfected with a 0.6L luciferase vector was low in both the Epo-stimulated and unstimulated cell populations. When we examined the entire 1.2-kb fragment (0.6L and 0.6R), we found that the luciferase activity was similar to that obtained with the 0.6R fragment (data not shown). To further clarify the functional specificity of the Stat binding element contained in the 0.6R fragment, a mutagenesis analysis was performed. We mutated three bases within this sequence motif (normal, TTCGGAGAA; mutant, TGAGGATAA) and transfected Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells with a 0.6R mutant luciferase vector. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the levels of luciferase activity were significantly lower than those observed with Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells transfected with the normal 0.6R luciferase construct (2.5-fold). Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the Epo-stimulated cells and the unstimulated cells, indicating the importance of the Stat binding element in Epo-induced transactivation of the bcl-x promoter. Interestingly, this Epo-induced activation is dependent on endogenous Stat5, as demonstrated by the ability of overexpressed Stat5Δ750, which lacks the transactivation domain and exerts a dominant negative effect (21Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), to block this induction (Fig. 4 B). Stat5 has been shown to be the main factor that mediates the effect of Epo on the transcription of genes in erythroid cells (18Damen J.E. Krystal G. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 1455-1459PubMed Google Scholar). To study whether Stat5 mediates the effect of Epo onbcl-x L transcription, we carried out DNA-protein binding analyses to detect whether Stat5 can bind to thebcl-x promoter. A representative experiment with one of the Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 clones is shown in Fig.5. Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells starved of serum and Epo for 24 h and then stimulated with Epo for 30 min were analyzed in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts were prepared and used in a binding reaction with different radiolabeled probes. We first showed that treatment of cells with Epo resulted in the formation of a DNA-protein complex when using a probe from the β-casein promoter, a known target of Stat5, further indicating that Stat5 was activated in response to Epo. Similar results were obtained with a GAS element-containing sequence of thebcl-x promoter (bcl-x probe). No electrophoretic shift of the radiolabeled probe was observed in unstimulated cells. In contrast, a DNA-protein binding complex was induced by Epo (Fig. 5). Furthermore, a 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled bcl-xprobe competitively inhibited the formation of this complex. In contrast, no competition was observed when nuclear extracts were pre-incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of a nonspecific double-stranded oligonucleotide of the same size and nucleotide composition as the bcl-x probe. To further clarify the requirement for an intact GAS element, we tested the ability of the same DNA probe carrying a mutated GAS sequence (TGAGGATAA) to form a binding complex. As shown in Fig. 5, no mutant DNA-protein complex was observed in response to Epo. These differences cannot be accounted for by differences in nuclear protein concentration because an Oct-1-specific probe bound the same amount of Oct-1 complex in our nuclear extracts (data not shown). To identify the Stat family member bound to the GAS element of the bcl-x promoter in Epo-stimulated Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells, supershift experiments were performed using antibodies specific for Stat5, Stat1, and Stat3. As shown in Fig. 5, only Stat5-specific antibodies supershifted all of the DNA-protein complexes induced by Epo. Epo initiates its cellular response by binding to the Epo receptor expressed on the surface of immature erythroblasts (3Wognum A.W. Lansdorp P.M. Humphries R.K. Krystal G. Blood. 1990; 76: 697-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sawyer S.T. Krantz S.B. Goldwasser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5554-5562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After ligand binding, EpoR is known to activate a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase, Jak2, which in turn activates a transcription factor, Stat5, triggering a signal transduction cascade that leads to the development of early erythroid progenitors into mature erythroblast cells (22Penta K. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31282-31287Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the absence of Epo, erythroid progenitors die, and their genomic DNA is degraded into oligonucleosomal fragments, a feature of apoptotic cell death (1Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Science. 1990; 248: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Several members of the bcl-2 family of apoptosis-regulatory genes that function as inhibitors of apoptosis in hematopoietic cells have been identified (10Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2908) Google Scholar, 23Nuñez G. Clarke M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 399-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that when the Epo-dependent erythroid progenitor cell line HCD-57 is cultured in the absence of Epo, the expression of Bcl-xL is rapidly down-regulated, and this is accompanied by the activation of an apoptotic process (12Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive expression of Bcl-xL rescues erythroid progenitors from apoptosis induced by Epo deprivation, suggesting that Epo can function as a survival factor by repressing apoptosis through Bcl-xL in erythroid progenitor cells. In an attempt to identify the signaling pathway involved in the transactivation of thebcl-x promoter in erythroid cells, we analyzed two Epo-dependent cell lines, HCD-57 and Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2. HCD-57 is a murine erythroid progenitor cell line that undergoes erythroid differentiation in the presence of hemin (12Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ba/F3-EpoR is a murine progenitor cell line stably transfected with the Epo receptor that proliferates and undergoes limited erythroid differentiation in Epo (15Liboi E. Carroll M. D'Andrea A.D. Mathey-Prevot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11351-11355Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Chiva T. Nagata Y. Kishi A. Sakamaki K. Miyajima A. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Todokoro K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11593-11597Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have transfected this cell line with bcl-2(Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2) to avoid apoptosis when cultured in the absence of Epo. The early induction of bcl-x L mRNA after Epo stimulation followed an accumulation pattern that was maintained or even enhanced in the presence of cycloheximide. A protein synthesis-independent induction was also shown foroncostatin M, an early response gene induced by Epo through the Jak2-Stat5 pathway. It has been noted previously (25Tzung S.-P. Fausto N. Hockenbery D.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1985-1995PubMed Google Scholar) that bcl-x L behaves as a delayed early response gene in that it requires de novo protein synthesis during liver regeneration. However, it is important to consider that thebcl-x promoter contains characteristic motifs for the binding of several transcription factors, including Ets-1, AP4, NF-E2, Evi-1, GATA-1, and AP-1 (14Grillot D. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nuñez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests thatbcl-x L may be induced by different transcriptional pathways distinguished by their requirement for de novoprotein synthesis, among other features. Because a Stat binding element has been found in the promoter region of the bcl-x gene (26Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Yamahuchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we studied the promoter activity of this sequence motif in response to Epo in Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells. We found that the Stat binding element responded to Epo by promoting the expression of a reporter gene and that this sequence specifically bound Stat5 as assessed by DNA-protein binding analysis. The observation that the Jak-Stat signaling pathway seems to be necessary to prevent apoptosis in erythroid progenitors in response to Epo (27Jacobs-Helber S.M. Penta K. Sun Z. Lawson A. Sawyer S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6850-6853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is consistent with this finding. It has been shown that the Epo-dependent inhibition of apoptosis is blocked by the ectopic expression of kinase-deficient dominant negative forms of Jak2, suggesting an essential role for this tyrosine kinase in the apoptotic pathway (28Zhuang H. Niu Z. He T.C. Patel S.V. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14500-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have activated the Jak-Stat pathway by treating Ba/F3-EpoR-Bcl-2 cells with ATA. This compound mimicks growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and activation of Stat5, resulting in the induction of Stat5-regulated genes (9Rui H. Xu J. Mehta S. Fang H. Williams J. Dong F. Grimley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ATA does not seem to regulate other members of the Stat family, nor does it affect Jak3. Consistent with this specificity, we found that ATA mimicked Epo-induced expression of oncostatin M, a direct target of Stat5 (19Yoshimura A. Ichihara M. Kinjyo I. Moriyama M. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and bcl-x L. These data suggest a model in which Epo triggers the activation of the Jak2-Stat5 transduction pathway, and Stat5 induces the expression of bcl-x Lthat blocks the apoptotic machinery of Epo-responsive progenitor cell lines. Very recently, it has been shown that the phenotypes of mutant mice that have the Stat5 genes deleted demonstrate an essential role for these proteins in physiological responses associated with growth hormone and prolactin, whereas the responses to a variety of cytokines, including Epo, are largely unaffected (29Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). However, the expression of Bcl-xL was not analyzed in any cellular compartment. It is likely that in these deficient mice, the expression ofbcl-x Lis diminished or abrogated, and other members of the Bcl-2-family promote erythroid progenitor survival. Consistent with this finding, it has been shown that HCD-57 erythroid cells express both Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, which are down-regulated after Epo withdrawal (12Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that although Bcl-xL seems to be the predominant anti-apoptotic protein in this cell line, Bcl-2 may contribute to cell survival. Consequently, transcription factors other than Stat5 may induce the expression of survival genes (i.e. bcl-2) in response to Epo. Alternatively, it is possible that other transcription factors may induce the expression of bcl-x. In fact, it has been shown that Stat1 mediates the expression of bcl-x in cardiac myocytes after induction with leukemia inhibitory factor (26Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Yamahuchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); however, we have shown that neither Stat1 nor Stat3 was able to bind the Stat-binding element from the bcl-x promoter. Consistent with these data, it has been described that in human primary erythroid precursors, only Stat5, not Stat1 or Stat3, is activated after stimulation with Epo (30Oda A. Sawada K. Druker B.J. Ozaki K. Takano H. Koizumi K. Fukada Y. Handa M. Koike T. Ikeda Y. Blood. 1998; 92: 443-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which makes it unlikely that other Stat proteins might transactivatebcl-x in erythroid cells. A more likely candidate might be GATA-1 because a consensus motif for transcription factors of the GATA family has been identified in the promoter region of bcl-x(14Grillot D. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nuñez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar). GATA-1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation of erythroid progenitor survival and differentiation by preventing apoptosis (31Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our data indicate that Epo-mediated activation of Stat5 can induce the expression ofbcl-x L in Epo-responsive progenitor cell lines; although there may be other transcriptional pathways involved in this process, we show for the first time a transactivation mechanism of thebcl-x promoter induced by Epo, which may account at least in part for the anti-apoptotic activity of Epo in erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1932013657,"Chemokines are thought to contribute to the cellular infiltrate characteristic of renal transplant rejection. We show that Met-RANTES, a chemokine receptor antagonist, suppresses recruitment of inflammatory cells into renal allografts. In a renal transplant model (Fisher RT1(lvl) rat kidney into Lewis RT1(l) rat) where no additional immune suppressant was used, Met-RANTES-treated animals showed a significant reduction in vascular injury score (16.10 +/- 5.20 vs. 62.67 +/- 18.64) and tubular damage score (15.70 +/- 5.22 vs. 33.00 +/- 6.44) relative to untreated animals. In a more severe rejection model (Brown-Norway RT1(n) rat kidney into Lewis RT1(1) rat), Met-RANTES significantly augmented low-dose cyclosporin A treatment to reduce all aspects of renal injury including interstitial inflammation (score 71.00 +/- 6.10 vs. 157.30 +/- 21.30). The majority of infiltrating cells in these models (60-70%) consisted of monocytes. Potential mechanisms of action of Met-RANTES were tested using monocyte attachment assays on microvascular endothelium under physiological flow conditions. Preexposure of microvascular endothelium to RANTES resulted in RANTES immobilization and RANTES-induced firm adhesion of monocytes only after prestimulation of the endothelium with IL-1beta. Met-RANTES completely inhibited this RANTES-mediated arrest. Thus, Met-RANTES may counter acute rejection by blocking leukocyte firm adhesion to inflamed endothelium."
https://openalex.org/W2118873017,"As first observed by Wittenberg (Kesti, T., Flick, K., Keranen, S., Syvaoja, J. E., and Wittenburg, C. (1999)Mol. Cell 3, 679–685), we find that deletion mutants lacking the entire N-terminal DNA polymerase domain of yeast pol e are viable. However, we now show that point mutations in DNA polymerase catalytic residues of pol e are lethal. Taken together, the phenotypes of the deletion and the point mutants suggest that the polymerase of pol e may normally participate in DNA replication but that another polymerase can substitute in its complete absence. Substitution is inefficient because the deletion mutants have serious defects in DNA replication. This observation raises the question of what is the essential function of the C-terminal half of pol e. We show that the ability of the C-terminal half of the polymerase to support growth is disrupted by mutations in the cysteine-rich region, which disrupts both dimerization of the POL2 gene product and interaction with the essential DPB2 subunit, suggesting that this region plays an important architectural role at the replication fork even in the absence of the polymerase function. Finally, the S phase checkpoint, with respect to both induction ofRNR3 transcription and cell cycle arrest, is intact in cells where replication is supported only by the C-terminal half of pol e, but it is disrupted in mutants affecting the cysteine-rich region, suggesting that this domain directly affects the checkpoint rather than acting through the N-terminal polymerase active site."
https://openalex.org/W2037913174,"Both estradiol binding and phosphorylation regulate transcriptional activation by the human estrogen receptor α (ER). We have previously shown that activation of the cyclin A-CDK2 complex by overexpression of cyclin A leads to enhanced ER-dependent transcriptional activation and that the cyclin A-CDK2 complex phosphorylates the ER N-terminal activation function-1 (AF-1) between residues 82 and 121. Within ER AF-1, serines 104, 106, and 118 represent potential CDK phosphorylation sites, and in this current study, we ascertain their importance in mediating cyclin A-CDK2-dependent enhancement of ER transcriptional activity. Cyclin A overexpression does not enhance transcriptional activation by an ER derivative bearing serine-to-alanine changes at residues 104, 106, and 118. Likewise, the cyclin A-CDK2 complex does not phosphorylate this triple-mutated derivative in vitro. Individual serine-to-alanine mutations at residues 104 and 106, but not 118, decrease ER-dependent transcriptional enhancement in response to cyclin A. The same relationship holds for ER phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 in vitro. Finally, enhancement of ER transcriptional activation by cyclin A is evident in the absence and presence of estradiol, as well as in the presence of tamoxifen, suggesting that the effect of the cyclin A-CDK2 on ER transcriptional activation is AF-2-independent. These results indicate that the enhancement of ER transcriptional activation by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex is mediated via the AF-1 domain by phosphorylation of serines 104 and 106. We propose that these residues control ER AF-1 activity in response to signals that affect cyclin A-CDK2 function.

The receptor is structurally similar to other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in that separate receptor activities such as DNA and ligand binding are localized to distinct regions of the protein (5Kumar V. Green S. Stack G. Berry M. Jin J.R. Chambon P. Cell. 1987; 51: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). ER contains at least two transcriptionally active domains: constitutively active AF-1 in the N terminus of the protein and ligand-dependent AF-2 at the ER C terminus. AF-1 and AF-2 can act independently or synergize to effect transcriptional activation (6Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7McInerney E.M. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interestingly, they are differentially affected by certain ligands such as tamoxifen, which blocks AF-2 action but activates AF-1, accounting for the mixed agonist-antagonist properties of this agent (8Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar, 9McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24172-24178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although ligand binding is considered essential for the full activation of ER, it has long been recognized that the receptor is subject to post-translational alterations, such as phosphorylation, which also regulate its activity (10Garabedian M.J. Rogatsky I. Hittelman A. Knoblauch R. Trowbridge J.M. Krstic M.D. Freedman L.P. Molecular Biology of Steroid and Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Birkhaeuser Boston, Cambridge, MA1998: 237-260Crossref Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of three N-terminus-located residues, serines 104, 106, and 118, which are the focus of our current studies, appears to regulate receptor-dependent transcriptional activation (11Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This additional level of regulation most likely serves to modulate receptor activity in a cell- and physiologically-specific manner. Indeed, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of steroid receptors may determine promoter specificity, cofactor interaction, strength and duration of receptor signaling, and ligand-independent receptor transactivation. Since ER can serve as a transcriptional repressor as well as an activator, effecting cellular proliferation in some settings and arrest or differentiation in others (13Blobel G.A. Sieff C.A.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), this level of complexity and flexibility is not surprising. Much work has been directed toward elucidating which circumstances induce ER phosphorylation and which receptor sites are the targets for this modification. Although a number of potential phosphorylation sites have been identified, the kinases that modify these residues are not fully established. In addition, ER phosphorylation patterns appear to be cell type-specific. Serine residues are the predominantly modified amino acids present in ER, and four of these (Ser-104, Ser-106, Ser-118, and Ser-167) are clustered in the N terminus within AF-1 of the receptor (12Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.-M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The sequence context surrounding serines 104, 106, and 118 suggests that they may be targeted by the serine/proline-directed protein kinases, which include mitogen-activated protein kinase family members, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Indeed, Ser-118 has been shown to be phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase family member, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK-1), in vitro and to facilitate ER ligand-independent activation in vivo (18Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 19Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Recent findings also suggest that Ser-118 is phosphorylated by a kinase distinct from mitogen-activated protein kinase upon estradiol treatment, suggesting that Ser-118 is the target for multiple kinases in vivo(20Joel P.B. Traish A.M. Lannigan D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Serine 167 has been shown to be phosphorylated by p90 rsk1 in vitro and to regulate ER AF-1-dependent transcriptional activation in vivo (21Joel P.B. Smith J. Sturgill T.W. Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Lannigan D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar); interestingly, this site also lies within the consensus sequence targeted by both calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and casein kinase II and has been reported to be phosphorylated by the latter in vitro, although the physiological significance of this finding remains uncharacterized (22Tzeng D.Z. Klinge C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Three of the putative phosphorylation sites, serines 104, 106, and 118, are critical for ER-dependent transcriptional enhancement and are phosphorylated in COS-1 cells (11Le Goff P. Montano M.M. Schodin D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4458-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify the kinase(s) responsible for this alteration, we have previously shown that the cyclin A-CDK2 complex phosphorylates ER between residues 82 and 121 in vitro and that overexpression of cyclin Ain vivo results in ligand-independent hyperphosphorylation of the receptor (23Trowbridge J.M. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10132-10137Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Regulatory effects of cyclin-CDK complexes upon steroid/nuclear receptors have been described for three other family members. The glucocorticoid receptor is phosphorylated by two cyclin-CDK complexes, A-CDK2 and E-CDK2 (24Krstic M.D. Rogatsky I. Yamamoto K.R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3947-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The progesterone receptor is phosphorylated by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, and the retinoic acid receptor is phosphorylated by cyclin H-CDK7, leading to ligand-dependent enhancement of receptor transcriptional activation (25Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Clement J.T. Prendergast P. Yip T.T. Hutchens T.W. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Rochette-Egly C.

To identify ER residues phosphorylated by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, we have generated a series of phosphorylation site-specific mutant ER derivatives at serines 104, 106, and 118, the three potential CDK phosphorylation sites. We examined the effect of cyclin A overexpression on ER transcriptional activation of these serine-to-alanine mutants, individually and collectively, in cultured mammalian cells and also determined whether these sites are phosphorylated by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex in vitro. Our results suggest that the effect of cyclin A-CDK2 on ER transcriptional activation is mediated by phosphorylation of serines 104 and 106. Phosphorylation site mutants were generated via a two-step polymerase chain reaction process wherein overlapping primers (a “top” strand and a “bottom” strand; Genelink, Thornwood, NY) bearing the mutation of interest were mixed and amplified. The reactions were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp 2400 System using Perkin-Elmer reagents and Taq DNA polymerase. Intermediate polymerase chain reaction products were separated from excess primer and template using the Qiagen polymerase chain reaction purification kit. B. Katzenellenbogen (University of Illinois, Urbana) kindly provided a double mutant, pCMV5-ER S104A/S106A. Triple phosphorylation site mutants in the context of pGex4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were constructed by subcloning. All phosphorylation site mutants were sequenced to verify the existence of the desired base alterations and to guard against the inclusion of untoward mutations (Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit, U.

Biochemical Corp.). pcDNA3-wt ER, pcDNA3-ER S104A, pcDNA3-ER S106A, pcDNA3-ER S118A, and pcDNA3-ER S104A/S106A/S118A expression plasmids were used to produce full-length human ER derivatives, and an XETL reporter plasmid containing one consensus ERE upstream of firefly luciferase gene was used to assay for ER transcriptional activity. The pCMV-Myc-cycA plasmid expressed Myc-tagged cyclin A. A pCMV empty vector was used to equalize the total amount of DNA transfected in each experiment. pCMV-LacZ plasmid produced β-galactosidase and was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cells (ATCC HTB 96) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 50 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient transfections, U-2 OS cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes (120,000 cells/dish) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. One h before transfection, cells were re-fed with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and transfected with indicated plasmids via the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described elsewhere (27). Five h post-transfection, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove calcium phosphate precipitates, allowed to recover overnight in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% stripped fetal bovine serum, and incubated with fresh medium containing 100 nm17β-estradiol (E2, resuspended in 100% ethanol) or 1 μm 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Calbiochem-Novabiochem; resuspended in 100% ethanol) where indicated for an additional 12 h. Transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed directly on the dishes in 250 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was quantified in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mmMgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol. A Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) was used with 1 mmd-luciferin (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) as substrate. Luciferase assays were performed, normalized to β-galactosidase (28Alam J. Cook J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) activity, and expressed as relative luminescence units. To prepare protein extracts from transfected cells, U-2 OS cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed directly on the plates in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaF, 25 μm ZnCl2supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) and a phosphatase inhibitor, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were collected, incubated on ice for 15 min, and precleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), protein concentration in all samples was adjusted with the lysis buffer, and 200 μl of the whole cell extracts was boiled for 3 min with 50 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer. For immunoblotting, protein extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and probed with the Myc-specific mouse monoclonal antibody to detect transfected Myc-tagged cyclin A or with anti-ER mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. catalog #SC-040, SC-787 and SC-543, respectively). The blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies and the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human ER derivatives containing N-terminal amino acids 1 through 121, either wild type (wt) or containing single S104A, S106A, S118A or triple S104A/S106A/S118A amino acid substitutions were subcloned into the pGex4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (GST-ER121) as described (24Krstic M.D. Rogatsky I. Yamamoto K.R. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3947-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The most concentrated fractions (1 mg/ml) were used as substrates for the in vitro kinase assays. High Five insect cells were maintained in Ex-Cell 405 insect culture media (JRH Biosciences) at 27 °C. Baculovirus vectors (107 plaque-forming units/ml) engineered to express human cyclin A or a hemagglutinin-tagged human CDK2 were used separately or in combination to infect cells. Cells (1 × 107cells/100-mm dish) were infected with 0.5 ml (5 × 106plaque-forming units) of each virus in a final volume of 2.5 ml for 3 h at 27 °C and re-fed with 10 ml of Ex-Cell medium. Two days post-infection, cells were lysed on ice for 1 h in 0.5 ml of 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with protease inhibitors (described above) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. The cyclin A-CDK2 complex was immunoprecipitated from approximately 100 μg of insect cell extract for 1 h on ice with 5 μg of the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) directed against the hemagglutinin epitope on CDK2. Immune complexes were immobilized on protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1.5 h at 4 °C, washed 3 times in 1 ml of lysis buffer (described above), once with 1 ml of lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, and once with DK buffer (50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.15, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 4.5 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (described above). The wild type or mutant GST-ER121 substrates (approximately 10 μg in 100 μl) were added to the immobilized kinase complex, the kinase reaction was initialized by adding 25 μm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi) in a total volume of 300 μl and allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature with continuous shaking. Reaction mixtures containing the immobilized receptor on glutathione beads and recombinant purified ERK-2 (New England Biolabs) were set up according to the manufacturer's instructions. The beads containing the kinase complex and the bound substrate were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline to remove unincorporated radioisotope, and the labeled GST-ER121derivative was released by boiling at 100 °C for 3 min in an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the receptor protein and dried, and the phosphorylation of substrates was examined by autoradiography at room temperature. To quantitate the amount of 32P incorporated into each ER derivative, the receptor bands were excised from the gel, immersed in scintillation fluor, and quantitated using a scintillation counter. We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of cyclin A in mammalian cells enhances ER transcriptional activation. To determine whether the effect of cyclin A is mediated through one or more of the three potential CDK phosphorylation sites in AF-1, Ser-104, Ser-106, and Ser-118 (Fig.1 A), we have substituted these serines with alanines (S104A/S106A/S118A) in the context of the full-length human receptor and compared the effect of cyclin A overexpression on the transcriptional response of the wtversus triple mutant ER in ER-deficient U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cells. Fig. 1 B demonstrates that overexpression of cyclin A results in a 2-fold increase of wt ER transcriptional enhancement. The ER triple mutation S104A/S106A/S118A (AAA mutant) completely abolished the receptor response to cyclin A (Fig.1 B, top panel). Importantly, the ER AAA mutant was expressed at the same level as the wt ER, and the expression of either derivative was not affected by the exogenously transfected cyclin A (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). These results suggest that the effect of cyclin A on ER transcriptional activation is not a function of alterations in expression of ER but rather is mediated, individually or collectively, through serines 104, 106, and/or 118. To examine whether Ser-104, Ser-106, and Ser-118 were indeed sites for cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylation, we have examined whether purified cyclin A-CDK2 could phosphorylate an ER derivative containing receptor amino acid residues 1 through 121 using an immune complex kinase assay. Both the wt ER and an ER containing the three amino acid substitutions S104A/S106A/S118A (AAA) were fused to GST, expressed in E. coli, and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. The cyclin A-CDK2 complex was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells by immunoprecipitation using antibody directed against an hemagglutinin epitope present on the CDK2 subunit of the complex. As shown in Fig.2 (top panel), immunopurified cyclin A-CDK2 complex phosphorylates the wt GST-ER121derivative, but not the AAA mutant, in vitro. These results suggest that the cyclin A-CDK2 complex directly phosphorylates one or more of the serine residues, 104, 106, or 118, in vitro. ER responsiveness to cyclin A overexpression as well as ER phosphorylation in vitro suggests three candidate target sites for the cyclin A-CDK2-mediated phosphorylation, Ser-104, Ser-106, and Ser-118, all of which lie within the serine-proline consensus motif, potentially modified by CDKs. To determine which of these serine residues are required for the cyclin A-mediated induction of ER transcriptional activation in mammalian cells, we constructed a series of full-length ER derivatives bearing individual serine-to-alanine substitutions, S104A, S106A, and S118A. These constructs were expressed in U-2 OS cells and assayed for ER-dependent transcriptional activation under conditions of cyclin A overexpression. Fig. 3 A demonstrates that the ER S104A and S106A mutations, but not the S118A substitution, partially suppress the effect of cyclin A on ER transcriptional activation relative to the wt ER. These differences in ER transcriptional activity are not a reflection of alterations in the level of ER protein synthesized, since all derivatives were expressed at a comparable level in both the presence and absence of exogenous cyclin A (Fig.3 B). The results from four independent experiments (Fig.3 C) demonstrate that S118A mutant is fully responsive to cyclin A, whereas both S104A and S106A are reduced in their response, with the average induction by cyclin A 43 and 18%, respectively. Thus, residues 104 and 106, but not 118, are responsible for the observed cyclin A-dependent enhancement of ER transcriptional activity in cultured mammalian cells. Interestingly, neither the S104A nor the S106A mutations completely eradicate cyclin A enhancement of ER activity, suggesting that both residues participate in the observed regulation. In addition, since either mutation results in more than 50% reduction of ER transcriptional enhancement, phosphorylation at these two sites is likely cooperative, such that replacement of either serine 104 or 106 with alanine partially inhibits phosphorylation of the adjacent site. We next assessed the ability of the cyclin A-CDK2 complex to phosphorylate individual serine-to-alanine ER mutants (S104A, S106A, and S118A) in vitro in the context GST-ER121. Fig. 4 Aillustrates that phosphorylation of each mutant, S104A, S106A, and S118A, is reduced compared with the wt ER. The lower panelis the Coomassie Blue-stained gel demonstrating that all receptor derivatives are expressed at comparable levels. To quantify the amount of phosphate incorporated into each ER mutant, the receptor and cyclin A bands were excised from the gel and subjected to liquid scintillation counting; ER phosphorylation was normalized to the amount of cyclin A immunoprecipitated and phosphorylated in each condition. Phosphate incorporation into the S104A derivative by cyclin A-CDK2 is decreased by more than 80%, relative to the wt ER (set as a 100%), whereas phosphorylation is virtually abolished when the S106A derivative is used as the substrate, reducing the amount of phosphorylation by more than 95% compared with the wt ER (Fig. 4 B). To establish that the integrity of the S106A derivative is preserved, we tested it as a substrate for mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-2), which utilizes Ser-118 as a target phosphorylation site. ERK-2 readily phosphorylates S106A, suggesting that the inability of cyclin A-CDK2 to phosphorylate S106A does not result from potential changes in protein conformation induced by the mutation but rather reflects the specificity of the kinase with respect to the particular substrate site (Fig. 4 C). The ER S118A mutation also results in a decrease in ER phosphorylation by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, albeit to a much smaller extent than the S104A and S106A substitutions. Although the phosphorylation of all three mutant receptor derivatives by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex in vitro is reduced (rank order of ER phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 in vitro: S106A < S104A < S118A < wt), S106A and S104A substitutions most profoundly affect phosphorylation by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex. Although Ser-118 appears to contribute to ER phosphorylation by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex in vitro, this may result from the artificial exposure of the Ser-118 site in the truncated GST-ER121 fusion protein. In contrast, in the context the full-length receptor expressed in mammalian cells, Ser-118 may not be accessible to the cyclin A-CDK2 complex or may be already phosphorylated by a different kinase (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase). Combined, our results argue that the ER residues Ser-104 and Ser-106 are bona fide cyclin A-CDK2 targets, which is supported by our transcriptional activity assays in mammalian cells. Cyclin A overexpression enhances the transcriptional activity of the ER in cultured mammalian cells both in the presence and in the absence of estradiol (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the effect of cyclin A overexpression and the activation of the ER by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex appear to be independent of ligand binding, suggesting the involvement of AF-1 but not AF-2. To further evaluate the importance of AF-2 for the enhanced ER-dependent transcriptional activation in response to cyclin A overexpression, we used a pharmacological approach and employed the ligand tamoxifen, a mixed agonist/antagonist currently used in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers. Tamoxifen prevents the productive interaction of the ER with co-activator protein(s) necessary for transcriptional activation via AF-2, thus allowing for the assessment of changes in AF-1 activity as a function of cyclin A concentration (8Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar, 29Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). U-2 OS cells were transiently transfected with the ER as well as the reporter constructs described above and treated with the ethanol vehicle, estradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen. For each treatment, ER transcriptional enhancement was assayed in the absence and presence of cyclin A overexpression. Consistent with our previous findings, a 2-fold increase in ER-dependent transcription was observed upon cyclin A overexpression in the absence or presence of estradiol (Fig. 5). Importantly, the magnitude of induction of ER-dependent transcriptional activation by cyclin A in response to tamoxifen treatment is comparable to that observed with estradiol (Fig. 5). Thus, the recruitment of co-activator proteins to AF-2 is dispensable for the cyclin A-mediated enhancement of ER activity, and ER AF-1 is sufficient to confer the receptor responsiveness to cyclin A. We have identified serines 104 and 106 of the human ER as the likely targets of cyclin A-CDK2-dependent phosphorylation. A triple serine-to-alanine mutation at residues 104, 106, and 118 abolishes both the cyclin A-CDK2-dependent increase of ER transcriptional activation in U-2 OS cells and ER phosphorylation by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex in vitro. Individual S104A and S106A mutations reduce the cyclin A-CDK2-dependent enhancement of ER-dependent transcriptional activation. In contrast, the S118A mutant responds like wt ER to cyclin A overexpression in mammalian cells. Similarly, phosphorylation of an ER N-terminal derivative by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex in vitrois significantly reduced in the S104A and S106A mutants, relative to the wt ER. Although the ER S118A mutant also exhibits decreased phosphorylation by the cyclin A-CDK2 in vitro, this reduction is much smaller than that exhibited by either the S104A or the S106A derivatives; in addition, this site may be artificially exposed to the purified kinase in the context of the GST-ER121 fusion protein. These in vitrofindings are consistent with our results in mammalian cells, where the cyclin A-CDK2-dependent enhancement of ER transcriptional activation is reduced in ER derivatives bearing serine-to-alanine mutations at 104 and 106 but not 118. These data suggest that Ser-118 is a poor target for cyclin A-CDK2 phosphorylation in vitroand in vivo. The inability of Ser-118 to serve as a substrate for cyclin A-CDK2 is also in agreement with previous reports proposing that Ser-118 is a substrate for epidermal growth factor-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase in the absence of estradiol as well as a target for another as yet unidentified kinase(s) in the presence of estradiol (18Bunone G. Briand P.-A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 19Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that ER is a substrate for the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, with the predominant sites of phosphorylation being Ser-104 and Ser-106. Given the close proximity of Ser-104 and Ser-106, cooperativity between the sites such that the same kinase complex modifies them and phosphorylation of one site promotes phosphorylation of the other appears likely. It is noteworthy that the ER sites phosphorylated by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex, Ser-104 and Ser-106, reside within sequence contexts that are noncanonical CDK phosphorylation targets (Fig. 1 A), as determined by a systematic evaluation of a panel of substrates phosphorylated in vitro by cyclin A-CDK2 (30Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25240-25246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is likely that multiple factors confer specificity and efficiency to cyclin A-CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of a given target site. For example, a noncanonical site might fold in such a way that the target is presented to the kinase in a favorable manner. Furthermore, recent findings by Schulman et al. (31Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) show that a conserved hydrophobic patch on the surface of cyclin A is involved in substrate recognition through a RXL motif on the substrate and that this binding is important for phosphorylation of a subset of proteins by cyclin A-CDK2 (31Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human ER-α contains three RXL motifs; one such motif is located in the N terminus (amino acids 37–39), whereas two others reside in the C-terminal ligand binding domain, at residues 352–354 and 477–479, respectively. In each case, these motifs are preserved among ERs from distinct species, including human, rat, mouse, sheep, pig, and chicken, suggesting a conservation of function. It is conceivable that one or more of these motifs serve as potential docking sites for the cyclin A-CDK2 complex and facilitate ER phosphorylation at Ser-104/Ser-106 by increasing the local concentration of the substrate. The enhancement of ER transcriptional activation by cyclin A overexpression occurs not only in the absence and presence of estradiol but is also observed when the receptor is activated by tamoxifen. Since tamoxifen induces a receptor conformation that is incompatible with coactivator binding to AF-2 (8Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar, 29Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar), these results suggest that cyclin A-CDK2 enhances ER transcriptional activity through AF-1 and not AF-2. We propose that ER phosphorylation at Ser-104/Ser-106 by the cyclin A-CDK2 complex provides sites that either recruit or prevent additional proteins from binding to ER AF-1. Although the p160 class of coactivators has recently been shown to interact with ER AF-1 and increase ER AF-1-dependent transcriptional activation, this effect is not dependent upon receptor phosphorylation at Ser-104, Ser-106, or Ser-118 (32Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.M. Subramanian S. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We further hypothesize that alterations in the level or activity of the cyclin A-CDK2 complex modulates ER activity by increasing or decreasing receptor phosphorylation, which in turn, affects the interaction of ER with accessory proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. This mechanism of cyclin A-CDK2 regulation of ER transcriptional activity through direct receptor phosphorylation and co-factor binding differs from that of cyclin D1-mediated enhancement of ER transcriptional activity (Fig.6). The effect of cyclin A on ER transcriptional activation requires the kinase activity of the CDK2, whereas the effect of cyclin D1 on ER is CDK-independent (33Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In addition, the enhancement of ER transactivation by cyclin A-CDK2 is achieved through phosphorylation of ER AF-1, whereas cyclin the effect of D1 on ER transcriptional activity is dependent on AF-2 and does not involve ER phosphorylation (33Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that cyclin D1 increases ER activity by acting as a bridge between AF-2 and the coactivator, SRC-1 (34Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of cyclin D1 enhancement of ER transcriptional activity appears to be through coactivator recruitment to AF-2. Although the means whereby cyclin D1 and cyclin A augment ER transcriptional activation differs, the result is the same; that is, an increase in ER transcriptional activation either through direct coactivator recruitment to AF-2 in the case of cyclin D1, or indirectly through AF-1 phosphorylation by cyclin A-CDK2 and subsequent cofactor interaction (Fig. 6). In view of increasing clinical data linking CDK dysregulation to a variety of human cancers, notably breast cancer (35Tsihlias J. Kapusta L. Slingerland J. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W1954023508,"Sepsis is associated with a pronounced catabolic response in skeletal muscle, mainly reflecting degradation of the myofibrillar proteins actin and myosin. Recent studies suggest that sepsis-induced muscle proteolysis may reflect ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent protein breakdown. An apparently conflicting observation is that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway does not degrade intact myofibrils. Thus, it is possible that actin and myosin need to be released from the myofibrils before they can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. We tested the hypothesis that sepsis results in disruption of Z-bands, increased expression of calpains, and calcium-dependent release of myofilaments in skeletal muscle. Sepsis induced in rats by cecal ligation and puncture resulted in increased gene expression of micro-calpain, m-calpain, and p94 and in Z-band disintegration in the extensor digitorum longus muscle. The release of myofilaments from myofibrillar proteins was increased in septic muscle. This response to sepsis was blocked by treating the rats with dantrolene, a substance that inhibits the release of calcium from intracellular stores to the cytoplasm. The present results provide evidence that sepsis is associated with Z-band disintegration and a calcium-dependent release of myofilaments in skeletal muscle. Release of myofilaments may be an initial and perhaps rate-limiting component of sepsis-induced muscle breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2096483656,"Sensory neurodegeneration occurs in mice defective in BPAG1, a gene encoding cytoskeletal linker proteins capable of anchoring neuronal intermediate filaments to actin cytoskeleton. While BPAG1 null mice fail to anchor neurofilaments (NFs), BPAG1/NF null mice still degenerate in the absence of NFs. We report a novel neural splice form that lacks the actin-binding domain and instead binds and stabilizes microtubules. This interaction is functionally important; in mice and in vitro, neurons lacking BPAG1 display short, disorganized, and unstable microtubules defective in axonal transport. Ironically, BPAG1 neural isoforms represent microtubule-associated proteins that when absent lead to devastating consequences. Moreover, BPAG1 can functionally account for the extraordinary stability of axonal microtubules necessary for transport over long distances. Its isoforms interconnect all three cytoskeletal networks, a feature apparently central to neuronal survival."
https://openalex.org/W1933198004,"G207 is a multi-mutated, replication-competent type-1 herpes simplex virus designed to target, infect, and lyse neurological tumors. This study examines the feasibility of using G207 in the treatment of human colorectal cancer and defines the biological determinants of its antitumor efficacy. This virus was tested on five human colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro to determine efficacy of infection and tumor cell kill. These results were correlated to measures of tumor cell proliferation. In vivo testing was performed through direct injections of G207 into xenografts of human colorectal cancer tumors grown in flanks of athymic rats. To evaluate an alternate method of administration, hepatic portal vein infusion of G207 was performed in a syngeneic model of liver metastases in Buffalo rats. Among the five cell lines tested, infection rates ranged between 10% and 90%, which correlated directly with S-phase fraction (8.6%-36.6%) and was proportional to response to G207 therapy in vitro (1%-93%). Direct injection of G207 into nude rat flank tumors suppressed tumor growth significantly vs. control (0.58 +/- 0.60 cm(3) vs. 9.16 +/- 3.70 cm(3), P<0. 0001). In vivo tumor suppression correlated with in vitro effect. In the syngeneic liver tumor model, portal infusion resulted in significant reduction in number of liver nodules (13 +/- 10 nodules in G207-treated livers vs. 80 +/- 30 nodules in control livers, P<0.05). G207 infects and kills human colorectal cancer cells efficiently. In vitro cytotoxicity assay and tumor S-phase fraction can be used to predict response to treatment in vivo. This antineoplastic agent can be delivered effectively by both direct tumor injection and regional vascular infusion.

Four groups of mice [Se-deficient or -adequate GPX1 knockout and wild-type (WT)] were injected (i.p.) with 50 mg paraquat/kg body weight and tissues were collected 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 h after the injection. Whereas the ratios of NADPH/NADP and NADH/NAD in lung were reduced by 50–70% only 0.5 h after the injection in all groups, these two ratios in liver of the Se-adequate WT were significantly higher than those of the three GPX1 knockout or deficient groups 2–4 h after the injection. The paraquat-induced pulmonary lipid peroxidation and hepatic protein oxidation, measured as F2-isoprostanes and carbonyl contents, respectively, peaked at 1 h in these three groups. No such oxidative events were shown in any tissue of the Se-adequate WT throughout the time course. Whereas the F2-isoprostane formation was accelerated by both GPX1 knockout and Se deficiency in liver, it was not significantly elevated by the paraquat treatment in brain of any group. The paraquat injection also resulted in temporal changes in lung GPX activity and GPX1 protein in the Se-adequate WT, and significant reductions in lung total SOD activity in the GPX1 knockout or deficient groups. In conclusion, GPX1 plays a critical role in maintaining the redox status of mice under acute oxidative stress, and protects against paraquat-induced oxidative destruction of lipids and protein in vivo. These protections of GPX1 seem to be inducible and coordinated with those of other antioxidant enzymes.—Cheng, W.-H., Fu, Y. X., Porres, J. M., Ross, D. A., Lei, X. G.

Transgenic mice with cardiac-targeted calsequestrin overexpression show marked suppression of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, myocyte hypertrophy, and premature death by 16 weeks of age (Jones, L. R., Suzuki, Y. J., Wang, W., Kobayashi, Y. M., Ramesh, V., Franzini-Armstrong, C., Cleemann, L., and Morad, M. (1998)J. Clin. Invest. 101, 1385–1393). To investigate whether alterations in intracellular Ca2+ trigger changes in the β-adrenergic receptor pathway, we studied calsequestrin overexpressing transgenic mice at 7 and 14 weeks of age. As assessed by echocardiography, calsequestrin mice at 7 weeks showed mild left ventricular enlargement, mild decreased fractional shortening with increased wall thickness. By 14 weeks, the phenotype progressed to marked left ventricular enlargement and severely depressed systolic function. Cardiac catheterization in calsequestrin mice revealed markedly impaired β-adrenergic receptor responsiveness in both 7- and 14- week mice. Biochemical analysis in 7- and 14-week mice showed a significant decrease in total β-adrenergic receptor density, adenylyl cyclase activity, and the percent high affinity agonist binding, which was associated with increased β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 levels.

Taken together, these data indicate that alterations in β-adrenergic receptor signaling precede the development of overt heart failure in this mouse model of progressive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac hypertrophy represents one of the most important adaptive responses to increase mechanical load on the heart. In an attempt to normalize excessive forces and work performed per contractile unit, myocardial hypertrophy unloads the heart by adding new sarcomeres in order to distribute tension across a greater cellular mass (1Grossman W. Jones D. McLaurin L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). Although the induction of cardiac hypertrophy can be viewed as a corrective response to elevated stress, it is now clear that sustained hypertrophy initiates a myopathic process leading to decompensated heart failure (2Lorell B.H. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3824-3827PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that are responsible for this transition from a compensatory state to one of progressive chamber enlargement and myocardial failure are poorly understood. Derangement in a number of cellular processes have been implicated in this pathological transition including abnormalities in β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) 1The abbreviations used are: βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; βARK1, β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; CSQ, calsequestrin; LVEDD, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension; LVESD, left ventricular end-systolic dimension; % FS, % fractional shortening; SEPth, septal wall thickness; PWth, posterior wall thickness; LV dP/dtmax and LV dP/dtmin, maximal and minimal first derivative of LV pressure, respectively; mVcfc, heart rate corrected mean velocity of circumferential shortening 1The abbreviations used are: βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; βARK1, β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; CSQ, calsequestrin; LVEDD, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension; LVESD, left ventricular end-systolic dimension; % FS, % fractional shortening; SEPth, septal wall thickness; PWth, posterior wall thickness; LV dP/dtmax and LV dP/dtmin, maximal and minimal first derivative of LV pressure, respectively; mVcfc, heart rate corrected mean velocity of circumferential shortening signaling (3Eichhorn E.J.

Hypertension. 1998; 31 Suppl.

Valdivia H.H. Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Santana L.F. Cannell M.B. McCune S.A. Altschuld R.A. Lederer W.J. Science. 1997; 276: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Chronic human heart failure is characterized by marked abnormalities in βAR signaling that result from a number of alterations including a 50% reduction in β1ARs without change in β2AR density (6Bristow M.R. Lancet. 1998; 352 Suppl. I: 8-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar), increased levels of the inhibitory G protein (6Bristow M.R. Lancet. 1998; 352 Suppl.

Res. 1994; 74: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). It remains controversial whether alterations in the βAR system are important in the pathogenesis of the failing heart. In this regard, we have recently reported the striking finding that cardiac overexpression of a βARK inhibitor prevents the development of cardiomyopathy in a genetic model of murine heart failure (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7000-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Thus, abnormal βAR/G protein-coupling early in the development of the failing heart appears to be a critical event in the progressive nature of this disease (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7000-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Calsequestrin (CSQ) is a 55-kDa high capacity Ca+2-binding protein located in the lumen of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum that forms a quaternary complex with junctin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor, which are all required for the normal regulation of Ca2+ release by the ryanodine receptor (9Zhang L.

Recently, we and others have characterized the electrophysiological properties of transgenic mice with impaired Ca2+ release achieved through cardiac overexpression of CSQ (10Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J.

CSQ-overexpressing transgenic mice showed markedly reduced Ca2+-induced Ca2+release (10Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin.

Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CSQ overexpression was associated with myocyte hypertrophy, depressed cellular contractility, and induction of a fetal gene program. The purpose of this study was to determine whether defects in βAR signaling are associated with this mouse model of cellular contractile failure so as to better understand the cellular mechanisms involved in the initiation of pathological hypertrophy and heart failure. Transgenic mice overexpressing (CSQ) mice were generated as described previously (10Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length canine cardiac CSQ cDNA was fused to the α-myosin heavy chain promoter to drive cardiac-targeted expression. Age-matched transgenic and wild-type littermates of either sex were used. The genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (10Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The animals in this study were handled according to approved protocols and the animal welfare regulations of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Indiana University. Echocardiography was performed in anesthetized mice (Avertin 2.5%, 14 μl/g intraperitoneally) using an ATL HDI 5000 echocardiograph (ATL Ultrasound, Bothell, WA) as described previously (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7000-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Wild-type and CSQ mice at the age of 7 and 14 weeks were evaluated by noninvasive echocardiography followed by invasive hemodynamics. In a separate group of mice, serial echocardiograms were obtained in the same animals over a 5-week period of time with the initial study at 8.4 ± 0.4 weeks of age and a second study performed at 13.3 ± 0.4 weeks of age. The operator who performed and measured the echocardiograms was blinded to the genotype of the animals. The following parameters were measured: LVEDD; LVESD; % FS, calculated as (LVEDD − LVESD)/LVEDD × 100; SEPth; PWth, mVcfc, calculated as fractional shortening divided by ejection time multiplied by the square root of the R-R interval. Estimated echocardiographic LV mass (in mg) was calculated as ((LVEDD + SEPth + PWth)3 − LVEDD3) × 1.055, where 1.055 (mg/mm3) is the density of myocardium. Intraobserver and interobserver variation for M-mode measurements was <6% for internal dimensions and <25% for wall thickness. Following echocardiography, hemodynamic evaluation was performed in closed-chest mice as described previously (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg) and connected to a rodent ventilator after endotracheal intubation. A 1.4 French high fidelity micromanometer catheter (Millar Instruments) was inserted into the right carotid and advanced retrograde into the LV. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded on an 8-channel chart recorder and in digitized form at 2,000 Hz at base line and 45–60 s after injection of incremental doses of isoproterenol (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7000-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Experiments were then terminated, hearts were rapidly excised, and individual chambers were separated, weighed, and frozen in liquid N2 for later biochemical analysis. Parameters measured were heart rate, LV systolic pressure, LV end diastolic pressure, LV dP/dtmax, and LV dP/dtmin. Ten sequential beats were averaged for each measurement. In separate CSQ overexpressing animals at 14 weeks of age, heart rate was matched to the wild-type mice by right atrial pacing. Following anesthesia and instrumentation as above, a bipolar pacing lead made from a pair of fine filament-coated wires was introduced into the right jugular vein and advanced into the right atrium. After a brief period of stabilization, atrial pacing was initiated at a rate of 400/min, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded as described. Myocardial sarcolemmal membranes were prepared by homogenizing whole hearts from 7- and 14-week-old mice in ice-cold buffer as described previously (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G.

Total βAR density was determined by incubating 25 μg of cardiac sarcolemmal membranes with a saturating concentration (80 pm) of [125I]cyanopindolol and 20 μm alprenolol to define nonspecific binding (14Koch W.J.

Competition binding isotherms in sarcolemmal membranes were done in triplicate with 18 varying concentrations of isoproterenol (10−13m to 10−4m). Assays were conducted at 37 °C for 60 min and then filtered over GF/C glass fiber filters (Whatman) that were washed and counted in a γ counter. Competition isotherms were analyzed by nonlinear least square curve fit (GraphPad Prism). Adenylyl cyclase activity was performed on myocardial sarcolemmal membranes from 7- and 14-week-old mice (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J.

Concentrated (Centricon, Amicon, Inc.) cytosolic extract (300 μg of protein) was incubated with rhodopsin-enriched rod outer segments in 50 μl of reaction buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1mmol/liter dithiothreitol), and 0.1 mmol/liter ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated in white light for 20 min and quenched with 300 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer and then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 ×g. Sedimented proteins were resuspended in 20 μl of protein gel loading dye and electrophoresed through SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gels. Phosphorylated rhodopsin was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a PhoshorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Immunodetection of myocardial levels of βARK1 was performed on cytosolic extracts following immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal βARK1/2 antibody as described previously (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R.

The ∼80-kilodalton βARK1 protein was visualized with the monoclonal antibody raised against an epitope within the carboxyl terminus of βARK1 and chemiluminescent detection of anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Northern blotting was performed on LV tissue obtained from 7- and 14-week CSQ and age-matched wild-type mice as described previously (15Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U.

Total RNA was isolated by a modification of the acid guanidine thiocyanate technique (RNeasy; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA (4 μg) was size-fractionated by denaturing gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes by capillary action, and cross-linked with UV light. Filters were prehybridized at 68 °C for 1 h and then hybridized for 4 h at 68 °C after the addition of 32P cDNA probes labeled using random priming. Post hybridization filters were washed under stringent conditions, and transcripts were detected by autoradiography. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. To test for statistical differences in serial echocardiographic data and hemodynamic data between CSQ and wild-type mice, a two way repeated measures analysis of variance was performed. When appropriate, post hoc analysis with regard to differences in mean values between the groups was conducted with a Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance between wild-type and CSQ mice at either 7 or 14 weeks of age for the biochemical data, chamber weights, and echocardiographic variables was performed using Student's t test. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to assess LV chamber size and global cardiac function in transgenic and wild-type mice. As shown in Fig.1, overexpression of CSQ resulted in an early phenotype of preserved chamber size and increased wall thickness that progressed to one of LV enlargement and severe cardiac dysfunction (Fig. 1). By 16 weeks of age all mice had died. Summary echocardiographic data obtained in 7- and 14-week-old mice are shown in Table I. At 7 weeks, CSQ mice showed mild chamber enlargement, mild reduction in % FS, and increased wall thickness. In contrast, at 14 weeks, severe cardiac enlargement and marked cardiac dysfunction was evident with a reduction in wall thickness back to normal values.Table IEchocardiographic and physiological parameters in 7- and 14-week-old CSQ-overexpressing mice7 weeks14 weeksWild type (n = 11)CSQ (n = 13)Wild type (n = 9)CSQ (n = 13)CSQ pace up (n = 4)LVEDD (mm)3.3 ± 0.83.9 ± 0.1ap < 0.0005.3.7 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.1ap < 0.0005.LVESD (mm)1.7 ± 0.72.5 ± 0.1ap < 0.0005.2.0 ± 0.13.8 ± 0.2ap < 0.0005.FS (%)47.5 ± 1.935.4 ± 1.7ap < 0.0005.44.8 ± 1.822.7 ± 1.5ap < 0.0005.SEPth (mm)0.65 ± 0.030.83 ± 0.04bp < 0.05.0.74 ± 0.030.76 ± 0.04mVcfc (circ/s)2.9 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.2bp < 0.05.2.6 ± 0.21.53 ± 0.1bp < 0.05.BW (g)18.9 ± 1.619.6 ± 1.020.1 ± 1.020.5 ± 0.5HW/BW (mg/g)5.3 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.1ap < 0.0005.4.8 ± 0.18.8 ± 0.8ap < 0.0005.LVW/BW (mg/g)3.7 ± 0.16.2 ± 0.1ap < 0.0005.3.5 ± 0.16.5 ± 0.2ap < 0.0005.HW/TL (mg/mm)6.2 ± 0.310.4 ± 0.3ap < 0.0005.5.9 ± 0.211.1 ± 0.5ap < 0.0005.LVW/TL (mg/mm)4.4 ± 0.27.6 ± 0.2ap < 0.0005.4.3 ± 0.17.7 ± 0.3ap < 0.0005.HR (beats/min)399 ± 14327 ± 13ap < 0.0005.401 ± 21307 ± 25ap < 0.0005.398 ± 12cp < 0.001.LV dP/dtmax (mm Hg/s)8382 ± 5634696 ± 299ap < 0.0005.8169 ± 8294135 ± 442ap < 0.0005.2907 ± 398cp < 0.001.LV dP/dtmin (mm Hg/s)−6003 ± 560−3719 ± 284ap < 0.0005.−6534 ± 831−2740 ± 346ap < 0.0005.−2779 ± 341LVSP (mm Hg)90 ± 381 ± 3112 ± 690 ± 5ap < 0.0005.80 ± 4cp < 0.001.LVEDP (mm Hg)0.9 ± 1.00.5 ± 1.110.7 ± 1.711.0 ± 1.510.7 ± 1.8BW, body weight; HW, heart weight; LVW, left ventricular weight; TL, tibia length; HR, heart rate; LVSP, left ventricular systolic pressure; LVEDP, left ventricular end diastolic pressure.

Individual data points for 3 echocardiographic parameters are plotted for 12 CSQ mice studied at 8.4 ± 0.4 weeks of age and at a follow-up echocardiographic study 5 weeks later (Fig. 2). On the initial study, 7 of the 12 CSQ mice had normal LV chamber size and systolic function as indicated by the normal LVEDD (Fig. 2 A) and % FS (Fig. 2 B). This early phenotype was associated with a significant increase in septal (Fig. 2 C) and posterior wall thickness (CSQ; 0.97 ± 0.04 versus wild type; 0.74 ± 0.03, mm, p < 0.001). In contrast, over a period of 5 weeks, nearly all CSQ mice showed an increase in LVEDD (Fig. 2 A), decrease in % FS (Fig. 2 B), and reduction in wall thickness (Fig. 2 C). Thus, cardiac overexpression of CSQ leads to an initial phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy with only a mild reduction in systolic function that progresses to severe cardiac enlargement and marked LV dysfunction with premature death. In addition to the time-dependent enlargement in chamber size, CSQ-overexpressing mice showed a progressive increase in LV mass as determined by serial echocardiography. Estimated LV mass of CSQ mice at echo #1 was significantly greater than in wild-type mice (CSQ; 169.1 ± 17.9 versus wild-type; 90.4 ± 10.7, mg,p < 0.001). Over the 5-week study period, little change in estimated LV mass was seen in wild-type animals, whereas a small increase in the estimated LV mass was seen in the CSQ-overexpressing mice at echo #2 (CSQ; 185.2 ± 9.45versus wild-type; 90.5 ± 7.7, mg, p < 0.001). These data are consistent with the heart weight data obtained at autopsy following the hemodynamic study in the 7- and 14-week-old mice (Table I). To determine whether in vivo βAR responsiveness was altered in mice with CSQ overexpression, cardiac catheterization was performed in 7- and 14-week old CSQ and age-matched wild-type mice. At 7 weeks of age, basal contractility as measured by the first derivative of LV pressure rise (LV dP/dtmax), was significantly reduced in the CSQ mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3 A, TableI). In response to isoproterenol, 7-week CSQ mice showed a markedly blunted response as compared with the brisk increase in LV dP/dtmax observed in wild-type mice (Fig. 3 A). Myocardial relaxation (as assessed by LV dP/dtmin) was also significantly impaired under basal conditions and with isoproterenol infusion (Fig. 3 B). Although LV systolic pressure was only slightly reduced (Fig.3 C), heart rate was significantly lower in the CSQ mice at base line and with isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 3 D). These data show that even in the absence of overt heart failure, young CSQ mice show marked abnormalities of βAR function in vivo. Cardiac catheterization in 14-week old CSQ mice showed a similar pattern with markedly depressed basal and isoproterenol-stimulated LV dP/dtmax (Fig.4 A, Table I), significantly impaired LV dP/dtmin (Fig. 4 B), reduced LV systolic pressure (Fig. 4 C), and slower heart rate (Fig. 4 D) compared with age-matched controls. These in vivo data demonstrate that CSQ overexpression is associated with a severe impairment in βAR responsiveness that occurs early in the course of the cardiac phenotype and precede the development of severe LV enlargement and pump failure.Figure 4In vivo assessment of LV contractile function in response to βAR stimulation at 14 weeks.

The pattern of change between groups was statistically significant for LV dP/dtmax, p < 0.00001 (A), LV dP/dtmin,p < 0.005 (B), and heart rate,p < 0.00001 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since heart rate can affect LV contractility as measured by the isovolumic phase index, LV dP/dtmax, in vivo hemodynamic parameters were obtained in a separate group of 14-week CSQ animals that underwent right atrial pacing to match heart rate to that of wild-type mice. Increasing heart rate to ≈400 beats/min did not increase LV dP/dtmax in the CSQ mice but rather resulted in a significant decline (Table I). To determine whether overexpression of CSQ leads to abnormalities in βAR signaling, we evaluated receptor-effector coupling in sarcolemmal membranes from hearts of CSQ mice removed after the 7- and 14-week hemodynamic study. At both 7 and 14 weeks of age, total βAR density was significantly reduced in CSQ hearts compared with wild-type hearts (Fig. 5 A). In addition to the decrease in βAR density, the percentage of βARs exhibiting high-affinity binding for isoproterenol was significantly reduced in membranes prepared from both 7- and 14-week CSQ hearts compared with controls (Fig. 5 B). The significant reduction in the number of high affinity receptors is consistent with a decreased ability of βARs to form the coupled hormone-receptor-G protein high affinity state. These changes occur when receptors are more desensitized (14Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Samama P. Hamilton R.A. Bond R.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). This decrease in βAR density and % high affinity agonist binding was associated with a marked reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in both the 7- and 14-week old mouse hearts, indicating a severe impairment in βAR coupling (Fig. 5 C). These biochemical data are consistent with the in vivofindings and indicate that cardiac overexpression of CSQ leads to profound functional uncoupling of βARs prior to the development of severe pump failure. Functional βAR uncoupling in human heart failure is associated with increased levels and activity of βARK1 (7Ungerer M. Parruti G. Bohm M. Puzicha M. DeBlasi A. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 16Ungerer M. Bohm M. Elce J.S. Erdmann E. Lohse M.J. Circulation. 1993; 87: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), a GRK that phosphorylates and desensitizes βARs. Thus, we measured GRK activity and βARK1 protein levels in cytosolic extracts from hearts of CSQ and wild-type mice. We have previously shown that the cytosolic enzyme βARK1 accounts for nearly all the GRK activity in cytosolic extracts prepared from mouse hearts (12Choi D.-J. Koch W.J. Hunter J.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17223-17229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). βARK1 protein levels in myocardial extracts from 7- and 14-week CSQ hearts were determined by protein immunoblotting following immunoprecipitation of soluble heart extracts with a monoclonal antibody to βARK1. As shown in Fig.6, A and B, the level of βARK1 protein was higher in the hearts of the CSQ mice at both ages compared with age-matched wild-type mice. Rhodopsin-enriched rod outer segment membranes were used as a substrate for myocardial GRK activity. Consistent with the increase in cytosolic βARK1 protein levels, modest but significant increases in GRK activity was found in cytosolic extracts obtained from 7-week (1.5 fold, p < 0.05) and 14-week CSQ mice (1.8-fold, p < 0.05) compared with age-matched wild-type mice (Fig. 6 C). These data demonstrate that the abnormal receptor-effector coupling found early in the progressive cardiac phenotype caused by CSQ overexpression is associated with increased βARK1 levels, which likely contributes to the marked functional uncoupling of βARs when measured bothin vivo (responsiveness to isoproterenol infusion) andin vitro (adenylyl cyclase activity). Northern blot analysis shows a marked increase in atrial natriuretic factor mRNA levels in CSQ hearts at both 7 and 14 weeks compared with age-matched wild-type hearts (Fig.7). This is consistent with an induction of a fetal gene program observed in response to hypertrophic stimuli (11Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn II, G.W. Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Rockman H.A. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8277-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that cardiac-targeted overexpression of CSQ results in a cardiac phenotype initially characterized by marked LV hypertrophy and mild decrease in cardiac systolic function, which then rapidly deteriorates to LV enlargement, severe cardiac dysfunction, and reduction in myocardial wall thickness. This phenotype is associated with a number of abnormalities in βAR signaling, which occur prior to the development of overt heart failure as documented by a decrease in total βAR density and % high affinity agonist binding, reduced basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, blunted in vivo βAR responsiveness, and the increase in βARK1 levels. CSQ is a Ca2+ storage protein located in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen, which serves as the source of the contractile Ca2+ released in response to opening of the ryanodine receptor after activation of the L-type Ca2+channel in the plasma membrane. Recent electrophysiologic studies in the CSQ-overexpressing mice has revealed that CSQ is not only a storage protein but also is involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in heart (10Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The data from this study suggests that chronic suppression of Ca2+ release (caused by overexpression of CSQ) may initiate a cascade of molecular events that activates the hypertrophic program but ultimately leads to progressive cardiac decompensation. Interestingly, in this study we show that one of the signaling pathways to become affected early in the time course of this phenotype is the βAR pathway. In addition to the significant reduction in βAR density and % high affinity binding in the hearts of CSQ mice, a marked functional uncoupling of βARs was shown by the severely depressed response to isoproterenol in vivo (LV dP/dtmax) and in vitro (adenylyl cyclase activity). A possible mechanism that contributes to the uncoupling of βARs in this model is the significant elevation in βARK1 levels. Thus, our results further point to a possible role for βAR desensitization in the pathogenesis of the failing heart (8Rockman H.A. Chien K.R. Choi D.J. Iaccarino G. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7000-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive response to increased mechanical stress on the heart characterized by the activation of a distinct program of gene expression leading to an increase in myocyte size, expansion of contractile elements, and induction of an embryonic gene program (17Chien K.R. Zhu H. Knowlton K.U. Miller-Hance W. van-Bilsen M. O'Brien T.X. Evans S.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This early hypertrophic adaptation is frequently associated with alterations in the intracellular Ca2+transient (5Gomez A.M. Valdivia H.H. Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Santana L.F. Cannell M.B. McCune S.A. Altschuld R.A. Lederer W.J. Science. 1997; 276: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The data from our study suggest that abnormalities in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis can primarily activate the hypertrophic program possibly related to the increase in mechanical stress on the cell as a consequence of a chronic reduction in force-generating capacity. It is interesting that in many of the CSQ mice studied, the initial phase was one of increased wall thickness, normal chamber dimensions, and preserved systolic function (Fig. 2). Since most CSQ mice at 7 weeks did not show LV enlargement, the marked increase in LV/ body weight is consistent with an early phenotype of concentric LV hypertrophy that then progresses to one of dilated cardiomyopathy. The increase in atrial natriuretic factor gene expression in 7-week CSQ mice, which persists into the dilated phase at 14 weeks (Fig. 7), is consistent with the induction of an embryonic gene program and with data from another model of CSQ overexpression (11Sato Y. Ferguson D.G. Sako H. Dorn II, G.W. Kadambi V.J. Yatani A. Hoit B.D. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28470-28477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that signals transduced through G protein-coupled receptors are critical in the initiation of the hypertrophic program. These receptor-coupled signals may participate in the progressive deterioration in cardiac function that follows with chronic stress (18Sakata Y. Hoit B.D. Liggett S.B. Walsh R.A. Dorn G.W.I. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this regard, we have recently shown an obligatory role for the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Gq, in the initiation of ventricular hypertrophyin vivo (19Akhter S.A. Luttrell L.M. Rockman H.A. Iaccarino G. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Science. 1998; 280: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Whether Gq-coupled receptor signaling pathways are activated in the hearts of transgenic mice with CSQ overexpression and progressive cardiomyopathy remains to be tested. Nonetheless it is interesting that CSQ mice have, as the initial phase, LV hypertrophy, supporting the concept that alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis are important in triggering the hypertrophic gene program (20Molkentin J.D.

Although other mouse models of cardiomyopathy have been developed (18Sakata Y. Hoit B.D. Liggett S.B. Walsh R.A. Dorn G.W.I.

First, the primary abnormality is in intracellular Ca2+ regulation (10Jones L.R. Suzuki Y.J. Wang W. Kobayashi Y.M. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Cleemann L. Morad M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which has previously been shown to be altered in heart failure (25Phillips R.M. Narayan P. Gomez A.M. Dilly K. Jones L.R. Lederer W.J. Altschuld R.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 37: 346-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the initial phase is concentric LV hypertrophy and preserved systolic function, which then leads to LV enlargement and decompensation. In summary, this model of cardiac-targeted overexpression of CSQ should provide a unique opportunity to test hypotheses related to the transition from cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure. Using a strategy that combines the mating of gene-targeted mouse models with comprehensive physiological analysis of the ensuing cardiac phenotype will allow the direct testing of the molecular framework involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

https://openalex.org/W2159879351,"Spo76p is conserved and related to the fungal proteins Pds5p and BIMD and the human AS3 prostate proliferative shutoff-associated protein. Spo76p localizes to mitotic and meiotic chromosomes, except at metaphase(s) and anaphase(s). During meiotic prophase, Spo76p assembles into strong lines in correlation with axial element formation. As inferred from spo76-1 mutant phenotypes, Spo76p is required for sister chromatid cohesiveness, chromosome axis morphogenesis, and chromatin condensation during critical transitions at mitotic prometaphase and meiotic midprophase. Spo76p is also required for meiotic interhomolog recombination, likely at postinitiation stage(s). We propose that a disruptive force coordinately promotes chromosomal axial compaction and destabilization of sister connections and that Spo76p restrains and channels the effects of this force into appropriate morphogenetic mitotic and meiotic outcomes."

The selective transport of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) into the lumen of the mammalian ER may contribute to protein disulfide biosynthesis (12Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). However, the ultimate oxidant for this process has yet to be identified, and recent studies have shown that glutathione is not an obligatory participant in disulfide bond formation in yeast (13Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Other investigators have suggested that cystamine, generated by a NADPH-dependent microsomal flavoprotein, monooxygenase (14Ziegler D.M. Poulsen L.L. Trends Biochem.

However, the activities observed in these studies seemed to be rather modest, which may have discouraged the widespread adoption of these proposals. The present work deals with a sulfhydryl oxidase (26Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Hoober K.L. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that is secreted, together with a number of other disulfide-bridged proteins, into the egg white of the chicken. The oxidase is a dimeric glycoprotein of 80-kDa monomers each bearing a noncovalently bound FAD and a redox-active disulfide bridge (26Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we show, for the first time, that a sulfhydryl oxidase can rapidly and directly introduce disulfide bonds into a wide range of proteins and peptides with catalytic efficiencies about 100-fold higher than for free cysteine or glutathione. Further, these oxidized, misfolded proteins are good substrates for PDI. Egg white sulfhydryl oxidase and recombinant rat liver protein disulfide isomerase were purified and assayed as described previously (4Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 26-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol.

Bovine pancreatic RNase and insulin, egg white lysozyme and ovalbumin, rabbit muscle aldolase and pyruvate kinase, and DTT, DTNB, ultra-pure urea, and guanidine hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma. TCEP was from Pierce. Egg white riboflavin binding protein was a generous gift from Dr. Harold B. White III. The ovalbumin heptapeptide N-(acetyl)-EAQCGTS-carboxyl (83% pure by high pressure liquid chromatography) was from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. Proteins (20 mg of RNase, lysozyme, ovalbumin, and riboflavin-binding protein) were dissolved in 1-ml aliquots of degassed 100 mm Tris buffer containing 6m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.3 mm EDTA, followed by the addition of at least a 5-fold excess of DTT over total protein thiols. The solution was incubated at pH 8 for 1 h at 37 °C and then adjusted to pH 3.5 with glacial acetic acid and gel-filtered using a PD10 column equilibrated with deoxygenated 8m urea containing 0.1% v/v acetic acid and 3 mm EDTA. Reduced denatured proteins were stored under nitrogen and were standardized for thiol content by DTNB. Insulin (30 mg) was suspended in 3 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA and dissolved upon the addition of a minimal volume of 1 m HCl. After adding 15 mm TCEP, the pH was adjusted to 3.8 with KOH, and the clear solution was flushed with nitrogen. Reduced A and B chains precipitated during overnight incubation at 20 °C and were recovered by centrifugation (4 min at 12,000 × g). The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of 8 m urea containing 25 mm Tris buffer, 1 mm EDTA and dissolved after the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with KOH. The solution was applied to a 0.5 × 5-cm DE-52 column equilibrated with this same buffer. The reduced insulin B chain emerged unretained in the wash. The A chain was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.08 m sodium acetate well separated from excess phosphine reductant. Aldolase and pyruvate kinase were dissolved in 8 m urea containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, 0.3 mmEDTA, pH 7.5, prior to use. Table I summarizes the physical and kinetic properties for a number of reduced proteins and peptides used as substrates in this study. Although RNase solutions are easily handled after denaturation and reduction, many other reduced proteins aggregate severely when the denaturant is removed. For consistency, a standard procedure was adopted to reduce each protein substrate. The denatured, reduced protein was rigorously freed of DTT by gel filtration in 8 m urea at pH 3.5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting reduced protein stock solutions were then kept under nitrogen and diluted as needed into assay buffer at pH 7.5 containing a final urea concentration of 2 m. This residual urea concentration has a relatively minor effect on sulfhydryl oxidase catalysis of the oxidation of ribonuclease; V maxis reduced by 28% and K m is increased 1.6-fold from the corresponding values in buffer alone (29Hoober K.L. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because bovine pancreatic RNase is not a physiological substrate of the oxidase, and might have an anomalously high reactivity, we tested three egg white proteins using the procedures outlined above.Table IComparison of several substrates for the egg white sulfhydryl oxidaseProteinM rpI-SHaNumber of thiols before reduction.initial-SHbTotal thiols after reduction of any disulfide bonds.finalTN maxcTN max values are disulfide bonds formed/minute.K mdK m values are expressed both on a per thiol basis and per substrate molecule (shown in parentheses).TN max/K meTN max/K m uses thiol (not protein) concentrations.min −1μmm −1s −1RNase13,7007.808610115 (14)8.8 × 104Lysozyme14,30010.708860110 (14)1.3 × 105Riboflavin-binding protein34,0004.20181100230 (13)8.0 × 104Ovalbumin45,0004.546565330 (55)2.9 × 104Aldolase40,2006.188200160 (20)2.1 × 104Pyruvate kinasefIn 3 m urea to maintain solubility at higher substrate concentrations.59,2506.6994751,250 (140)6.3 × 103Insulin A chain2,3403.8041000215 (55)7.8 × 104Insulin B chainfIn 3 m urea to maintain solubility at higher substrate concentrations.3,4006.902700300 (150)3.9 × 104N-acetyl-EAQCGTS7404.01114201,7201.4 × 104GSHgSee Ref. 26.3002.811138520,0001.2 × 103Kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”a Number of thiols before reduction.b Total thiols after reduction of any disulfide bonds.c TN max values are disulfide bonds formed/minute.d K m values are expressed both on a per thiol basis and per substrate molecule (shown in parentheses).e TN max/K m uses thiol (not protein) concentrations.f In 3 m urea to maintain solubility at higher substrate concentrations.g See Ref. 26Hoober K.L.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lysozyme, a highly basic protein with four disulfide bridges (Table I), comprises about 3.5% of the total protein in egg white. Fig.1 shows that the oxidase is a facile oxidant of reduced lysozyme in 2 m urea. Reoxidation is one-half complete in 125 s with 0.4 of 8 thiols remaining after 27 min under these conditions. This strongly curved time course is typical of protein substrates and may reflect the progressive difficulties of inserting additional disulfides into an ever more constrained substrate. The inset in Fig. 1 plots initial turnover numbers (expressed as disulfide bonds generated per minute) as the lysozyme thiol concentration is raised. The K m/thiol is 110 μm (14 μm/lysozyme molecule), markedly lower than the corresponding values for glutathione (20 mm (26Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). Riboflavin-binding protein, a strongly acidic protein with nine disulfide bridges, accounts for about 0.8% of the egg white. The reduced denatured riboflavin-binding protein was freed from both excess DTT and bound riboflavin by gel filtration and was found to be an excellent substrate of the oxidase. Oxidation of cysteine residues was essentially complete (less than 2 of the 18 cysteine residues in 10 μm reduced aporiboflavin-binding protein remain after 16 min using 100 nm oxidase; not shown). Initial rates yield a turnover number of 1100/min with an apparent K m of 230 μm/thiol. Ovalbumin, the dominant egg white protein (54% of the total), is unusual in that one native disulfide coexists with four free cysteine residues (most secreted proteins do not have free cysteine residues (Table I)). Prolonged incubation of the oxidase with reduced ovalbumin consistently led to the decrease of 1.8 of 6 total thiols. This failure to oxidize the approximately four remaining thiols is consistent with a native structure for reoxidized ovalbumin. In view of the refractility of ovalbumin to complete oxidation, we tested the oxidase using proteins without naturally occurring disulfide bridges. Aldolase and pyruvate kinase are abundant cytoplasmic proteins with eight and nine cysteine residues per subunit, respectively (TableI). Neither of these proteins is a detectable substrate in its native state when diluted into standard assay conditions containing 2 (or 3) M urea (not shown). However, after pretreatment with 8 murea, the reduced proteins become significant substrates. In both cases essentially all protein thiol groups are converted to disulfide cross-links. Both the A and B chains of bovine insulin are excellent substrates of the egg white oxidase (Table I) The low solubility of the B chain required a concentration of 3 m urea to allow estimation of a K m (not shown; Table I). The mixture of reduced A and B chains, freed from reductant by gel filtration in 8 murea, gave a TN max and K m per thiol essentially comparable with the kinetics observed for the isolated A chain. Finally, a synthetic heptapeptide (residues 70–76 matching one-half of the single ovalbumin disulfide bridge) proved a worse substrate than either of the insulin chains, with aK m of 1.7 mm. These data show that the oxidase is a facile oxidant for cysteine residues in a range of proteins and peptides. Preliminary experiments showed that the rapid oxidation of RNase thiols by sulfhydryl oxidase led to less than a 10% regain in enzymatic activity (29Hoober K.L. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3211-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows that the resulting inactive oxidized RNase is a good substrate for protein disulfide isomerase. As expected, when reduced RNase is incubated with 0.5 μm reduced PDI and 1 mm GSH in the absence of sulfhydryl oxidase, little recovery of RNase activity occurs because a source of oxidizing equivalent is absent. However, the inclusion of low concentrations of sulfhydryl oxidase (0.02 or 0.1 μm) as the sole oxidizing catalyst, as well as retaining 1 mm GSH to ensure that PDI is maintained in its active reduced state (4Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 26-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), leads to a marked increase in the regeneration of active RNase. The amount of GSSG directly produced by the oxidase in the initial stages of the assay (<0.02 mm) is insufficient to support significant nonenzymatic RNase oxidation. In any event, Table I shows that RNase thiols would be considerably better substrates of the oxidase than GSH under these conditions. Fig. 2 B shows that sulfhydryl oxidase can oxidize reduced PDI directly. Reduced PDI is assayed by the ability of its redox-active dithiols to isomerize scrambled RNase in the absence of GSH (30Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Hence, the decline in PDI activity observed in Fig. 2 B, when reduced PDI is incubated with increasing concentration of the oxidase in the absence of GSH, reflects the conversion of PDI into its inactive oxidized form. Egg white sulfhydryl oxidase is a facile, versatile, and direct catalyst for the in vitro formation of disulfide bridges within peptides and proteins. There seem to be no obvious restrictions as to molecular weight or pI for the substrates tested (Table I). The oxidase can even oxidize unfolded cytoplasmic proteins without native disulfide bridges. Secreted proteins with two or more thiols seem to be the best substrates of the oxidase, with typical K mvalues of 110–330 μm/thiol (Table I) compared with values of 1.7 mm for the monothiol ovalbumin heptapeptide, 20 mm for GSH, and 50 mm for β-mercaptoethanol (26Hoober K.L. Joneja B. White III, H.B. Thorpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30510-30516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The high K m and the low catalytic efficiency of glutathione (e.g. 100-fold lower than for lysozyme thiols; Table I) suggest that this abundant cellular reductant is not likely to be a primary substrate of the enzyme. The GSH concentration in the ER has been estimated as 0.5–1 mm(12Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar), a value far lower than the K m of 20 mm for this sulfhydryl oxidase. However, GSH might serve as a co-substrate of the oxidase, with the generation of mixed disulfide bridges as a first step in the oxidative process in vivo. The conditions of these in vitro experiments, with dilute solutions of reduced proteins in 2 or 3 m urea, are far from the crowded environment of the ER, in which co- and post-translational disulfide bridge formations (31Braakman I.

Fig. 2supports a potential cooperation between sulfhydryl oxidase and PDI in the ER. Oxidase-treated reduced RNase is not only a good substrate of PDI, but the oxidase can also oxidize reduced PDI directly. Thus, the sulfhydryl oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of nascent chains in the ER could occur via direct interaction or through the mediation of PDI. Clearly, the current experiments do not definitively prove that this FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase is directly involved in the maturation of secreted proteins. Indeed disulfide bond formation in eukaryotes may involve multiple pathways and redundancies. However, the present experiments do show, apparently for the first time, that this FAD-linked enzyme can oxidize a wide range of protein and peptide substrates with catalytic efficiencies up to 100-fold higher than glutathione. It is important to note that oxidation is direct and does not require the mediation of small molecular disulfides such as GSSG. If sulfhydryl oxidases are not involved in the generation of protein disulfide bridges, what is the physiological role of these widely distributed metalloprotein and flavin-linked catalysts (18Janolino V.G.

The transport specificities of some family members are known, but most are not.

Reconstituted OAC catalyzes both unidirectional transport and exchange of substrates. In S. cerevisiae, OAC is in inner mitochondrial membranes, and deletion of its gene greatly reduces transport of oxaloacetate sulfate, thiosulfate, and malonate. Mitochondria from wild-type cells swelled in isoosmotic solutions of ammonium salts of oxaloacetate, sulfate, thiosulfate, and malonate, indicating that these anions are cotransported with protons. Overexpression of OAC in the deletion strain increased greatly the [35S]sulfate/sulfate and [35S]sulfate/oxaloacetate exchanges in proteoliposomes reconstituted with digitonin extracts of mitochondria. The main physiological role of OAC appears to be to use the proton-motive force to take up into mitochondria oxaloacetate produced from pyruvate by cytoplasmic pyruvate carboxylase.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two principal pathways for replenishing the intermediates of the Krebs cycle that have been withdrawn for biosynthesis. They are the glyoxylate cycle and the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, catalyzed by two cytosolic isozymes of pyruvate carboxylase. (Mammalian pyruvate carboxylase is in the mitochondrial matrix.) These processes require traffic of substrates across the inner mitochondrial membrane. S. cerevisiae encodes 35 members of the mitochondrial carrier family (1Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Kuan J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The former catalyzes the import into mitochondria of succinate (or malate) in exchange for phosphate, producing a net uptake of succinate and supply of a substrate to the Krebs cycle (7Palmieri L.

Yeast gene disruption strains (Δ-DIC1 and Δ-SFC1) cannot grow on either ethanol or acetate as sole carbon source, but they grow well on glycerol, pyruvate and other nonfermentable substrates (7Palmieri L.

Growth of the Δ-DIC1strain on ethanol or acetate is restored by both low concentrations of oxaloacetate and other compounds that start the tricarboxylate cycle (and the oxidation of the acetyl-CoA unconsumed by the glyoxylate cycle) by generating either intramitochondrial oxaloacetate or other Krebs cycle intermediates (7Palmieri L.

Therefore, does oxaloacetate enter yeast mitochondria, and if so, how? The S. cerevisiae geneOAC1 1The name OAC1 has been reserved for the gene encoding the yeast oxaloacetate carrier. (formerly known as PMT or YKL120w) encodes a member of the mitochondrial carrier family of hitherto unknown function that is 29% identical to the yeast DIC, its closest relative in yeast and 30% identical to the bovine 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier. OAC and the dicarboxylate carrier are the only carriers that cluster on a phylogenetic tree with the bovine oxoglutarate/malate carrier (10El Moualij B. Duyckaerts C. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Sluse F.E.

We have overexpressed the OAC in E. coli, reconstituted it into phospholipid vesicles, and shown that it transports oxaloacetate, sulfate, and thiosulfate both in vitro and in vivo.

Transport at 25 °C was started by adding [14C]malonate or [35S]sulfate to the proteoliposomes and terminated by addition of 0.l mm p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate and 10 mm bathophenanthroline (the “inhibitor-stop” method (18Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). In controls, inhibitors were added with the labeled substrate. Finally, the external radioactivity was removed on Dowex AGl-X8, and the internal radioactivity was measured (18Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The transport activity was the difference between experimental and control values. The initial rate of transport was calculated in μmol/min/g of protein from the time course of isotope equilibration (18Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Various other transport activities were also assayed by inhibitor-stop. The OAC1 gene was deleted by homologous recombination of the auxotrophic marker URA3 at the OAC1 gene locus of S. cerevisiae strain YPH499. Its genotype is MATa ade2–101 his3-Δ 200 leu2-Δ1 ura3–52 trpl-Δ 63lys2-801 OAC1::URA3. The coding sequence was cloned into the yeast expression plasmid pYeDP60 (19Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) yielding plasmidOAC1-pYeDP60. It was introduced into the Δ-OAC1yeast strain, and transformants were selected for adenine auxotrophy. Wild-type fungi and the deleted strain were grown either in rich medium containing 2% bactopeptone and 1% yeast extract (YP) or in synthetic complete medium (20Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) supplemented with either fermentatable or nonfermentable carbon sources (2% glucose or 2% galactose, and 3% glycerol, 2% ethanol, and 3% acetate or 2% lactate). The Δ-OAC1 strain transformed with the OAC1-pYeDP60 construct (the OAC1-pYeDP60 strain) was precultured in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, supplemented with 2% ethanol. For preparation of mitochondria, the preculture was diluted 35-fold in YP medium. The Gal-Cyc promoter was repressed by addition of 0.1% glucose. The OAC1-pYeDP60 cells were grown to exponential phase, and galactose (0.4%) was added 6 h before harvesting. Yeast was grown in YP broth supplemented with 2% ethanol, and mitochondria were isolated (21Daum G. Gasser S.M. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13075-13080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Integral membrane proteins were separated from soluble and peripheral proteins by extraction of mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) with 0.1 m sodium carbonate for 30 min at 0 °C and centrifugation (226,000 × g for 1 h at 2 °C). The pellet contained integral membrane proteins, and the supernatant contained peripheral and soluble proteins (22Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were resuspended in buffer (10 mmK+-MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm o-phenanthroline, and 0.2 m KCl; final protein concentration, 1 mg/ml) and extracted with digitonin (23Hartl F.-U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The solutions were mixed and placed on ice for 1 min. They were diluted with 4 volumes of buffer and centrifuged (100,000 × g for 10 min). The soluble proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a rabbit antibody against recombinant OAC (24Dietmeier K. Zara V. Palmisano A.

Swelling of mitochondria in an isoosmotic solution of an ammonium salt indicates that an anion permeates the mitochondrion with protons (or in exchange for hydroxyl ions) (25Chappell J.B. Br. Med. Bull. 1968; 24: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Molecular ammonia is protonated inside the mitochondria, and the pH gradient collapses. The rate of swelling of mitochondria was monitored by the decrease in A 546 (7Palmieri L. Vozza A. Hönlinger A. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Zara V. Palmieri F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria (100 μg of protein) were added to 1 ml of various ammonium salts (120 mm), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μm rotenone, and 0.1 μm antimycin. The membrane potential of mitochondria was assessed from the fluorescence changes of the voltage-sensitive dye DiSC3(5) (26Zara V. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Vozza A. Rassow J. Palmieri F. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6524-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Yeast OAC was overexpressed inE. coli C0214(DE3) at high levels (Fig.1, lane 4). Its apparent molecular mass was about 37 kDa (calculated value including the initiator methionine, 35,165 Da). The purified inclusion bodies gave rise a single band on SDS-PAGE gels with the same apparent molecular mass (Fig. 1, lane 5). It was detected neither in bacteria harvested immediately before induction of expression (lane 2) nor in cells harvested after induction but lacking the OAC coding sequence in the expression vector (lane 3). The N-terminal sequence of the 37-kDa protein, SSDNSKQDKQIE, is identical to residues 2–13 of OAC. About 60 mg of purified protein (Fig. 1, lane 5) were obtained per liter of culture. The reconstituted protein catalyzed an active [l4C]malonate/malonate exchange and a more active [35S]sulfate/sulfate exchange (TableI) that were inhibited by a mixture ofp-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate and bathophenanthroline. Homoexchange activities more than 1 order of magnitude lower than these activities were measured for malate, oxoglutarate, and phosphate. No homoexchange activities were detected with OAC that had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes or by reconstitution of sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the expression vector for OAC or harvested immediately before induction of overexpression. The proteoliposomes did not catalyze homoexchanges for fumarate, citrate, glutamate, aspartate, glutamine, carnitine, ornithine, and ADP (external concentration, 1 mm; internal concentration, 10 mm) (Table I).Table IRates of homo-exchanges of various substrates in proteoliposomes containing recombinant yeast OACSubstrate transportμmol/min/g proteinMalonate222l-Malate25Fumarate0Sulfate596Phosphate10Oxoglutarate12Citrate0Glutamate0Aspartate0Glutamine0Ornithine0Carnitine0ADP0Transport was initiated by adding radioactive substrate (final concentration, 1 mm) to proteoliposomes preloaded internally with the same substrate (concentration, 10 mm). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Transport was initiated by adding radioactive substrate (final concentration, 1 mm) to proteoliposomes preloaded internally with the same substrate (concentration, 10 mm). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. In Fig. 2 A, the time-courses are compared of uptake by proteoliposomes of 1 mm[l4C]malonate measured either as uniport (in the absence of internal malonate) or as exchange (in the presence of 10 mm malonate). Both data sets fitted a first-order rate equation with rate constants (k) for the exchange and the uniport reactions of 0.15 and 0.14 min−1, respectively. Maximum uptake was approached after 30 min. The corresponding values at infinite time were 1.46 and 0.16 μmol/mg. The ratio of maximal substrate uptake by the exchange and by the uniport was 9.1, in agreement with the expected value of 10 from the intraliposomal concentrations at equilibrium (1 and 10 mm for uniport and exchange, respectively). The initial rates of malonate uptake (the product of k and intraliposomal quantity of malonate taken up at equilibrium (18Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)) were 213 and 23 μmol/min/g of protein for the exchange and uniport reactions, respectively. The addition of 10 mm unlabeled malonate after 30 min incubation, when radioactive uptake by the proteoliposomes had approached equilibrium, caused an extensive efflux of radiolabeled malonate from both malonate-loaded and unloaded proteoliposomes (Fig. 2 A). This efflux indicates that the [l4C]malonate taken up by uniport is released by exchange for externally added substrate. Upon addition to liposomes that had been preincubated for 30 min with 1 mm [l4C]malonate in the absence of internal substrate of 10 mm malonate, oxaloacetate, or sulfate, an extensive efflux of intraliposomal radioactivity was observed (Fig.2 B). Upon addition of malate, oxoglutarate, and phosphate, very little efflux was detected, and addition of fumarate had no effect. These results indicate clearly that oxaloacetate, sulfate, and malonate are good substrates for reconstituted OAC. The substrate specificity of reconstituted OAC was investigated further by measuring the uptake of [l4C]malonate and [35S]sulfate into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with various substrates (Table II). The highest activities were observed in the presence of internal sulfate, thiosulfate, oxaloacetate, and malonate. Lower activity was found in the presence of internal malate, succinate, oxoglutarate, and phosphate. Virtually no exchange was detected with internal fumarate, pyruvate, aspartate, glutamate, citrate, ADP, ornithine, glutamine, and carnitine. The residual activity in the presence of these substrates was virtually the same as the activity observed without internal substrate. Therefore, the substrate specificity of the OAC protein is confined essentially to sulfate, thiosulfate, and the physiologically important dicarboxylate oxaloacetate.Table IIDependence on internal substrate of the transport properties of proteoliposomes containing recombinant yeast OACInternal substrate (10 mm)Substrate transport[14C]Malonate[35S]Sulfateμmol/5 min/g proteinNone (Cl−present)129116Malonate8831252Sulfate9471597Thiosulfate9641488Oxaloacetate9561305l-Malate296621Succinate214263Oxoglutarate258407Phosphate253352Fumarate145198Pyruvate123107Aspartate92104Glutamate10598Citrate137152ADP114125Ornithine138146Glutamine127109Carnitine130182Proteoliposomes were preloaded internally with various substrates (concentration, 10 mm).

Transport was started by the external addition of [14C]malonate or [35S]sulfate (final concentrations, 0.5 mm) and terminated after 5 min. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. The uptake of [l4C]malonate by proteoliposomes was inhibited by sulfydryl reagents (mersalyl,p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, andN-ethylmaleimide), by pyridoxal 5-phosphate, and by bathophenanthroline (Table III). The impermeable dicarboxylate analogues butylmalonate and benzylmalonate also inhibited the transport activity strongly. In contrast, carboxyatractyloside, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate and α-cyanocinnamate, inhibitors of other characterized mitochondrial carriers, had no effect on the activities of reconstituted OAC. The ability of nonradioactive potential substrates to inhibit the uptake of [l4C]malonate was also examined (Table III). Malonate transport was prevented by external addition of malonate, sulfate, thiosulfate, and oxaloacetate, substrates that are transported by OAC (Tables I and II and Fig. 2 B). To a lesser extent, poor substrates such as malate, phosphate, oxoglutarate, and succinate inhibited the OAC-catalyzed transport of [l4C]malonate.Table IIIEffect of inhibitors and externally added substrates on the uptake of [ 14C]malonate into proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant OACReagentsInhibition%Experiment 1Mersalyl99p-Chloromercuriphenylsulfonate99N-Ethylmaleimide68Bathophenanthroline85Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate84Butylmalonate93Benzylmalonate881,2,3-Benzenetricarboxylate12Carboxyatractyloside4α-Cyanocinnamate7Experiment 2Malonate96Sulfate87Thiosulfate82Sulfite85Oxaloacetate84Malate56Phosphate46Oxoglutarate30Succinate23Pyruvate6Citrate7ADP4Carnitine10Ornithine7Transport was started by adding [14C]malonate (final concentration, 0.1 mm) to proteoliposomes containing 10 mm NaCl and no substrate.

All inhibitors and substrates were present at final concentrations of 2 mm, except for organic mercurials (0.001 mm), carboxyatractyloside and α-cyanocinnamate (0.1 mm), and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (10 mm).

The control values for uninhibited malonate uptake were 12.4 (experiment 1) and 14.0 (experiment 2) μmol/min per g of protein. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. TheK m and V max values for malonate uptake by unloaded proteoliposomes (measured as uniport at 25 °C), from a typical experiment (Fig.3) were 0.11 mm and 25 μmol/min/g of protein, respectively. The average values ofK m and V max from 18 experiments were 0.1 ± 0.01 mm and 22 ± 6 μmol/min/g of protein, respectively. Oxaloacetate and sulfate inhibited malonate uptake competitively (Fig. 3). All of the compounds summarized in Table IV are competitive inhibitors with respect to malonate, because they were found to increase the apparent K m without changing theV max of malonate uptake (not shown). TheK i value of l-malate is significantly lower than the respective K m value (> 6 mm) as determined from homoexchange rate measurements, indicating that although malate is poorly transported by OAC, it has a high affinity for its substrate-binding site.Table IVCompetition with [ 14C]malonate uptake in proteoliposomes containing recombinant yeast OACSubstrateK immSulfate0.07 ± 0.02Thiosulfate0.17 ± 0.02Sulfite0.06 ± 0.01Oxaloacetate0.25 ± 0.09Malate1.1 ± 0.2Oxoglutarate3.4 ± 0.4Phosphate2.0 ± 0.4The values were calculated from double reciprocal plots of the rate of [14C]malonate uptake versus substrate concentrations.

The competing substrates were added at the appropriate concentrations simultaneously with [14C]malonate. The data represent the means ± S.D. of at least three different experiments. A single immunoreactive band with an apparent molecular mass of about 36.2 kDa was detected in the wild-type mitochondria, but not in mitochondria from the Δ-OAC1 strain (Fig. 4). The calculated mass of OAC including the initiator methionine is 35,165 Da. The contents of succinate-fumarate, ADP/ATP, phosphate, and the dicarboxylate carriers detected with specific antibodies were essentially the same in wild-type and Δ-OAC1 mitochondria. Therefore, the absence of OAC from the Δ-OAC1 strain does not reduce expression of other carriers. The submitochondrial location of OAC was examined by separation of soluble and peripheral proteins from integral membrane proteins of wild-type mitochondria by carbonate treatment (Fig.5, A and B). OAC remained in the membrane protein fraction, as did the ADP/ATP carrier and Tom40 (marker proteins of inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively), but the intermembrane space protein cytochrome b2 and the matrix protein hsp70 were in the soluble and peripheral protein fraction. Therefore, OAC is an integral mitochondrial membrane protein. Both OAC and the ADP/ATP carrier were solubilized from wild-type mitochondria at the same concentration of digitonin, which was greater than that required to solubilize the outer membrane protein Tom40 (Fig.5 C). Therefore, OAC is an integral protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Wild-type and Δ-OAC1cells had similar growth characteristics in complete synthetic medium and in YP broth, but their mitochondria differed in several respects. For example, wild-type mitochondria swelled in 120 mmsolutions of ammonium salts of malonate, oxaloacetate, sulfate, and thiosulfate (Fig. 6), whereas mitochondria from the Δ-OAC1 strain did not do so appreciably. Both mitochondria swelled in ammonium phosphate, indicating the presence of an active phosphate carrier, but neither did in the ammonium salts of malate (mainly transported by the dicarboxylate carrier; swelling requires a catalytic trace of phosphate), fumarate (transported by the succinate-fumarate carrier), or chloride (impermeant anion). Therefore, the absence of OAC does not affect the integrity of the mitochondria and the activity of other carriers. The validity of the swelling method was confirmed by control experiments on mitochondria from a strain in which the gene for the dicarboxylate carrier has been disrupted (ΔDIC1). They swelled in the presence of the ammonium salts of low affinity substrates of the dicarboxylate carrier (oxaloacetate, malonate, sulfate, and thiosulfate) at a very similar rate to wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 6), but not in the presence of ammonium malate plus phosphate, in agreement with the absence of the dicarboxylate carrier (7Palmieri L. Vozza A. Hönlinger A. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Zara V. Palmieri F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). When the external pH was decreased from 8.0–5.9, the rate of swelling in ammonium sulfate increased strongly (Fig.7 A), confirming the dependence of the sulfate/H+ influx on ΔpH. Similar results were obtained with ammonium oxaloacetate and ammonium malonate (data not shown). Further evidence that the influx into the mitochondrial matrix of sulfate, oxaloacetate, and malonate is carrier-mediated came from the study of the effects of inhibitors of OAC on swelling. In isoosmotic ammonium sulfate, swelling of wild-type mitochondria is strongly inhibited by 20 mm bathophenanthroline and abolished almost completely by 0.2 mm mersalyl orp-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (Fig. 7 B). Organic mercurials and bathophenanthroline inhibited mitochondrial swelling in ammonium salts of oxaloacetate and malonate (data not shown). Therefore, mitochondrial swelling and activity of recombinant OAC are inhibited by the same reagents. Finally, the membrane potential (Δψ) of wild-type and Δ-OAC1 mitochondria were compared with the fluorescence dye DiSC3(5) (27Sims P.J. Waggoner A.S. Wang C.-H. Hoffmann J.F. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). The fluorescence difference of the mitochondria and substrates, before and after the addition of valinomycin (in the presence of K+), was virtually the same in wild-type and Δ-OAC1 mitochondria (data not shown). Therefore, deletion of the OAC1 gene does not influence the coupling properties of the inner mitochondrial membrane. OAC was expressed about 30 times higher in mitochondria in theOAC1-pYeDP60 strain than in wild-type mitochondria. Increased activity was evident from rapid mitochondrial swelling in ammonium sulfate or ammonium malonate (Fig. 6), and from increased uptake into proteoliposomes reconstituted with a digitonin extract of those mitochondria of [35S]sulfate in exchange for sulfate, oxaloacetate, or malonate (Fig.8). The sulfate/sulfate, sulfate/oxaloacetate, and sulfate/malonate exchange activities were several times higher than in Δ-OAC1 and wild-type mitochondria, whereas the sulfate/phosphate exchange (mainly the dicarboxylate carrier) was little increased in OAC1-pYeDP60 mitochondria. Similarly, the [l4C]malate/phosphate exchange (the defining reaction of the dicarboxylate carrier) was virtually the same in wild-type and OAC1-pYeDP60 mitochondria (not shown). Therefore, the large difference between the activities of the reactions catalyzed by OAC in Δ-OAC1 and OAC1-pYeDP60 mitochondria strongly supports the conclusion that OAC functions as a transporter for oxaloacetate and sulfate. The identification of yeast OAC as an oxaloacetate and sulfate carrier provides a further demonstration of the utility of the procedure for overexpressing the mitochondrial carriers in E. coli and of reconstituting the recombinant proteins in liposomes in order to study their transport properties. This procedure, originally developed with the bovine oxoglutarate/malate carrier (15Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) to be identified. The use of S. cerevisiae strains containing deleted carrier genes has provided evidence that the dicarboxylate and ornithine carriers operate with the same transport properties in vivoas in vitro (7Palmieri L. Vozza A. Hönlinger A. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Zara V. Palmieri F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Soetens O. Crabeel M. El Moualij B. Duyckaerts C. Sluse F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 702-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Four observations demonstrate that reconstituted OAC catalyzes both exchange and uniport. First, the ratio between malonate taken up by exchange and uniport at equilibrium agrees with the expected value if all of the carrier-loaded liposomes catalyze both exchange and uniport of malonate. Second, addition of unlabeled substrates releases nearly all [14C]malonate taken up by uniport. Third, both exchange and uniport are inhibited by low concentrations of bathophenanthroline and mercurials. Fourth, the first-order rate constant for uniport is practically the same as that measured for the exchange. However, the exchange rate is much faster than the uniport rate, and so the OAC resembles other reconstituted mitochondrial carriers (phosphate, carnitine, and ornithine) (31Palmieri L. De Marco V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,34Indiveri C. Tonazzi A. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1069: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The physiologically important reaction for the phosphate carrier is the uniport (Pi/H+ symport), whereas for the carnitine and the ornithine carriers, both exchange and unidirectional reactions are important. Because the apparentV max depends on the experimental conditions of the reconstituted system, and the amount of active carrier molecules present in the proteoliposomes is not known, the transport rates measured in the reconstituted system may differ substantially from the activities in vivo. The substrate specificity of the OAC is distinct from those of the dicarboxylate and oxoglutarate carriers (the principal substrates of which are malate and phosphate, and oxoglutarate and malate, respectively), or from any other characterized mitochondrial carrier. Nonetheless, l-malate, phosphate, and oxoglutarate are transported to some extent by the OAC protein, and so its specificity overlaps with those of the dicarboxylate and the oxoglutarate carriers. When homoexchanges are measured (Table I), the rate is less than 120 of that of the sulfate/sulfate exchange. However, a low rate of transport takes place when the exchange of intraliposomal malate, oxoglutarate, or phosphate at high concentrations (10 mm) is measured against sulfate and malonate, which are good substrates for OAC (Table II). The inhibition constants of oxoglutarate, phosphate, and expecially malate on the rate of malonate uptake (Table III) also indicate a rather significant affinity for OAC. However, the half-saturation transport constant for malate (>6 mm) is much higher than its K i, clearly showing that malate binds to the substrate-binding site of OAC, although it is poorly transported. Given the rather close similarity of the sequences of the OAC and the dicarboxylate and the oxoglutarate carriers, this is expected. The swelling properties of the wild-type yeast mitochondria were strikingly different from those of rat liver. The former swell in ammonium oxaloacetate, sulfate, thiosulfate, and malonate, whereas the latter do not swell either in ammonium oxaloacetate, 3L. Palmieri, A. Vozza, G. Agrimi, V. De Marco, M. J. Runswick, F. Palmieri, and J. E. Walker, unpublished observations. or in ammonium sulfate, thiosulfate, or malonate (35Crompton M. Palmieri F. Capano M. Quagliariello E. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Crompton M. Palmieri F. Capano M. Quagliariello E. FEBS Lett. 1974; 46: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, oxaloacetate, sulfate, thiosulfate, and malonate are transported into the yeast mitochondrial matrix with protons (or in exchange for hydroxyl ion) (25Chappell J.B. Br. Med. Bull. 1968; 24: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and the ΔpH component of the protonmotive force drives their entry into the matrix (37Mitchell P. Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). This transport mechanism is consistent with the ability of the recombinant OAC to catalyze influx of its substrates into proteoliposomes in the absence of internal substrate. As the S. cerevisiaepyruvate carboxylase is cytoplasmic, one physiological role of OAC is probably to catalyze uptake of oxaloacetate into mitochondria, a role supported by the higher transcript level in synthetic medium than in rich medium (13Richard G.-F.

The OAC1 gene is not essential for growth of S. cerevisiae, and it is likely that in the absence of OAC, oxaloacetate is converted to malate in the cytoplasm, and malate enters the mitochondrion via the dicarboxylate carrier in exchange for phosphate. A role in anaplerosis for both the OAC and the dicarboxylate carrier (7Palmieri L. Vozza A. Hönlinger A. Dietmeier K. Palmisano A. Zara V. Palmieri F. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is consistent with the failure of a yeast strain with both carrier genes deleted to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (not shown). Another possible role for the OAC may be to transfer reducing equivalents from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol by catalyzing a malate/oxaloacetate exchange when the intramitochondrial concentrations of NADH and malate are high. A malate-oxaloacetate shuttle has been proposed to operate in mammalian and plant mitochondria (38Gimpel J.A. De Haan E.J. Tager J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Passarella S. Palmieri F. Quagliariello E. Arch. Biochem.

The OAC and the dicarboxylate carrier are the only proteins with significant sequence homology to the bovine oxoglutarate carrier, and so it is unlikely that S. cerevisiae has an oxoglutarate/malate carrier. One important difference between animal and yeast mitochondria is the mechanism for reoxidation of cytosolic NADH. In animals, the oxoglutarate/malate and glutamate/aspartate carriers produce a net transport of reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix by the aspartate-malate shuttle. InS. cerevisiae and in plants, cytosolic NADH is oxidized on the exterior of the inner mitochondrial membrane, making the presence of the oxoglutarate/malate carrier unnecessary. Therefore, it is possible that OAC and the oxoglutarate carrier have evolved from a close common ancestor. Transport of sulfate and thiosulfate may be important in sulfur metabolism. In mammals, the conversion of thiosulfate to sulfite is catalyzed by mitochondrial thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanase) and thiosulfate reductase (41De Duve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1955; 60: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar, 42Koj A. Frendo J. Janik Z. Biochem.

NF-κB is sequestered in the cytosol by an inhibitory subunit IκB, which is inducibly phosphorylated by an IκB kinase complex and subsequently degraded. Sodium salicylate (NaSal) can block NF-κB activation by inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation. Recently, we used the specific p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor SB203580 to demonstrate that inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation requires NaSal-induced p38 activation. We demonstrate that NaSal similarly inhibits TNF-induced IκBβ degradation in a p38-dependent manner. To further examine the role of p38, we determined whether other agents that activate p38 can block TNF-induced IκB phosphorylation and degradation. Sorbitol, H2O2, and arsenite each blocked IκBα phosphorylation induced by TNF, and SB203580 reversed the inhibitory effects of sorbitol and H2O2, but not arsenite. In addition, sorbitol and H2O2 blocked TNF-induced but not interleukin-1-induced IκBα phosphorylation, whereas arsenite inhibited IκBα phosphorylation induced by TNF and interleukin-1. Transient expression of MAP kinase kinase (MKK) 6b(E), a constitutive activator of p38, reduced both TNF-induced phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB-dependent reporter activity. However, MKK7(D), a constitutive activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinases, failed to inhibit these TNF actions.

Among the events leading to enhanced gene expression by these cytokines is activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, important in the regulation of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. NF-κB exists as a homo- or heterodimer of members of the Rel family of proteins, consisting of p50/p105, p52/p100, p65/RelA, c-Rel, and RelB. These proteins contain an N-terminal ∼300-amino acid region known as the Rel homology domain that is responsible for dimerization, DNA binding, and interaction with an inhibitory IκB subunit, such as IκBα, IκBβ, or IκBε (4Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In most cell types, an IκB protein sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm. IκB may be inducibly phosphorylated on two serine residues at its N terminus and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to the release of NF-κB and its translocation to the nucleus. The pathway by which TNF leads to NF-κB activation involves the TNF-induced oligomerization of the type 1 TNF receptor, allowing for the recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins, including TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and activation of kinases, such as MAP ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) and the NF-κB-inducing kinase NIK (5Lee F.S.

IL-1 activates NF-κB by recruiting the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to the IL-1 receptor, enabling the association of MyD88 and the serine/threonine kinases IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and IRAK-2 (7Wesche H.

Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that are important mediators of cellular responses to a variety of stimuli. The three major subfamilies of MAP kinases in mammalian cells are the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38 MAP kinases. Each of these MAP kinase subfamilies is activated by specific upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), which dually phosphorylate MAP kinases on a threonine and tyrosine residue separated by an intervening amino acid characteristic for each MAP kinase subfamily (i.e. TEY for ERKs, TPY for JNKs, and TGY for p38 MAP kinases) (19Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 20Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Peptide growth factors and phorbol esters preferentially activate ERKs, whereas cellular stresses, such as hyperosmolarity or reactive oxygen species, as well as lipopolysaccharide and certain cytokines, most potently activate the JNK and p38 kinases. Activation of MAP kinase family members leads to phosphorylation of numerous downstream cellular effectors, including protein kinases, such as MAPKAP-K1, MAPKAP-K2/3, Mnk1/2, and MSK1, and transcription factors, including SAP-1, Elk-1, c-Jun, ATF-2, MEF2C, and CHOP (reviewed in Refs. 21Cohen P.

We have recently demonstrated that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent sodium salicylate (NaSal) can rapidly and persistently activate p38 MAP kinase (23Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I.

Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through the use of the pyridinyl imidazole compound SB203580, a specific p38 inhibitor (25Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar), we have shown that the ability of NaSal to induce apoptosis in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts is dependent upon NaSal-induced p38 activation (23Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). NaSal has been demonstrated to inhibit NF-κB activation by inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation (27Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar), and we have shown that NaSal-induced p38 activation is important for its ability to inhibit TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (24Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that NaSal similarly inhibits TNF-induced degradation of IκBβ in a p38-dependent manner. In addition, we show that stress stimuli, such as hyperosmolar sorbitol and H2O2, inhibit TNF-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα in a p38-dependent manner but have a much weaker inhibitory effect upon IL-1-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. Expression of a dominant active MKK6b(E) mutant, which specifically activates p38 MAP kinases, partially inhibits IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB-dependent transcription induced by TNF, whereas expression of an MKK7(D) mutant, which specifically activates JNKs, fails to inhibit these actions. Our results provide evidence that sustained p38 MAP kinase activation plays a role in the inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation. HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM with 0.25% FBS prior to use in experiments. Normal human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% FBS, and were serum-starved for 2–3 days in minimal essential medium with 0.25% FBS before use in experiments. COS-1 African green monkey kidney cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and were serum-starved for 18–24 h in DMEM with 0.5% FBS, except when used in transfections. NaSal, sodium meta-arsenite, sorbitol, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were purchased from Sigma. NaSal and arsenite were dissolved in distilled water, and sorbitol was dissolved in tissue culture medium. Recombinant human TNF-α was provided by Masafumi Tsujimoto of the Suntory Institute for Biomedical Research (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant human IL-1α was obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 (26Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D.

Lee and Peter Young (SmithKline Beecham) or purchased from Calbiochem and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Control experiments demonstrated that treatment of cells with Me2SO alone had no effect on the ability of all agents tested to inhibit TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα, anti-IκBβ, and anti-p38 antibodies and the mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc (9E10) antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Alternatively, a peroxidase-conjugated 9E10 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for direct detection in immunoblots. The rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p38 (recognizing p38 dually phosphorylated on Thr-180 and Tyr-182), anti-phospho-IκBα (recognizing IκBα phosphorylated on Ser-32) and monoclonal anti-phospho JNK (recognizing the 46- and 54-kDa JNK isoforms dually phosphorylated on Thr-183 and Tyr-185) antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs. Full-length constitutively active human MKK6b(E) and MKK7(D) mutants cloned in the vector pcDNA3 were described previously (29Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J.

An NF-κB-luciferase construct containing a 4× NF-κB binding element from the immunoglobulin κ enhancer (33Sen R. Baltimore D.

All transfections were performed in COS-1 cells, plated at a density of approximately 2 × 105cells/well in six-well plates. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 1 ml serum-free DMEM. Five hours posttransfection, 1 ml of DMEM with 20% FBS was added to each well. Cells were refed with DMEM containing 10% FBS the next day and incubated for 24 h following initial serum addition, prior to stimulation with the indicated agents. The pcDNA3 vector was used to equalize the total amount of DNA transfected for each experiment. COS-1 cells were transfected as described above, except that 1 ml of serum-free DMEM was added to each well 5 h posttransfection, and cells were refed with serum-free DMEM the next day. Following the indicated treatments, cells were lysed in 250 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase activity in a reaction mixture containing 25 mmglycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was measured with a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) using 1 mmd-luciferin (PharMingen) as substrate. Kinase assays were performed as described previously (23Schwenger P.

Briefly, whole cell lysates were generated using a buffer consisting of 1% Igepal, 50 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 mmNaF. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). To assay JNK activity, equal amounts of total protein were incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C with glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-c-Jun (amino acids 1–223) coupled to glutathione agarose beads (35Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). The beads were subsequently washed three times with lysis buffer, then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μmATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× protein sample buffer, and phosphorylated GST-c-Jun was visualized following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously, with some modifications (23Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, whole cell extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat milk. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. The anti-phospho-IκBα, anti-phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-c-Myc (9E10), and anti-IκBβ antibodies were each used at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS-5% bovine serum albumin. The anti-phospho JNK antibody was used at 1:2000, and the anti-IκBα antibody was used at 1:250 in TBS-5% bovine serum albumin. Antibody-antigen complexes were detected with the aid of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), and a chemiluminescent substrate development kit (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). It has been demonstrated that activation of NF-κB by TNF, lipopolysaccharide, phorbol ester, or viral infection can be prevented by treatment with NaSal (28Kopp E. Ghosh S.

Because IκBβ is another major IκB isoform responsible for inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation (40Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

We observed that in HT-29 cells TNF induced a partial degradation of IκBβ by 15 min, with IκBβ levels remaining decreased for at least 60 min (Fig.1 A, top panel). When the same lysates were immunoblotted with an antibody directed against IκBα, a nearly complete degradation of IκBα was seen by 15 min (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). Unlike IκBβ, IκBα reappeared within 30–60 min, as reported for other systems (43Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that NaSal inhibits TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in a manner preventable by the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 (24Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implicating a requirement for p38 activation by NaSal in the inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation. To determine whether NaSal-mediated inhibition of TNF-induced IκBβ degradation was similarly p38-dependent, HT-29 cells were treated with SB203580 prior to the addition of NaSal. After a 15-min incubation with TNF, cells were harvested, and lysates were immunoblotted for IκBβ and IκBα. NaSal inhibited TNF-induced degradation of both IκBβ and IκBα, and this inhibition was reversed by pretreatment with SB203580 (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that NaSal employs a similar p38-dependent mechanism to inhibit degradation of these two IκB isoforms. We have observed that NaSal inhibits IκBα degradation in a manner reversible by SB203580 in HT-29, COS-1, and 293T cell lines (Ref. 24Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Figs. 1 and 2, and data not shown). However, NaSal only weakly inhibited TNF-induced IκBα degradation in normal human FS-4 fibroblasts; nevertheless, this weak inhibition was reversed by SB203580 pretreatment, as was the stronger inhibition in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2 A). As previously demonstrated (23Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 24Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NaSal produced a rapid and sustained activation of p38 in both FS-4 and COS-1 cells (Fig. 2 B, top panels). The finding that NaSal activated p38 in the two cell types, but more strongly inhibited IκBα degradation in COS-1 cells than in FS-4 cells, suggested that p38 activation by NaSal may be required, but not sufficient, for maximal inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα degradation. Because JNK and p38 MAP kinases are coordinately regulated in many systems (44Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 45Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that activation of both p38 and JNK may be necessary for maximal inhibition of IκBα degradation induced by TNF. In previous reports, we demonstrated that NaSal fails to activate JNK in FS-4 cells yet activates both JNK and p38 in COS-1 and HT-29 cells (23Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 46Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Treatment with NaSal for time periods ranging from 15 to 60 min increased phosphorylation of the 46- and 54-kDa isoforms of JNK in COS-1 cells but not in FS-4 cells (Fig.2 B, bottom panels). Phosphorylation of these JNK isoforms in COS-1 cells correlated with increased in vitroJNK kinase activity (Ref. 46Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar and data not shown). NaSal did not produce activation of ERKs over this time course in either FS-4 or COS-1 cells (Ref. 36Schwenger P. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8089-8094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and data not shown). Thus, it appeared plausible that NaSal-induced activation of JNK, together with p38, may contribute to the strong inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα degradation observed in COS-1 (Fig. 2 A) and HT-29 cells (Fig. 1 B). In order to assess the relative importance of p38 and JNK in the inhibition of TNF-induced IκBα degradation, we examined the effect of various stress stimuli on TNF-induced IκBα degradation in FS-4 cells. To induce activation of both p38 and JNK, FS-4 fibroblasts were treated for 15–60 min with hyperosmolar sorbitol, H2O2, or the sulfhydryl reagent arsenite. Consistent with other reports (47Liu Y.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), treatment with each of these agents produced a strong p38 activation at the time points examined, as indicated by site-specific p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A, top panel). Activation of endogenous JNK kinase activity was most rapid and intense following sorbitol treatment and was also marked after treatment with H2O2 or arsenite (Fig.3 A, bottom panel). To determine whether these stress stimuli inhibit TNF-induced IκBα degradation, FS-4 cells were treated for 30 min with sorbitol, arsenite, or H2O2, followed by treatment with TNF for 15 min. All three agents completely inhibited IκBα degradation induced by TNF (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether this inhibition was dependent upon activation of p38, as previously demonstrated for NaSal, FS-4 cells were incubated with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 prior to treatment with the various agents, followed by TNF stimulation. SB203580 reversed the inhibitory effects of sorbitol and H2O2, but not that of arsenite (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that activation of p38 by sorbitol and H2O2 is required for the inhibitory effect of these agents. A similar, albeit weaker, inhibition of IκBα degradation was also observed when cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, and this inhibition was also reversed by SB203580. 2D. Alpert and J. Vilček, unpublished results. TNF stimulation induces IκBα phosphorylation at serines 32 and 36, followed by ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκBα by the 26 S proteasome (51Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of IκBα degradation could occur at the level of IκBα phosphorylation, or it could be due to inhibition of ubiquitination or proteasomal degradation. To determine whether IκBα phosphorylation is inhibited by stress stimuli, FS-4 cells were treated for 30 min with sorbitol, arsenite, or H2O2, followed by treatment for 5 min with TNF. Each of these agents inhibited TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation, as manifested by the appearance of a slower migrating (i.e.hyperphosphorylated) form of IκBα (Fig. 3 C, top panel), or visualized by an antibody specific for Ser-32-phosphorylated IκBα (Fig. 3 C, bottom panel).

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4987-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, whether the communication between these two organelles is reciprocal. ATP release from mitochondria, globally into the cytoplasm and locally into the vicinity of the InsP3R channels that are in close apposition, may provide a signaling pathway for communication from the mitochondria back to the ER. Thus, regulation of the InsP3R by ATP could have considerable significance for intracellular signaling, particularly if the channel is sensitive to ATP levels in normal physiological as well as pathological conditions, including ischemia. Most previous studies of ATP regulation of the InsP3R have been limited to indirect measurements, i.e. Ca2+fluxes or concentrations, to infer InsP3R channel activity, because the intracellular location of the Ca2+ release channel has limited its accessibility to electrophysiological approaches. Furthermore, only a limited range of [Ca2+]i was examined in previous studies, despite the fact that the InsP3R is intricately regulated by [Ca2+]i (6Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M.

Our results demonstrate that cytoplasmic ATP free acid, but not cytoplasmic MgATP complex, activates the gating of the InsP3R primarily by allosteric regulation of the [Ca2+]i sensitivity of the Ca2+activation sites of the channel. By regulating the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release properties of the InsP3R, ATP may play an important role in shaping the extent and duration of [Ca2+]i signals, possibly linking cell metabolic state to important Ca2+-dependent process including synaptic plasticity. Patch clamp experiments were performed as described in Refs. 8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, stage V or VI oocytes were opened mechanically just prior to use. The nucleus was separated from the cytoplasm and transferred to a dish on the stage of a microscope for patch-clamping. The oocyte expresses only a single InsP3R isoform (type 1) and lacks other (e.g.ryanodine receptor) Ca2+ release channels (41Kume S. Muto A. Aruga J. Nakagawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Nakade S. Okano H. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 1993; 73: 555-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Experiments were done in “on-nucleus” configuration, with the solution in the perinuclear lumen between the outer and inner nuclear membranes in apparent equilibrium with the bath solution (35Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29375-29378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the cytoplasmic aspect of the InsP3R channel facing into the patch pipette. Following standard conventions, the applied potential is that of the pipette electrode minus the reference bath electrode (positive current flows from pipette outward). Experiments were performed at room temperature with the pipette electrode at +20 mV relative to the reference bath electrode. Single channel currents were amplified with an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) with antialiasing filtering at 1 kHz, transferred to a Power Macintosh 8100 via an ITC-16 interface (Instrutech Corp., Great Lake, NY), digitized at 5 kHz, and written directly onto the hard disc by Pulse+PulseFit software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Data were analyzed to identify channel opening and closing events and evaluate channel open probabilities using MacTac 3 (Bruxton, Seattle, WA). Each data point shown is the mean of results from at least four separate patch clamp experiments performed under the same conditions. Error bars indicate the S.E. Theoretical curves were fitted to experimental data using Igor Pro 3 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). All patch clamp experiments were performed with solutions containing 140 mmKCl and 10 mm HEPES with pH adjusted to 7.1 using KOH. Since the luminal [Ca2+] or [ATP] have no systematic effects on the open probability response of the InsP3R (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a bath solution containing no ATP and 250 nm free Ca2+ was used in all experiments. Pipette solutions contained various concentrations of nucleotides (sodium salts of ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, and UTP and adenosine, from Sigma) as specified. Because of chelation of Mg2+ by ATP, the actual free [Mg2+] and free [ATP] in the solutions containing Mg2+ and ATP were calculated by the Maxchelator software (C. Patton, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). By using K+as the current carrier and appropriate quantities of the high affinity Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA (100–500 μm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), the low affinity Ca2+ chelator, 5,5′-dibromo-BAPTA (100–350 μm; Molecular Probes), or just ATP (0 or 0.5 mm) to buffer [Ca2+] in the experimental solutions, [Ca2+] was tightly controlled in our experiments. Total Ca2+ content (60–370 μm) in the solutions was determined by induction-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Mayo Medical Laboratory, Rochester, MN). Free [Ca2+] was calculated using the Maxchelator software. Pipette solutions contained 10 μm InsP3(Molecular Probes). To examine the effects of ATP on the permeation and gating properties of the InsP3R, we included 10 μm InsP3, 250 nmfree Ca2+, and 0.5 mm free ATP in the pipette solution. Under these conditions, the endogenous Xenopustype 1 InsP3R channel exhibited channel conductance properties and kinetics similar to those observed previously under similar conditions (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 40Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C179-C188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The channels gated with a moderately high open probability (P o) of ∼0.5 (Fig.1 A). In similar experiments employing pipette solutions that lacked ATP, the InsP3R channel P o was significantly lower (∼0.2) in either the absence or presence of 3 mm Mg2+(Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether the ATP activation of the channel P o was mediated by MgATP, which could suggest a role for ATP hydrolyisis or phosphorylation, similar experiments were undertaken with 3 mm total Mg2+ and 0.5 mm total ATP in the pipette. Under these conditions, [MgATP] is approximately 0.5 mm, and the free Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) and the cytoplasmic free ATP concentration ([ATP]i) were calculated to be 2.5 and 0.012 mm, respectively. Nevertheless, P oremained low (Fig. 1 D). The low P o in the presence of MgATP (Fig. 1) was solely caused by ATP complexation by Mg2+, since it was fully reversed by adding more ATP to the pipette solution to restore [ATP]i (Fig. 1 E). Thus, MgATP has no effect, stimulatory or inhibitory, on InsP3R activity. We previously demonstrated that theP o of the Xenopus type 1 InsP3R is independent of [Mg2+]i up to 9.5 mm (40Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C179-C188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that ATP free acid (ATP3− or ATP4−) was the relevant ionic species and that ATP hydrolysis was not involved in the stimulation of InsP3R channel gating. InsP3 activates the InsP3R by modulating the sensitivity of the channel to [Ca2+]i (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism of ATP activation of the InsP3R channel gating, we investigated in detail the effects of ATP on the channel kinetics of the InsP3R over a wide range of [Ca2+]i. A systematic series of patch clamp experiments were performed using pipette solutions containing various [Ca2+]i with 0.5 mm ATP alone, 3 mm Mg2+ alone, 0.5 mm ATP, and 3 mm Mg2+(calculated [ATP]i = 0.012 mm; calculated [Mg2+]i = 2.5 mm) or no ATP or Mg2+. To avoid possible effects of Ca2+ on InsP3 binding, a functionally saturating InsP3concentration of 10 μm was used (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]i sensitivity of the InsP3R in the absence of cytoplasmic free ATP was biphasic (Fig.2) and could be well fitted with a biphasic Hill equation similar to the following one previously derived for the InsP3R in the presence of 0.5 mmcytoplasmic free ATP (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Po=Pmax{1+(Kact/[Ca2+]i)Hact}−1{1+([Ca2+]i/Kinh)Hinh}−1.Equation 1 Similar results were obtained independent of the presence or absence of either Mg2+ or MgATP in the pipette solutions. This result indicates that the InsP3R can achieve a maximum open probability P max of 0.79 in the absence of cytoplasmic free ATP, a level of activity very similar to theP max of 0.81 found in the presence of 0.5 mm cytoplasmic free ATP (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP does not activate the channel by increasing P max. The Hill coefficient for Ca2+ activation H actwas 2.4 ± 0.6 in the absence of free ATP, similar toH act = 1.9 ± 0.3 in the presence of 0.5 mm free ATP. This result suggests that Ca2+probably activates the InsP3R via the same cooperative process in either the presence or absence of cytoplasmic free ATP. Thus, ATP does not activate the channel by modulatingH act. The observed activation of the InsP3R by cytoplasmic free ATP (Fig. 1) was associated with a reduction of the half-maximal activating [Ca2+]i (K act) from 500 ± 50 nm in the absence of free ATP to 190 ± 20 nm in the presence of 0.5 mm free ATP. Thus, ATP activates the channel by sensitizing it to Ca2+. ATP therefore enhances Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) by the InsP3R. Because InsP3 activates channel gating by modifying the [Ca2+]i inhibition phase of the channel [Ca2+]i dependence (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we were also interested in examining the effects of ATP on this aspect of the response. However, investigations of InsP3R channel activity in the absence of free ATP at [Ca2+]i which inhibit channel gating (>20 μm; Ref. 8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) were not possible because of the unavailability of a Ca2+ chelator with the appropriate Ca2+ affinity. In our previous experiments that examined the effects of high [Ca2+]i on InsP3R channel gating (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), ATP was used as the Ca2+ chelator for buffering [Ca2+]iat high [Ca2+]i. The data we were able to obtain in the absence of ATP in the present study indicated thatP o began to decrease as [Ca2+]i was increased beyond 10 μm, but the inhibitory half-maximal [Ca2+]i,K inh, or Hill coefficient,H inh, could not be determined accurately (Fig.2). Analysis of the mean open and closed durations of the InsP3R revealed that the mean open duration (τo) in the absence of free ATP lay within a narrow range between 5 and 15 ms over a wide range of [Ca2+]i(1–10 μm). At both very low (<400 nm) or very high (>10 μm) [Ca2+]i, τo was shorter (∼3 ms) (Fig.3). In contrast, the mean closed duration (τc) in the absence of free ATP decreased about 2 orders of magnitude, from 200 to 3 ms, as [Ca2+]i was increased from 200 nm to 1 μm. τc remained low between 1 and 10 μm[Ca2+]i (Fig. 4). These same basic kinetics were observed in all experiments conducted in the absence of cytoplasmic free ATP, regardless of the presence or absence of free Mg2+ or MgATP complex. Similar [Ca2+]i dependences of τo and τc (Figs. 3 and 4) were also observed in the presence of 0.5 mm free ATP (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). An examination of the differences in the [Ca2+]i dependences of τo and τc in either the presence and absence of cytoplasmic free ATP reveals that the mechanism whereby free ATP enhances channel activity is by stabilization of the open channel state(s) and destabilization of the closed channel state(s) in the low [Ca2+]i regime (30–500 nm). Our more limited data indicate that free ATP may also stabilize the open channel state(s) at very high [Ca2+]i (>15 μm).Figure 4[Ca2+]i dependence of the mean closed durations of the InsP3R channels in the absence of free cytoplasmic ATP (A) and in the presence of 0.5 mm free ATP (B). Thesymbols used are the same as those in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We undertook a systematic study of the activation of the InsP3R by [Ca2+]iover a wide range of free [ATP]i. In the presence of 10 μm InsP3, the activating Hill equation (Equation 2) agreed well the experimental data for [ATP]i of 4.8 and 9.5 mm, with no significant effects of [ATP]i on H act orP max (Fig. 5). Po=Pmax{1+(Kact/[Ca2+]i)Hact}−1Equation 2 [ATP]i decreased K act of the InsP3R by over an order of magnitude, from 500 ± 50 nm in 0 mm [ATP]i to 29 ± 4 nm in 9.5 mm [ATP]i. The effects of [ATP]i on K act of the InsP3R were analyzed by fitting the data with a modified Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig.6). Kact=Kmin+Kr{1+([ATP]i/KATP)}−1Equation 3 A modification to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation was necessary because ATP alone is insufficient to activate the channel in absence of InsP3, and therefore the activating half-maximal [Ca2+]i (K act) should not approach 0 even in presence of saturating concentrations of ATP. The results indicate that the range over which K actof the InsP3R varies in response to [ATP]i,K r = 480 ± 20 nm; the minimumK act under saturating [ATP]i,K min = 17 ± 3 nm; and the functional dissociation coefficient for cytoplasmic free ATP activation of the InsP3R, K ATP = 0.27 ± 0.04 mm. The good fit of this equation to the data suggests that ATP stimulation of channel activity is not cooperative, requiring binding of only one ATP molecule to the InsP3R tetramer to stimulate it.Figure 6Effect of [ATP]i on the activating half-maximal [Ca2+]i(K act) of the InsP3R . Thecurve is the theoretical fit based on the modified Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the nucleotide specificity of the stimulatory effects we observed for free ATP, we also investigated the effects of adenosine, AMP, ADP, GTP, and UTP. Each nucleotide was present as 0.5 mm free nucleotide in the absence of Mg2+. The [Ca2+]i was fixed at 220 ± 15 nm, because theP o is very sensitive to activation by free ATP at this [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2). Using the channelP o (0.14) in the absence of any nucleotide as the reference, the relative P o of the channel was determined in the presence of the various nucleotide species (Fig.7). Similar to the MgATP complex, free UTP, ADP, and adenosine had no effects on the P oof the InsP3R (p > 0.05). In contrast, free ATP, AMP, and GTP each activated the InsP3R (p < 0.05). Free ATP had the greatest effect, more than tripling the P o, whereas both free AMP and GTP doubled the channel P o. We previously described the detailed permeation and gating properties of the Xenopus type 1 InsP3R channel by patch clamp studies of isolated oocyte nuclei (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 35Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. J. Biol.

Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C179-C188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under optimal conditions, gating of the channel is robust, with maximum open probability of ∼80% over a wide range of [Ca2+]i (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Importantly, the gating of the channel is regulated by both InsP3 as well as by [Ca2+]i. The regulation of the InsP3-liganded channel activity by [Ca2+]i is biphasic, with half-maximal activation at 210 nm and half-maximal inhibition at 45 μm in 10 μm InsP3. InsP3 binds noncooperatively to a high affinity site (K D ∼ 50 nm) on each monomer of the channel tetramer. Binding of InsP3 to the channel has the sole effect of decreasing the Ca2+ affinity of the Ca2+ inhibition site on each monomer, in a process which has high cooperativity (Hill coefficient of 4) (8Mak D.-O.D. McBride S. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15821-15825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). When cytoplasmic InsP3 concentration ([InsP3]i) is low, under conditions of no or weak stimulation, the channel is inhibited by relatively low [Ca2+]i, whereas it becomes much less sensitive to Ca2+ inhibition at higher [InsP3]i, enabling it to become activated. Thus, InsP3 activates the channel by tuning the inhibition efficacy of the Ca2+ ligand. Of particular significance, [Ca2+]i activation of the channel wasnot modified by InsP3. However, it is unknown whether other modulators of InsP3R activity similarly impinge on the Ca2+ inhibition properties of the channel or whether the Ca2+ activation properties of the channel are exploited as an alternate method of channel regulation. The results from the present study suggest that ATP stimulates gating of the InsP3R by modulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Ca2+ activation sites. We performed a systematic investigation of the effects of nucleotides on gating of the Xenopus type 1 InsP3R Ca2+ release channel. Our study focused on the effects of ATP on single channel activity, and included additional examination of effects of other nucleotides for comparison. Stimulation of InsP3R by nucleotides in the presence of InsP3 has been previously reported (20Ferris C.D. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2147-2151Crossref P"
https://openalex.org/W1777733877,"The tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a serine protease that is involved in neuronal plasticity and cell death induced by excitotoxins and ischemia in the brain. t-PA activity in the central nervous system is regulated through the activation of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) such as the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), the protease nexin-1 (PN-1), and neuroserpin (NSP). Recently we demonstrated in vitro that PAI-1 produced by astrocytes mediates the neuroprotective effect of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in NMDA-induced neuronal cell death. To investigate whether serpins may be involved in neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia, we determined, by using semiquantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, that focal cerebral ischemia in mice induced a dramatic overexpression of PAI-1 without any effect on PN-1, NSP, or t-PA. Then we showed that although the expression of PAI-1 is restricted to astrocytes, PN-1, NSP, and t-PA are expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. Moreover, by using semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, we observed that only the expression of PAI-1 was modulated by TGF-beta1 treatment via a TGF-beta-inducible element contained in the PAI-1 promoter (CAGA box). Finally, we compared the specificity of TGF-beta1 action with other members of the TGF-beta family by using luciferase reporter genes. These data show that TGF-beta and activin were able to induce the overexpression of PAI-1 in astrocytes, but that bone morphogenetic proteins, glial cell line-derived neutrophic factor, and neurturin did not. These results provide new insights into the regulation of the serpins/t-PA axis and the mechanism by which TGF-beta may be neuroprotective."

Although evidence from previous studies suggested that TFIIH DNA helicase activity is required for ATP-dependent formation of the open complex and ATP-dependent promoter escape, a direct test of this hypothesis was not possible until sufficient quantities of purified TFIIH mutants lacking functional XPB or XPD DNA helicase were available. Recently, some of us (F. Tirode and J.-M. Egly) reported the development of methods for reconstitution of TFIIH and TFIIH subassemblies from wild type and mutant subunits (2Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F.

Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we obtained evidence supporting the model that the XPB DNA helicase is essential for formation of the open complex and runoff transcription and that the XPD DNA helicase, though not essential, stimulates these reactions (2Tirode F.

In this report, we exploit recombinant TFIIH mutants lacking functional XPB DNA helicase, XPD DNA helicase, or CAK to investigate the contribution of TFIIH DNA helicase and CTD kinase activities to efficient promoter escape. Our findings argue that the XPB DNA helicase is primarily responsible for TFIIH action in suppression of arrest of early RNA polymerase II elongation complexes during their escape from the promoter.

Transcription was initiated by addition of 4 μl of a solution containing the nucleotides indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were stopped by addition of an equal volume of 9.0m urea containing 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue and 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF.

To investigate the roles of the XPB and XPD DNA helicases and CAK in TFIIH-dependent promoter escape, we compared the abilities of IIH6 and two IIH6 mutants, IIH6/XPB-K346R and IIH6/XPD-K48R, which contain point mutations in the XPB and XPD ATP binding sites and lack DNA helicase activity (24Sung P.

IIH6 and IIH6 mutants were expressed in Sf9 cells coinfected with baculoviruses encoding human TFIIH subunits p34, p44, p52, p62, wild type or mutant XPD, and wild type or mutant XPB (2Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recombinant IIH6 and IIH6 mutants were purified from lysates of Sf9 cells by sequential heparin ultrogel and anti-p44 immunoaffinity chromatography (2Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol.

J. 1999; 18: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recombinant CAK was purified from lysates of Sf9 cells coinfected with baculoviruses encoding CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1 (4Rossignol M. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.P. Schaeffer L. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The subunit compositions of wild type and mutant IIH6 complexes and CAK were verified by Western blotting, and the relative concentrations of wild type and mutant IIH6 complexes were estimated by quantitative Western blotting (Fig. 1 and data not shown). To characterize the transcriptional activities of IIH6 and IIH6 mutants, we began by using a dinucleotide-primed abortive initiation assay to compare their abilities to support transcription initiation from the AdML promoter in the minimal transcription system. In the presence of an ATP cofactor, RNA polymerase II will utilize dinucleotides to prime synthesis of promoter-specific transcripts (34Samuels M. Fire A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If only a dinucleotide primer and the next nucleotide encoded by the template are provided as substrates for transcription, polymerase will efficiently synthesize abortively initiated, trinucleotide transcripts (10Wang W. Carey M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1992; 255: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 35Luse D.S. Jacob G.A. J. Biol.

We and others have shown previously that abortive initiation from the AdML promoter can be measured in the presence of [α-32P]CTP and either initiating dinucleotide CpA or CpU, which prime transcription at positions −1 and −3 relative to the normal AdML transcriptional start site (Fig.2 A) (35Luse D.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7245-7248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have shown that maximal rates of abortive initiation from the AdML promoter depend strongly on an ATP cofactor and all five general initiation factors (21Kugal J.F. Goodrich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9232-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Kumar K.P. Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7245-7248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, wild type IIH6 stimulated the rate of abortive initiation above the low background level observed in the absence of TFIIH, whereas equivalent concentrations of the XPB mutant IIH6/XPB-K346R and the XPD mutant IIH6/XPD-K48R did not. CAK, which is composed of CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1 subunits, detectably stimulated the rate of abortive initiation by both wild type IIH6 and the XPD mutant IIH6/XPD-K48R, but not by the XPB mutant IIH6/XPB-K346R (Fig.2 B). These findings are consistent with the results of Tirode et al. (2Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), who observed that the XPB mutant IIH6/XPB-K346R did not support detectable open complex formation and runoff transcription in the presence or absence of CAK, whereas the XPD mutant IIH6/XPD-K48R was substantially less active than IIH6, but could support a low level of runoff transcription that was stimulated by CAK. To investigate the activities of IIH6 and IIH6 mutants in promoter escape, we took advantage of the artificial AdML promoter derivative Ad(−9/−1), which contains a premelted region from positions −9 to −1 relative to the normal transcriptional start site. The Ad(−9/−1) promoter supports transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in the absence of TFIIH and an ATP cofactor and is therefore a useful model for investigating post-initiation roles of TFIIH and ATP (12Holstege F.C.P. van der Vliet P.C.

We previously observed that maximal synthesis of 18 nucleotide RNAs terminated at the first G residue of the Ad(−9/−1) transcript by incorporation of 3′-O-MeG requires TFIIH and ATP and is inhibited by ATPγS (18Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further elongation of the 18-nucleotide transcript is independent of ATP and TFIIH; thus, RNA polymerase II elongation complexes that have completed synthesis of these transcripts can be considered to have escaped the promoter. To compare the abilities of IIH6 and IIH6 mutants to support efficient promoter escape, RNA polymerase II preinitiation complexes were assembled at the Ad(−9/−1) promoter in the minimal transcription system in the presence of either IIH6, IIH6/XPB-K346R, or IIH6/XPD-K48R. Transcription was carried out in the presence of ATP or ATPγS and the initiating dinucleotide CpU, UTP, [α-32P]CTP, and 3′-O-MeGTP. Reaction mixtures were then gel-filtered to remove unincorporated [α-32P]CTP and the large number of abortive transcripts synthesized during transcription of premelted templates (40Keene R.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), see also Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig. 3 B, in the presence of ATPγS, the majority of RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates suffered arrest before completing synthesis of the 18 nucleotide, 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcript; similar levels of the 18-nucleotide transcript were synthesized whether reactions contained IIH6, IIH6/XPB-K346R, or IIH6/XPD-K48R. Substitution of ATP for ATPγS increased accumulation of the 18-nucleotide transcript ∼7-fold in reactions containing IIH6 and ∼5-fold in reactions containing the XPD mutant IIH6/XPD-K48R. In contrast, substitution of ATP for ATPγS had no significant effect on accumulation of the 18 nucleotide transcript in reactions containing the XPB mutant IIH6/XPB-K346R, arguing that the XPB DNA helicase makes a significantly greater contribution than the XPD DNA helicase to TFIIH function in ATP-dependent promoter escape. As shown previously (2Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and in Fig. 2 B, the presence of the CAK subunits increases TFIIH activity in abortive initiation and in synthesis of runoff transcripts. To investigate the contribution of CAK to TFIIH-dependent promoter escape, IIH6 and IIH6 mutants were assayed in the presence and absence of CAK, and reaction products were analyzed without prior gel filtration. As shown in Fig.3 C, CAK had no detectable effect on the levels of 18 nucleotide transcripts synthesized in the presence of either wild type IIH6, IIH6/XPB-K346R, or IIH6/XPD-K48R, arguing that CAK does not contribute significantly to TFIIH-dependent promoter escape. Because these reactions were not gel-filtered, a large number of abortive transcripts can be observed. Nonetheless, the relative amounts of 18 nucleotide transcript synthesized in the presence of wild type IIH6, IIH6/XPB-K346R, and IIH6/XPD-K48R are comparable with those seen when reaction products were gel filtered prior to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1,3, and 5). In summary, in this report we have taken advantage of recombinant TFIIH mutants to investigate the contributions of TFIIH DNA helicase and CTD kinase activities to efficient promoter escape by RNA polymerase II in a minimal transcription system reconstituted with purified polymerase and general initiation factors. By comparing the activities of the TFIIH subassembly IIH6 and two IIH6 mutants, IIH6/XPB-K346R and IIH6/XPD-K48R, which contain point mutations in the XPB and XPD ATP binding sites and lack DNA helicase activity (24Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 25Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we have obtained evidence supporting the model that the XPB DNA helicase is primarily responsible for TFIIH action in ATP-dependent promoter escape. We observe (i) that the IIH6 point mutant IIH6/XPB-K346R, which contains wild type XPD DNA helicase but lacks functional XPB DNA helicase, is inactive in promoter escape and (ii) that the IIH6 point mutant IIH6/XPD-K48R, which contains wild type XPB DNA helicase but lacks functional XPD DNA helicase, supports promoter escape but less actively than wild type IIH6. Together with the recent findings of Tirode et al. (2Tirode F. Busso D. Coin F. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 87-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), who presented evidence supporting the model (i) that the XPB DNA helicase is essential for ATP-dependent formation of the open complex and (ii) that the XPD DNA helicase stimulates this reaction, our results indicate that the relative contributions of the XPB and XPD DNA helicases to promoter escape closely parallel their contributions to open complex formation and suggest that TFIIH performs similar roles during both open complex formation and promoter escape.

To study the role of nNOS reductase domain cluster 1 acidic residues, we mutated two conserved acidic (Asp918 and Glu919) and one conserved aromatic residue (Phe892), and investigated the effect of each mutation on flavin binding, conformational change, electron transfer reactions, calmodulin regulation, and catalytic activities. Each mutation destabilized FMN binding without significantly affecting other aspects including substrate, cofactor or calmodulin binding, or catalytic activities upon FMN reconstitution, indicating the mutational effect was restricted to the FMN module. Characterization of the FMN-depleted mutants showed that bound FMN was essential for reduction of the nNOS heme or cytochrome c, but not for ferricyanide or dichlorophenolindolphenol, and established that the electron transfer path in nNOS is NADPH to FAD to FMN to heme. Steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic analysis revealed a novel role for bound FMN in suppressing FAD reduction by NADPH. The suppression could be relieved either by FMN removal or calmodulin binding. Calmodulin binding induced a conformational change that was restricted to the FMN module. This increased the rate of FMN reduction and triggered electron transfer to the heme. We propose that the FMN module of nNOS is the key positive or negative regulator of electron transfer at all points in nNOS.

However, it is still unclear what protein residues facilitate electron transfer, and how CaM controls the domain interaction.

Because of the structural homology, work done with these proteins serves to guide investigation of nNOS. In general, the FNR and FMN modules of these proteins appear to fold separately and function when expressed independently or after being separated by proteolysis (16Porter T.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 154-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A crystal structure of cytochrome P450 reductase has recently revealed the interactions that occur between the FNR and FMN modules of that enzyme (17Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M.

All of these proteins (or their isolated reductase domains) share biochemical similarities in transferring NADPH-derived electrons to either hemeprotein acceptors or attached hemeprotein domains (11Mayer B.

Electron transfer typically proceeds from NADPH to FAD to FMN to hemeprotein, although this path has not been definitively demonstrated for nNOS. In cytochrome P450BM3, recent work suggests that its FMN module is capable of interacting with both the FNR and attached hemeprotein domain by means of a flexible linker, and this enables the FMN module to shuttle electrons between the FNR and heme during catalysis (22Sevrioukova I.F. Li H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). All of these flavoproteins also transfer NADPH-derived electrons to artificial acceptors including cytochrome c, ferricyanide, and dichlorophenolindolphenol (DCIP) (11Mayer B. Werner E.R.

Despite the similarities, nNOS is distinguished from these flavoproteins by its ability to increase electron transfer rates to acceptors upon CaM binding (11Mayer B. Werner E.R.

Importantly, CaM's ability to speed flavin reduction can occur independent of its triggering nNOS heme reduction (24Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E.

Thus, while nNOS and related flavoproteins display many structural and biochemical similarities, the CaM activation component makes nNOS unique and suggests significant structure-function differences do exist. Studies investigating the interaction between cytochrome P450 reductase and its cytochrome P450 or cytochrome c acceptor hemeproteins have implicated two clusters of acidic residues within the FMN module 207Asp-Asp-Asp209 (cluster 1) and213Glu-Glu-Asp215 (cluster 2) in controlling interactions important for electron transfer (27Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27475-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Both clusters reside in the FMN module of the reductase and are highly conserved among related flavoproteins including the NOSs (Fig.1). Mutagenic (27Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27475-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and chemical cross-linking (28Nisimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14232-14239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studies with cytochrome P450 reductase suggested Asp208 of cluster 1 is important for electron transfer to its P450 acceptor hemeprotein. For example, N-demethylase activity of the Asn208 mutant was inhibited by 63% without changing the reductase K m toward cytochrome P450 or NADPH (27Shen A.L. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27475-27480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mutation did not affect cytochrome c or ferricyanide reductase activities, indicating interaction between the reductase and these molecules is distinct from its interaction with cytochrome P450. Similar observations were reported inAnabaena flavodoxin (29Jenkins C.M. Genzor C.G. Fillat M.F. Waterman M.R. Gomez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22509-22513Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), where mutagenic analysis of cluster I acidic residues Asp144 and Glu145showed they were involved in flavodoxin-supported P450c17progesterone 17a-hydroxylase activity but not involved in cytochromec reduction. Crystal structures of cytochrome P450 reductase (17Wang M. Roberts D.L. Paschke R. Shea T.M. Masters B.S.S. Kim J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

D. 1995; 51: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) show that cluster 1 residues are located near the surface, presumably positioned to interact with a positive surface patch on their hemeprotein acceptor. Because protein sequence and functional data suggest that the nNOS reductase domain and cytochrome P450 reductase have a similar secondary and tertiary structure, we hypothesized that cluster 1 residues may also be important in controlling reductase-oxygenase domain interaction and electron transfer in nNOS. We utilized site-directed mutagenesis to assess the importance of conserved amino acids Phe892, Asp918, and Glu919 with respect to FMN binding, electron transfer reactions, and catalytic activities of nNOS. Surprisingly, our data show that these three residues impact nNOS function primarily by stabilizing FMN binding to the reductase. Their mutation resulted in FMN-depleted forms of nNOS, which we used to investigate reductase domain function and how the FMN module participates in nNOS response to CaM. Superoxide dismutase was obtained from Calbiochem and was of the ferrous manganese type. All other regents and materials were obtained from Sigma or from sources previously reported (9Gachhui R.

Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the Altered Sites I in vitro Mutagenesis Kit from Promega. Wild-type nNOS cDNA was cut from PCWori with NdeI and XbaI and cloned into the XbaI site of the pAlter-I mutagenesis vector. Incorporated mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Cleveland Clinic core facility. DNAs that contained the desired mutations were cloned into the NdeI and XbaI sites of the PCWori vector and transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3).

Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 3 liters of terrific broth supplemented with 125 mg/liter ampicillin and 20 mg/liter chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced when the cultures reached an OD600 of 0.8 to 1 by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and the cultures were supplemented with 0.4 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid. After further growth at room temperature for 24 h, the cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (40 mm HEPPS, pH 7.6, with 10% glycerol, 1 mm Arg, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm H4B, 3 mm ascorbic acid) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing three times in liquid nitrogen followed by sonication for three 25-s pulses with a 1-min rest on ice between pulses, using a medium probe Sonicator Cell Disrupter (Model W-220F, Heat systems, Ultrasonics. Inc.). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min and the cell-free supernatant was precipitated by adding 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The precipitant was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 16,000 rpm in a JA-17 rotor and kept at −70 °C. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was resuspended in a buffer A containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resuspended solution was loaded onto a Ni2+nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose CL-4B column that had been charged with 50 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The column was washed with 5 times of column buffer and 5 times of column buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. The nNOS protein was eluted with 160 mm imidazole in buffer A and active fractions were pooled and stored at 4 °C overnight in the presence of 1 mm DTT. The fractions were next loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column equilibrated with 40 mm HEPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm Arg, 3 mm DTT, and 2 μm H4B. After adsorption the column was washed with column buffer containing 450 mm NaCl, and the protein was eluted with column buffer containing 10 mm NADPH. Selected fractions were concentrated using a Centriprep-50, dialyzed against 40 mmHEPPS, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm DTT, and 2 μm H4B, and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Spectral data was recorded on a Hitachi U3110 Spectrophotometer in the presence of H4B and Arg. Scans of the dithionite-reduced CO-bound proteins were taken in 40 mm HEPPS, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Arg, and 20 μmH4B. The ferrous-CO adduct absorbing at 444 nm was used to quantitate the heme protein content using an extinction coefficient of 74 mm−1 cm−1(A 444-A 500) (34Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound FAD and FMN were released from nNOS or mutants by heat denaturation of the enzyme (95 °C for 5 min in the dark). It is essential to use well sealed vials for this procedure in order to avoid loss of sample volume. Subsequently samples were cooled to 4 °C and filtered to remove denatured protein. Samples were injected into a Microsorb Cyano Analytical HPLC Column (5 mm × 4.6 mm × 15 cm) and subjected to isocratic elution with 5 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, containing 20% (v/v) methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. FAD and FMN had retention times of 4.1 and 7.6 min and the peaks were completely resolved. Flavins were detected by fluorescence emission and quantitated based on authentic freshly prepared FAD and FMN standards. The initial rate of NO synthesis by nNOS and mutants was quantitated at 37 °C using the oxyhemoglobin assay for NO (34Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nNOS (∼25 nm) was added to a cuvette containing 40 mm HEPPS, pH 7.6, containing 15 μg/ml CaM, 0.62 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm DTT, 5 mm Arg, 4 μm each of FAD and H4B, 100 units/ml catalase, and 10 μm oxyhemoglobin to give a final volume of 0.7 ml. The reaction was started by adding NADPH to give 0.2 mm. The NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin was monitored over time as an absorbance increase at 401 nm and quantitated using the extinction coefficient of 38 mm−1 cm−1 . The initial rate of NADPH oxidation at 25 °C was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1cm−1. The composition of the assay mixture was similar to that of the NO synthesis measurement except that oxyhemoglobin was absent unless specified otherwise. Wavelengths and extinction coefficient used to quantitate the NADPH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c, DCIP, and ferricyanide were 550 nm (21 mm−1cm−1), 600 nm (20.6 mm−1cm−1), and 420 nm (1.2 mm−1cm−1), respectively. The composition of the assay mixture was 40 mm HEPPS, pH 7.6, 4 μm FAD, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml CaM, 0.6 mm EDTA, 10 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and cytochromec, DCIP, or ferricyanide at 0.1, 0.1, or 1 mm, respectively. In some cases, 0.83 mm Ca2+ was added to promote CaM binding to nNOS. After the addition of nNOS, the reaction was initiated by adding 0.1 mm NADPH.K m values for cytochrome c, CaM, and FMN were determined from experiments in which the concentration of these molecules was varied and by reciprocal analysis of the velocityversus concentration data. All samples were equilibrated at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions in buffer saturated with CO. The cuvette contained 3 μm wild-type nNOS or mutants in CO-saturated 40 mm HEPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 mm DTT, 4 μm H4B, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm Arg, and 6 μm CaM. Concentrated anaerobic NADPH solution was added to the sample to give 0.1 mm. CaM binding and heme reduction were initiated by adding 1 mm CaCl2. Flavin fluorescence measurements were done using a Hitachi model F-2000 spectrofluorometer as described previously (9Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with modifications. A 1-ml quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm was used for the experiments. The nNOS proteins were diluted to 2 μm in 40 mm HEPPS, pH 7.6, containing 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 3 μm CaM. Proteins were irradiated with 450–460 nm light using an in-line 8% filter and their emission spectra were recorded between 450 and 700 nm. In some experiments flavin fluorescence emission at 530 nm was monitored versus time before and after consecutive addition of 1 mm Ca2+ and 3 mm EDTA. The kinetics of flavin reduction were analyzed under anaerobic conditions as described previously (14Abu-soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a stopped-flow apparatus (Hi-tech Ltd., model SF-51) equipped for anaerobic work. Wild-type nNOS and mutants were briefly treated with ferricyanide and desalted prior to use in these experiments in order to oxidize the residual air-stable flavin semiquinone that is present in nNOS after purification (9Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Measurements were made under pseudo first-order conditions and initiated by rapid mixing a solution of 0.1 mm NADPH with a solution containing 3 μmCaM-free or -bound nNOS or mutants in 40 mm HEPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 6.0 μm CaM and in some cases, 1 mm Ca2+. The absorbance change was monitored at 485 nm. Signal to noise ratios were improved by averaging the 10 individual scans. The time course of absorbance change was best fit to a single or double exponential equation by use of a nonlinear least-squares method provided by the instrument manufacturer (14Abu-soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32047-32050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two-step enzyme purification typically yielded about 8 mg of full-length heme-containing nNOS mutants per liter of culture, which is similar to our yield of wild-type nNOS expressed in the same system. Spectroscopic analysis showed that all mutants contained heme in a predominantly low spin state. The heme iron of each mutant was observed to shift to high spin upon addition of 20 μmH4B and 1 mm Arg. Dithionite reduction of each mutant in the presence of Arg, H4B, and CO produced the expected 444-nm absorbance peak for the ferrous-CO complex in all cases (data not shown). These data show that the reductase domain mutations did not alter expression of the full-length enzyme or affect the properties of the heme-containing oxygenase domain. Flavin analysis showed that the mutants contained normal quantities of FAD (∼1 per subunit) but contained below normal or practically undetectable levels of FMN (Table I). The D918A,E919A double mutant and single mutants F892A and D918A had almost no bound FMN, while E919A contained almost half the saturating level of FMN. Thus, the cluster I point mutations reduced or prevented stable binding of FMN by the nNOS reductase domain.Table IFlavin content per heme of wild-type and mutant nNOSEnzymeFADFMNWild-type0.97 ± 0.021.0 ± 0.02D918A0.87 ± 0.02NDaND, not detectable.E919A1.02 ± 0.060.49 ± 0.07D918A,E919A0.92 ± 0.05NDF892A1.03 ± 0.090.09 ± 0.06The values represent the mean and S.E. for three measurements each.a ND, not detectable.

https://openalex.org/W1958026543,"As a major component of mammalian cell plasma membranes, cholesterol is essential for cell growth. Accordingly, the restriction of cholesterol provision has been shown to result in cell proliferation inhibition. We explored the potential regulatory role of cholesterol on cell cycle progression. MOLT-4 and HL-60 cell lines were cultured in a cholesterol-deficient medium and simultaneously exposed to SKF 104976, which is a specific inhibitor of lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase. Through HPLC analyses with on-line radioactivity detection, we found that SKF 104976 efficiently blocked the [(14)C]-acetate incorporation into cholesterol, resulting in an accumulation of lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol, without affecting the synthesis of mevalonic acid. The inhibitor also produced a rapid and intense inhibition of cell proliferation (IC(50) = 0.1 microM), as assessed by both [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA and cell counting. Flow cytometry and morphological examination showed that treatment with SKF 104976 for 48 h or longer resulted in the accumulation of cells specifically at G2 phase, whereas both the G1 traversal and the transition through S were unaffected. The G2 arrest was accompanied by an increase in the hyperphosphorylated form of p34(cdc2) and a reduction of its activity, as determined by assaying the H1 histone phosphorylating activity of p34(cdc2) immunoprecipitates. The persistent deficiency of cholesterol induced apoptosis. However, supplementing the medium with cholesterol, either in the form of LDL or free cholesterol dissolved in ethanol, completely abolished these effects, whereas mevalonate was ineffective. Caffeine, which abrogates the G2 checkpoint by preventing p34(cdc2) phosphorylation, reduced the accumulation in G2 when added to cultures containing cells on transit to G2, but was ineffective in cells arrested at G2 by sustained cholesterol starvation. Cells arrested in G2, however, were still viable and responded to cholesterol provision by activating p34(cdc2) and resuming the cell cycle. We conclude that in both lymphoblastoid and promyelocytic cells, cholesterol availability governs the G2 traversal, probably by affecting p34(cdc2) activity."
https://openalex.org/W2104673352,"Episodic ataxia type-1 syndrome (EA-1) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder that manifests itself during infancy and results from point mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel gene hKv1.1. The hallmark of the disease is continuous myokymia and episodic attacks of spastic contractions of the skeletal muscles, which cause permanent disability. Coexpression of hKv1.1 and hKv1.2 subunits produces heteromeric potassium channels with biophysical and pharmacological properties intermediate between the respective homomers. By using tandemly linked subunits, we demonstrate that hKv1.1 subunits bearing the EA-1 mutations V408A and E325D combine with hKv1.2 to produce channels with altered kinetics of activation, deactivation, C-type inactivation, and voltage dependence. Moreover, hKv1.1V408A single-channel analysis reveals a approximately threefold reduction of the mean open duration of the channel compared with the wild-type, and this mutation alters the open-state stability of both homomeric and heteromeric channels. The results demonstrate that human Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 subunits coassemble to form a novel channel with distinct gating properties that are altered profoundly by EA-1 mutations, thus uncovering novel physiopathogenetic mechanisms of episodic ataxia type-1 myokymia syndrome."

IgE antibodies of grass pollen allergic patients identified five continuous epitope-containing areas that on an average bound 40% of Phl p 1-specific IgE antibodies and were stably recognized in the course of disease. In contrast to untreated patients, patients undergoing grass pollen immunotherapy started to mount IgG4 antibodies to the recombinant IgE-defined fragments in the course of immunotherapy. The protective role of these IgG4 antibodies is demonstrated by observations that 1) increases in rPhl p 1 fragment-specific IgG4 were in parallel with decreases in Phl p 1-specific IgE, and 2) preincubation of rPhl p 1 with patients sera containing rPhl p 1 fragment-specific IgG4 blocked histamine release from basophils of an untreated grass pollen allergic patient. We propose to use recombinant Phl p 1 fragments for active immunotherapy in order to induce protective IgG responses against IgE epitopes in grass pollen allergic patients. This concept may be applied for the development of allergy vaccines whenever the primary sequence or structure of an allergen is available.—Ball, T., Fuchs, T., Sperr, W.

https://openalex.org/W1901832436,"Type VIII collagen is a short-chain collagen that is present in increased amounts in atherosclerotic lesions. Although the physiological function of this matrix protein is unclear, recent data suggest an important role in tissue remodeling. Type VIII collagen in the atherosclerotic lesion is mainly derived from smooth muscle cells. We now show that macrophages in the atherosclerotic vessel wall and monocytes in adjacent mural thrombi also express type VIII collagen. We demonstrated this using a novel combined fluorescence technique that simultaneously stains, within the same tissue section, specific RNAs by in situ hybridization and proteins by indirect immunofluorescence. In culture, human monocyte/macrophages expressed type VIII collagen at all time points from 1 h to 3 wk after isolation. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation also revealed secretion of type VIII collagen into the medium of 14-day-old macrophages. Because this is the first report of secretion of a collagen by macrophages, we tested the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon gamma, substances that stimulate macrophages to secrete lytic enzymes, on macrophage expression of type VIII collagen. LPS and interferon gamma decreased expression of type VIII collagen. By contrast, secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP 1) was increased, indicating a switch from a collagen-producing to a degradative phenotype. Double in situ hybridization studies of expression of type VIII collagen and MMP 1 in human coronary arteries showed that in regions important for plaque stability, the ratio of MMP 1 RNA to macrophage type VIII collagen RNA varies widely, indicating that the transition from one phenotype to the other that we observed in vitro may also occur in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2051973322,"An in vivo adenoviral gene delivery system was utilized to assess the effect of overexpressing protein kinase C (PKC)-ζ on rat skeletal muscle glucose transport activity. Female lean Zucker rats were injected with adenoviral/human PKC-ζ (hPKC-ζ) and adenoviral/LacZ in opposing tibialis anterior muscles. One week subsequent to adenoviral/gene delivery rats were subjected to hind limb perfusion. The hPKC-ζ protein was expressed at the same level (fast-twitch white) or at ∼80% of the level (fast-twitch red) of endogenous PKC-ζ, thus approximately doubling the amount of PKC-ζ in tibialis anterior. Basal glucose transport activity was elevated ∼3.4- and 2-fold, respectively, in fast-twitch white and red hPKC-ζ muscle relative to control. Submaximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity, corrected for basal transport, was ∼90 and 40% over control values, respectively, in fast-twitch white and red hPKC-ζ muscle. The enhancement of glucose transport activity in muscle expressing hPKC-ζ occurred in the absence of any change in GLUT1 or GLUT4 protein levels, suggesting a redistribution of existing transporters to the cell surface.

The existence of parallel or branched paths, however, at this point in the insulin signaling cascade have been suggested by the findings that inositol 3-phosphates and PDK-1 also activate a member of the atypical protein kinase C (PKC) family, PKC-ζ (11Le Good J.A.

Caro J.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This ambiguity may stem, in part, from the diversity within the extensive PKC family that has been identified thus far. Normal insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 cells despite down-regulation of conventional and novel PKC isoforms using phorbol esters suggests that these isoforms are not necessary for insulin-induced activation of glucose transport (15Klip A. Ramlal T. Koivisto U.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Gibbs E.M. Calderhead D.M. Holman G.D. Gould G.W. Biochem.

Acta. 1993; 1177: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Alternatively, atypical PKC isoforms, such as PKC-ζ, are not diacylglycerol-sensitive and, as mentioned above, are activated by a well established arm of the insulin signaling pathway, products of PI-3-K (11Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 13Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that PKC-ζ is activated by insulin and that overexpression of wild-type PKC-ζ increased, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative PKC-ζ decreased, basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3/L1 cells (18Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Likewise, stable and transient expression of a kinase-inactive PKC-ζ was shown to inhibit both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 myotubes (19Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest a potential role for PKC-ζ downstream of PI-3-K in the insulin signaling pathway for the stimulation of glucose transport.To examine the potential ability of exogenously administered PKC-ζ to stimulate glucose transport activity in the primary insulin-responsive tissue, skeletal muscle, we expressed recombinant human PKC-ζ (hPKC-ζ) in rat tibialis anterior muscle using a novel in vivo adenoviral gene transfer system. Unlike classic transgenic studies, this approach affords several advantages including the following. Gene delivery and subsequent protein expression occurs in adult animals, and thus developmental compensatory responses are less likely to dictate the observed physiological outcome. Also, localization of gene delivery and protein expression within a specific muscle allows experimental and control genes to be delivered to the same animal, resulting in a highly controlled experimental paradigm. Finally, the ability to administer the adenoviral/gene construct to animals of various backgrounds or disease states eliminates the need for costly and time consuming breeding and backcrossing.Application of this in vivo adenoviral/gene transfer system and subsequent assessment of physiological responses using the hind limb perfusion technique revealed that expression of hPKC-ζ in skeletal muscle of normal lean rats results in enhanced rates of both basal and submaximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevious work with transgenic animals demonstrated that single gene manipulations can significantly alter normal and/or disease (diabetic) phenotypes (25Liu M.L. Gibbs E.M. McCoid S.C. Milici A.J. Stukenbrok H.A. McPherson R.K. Treadway J.L. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1512-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The application of these genetic manipulations was of limited practical implication, however, as a result of the technical aspects of gene insertion at the pro-nuclear stage of development. Such early manipulation also raises the question of developmental compensatory alterations leading to the observed adult transgenic phenotype. To circumvent such confounding factors and to investigate the practicality of acutely altering genetic expression in adult animals, we developed/refined a system for delivering genes of interest to a primary target of insulin action and a key regulator of glucose homeostasis, skeletal muscle. By combining the intramuscular adenoviral/gene injections with subsequent hind limb perfusion experiments, we were able to determine whether transcription of our gene of interest (hPKC-ζ) resulted in expression of a functional protein and, furthermore, determine whether the expression of that protein is physiologically relevant.As shown in Fig. 1, lanes 2and 4, intramuscular injection of the adenoviral/hPKC-ζ construct into tibialis anterior muscle resulted in the appearance of a second immunoreactive PKC-ζ band of slightly greater molecular weight than the endogenous band. We have observed that this migratory difference, between endogenous and exogenous PKC-ζ, on SDS-PAGE is species-related. Quantitative analysis revealed that hPKC-ζ expression equaled endogenous PKC-ζ expression in fast-twitch white muscle, whereas in fast-twitch red muscle hPKC-ζ was expressed at ∼80% of endogenous levels (p = 0.01). There were no apparent systemic effects of the local injections as expression of hPKC-ζ (Fig. 1) and expression/activity of β-gal (data not shown) were noted only in those muscles directly injected.Upon establishment of hPKC-ζ expression, attention was turned toward the metabolic consequences. Fig. 2reveals glucose transport activity assessed during hind limb perfusion. In fast-twitch white muscle, hPKC-ζ expression enhanced basal glucose transport 3.4-fold above the β-gal control. Similarly, basal glucose transport was elevated approximately 2-fold above control in fast-twitch red muscle expressing hPKC-ζ. It may be speculated that the difference between fiber types, with regard to magnitude of increase in transport activity, reflects the subtle disparity noted in the level of hPKC-ζ expression. The expression of β-gal in tibialis anterior muscle (fast-twitch red and white) did not alter basal glucose transport rates relative to control noninjected muscle (data not shown).Figure 2Basal and insulin-stimulated (50 microunits/ml) 2-deoxy-glucose transport in fast-twitch white and red portions of the tibialis anterior (* denotes a significant difference from the corresponding β-gal value,p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Glucose transport was also assessed in the presence of a physiologically relevant submaximal insulin concentration (50 microunits/ml). The absolute rates of glucose transport in fast-twitch white and red muscle portions are displayed in Fig. 2, however, as a result of the elevated basal glucose transport activity in muscle expressing hPKC-ζ, the “true” insulin effect was obtained by subtracting basal rates of transport from the absolute insulin-stimulated values in the respective cases. These conversions revealed that increasing PKC-ζ in fast-twitch white muscle enhanced the effect of a submaximal insulin concentration by approximately 90% over control (4.56 versus 2.39 μmol/g/h). In fast-twitch red muscle, the true insulin effect was approximately 40% over control levels (10.33 versus 7.55 μmol/g/h).Previously, cell based assay systems have been utilized to examine the effects of expressing atypical PKC isoforms (ζ and λ) on glucose transport activity (18Bandyopadhyay G.

Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 cells, an approximate 2-fold overexpression of PKC-ζ resulted in a significant enhancement of both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport (18Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), yet surprisingly similar overexpression of PKC-ζ in L6 myotubes had no effect (19Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutively active mutant of PKC-λ in 3T3-L1 cells using an adenoviral vector system increased glucose transport in accord with the multiplicity of infection such that the stimulation paralleled the level of expression of the mutant protein (28Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the specificity of the effects of the atypical PKC isoforms was provided by overexpression of kinase-inactive mutants of PKC-ζ and -λ, which resulted in inhibition of both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, respectively (19Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 28Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we utilized the information from the cell-based experiments with implicit assumptions regarding the specificity of atypical PKC action and extend these findings to a higher level of organizational structure and physiological relevance by expressing hPKC-ζ in vivo in arguably the most important insulin-responsive tissue, skeletal muscle. The highly controlled nature of these experiments, in which adenoviral/Lac-Z injections and subsequent β-gal expression served as the control for infection/gene transfer in the same animal as the hPKC-ζ expression, revealed that increased expression of this kinase produces a physiologically relevant outcome, acceleration of glucose transport. Taken together with previous reports, these results provide strong evidence that PKC-ζ is involved in stimulation of glucose transport activity in mammalian cells. In the current study, the mechanism through which these results were achieved, however, remained to be explored.Insulin acutely accelerates glucose transport in skeletal muscle through the translocation of existing glucose transporters from an intracellular pool to the cell surface (29Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be speculated that if PKC-ζ is a downstream insulin signaling component, increased expression of the protein could result in enhanced glucose transporter translocation. Alternatively, PKC-ζ has also been implicated in the ability of insulin to stimulate general protein synthesis (30Mendez R. Kollmorgen G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5184-5192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was equally as tempting to speculate that increased expression of PKC-ζ would be capable of driving the synthesis of additional glucose transporters, which could also translate into increased glucose transport activity. To rule out the latter possibility, we quantified GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein levels in the injected muscle samples. We detected no difference in either GLUT1 or GLUT4 protein levels in fast-twitch red or white muscle expressing hPKC-ζ relative to control (representative samples displayed in Fig.3, A and B for GLUT1 and GLUT4, respectively). These findings, combined with previousin vitro observations of alterations in the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing atypical PKC isoforms (18Bandyopadhyay G.

Furthermore, expression of this kinase enhanced both basal and insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport, affirming in this unique setting a role for PKC-ζ in the regulation of glucose transport. Establishment of these techniques and the resultant positive physiological outcome provides new insight into potential gene therapy approaches for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.

PKC involvement in the stimulation of metabolism by insulin has been speculated on and investigated for many years, yet overall the evidence for or against a role for PKC in insulin signaling can best be described as equivocal (14Considine R.V. Caro J.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This ambiguity may stem, in part, from the diversity within the extensive PKC family that has been identified thus far. Normal insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 cells despite down-regulation of conventional and novel PKC isoforms using phorbol esters suggests that these isoforms are not necessary for insulin-induced activation of glucose transport (15Klip A. Ramlal T. Koivisto U.M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Gibbs E.M. Calderhead D.M. Holman G.D. Gould G.W. Biochem.

Acta. 1993; 1177: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Alternatively, atypical PKC isoforms, such as PKC-ζ, are not diacylglycerol-sensitive and, as mentioned above, are activated by a well established arm of the insulin signaling pathway, products of PI-3-K (11Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 13Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that PKC-ζ is activated by insulin and that overexpression of wild-type PKC-ζ increased, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative PKC-ζ decreased, basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3/L1 cells (18Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L. Yu B. Avignon A. Galloway L. Karnam P. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Likewise, stable and transient expression of a kinase-inactive PKC-ζ was shown to inhibit both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 myotubes (19Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest a potential role for PKC-ζ downstream of PI-3-K in the insulin signaling pathway for the stimulation of glucose transport. To examine the potential ability of exogenously administered PKC-ζ to stimulate glucose transport activity in the primary insulin-responsive tissue, skeletal muscle, we expressed recombinant human PKC-ζ (hPKC-ζ) in rat tibialis anterior muscle using a novel in vivo adenoviral gene transfer system. Unlike classic transgenic studies, this approach affords several advantages including the following. Gene delivery and subsequent protein expression occurs in adult animals, and thus developmental compensatory responses are less likely to dictate the observed physiological outcome. Also, localization of gene delivery and protein expression within a specific muscle allows experimental and control genes to be delivered to the same animal, resulting in a highly controlled experimental paradigm. Finally, the ability to administer the adenoviral/gene construct to animals of various backgrounds or disease states eliminates the need for costly and time consuming breeding and backcrossing. Application of this in vivo adenoviral/gene transfer system and subsequent assessment of physiological responses using the hind limb perfusion technique revealed that expression of hPKC-ζ in skeletal muscle of normal lean rats results in enhanced rates of both basal and submaximal insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPrevious work with transgenic animals demonstrated that single gene manipulations can significantly alter normal and/or disease (diabetic) phenotypes (25Liu M.L. Gibbs E.M. McCoid S.C. Milici A.J. Stukenbrok H.A. McPherson R.K. Treadway J.L. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11346-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Treadway J.L. Hargrove D.M. Nardone N.A. McPherson R.K. Russo J.F. Milici A.J. Stukenbrok H.A. Gibbs E.M. Stevenson R.W. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29956-29961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gibbs E.M. Stock J.L. McCoid S.C. Stukenbrok H.A. Pessin J.E. Stevenson R.W. Milici A.J. McNeish J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1512-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The application of these genetic manipulations was of limited practical implication, however, as a result of the technical aspects of gene insertion at the pro-nuclear stage of development. Such early manipulation also raises the question of developmental compensatory alterations leading to the observed adult transgenic phenotype. To circumvent such confounding factors and to investigate the practicality of acutely altering genetic expression in adult animals, we developed/refined a system for delivering genes of interest to a primary target of insulin action and a key regulator of glucose homeostasis, skeletal muscle. By combining the intramuscular adenoviral/gene injections with subsequent hind limb perfusion experiments, we were able to determine whether transcription of our gene of interest (hPKC-ζ) resulted in expression of a functional protein and, furthermore, determine whether the expression of that protein is physiologically relevant.As shown in Fig. 1, lanes 2and 4, intramuscular injection of the adenoviral/hPKC-ζ construct into tibialis anterior muscle resulted in the appearance of a second immunoreactive PKC-ζ band of slightly greater molecular weight than the endogenous band. We have observed that this migratory difference, between endogenous and exogenous PKC-ζ, on SDS-PAGE is species-related. Quantitative analysis revealed that hPKC-ζ expression equaled endogenous PKC-ζ expression in fast-twitch white muscle, whereas in fast-twitch red muscle hPKC-ζ was expressed at ∼80% of endogenous levels (p = 0.01). There were no apparent systemic effects of the local injections as expression of hPKC-ζ (Fig. 1) and expression/activity of β-gal (data not shown) were noted only in those muscles directly injected.Upon establishment of hPKC-ζ expression, attention was turned toward the metabolic consequences. Fig. 2reveals glucose transport activity assessed during hind limb perfusion. In fast-twitch white muscle, hPKC-ζ expression enhanced basal glucose transport 3.4-fold above the β-gal control. Similarly, basal glucose transport was elevated approximately 2-fold above control in fast-twitch red muscle expressing hPKC-ζ. It may be speculated that the difference between fiber types, with regard to magnitude of increase in transport activity, reflects the subtle disparity noted in the level of hPKC-ζ expression. The expression of β-gal in tibialis anterior muscle (fast-twitch red and white) did not alter basal glucose transport rates relative to control noninjected muscle (data not shown).Glucose transport was also assessed in the presence of a physiologically relevant submaximal insulin concentration (50 microunits/ml). The absolute rates of glucose transport in fast-twitch white and red muscle portions are displayed in Fig. 2, however, as a result of the elevated basal glucose transport activity in muscle expressing hPKC-ζ, the “true” insulin effect was obtained by subtracting basal rates of transport from the absolute insulin-stimulated values in the respective cases. These conversions revealed that increasing PKC-ζ in fast-twitch white muscle enhanced the effect of a submaximal insulin concentration by approximately 90% over control (4.56 versus 2.39 μmol/g/h). In fast-twitch red muscle, the true insulin effect was approximately 40% over control levels (10.33 versus 7.55 μmol/g/h).Previously, cell based assay systems have been utilized to examine the effects of expressing atypical PKC isoforms (ζ and λ) on glucose transport activity (18Bandyopadhyay G.

In 3T3-L1 cells, an approximate 2-fold overexpression of PKC-ζ resulted in a significant enhancement of both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport (18Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), yet surprisingly similar overexpression of PKC-ζ in L6 myotubes had no effect (19Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutively active mutant of PKC-λ in 3T3-L1 cells using an adenoviral vector system increased glucose transport in accord with the multiplicity of infection such that the stimulation paralleled the level of expression of the mutant protein (28Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the specificity of the effects of the atypical PKC isoforms was provided by overexpression of kinase-inactive mutants of PKC-ζ and -λ, which resulted in inhibition of both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in L6 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, respectively (19Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4721-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 28Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we utilized the information from the cell-based experiments with implicit assumptions regarding the specificity of atypical PKC action and extend these findings to a higher level of organizational structure and physiological relevance by expressing hPKC-ζ in vivo in arguably the most important insulin-responsive tissue, skeletal muscle. The highly controlled nature of these experiments, in which adenoviral/Lac-Z injections and subsequent β-gal expression served as the control for infection/gene transfer in the same animal as the hPKC-ζ expression, revealed that increased expression of this kinase produces a physiologically relevant outcome, acceleration of glucose transport. Taken together with previous reports, these results provide strong evidence that PKC-ζ is involved in stimulation of glucose transport activity in mammalian cells. In the current study, the mechanism through which these results were achieved, however, remained to be explored.Insulin acutely accelerates glucose transport in skeletal muscle through the translocation of existing glucose transporters from an intracellular pool to the cell surface (29Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be speculated that if PKC-ζ is a downstream insulin signaling component, increased expression of the protein could result in enhanced glucose transporter translocation. Alternatively, PKC-ζ has also been implicated in the ability of insulin to stimulate general protein synthesis (30Mendez R. Kollmorgen G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5184-5192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was equally as tempting to speculate that increased expression of PKC-ζ would be capable of driving the synthesis of additional glucose transporters, which could also translate into increased glucose transport activity. To rule out the latter possibility, we quantified GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein levels in the injected muscle samples. We detected no difference in either GLUT1 or GLUT4 protein levels in fast-twitch red or white muscle expressing hPKC-ζ relative to control (representative samples displayed in Fig.3, A and B for GLUT1 and GLUT4, respectively). These findings, combined with previousin vitro observations of alterations in the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing atypical PKC isoforms (18Bandyopadhyay G.

Furthermore, expression of this kinase enhanced both basal and insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport, affirming in this unique setting a role for PKC-ζ in the regulation of glucose transport. Establishment of these techniques and the resultant positive physiological outcome provides new insight into potential gene therapy approaches for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.

The formyl group also prevents the tRNAfMet from participating in elongation by blocking binding of elongation factor EF-Tu (5Varshney U. Lee C.-L. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol.

Formylation of the Met-tRNAfMet is generally accepted as a key checkpoint required for initiation of protein synthesis in eubacteria. This dogma, based primarily on studies conducted inE. coli, was further substantiated by the finding that disruption of the E. coli chromosomal fmt gene severely curtailed cell growth (3Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, some earlier studies have obtained circumstantial evidence that questioned this generalization. AStreptococcus faecalis folate-deficient strain, which is unable to synthesize the formyl donorN 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (fTHF), was shown to be unaffected in growth or viability (11Samuel C.E. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1198-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not clear that S. faecalis can initiate protein synthesis in the absence of formylation, since the strain also incurred additional chromosomal mutations that affect proper tRNA modification (11Samuel C.E. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1198-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the studies in S. faecalis were inconclusive, they hinted that formylation may not be a prerequisite for initiation of protein synthesis in all eubacteria. Therefore, we investigated the significance of the formylation step in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that is distantly related to E. coli. The results show that the process of initiation of protein synthesis in P. aeruginosais not strictly dependent on formylation and can accommodate the use of non-N-blocked Met-tRNAfMet. The extent to which other eubacteria have this capacity to initiate translation thus becomes an open question. The plasmids pEX100T (12Schweizer H.P. Hong T.T. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), pUCGM (13Schweizer H.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 831-833PubMed Google Scholar), and pUCP26 (14West S.E.H. Schweizer H.P. Dall C. Sample A.K. Runyen-Janecky L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 128: 81-86Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and the P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain were provided by Dr. J. S. Lam, Department of Microbiology, University of Guelph. The pACTN vector was described previously (15Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 64-69Crossref Google Scholar). The E. colimethionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) and initiator tRNA (15Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 64-69Crossref Google Scholar) and P. aeruginosa MTF (15Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 64-69Crossref Google Scholar, 16.Newton, D. T., Lo, R. Y. C., and Mangroo, D. (1998) Canadian Society for Microbiology Meeting, June 15–19, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Abstract GMp 23.Google Scholar) were overproduced and purified as described. The fmt-deficient strain of E. coliwas constructed previously (16.Newton, D. T., Lo, R. Y. C., and Mangroo, D. (1998) Canadian Society for Microbiology Meeting, June 15–19, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Abstract GMp 23.Google Scholar). The open reading frame (ORF) of thefmt genes was cloned into the NcoI andBamHI sites in pACTN (15Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 64-69Crossref Google Scholar). In this construct, thefmt genes are under the control of the Lacpromoter and the Shine-Dalgarno and transcription termination sequences of gene 10 of bacteriophage T7. A 1.4-kilobase pair KpnI fragment containing the wild type P. aeruginosa fmt gene was inserted into the same site in the P. aeruginosa shuttle vector pUCP26. The cloned fragment is under the control of theLac promoter. TheP. aeruginosa fmt gene on a 6-kilobase pair fragment was isolated previously from a genomic library (GenBankTMaccession number AF073952) (16.Newton, D. T., Lo, R. Y. C., and Mangroo, D. (1998) Canadian Society for Microbiology Meeting, June 15–19, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Abstract GMp 23.Google Scholar). A 4.5-kilobase pair SmaI segment containing the fmt gene and flanking sequences was obtained from the 6-kilobase pair fragment and inserted into the same site of pEX100T. An 840-base pair fragment containing the gentamycin resistance gene (GmR) was obtained by PCR amplification using pUCGM as the template. The fragment was digested withMfeI and inserted into the same site in the fmtgene on pEX100T. The pEX100Tfmt::GmRconstruct was used to replace the chromosomal MTF gene of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain (12Schweizer H.P. Hong T.T. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Gene replacement was verified by PCR analysis using primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fmt ORF. The sequence of the primers are 5′-TTTTCCATGGCGATGAGCCAAGCATTGCGC-3′ and 5′-TTTGGATCCTCATTGGCCGAGCACCTG-3′. The wild type and mutantfmt P. aeruginosa strains harboring the pUCP26 vector without the fmt gene were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 60 μg/ml tetracycline. An aliquot of the cultures were diluted 50-fold into 3 ml of medium containing tetracycline and grown for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells from 1.2 ml of culture was pelleted by centrifugation and lysed (8Mangroo D. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was centrifuged and an aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with 3 volumes of 25.6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 13.3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm KCl, and 66% glycerol (w/v) and stored at −20 °C (8Mangroo D. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The initiator tRNA substrate was acylated with methionine at 37 °C for 30 min. The incubation mixture (20 μl) consisted of 20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm methionine (specific activity: 13,000–15,000 cpm/pmol), 2 mm ATP, 5 μmtRNAfMet, and an excess of MetRS (1 μg). To measure the formylation activity in cell extracts, 5 μl of 1.8 mm of fTHF in 20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 μl of appropriately diluted MTF were added, and the incubation mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 360 mm copper sulfate in 1.1m Tris, pH 7.3. After 5 min an aliquot was spotted on Whatman No. 3MM filter paper and washed sequentially with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.2% casamino acids, 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.2% casamino acids, and cold 95% ethanol. The retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The wild type and mutant strains carrying the pUCP26 vector were grown at 37 °C in 100 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 60 μg/ml tetracycline to an A 600 of 1. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, buffer containing 10 mm NaEDTA (3Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Total tRNA was extracted from the cells with phenol and purified under acidic conditions at 4 °C (3Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A portion of the tRNA samples was completely deacylated by a 90-min incubation at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 2m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cleavage of the ester linkage of aminoacyl-tRNAs in another portion of the samples was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, buffer containing 10 mm CuSO4. 0.5A 260 units of tRNA from the fully deacylated and CuSO4-treated samples were acylated with methionine for 5 min using a large excess of MetRS. Formylation was carried out for 5 min using a large excess of affinity purified P. aeruginosaMTF. The amount of N-blocked Met-tRNAfMet in each strain was determined by the difference between formyl acceptance of the two tRNA samples and expressed as a percent of the total tRNAfMet in the completely deacylated sample. In vitro studies of protein synthesis using extracts from E. coli showed that translation was stimulated by fMet-tRNAfMet (17Ebbole D.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8274-8287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of formylation in E. coli by using trimethoprim to impair folate metabolism caused the cells to grow very slowly (18Baumstark B.R. Spremulli L.L. RajBhandary U.L. Brown G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 457-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Danchin A. FEBS Lett. 1973; 34: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Harvey R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 309-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These early studies led to the belief that formylation is an important prerequisite for initiation of protein synthesis in eubacteria. Recently, this view was supported by the finding that inactivation of the E. colichromosomal fmt gene, which codes for the formylating enzyme, severely curtailed cell growth (3Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Both in vitroand in vivo studies showed that the formyl group is important for selection of the initiator tRNA by IF-2 at the initiation site of the ribosome and for preventing misappropriation of the tRNA in elongation (5Varshney U. Lee C.-L. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18018-18024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Guillon J.-M. Heiss S. Soutourina J. Mechulam Y. Laalami S.

Chem. 1976; 251: 3338-3345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some circumstantial evidence obtained from studies conducted inS. faecalis and Bacillus subtilis questioned the importance of formylation in initiation of protein synthesis in eubacteria. In contrast to E. coli, B. subtiliswas capable of growth when formylation was blocked by trimethoprim inhibition of folate metabolism (21Arnold H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 476: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similarly, a S. faecalis mutant deficient in folate synthesis was not affected in growth (11Samuel C.E. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1198-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of S. faecalis, the selection conditions used to isolate the mutant strain resulted in additional chromosomal mutations, which affected proper tRNA modification. This observation suggests that growth of B. subtilis could be due to compensatory chromosomal mutations. Therefore, it is not clear whether formylation is required for initiation of protein synthesis in these organisms. To investigate the importance of Met-tRNAfMet formylation inP. aeruginosa, the chromosomal fmt gene was replaced with a mutant copy by homologous recombination (12Schweizer H.P. Hong T.T. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thefmt gene used in this study was isolated previously from a genomic library by functional complementation of a MTF-deficientE. coli strain (16.Newton, D. T., Lo, R. Y. C., and Mangroo, D. (1998) Canadian Society for Microbiology Meeting, June 15–19, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Abstract GMp 23.Google Scholar). A 4.5-kilobase pair SmaI segment containing the fmt gene as well as flanking sequences was obtained from the genomic clone and inserted into the same site in the suicide vector pEX100T. The fmt gene was inactivated by insertion of the GmR cassette into aMfeI site. P. aeruginosa transformants containing the pEX100Tfmt::GmR vector in the chromosome were identified by selecting for carbenicillin and gentamycin resistance. Resolution of the plasmid was achieved by subjecting the merodiploid strain to sucrose counter-selection in the presence of gentamycin. Several sucrose- and gentamycin-resistant colonies were observed within 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Replacement of the wild typefmt gene with the mutant copy was verified by PCR analysis using primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fmtORF (Fig. 1). Two products of about 1.7- and 1-kilobase pair, corresponding to thefmt::GmR fragment (compare lanes 1 and 4) and the wild type fmt ORF (comparelanes 1 and 3), respectively, were obtained when the chromosomal DNA from the merodiploid strain was used (lane 1). The presence of the fmt::GmRfragment and absence of the wild type fmt gene confirmed replacement of the chromosomal copy in one of the isolates (lane 2). The P. aeruginosa MTF mutant strain grew with a doubling time of 152 min (Fig.2 A). Complementation with the wild type fmt gene, provided in trans on the plasmid pUCP26, decreased the doubling time of the mutant strain to 56 min. This is comparable with that of the wild type strain harboring the pUCP26 vector with or without the fmt gene (Fig. 2 A). This finding established that the reduced growth rate of P. aeruginosa was due specifically to inactivation of the chromosomalfmt gene. The E. coli MTF mutant, constructed as described previously (3Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16.Newton, D. T., Lo, R. Y. C., and Mangroo, D. (1998) Canadian Society for Microbiology Meeting, June 15–19, Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Abstract GMp 23.Google Scholar, 22Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), doubled every 474 min, whereas the mutant strain expressing the wild type E. coli or P. aeruginosa fmt ORFs grew with a doubling time of 42–46 min (Fig.2 B). The residual growth of the E. coli mutant strain is probably due to some low level utilization of the unformylated Met-tRNAfMet in initiation. The growth rate of the MTF-deficient E. coli strain was reduced by 12-fold and that of the P. aeruginosa mutant strain was reduced by 3-fold. The distinct growth phenotype of the two mutant strains suggests that formylation is less important in P. aeruginosathan in E. coli. Growth of the P. aeruginosa fmt mutant strain was not due to the presence of a homologue of MTF or to the mutant MTF enzyme being active. This conclusion is based on measurement of formylation activity in cell extracts prepared from the wild type and mutant strains (Fig.3). The total activity in cell extracts prepared from the wild type parental strain increased with the amount of protein assayed. In contrast, no formylation activity was detected in cell extracts prepared from the mutant strain even at high protein levels. These results show that the P. aeruginosa fmt mutant strain was devoid of formylating activity. We investigated whetherN-acylation of the Met-tRNAfMet by a functional group other than the formyl group could account for the growth of theP. aeruginosa fmt mutant strain. Total tRNAs were isolated from the wild type and mutant strains, under conditions that stabilize the aminoacyl ester linkage (3Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One portion of the sample was completely deacylated, by incubating the tRNA under alkaline conditions. A second portion was treated with CuSO4, which cleaves the ester bond of aminoacyl-tRNA but not that ofN-acyl-Met-tRNAfMet. Both tRNA samples were re-acylated with methionine, and formyl acceptance was measured usingP. aeruginosa MTF overproduced in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography (15Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 64-69Crossref Google Scholar). The amount ofN-blocked Met-tRNAfMet in the wild type and mutant MTF strains was determined by the difference between formyl acceptance of the completely deacylated and CuS04-treated tRNA samples. Based on this analysis, 80% of the Met-tRNAfMet in the wild type strain wasN-blocked (Fig. 4). However, only the unblocked Met-tRNAfMet species was found in the mutant strain. This result showed that the Met-tRNAfMet in the MTF-deficient strain was not N-acylated by another group. Taken altogether, the results indicate that protein synthesis in the MTF-deficient P. aeruginosa strain is initiated with the initiator methionyl-tRNA and not with N-blocked Met-tRNAfMet. In archaebacteria and the cytoplasm of eukaryotes, protein synthesis is initiated with the initiator Met-tRNA (23Smith A.E. Mercker K.A. Nature. 1970; 226: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These initiator tRNAs contain an A:U base pair which is, in part, required for initiation factor (eIF) recognition of the tRNA (24Sprinzl M. Steegborn C. Hubel F. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, eubacterial initiator tRNAs contain a C × A mismatch between nucleotides 1 and 72. The mismatch in the E. coli initiator tRNA is a key formylation determinant (4Lee C.-P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18012-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Varshney U. Lee C.-L. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 224: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, for initiation in the absence of formylation, it is possible that P. aeruginosa is using an initiator tRNA with functional properties comparable with those of eukaryotes. A search of the P. aeruginosa genome sequence data base identified two initiator tRNA genes encoding tRNAs that are almost identical. The sequences of the initiator tRNAs are homologous to the E. coli tRNAfMet (Fig.5). Moreover, the P. aeruginosa tRNAs contain a C × A mismatch between nucleotides 1 and 72. This feature was used by the P. aeruginosa MTF to recognize the initiator tRNA, since overproduction of the enzyme increased the initiator activity of a formylation-defective tRNAfMet mutant with a base pair between nucleotides 1 and 72 (data not shown). These results suggest that P. aeruginosa is using the tRNAfMet and not a unique initiator tRNA to initiate protein synthesis in the absence of formylation. IF-2 is essential for initiation of protein synthesis in E. coli (25Laalami S. Putzer H. Plumbridge J. Grunberg-Manago M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The protein has a higher affinity for the fMet-tRNAfMet than for the Met-tRNAfMet, indicating that the formyl group is an IF-2 recognition element (9Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1899-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,10Sundari R. Stringer E.A. Schulman L.H. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3338-3345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that IF-2 selects the fMet-tRNAfMet at the initiation site of the preinitiation complex (9Hartz D. McPheeters D.S. Gold L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1899-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, in E. coli, IF-2 is partly responsible for excluding the participation of the nonformylated Met-tRNAfMet in initiation. This is consistent with the observation that in the MTF-deficient E. coli strain, initiation of protein synthesis is severely impaired. The eIF-2s of archaebacteria and eukaryotic cytoplasm are involved in selecting the initiator Met-tRNA for utilization in initiation of translation. A BLAST search of the P. aeruginosa genome data base identified sequences that were homologous to the E. coliIF-2 gene but none that were homologous for the eIF-2 gene. Therefore, it is conceivable that the P. aeruginosa IF-2 has dual substrate specificity and facilitates utilization of both Met-tRNAfMet and fMet-tRNAfMet in initiation or that an unidentified initiation factor, which only recognizes the Met-tRNAfMet species, is involved. We have shown that P. aeruginosa can carry out formylation-independent initiation of protein synthesis, using the Met-tRNAfMet. This finding represents the first direct evidence that eubacteria have the ability to initiate translation with fMet-tRNAfMet and Met-tRNAfMet. While it is not known whether this phenomenon is unique to P. aeruginosa, it opens the possibility that other eubacteria may have the capacity to use both forms of the tRNAfMet for initiation. The availability of various fmt sequences will facilitate investigation of this question in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We thank Dr. J. S. Lam for the P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain and vectors. We also thank our colleagues, Drs. P. D. Josephy, F. J. Sharom, R. A. B. Keates, and A. R.

https://openalex.org/W2077446662,"Fatty acid induction of the peroxisomal β-oxidation machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeinvolves transcriptional control of genes regulated by the oleate response element (ORE). Glucose as the preferred carbon source antagonizes this effect. Induction is dependent on the Zn2Cys6 family members Oaf1p and Pip2p, which bind to this element as a heterodimer. We show here by ectopically expressing both components and LexA fusion derivatives that this transcription factor complex is only active in the presence of oleate. In contrast to Pip2p, Oaf1p is responsive to oleate activation in the absence of the other component of the heterodimer. Therefore, it is the exclusive receptor of the oleate signal. Pip2p is active also under noninducing conditions but is effectively inhibited when complexed with Oaf1p in the absence of inducer. It contributes to the trans-activation properties of the Oaf1p-Pip2p heterodimer and is required for efficient binding of Oaf1p to OREs in vivo. Repression of ORE-dependent transcription by glucose occurs via both Oaf1p and Pip2p. By dissecting functional domains of both proteins, we identified a region required for regulated activity of the C-terminal activation domain. These findings allow us to postulate a model for carbon source-regulated transcription of peroxisomal protein genes.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae fatty acids such as oleate cause a massive proliferation of the peroxisomal compartment accompanied by the induction of β-oxidation (1Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.-H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Glucose represses these effects apparently because it is utilized preferably to alternative carbon sources such as fatty acids (2Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell.

It constitutes the binding target for the transcription factors Oaf1p and Pip2p (11Luo Y. Karpichev I.V. Kohanski R. Small G.M. J. Biol.

These two proteins are quite similar with an overall identity of 40% and belong to the Zn2Cys6 protein family of fungal transcription factors. Usually, members of this family require homodimerization to be able to bind their cognate sites. Oaf1p and Pip2p, however, predominantly bind to OREs as a heterodimeric complex (13Karpichev I.V. Luo Y. Marians R.C. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 69-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transcription of PIP2 is itself up-regulated by oleate via an ORE in its promoter and thus requires Pip2p and Oaf1p, whereas expression of OAF1 is independent of these factors and comparable in glucose, ethanol, and oleate medium (14Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Functional domains other than the N-terminal Zn2Cys6 DNA-binding motifs have not yet been identified in Oaf1p or Pip2p. The domain structures of Oaf1p and Pip2p may deviate from the functional organization of a prototypic Zn2Cys6 protein homodimer (15Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) as they have to allow the formation of a heterodimer in order to function properly. Moreover, the mechanisms required to convert Zn2Cys6 proteins from an inactive to an active state are apparently not conserved. Activation of Gal4p, for instance, depends on its interaction with Gal80p- and Gal3p-binding galactose (16Yano K. Fukasawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Blank T.E. Woods M.P. Lebo C.M. Xin P. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2566-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation via the Snf1p (Cat1p) protein kinase suffices to activate Cat8p and Sip4p (18Randez-Gil F. Bojunga N. Proft M. Entian K.-D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2502-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Rahner A. Scholer A. Martens E. Gollwitzer B. Schüller H.J.

These recent findings challenge the idea of a common principle in Zn2Cys6 protein regulation and highlight the requirement for a detailed study on the inducer-mediated activation of the Oaf1p-Pip2p transcription factor. This report is concerned with the individual roles of Pip2p and Oaf1p in activation of transcription by fatty acids and its repression by glucose and addresses the domain structure of Oaf1p and Pip2p. The results obtained are integrated into a model for carbon source-dependent transcription of ORE-regulated genes. Yeast strains and plasmids used are listed in Tables Iand II, respectively.

Open table in a new tab For β-galactosidase assays overnight cultures propagated in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone) containing 2% glucose were diluted to anA 600 of 0.3 either in YP medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose (for strains derived from BJ1991) or in synthetic medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% glucose, amino acids as required) lacking tryptophan (for strains derived from L40) and grown for 8 h. The cultures were then shifted to YP medium containing 2% glucose (YPD), 2% ethanol (YPE), or 0.2% oleic acid plus 0.02% Tween 80, adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH (YPO), and further grown until the cultures reached an A 600 of 1.0–1.5 (16 h). To test in MF24–6x-derived strains truncated versions of Oaf1p and Pip2p for their ability to complement oaf1Δ andpip2Δ deletions, respectively, transformants were replica-plated on YPO plates that contained 0.02% X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) and monitored for blue color formation as described (12Rottensteiner H.

To clone pBTMOAF1-1021N (the distal 81 bp of OAF1), a PCR was performed with the primer pair O1021N-EcoRI (5′-GAATTCGCGAATAATACTCCTTTTC-3′) and pBTM-rev using genomic DNA from BJ1991 wild type as a template. The PCR product was cut with EcoRI and SalI, and a 70-bpEcoRI-SalI-delimited fragment was ligated into the appropriately cut plasmid pBTM116. To generate pYCPIP2-975C, the annealed linker oligonucleotides ΔNco,SalI-1, and ΔNco, SalI-2 were ligated into anNcoI, SalI-cut pYCPIP2 (12Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B.

To clone pYCPIP2-832C, a 1560-bp BamHI, SalI-delimitedPIP2 fragment from plasmid pBTMPIP2-832C was ligated into an appropriately cut pYCPIP2. To generate plasmid pYCOAF1-901C, a PCR was carried out using pYCOAF1 (14Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) as a template and the primer pair OAF1prom.-SalI (5′-AATTGTCGACGGTTTCGTCAGTGATGGCGG-3′) and O-901C PstI (5′-AATTCTGCAGCTATTCAACGCTAAAATTCG-3′). The 2.7-kb SalI, PstI-delimited fragment was ligated into an appropriately cut YCplac22 (21Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). Strains overexpressing Pip2p or Pip2p-myc9 were generated by integration of EcoRV-linearized pADH2-PIP2 and pADH2-PIP2-myc9 into the trp1 locus of the BJ1991-derived strains. Strains harboring the FOX3ORE-CYC1-lacZ reporter gene were generated by single integrations of StuI-linearized pFOX3 ORE-CYC1-LacZ into the ura3 locus of the respective BJ1991-derived strains. All strains containing centromeric or episomal plasmids were obtained by selecting transformants on the respective selective media. In vivo dimethyl sulfate (DMS) protection assays using CTA1 primers followed a procedure essentially as described (22Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Erstuch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In brief, strains BJ1991, BJ1991pip2Δ, BJ1991oaf1Δ, and BJ1991pip2Δoaf1Δ were grown in YP medium containing 0.3% glucose to an A 600 of 0.4, shifted to YPO medium, and incubated for 12 h. Cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in YP medium. After adding 2.5 μl of DMS/ml cells, the mixtures were incubated for 4 min at 25 °C. The methylation reactions were stopped by adding 30 ml of ice-cold TNEβ buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm NaCl, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Chromosomal DNA was subsequently extracted and used as a template for primer extension reactions with the following primers: CTA1/333 (5′-AAACGTCCTTGCGTGAAGAAGTGAGCGG-3′) for analysis of the lower strand and CTA1/rev (5′-AAACCTACAAGAAATTCAAATGTACGATTTGG-3′) to probe the upper strand. Reaction products were separated on an 8% sequencing gel, and bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Crude cell extracts were prepared in a buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (completeTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany), separated by SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and blotted to nitrocellulose. Immunodetection of proteins was carried out using polyclonal rabbit anti-LexA antibody (obtained from J. Little, University of Tucson, AZ), polyclonal rabbit anti-Kar2p antibody (A. J. Kal, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and anti-myc hybridoma supernatant antibody (cell line 9E10). The secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom. The proteins were visualized using SuperSignalTM (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following procedures were carried out according to published methods: nucleic acid manipulations (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6806-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic kinetics of AK has been studied extensively (10Callaghan O.H. Weber G. Biochem. J. 1959; 73: 473-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 11Rhoads D.G. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3963-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kuby S.A. Hamada M.

Paimieri R.H. Russell G.A. Kuby S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a full understanding mechanism is still lacking. The basic kinetic pattern is random Bi Bi (11Rhoads D.G. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3963-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but whether the chemical step or the physical step(s) is rate-limiting is still controversial. Furthermore, it was reported in an early work of Kuby et al. (12Kuby S.A. Hamada M. Gerber D. Tsai W.C. Jacobs H.K. Cress MC. Chua G.K. Fleming G. Wu L.H. Fischer A.H. Frischat A. Maland L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 187: 34-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that the nature of the AP5A inhibition changes qualitatively from competitive inhibition with respect to either substrate in the forward reaction (MgATP or AMP) to noncompetitive (mixed noncompetitive) in the backward reaction with either substrate (MgADP or ADP). There is still no convincing explanation for the inhibition nature of AP5A. In a series of previous studies in this laboratory, it was found that there are multiple native forms of AK in equilibrium in solution (15Zhang H.J. Sheng X.R. Niu W.D. Pan X.M. Zhou J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7448-7456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Zhang H.J. Sheng X.R. Pan X.M. Zhou J.M. Biochem.

Sheng X.R. Pan X.M. Zhou J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which may help improve our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of AK. In this study, the catalysis and inhibition kinetics of AK was re-examined. An iso-random Bi Bi catalytic mechanism was proposed. The AP5A inhibition equations derived from this mechanism show that AP5A acts as a competitive inhibitor for the forward reaction and a mixed noncompetitive inhibitor for the backward reaction, agreeing well with experimental results. Pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, NADP, NADH, AMP, ADP, ATP, and AP5A were Sigma products, and other reagents were local products of analytical grade. The enzyme was prepared essentially according to Zhang et al.(19Zhang Y.L. Zhou J.M. Tsou C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) The yield was usually about 60 mg of pure enzyme per kilogram of rabbit muscle. The final preparation usually had a specific activity greater than 1,600 units/mg and showed only a single peak in SDS electrophoresis, gel filtration, and reversed-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. One unit is defined as 1 μmol of ADP (MgADP) generated per minute in forward reaction and 1 μmol of ATP generated per minute in backward reaction. UV absorbance at 340 nm was measured with either Cary 219 (Varian) or U-3000 (Hitachi, Japan) spectrophotometer. The rate of the backward reaction (MgADP + ADP ⇒ MgATP + AMP) was measured by following the reduction of NADP at 340 nm in a coupled enzyme solution with hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The final assay mixture was: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6.7 mm glucose, 0.67 mm NADP, 7.6 μm bovine serum albumin, 10 units/ml hexokinase, 10 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, varying and calculated concentrations of MgAc2, and ADP. Measurements of the velocity of the forward reaction (MgATP + AMP ⇒ MgADP + ADP) was performed by monitoring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm coupling with pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The final assay mixture was: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 75 mm KCl, 4 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 1.0 mm of MgAc2 as free Mg2+, 0.2 mm NADH, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 20 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 7.6 μm bovine serum albumin, plus varying and calculated amounts of MgAc2, ATP, and AMP. The catalysis and inhibition mechanism of adenylate kinase is suggested as shown SchemeFS1. Using the combined equilibrium and steady-state treatment developed by Cha (20Cha S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 820-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and described by Huang (21Huang C.Y. Purich D.L. Methods in Enzymology. 63. Academic Press, New York1979: 54-84Google Scholar), Scheme FS1 can be reduced to Scheme 2 and Eq. 1. X̄1<k2fME1T+k1fE1k−2fD1E2D2+k−1fE2>X̄2 SCHEME2 Here E 1 and E 2denote two native forms of enzyme, one form (E 1) can bind with AMP (M) and MgATP (T), and the other one with ADP (D 1) and MgADP (D 2). Both interconversions of the ternary complexes and free enzymes are rate-limiting steps. This mechanism is, in principle, a random Bi Bi type, similar to that proposed by an earlier study (11Rhoads D.G. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3963-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but with the major modification that two native forms of enzyme are introduced. This mechanism is based on the fact that AK undergoes large domain movements upon substrate binding (22Schulz G.E. Müller C.W. Diederich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). After aligning 17 known structures of nucleoside monophosphate kinases, Vonrhein et al. (23Vonrhein C. Schlauderer G.J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) gave movies to demonstrate the catalytic cycle of AK, which showed that the conformation of ternary complex of enzyme binding with AMP and ATP is different from that of enzyme binding with two ADP. That is to say, AK undergoes at least two steps of conformational changes. One step is the change of a ternary complex with bound substrates to one with bound products during the reaction, and the other is the change of the free enzyme in different forms. These conformational changes should be the rate-limiting steps in the catalytic cycle of AK, whereas the binding of substrates to and the release of products from the enzyme are quickly equilibrated. AP5A is composed of ATP and AMP connected by a fifth phosphate, and mimics both substrates (24Lienhard G.E. Secemski I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was assumed that AP5A (I) can only bind to E 1 and the binding reaction of E 1 with AP5A is rapid with an equilibrium constant ofK I. We have also assumed that the affinities for substrates of free enzyme and binary complexes,ME 1 and E 1 T, as well as D 1 E 2 andE 2 D 1, are the same. vE0=k2fME1TX̄1−k−2fD1E2D2X̄2X̄1+X̄2Equation 1 =k2fME1Tk−1fE2−k−2fD1E2D2k1fE1k−2fD1E2D2+k−1fE2+k2fME1T+k1fE1 =k2k−1[M][T]KMKT−k−2k1[D1][D2]KD1KD2k−1+k−2[D1][D2]KD1KD21+1KM+1KM′[M]+[T]KT+[M][T]KMKT+[I]KI+k1+k2[M][T]KMKT1+1KD1+1KD1′[D1]+[D2]KD2+[D1][D2]KD1KD2In the forward reaction, one binding site is specific for AMP, whereas the other less specific one is for MgATP (25Khoo J.C. Russell Jr., P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4163-4167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so the reaction system consists of free enzymes E 1 andE 2, binary complexes ME 1,E 1 M, andE 1 T and ternary complexesME 1 T andME 1 M. The products,D 1 and D 2, are rapidly removed by the coupled enzymes, so that the concentration of ternary complexD 1 E 1 D 2approaches zero. In the absence of AP5A, we have Eq. 2. vE0=2k2k−1[M][T]KMKTk−11+1KM+1KM′[M]+[T]KT+[M][T]KMKT+k1+k2[M][T]KMKTEquation 2 Here a factor of two is introduced, because the forward reaction produces two ADP molecules.

In the backward reaction, one binding site is specific for ADP, and the other less specific one for MgADP (25Khoo J.C. Russell Jr., P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4163-4167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so the reaction system consists of free enzymes E 1 andE 2, binary complexesD 1 E 2,E 2 D 1, andE 2 D 2, as well as ternary complexesD 1 E 2 D 2andD 1 E 2 D 1. The product ATP is rapidly removed by coupled enzymes, so that the concentration of ternary complex ME 1 Tapproaches zero. The product conversion was controlled under 10%, and the concentration of binary complex ME 1 could be considered as zero. In the absence of AP5A, we have Eq. 4. vE0=k−2k1[D1][D2]KD1KD2k−1+k−2[D1][D2]KD1KD2+k11+1KD1+1KD1′[D1]+[D2]KD2+[D1][D2]KD1KD2Equation 4 The free concentrations of ADP ([D 1]) and MgADP ([D 2]) can be calculated from the total concentrations of ADP ([D 1]0)and Mg ([Mg]0) by Eqs. 5 and 6.

Lardy H.A. Myrback K. Ed. 2. The Enzymes. 6. Academic Press, New York1962: 515-603Google Scholar). In the presence of AP5A, we have Eq. 7. vE0=k−2k1[D1][D2]KD1KD2k−1+k−2[D1][D2]KD1KD21+[I]KI+k11+1KD1+1KD1′[D1]+[D2]KD2+[D1][D2]KD1KD2Equation 7 Eq. 7 shows that AP5A acts as a mixed noncompetitive inhibitor for backward reaction. Fig. 1,A and B, shows the catalytic pattern when AMP and ATP were used as substrates of the forward reaction with the concentration of magnesium ion kept constant at 1 mm. Fig.1 A shows AMP as the variable substrate, whereas Fig.1 B shows MgATP as the variable substrate. With MgATP concentration lower than 0.1 mm, the specific activity increases initially then decreases with increasing concentration of AMP, implying that AMP can bind to the MgATP site (Fig.1 A). In the backward reaction, the concentrations of ADP and MgADP are dependent on the concentration of magnesium ion. The kinetic measurements were carried out under either varied concentrations of magnesium ion with constant ADP (Fig.2 A) or varied concentrations of ADP with constant magnesium ion (Fig. 2 B). Fig.2 A shows that when ADP concentration is lower than 0.5 mm, the specific activity increases first then decreases with the increasing concentration of magnesium ion, because the concentration of MgADP increases with the increasing of magnesium ion concentration, whereas that of ADP decreases. Fig. 2 B shows that with magnesium ion concentration lower than 0.5 mm, the specific activity increases first then decreases with increasing ADP concentrations, implying that ADP can bind to the MgADP site. The full set of data in Figs. 1 and 2 was fitted to Eqs. 2 and 4 to calculate kinetic parameters by a computer program. The best fit kinetic parameters are summarized in TableI and were used to draw the solid lines in Figs. 1 and 2, which are in good agreement with the experimental results.Table IKinetic parameters of adenylate kinaseConstantsK m(AMP)0.12 ± 0.02 mmK i(AMP)3.3 ± 0.3 mmK m(MgATP)0.06 ± 0.01 mmK m(ADP)0.028 ± 0.002 mmK i(ADP)0.91 ± 0.1 mmK m(MgADP)0.033 ± 0.003 mmK I(AP5A)2 ± 0.5 × 10−6 mmk 114,000 ± 2,000 μmol·min−1·mg−1k −18,000 ± 800 μmol·min−1·mg−1k 2710 ± 70 μmol·min−1·mg−1k −2960 ± 100 μmol·min−1·mg−1The Michaelis constants K m equal to the dissociation constants, i.e. K m(AMP) =K M, K m(MgATP) =K T, K m(ADP) =K D1, K m(MgADP) =K D2, K i(ADP) =K′D1,K i(AP5A) = K I, andK i(AMP) = K′M.

It has been reported by Kuby et al. (12Kuby S.A. Hamada M. Gerber D. Tsai W.C. Jacobs H.K. Cress MC. Chua G.K. Fleming G. Wu L.H. Fischer A.H. Frischat A. Maland L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 187: 34-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that AP5A acts as a competitive inhibitor for the forward reaction and a noncompetitive inhibitor (the origin figures show a mixed noncompetitive) for the backward reaction, here the AP5A inhibition patterns were re-examined. Because the affinities of AMP to MgATP site as well as ADP to MgADP site are relatively smaller, Eqs. 10 and 12 can be treated as linear. Fig. 3, A and B, shows the AP5A inhibition patterns in the forward reaction with varied AMP (Fig. 3 A) and MgATP (Fig. 3 B) concentrations, respectively, indicating that AP5A acts as a competitive inhibitor for the forward reaction. Fig. 4, A and B, shows the AP5A inhibition patterns in the backward reaction with varied ADP (Fig. 4 A) and MgADP (Fig. 4 B) concentrations calculated according to Eqs. 3 and 7, respectively, exhibiting that AP5A acts as a mixed noncompetitive inhibitor for the backward reaction. A value of K I = 2 ± 0.5 × 10−6 mm was obtained from the full set of data in Figs. 3 and 4. There are two nucleotide-binding sites of AK, one for the magnesium complexes and the other for uncomplexed nucleotides. X-ray and NMR studies suggested that the latter substrate site is more specific, whereas the former can bind uncomplexed substrates to some extent (24Lienhard G.E. Secemski I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1121-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above experiments demonstrate that AMP or ADP shows substrate inhibition in the forward or the backward reaction, respectively. This result, which was also observed in bakers' yeast AK by Russell and co-workers (25Khoo J.C. Russell Jr., P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4163-4167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is in agreement with the x-ray and NMR findings. The equilibrium concentrations of E 1 andE 2 in the absence of substrates should be different from those at steady state, so a lag (or burst) phase should occur in the beginning of the catalytic reaction. However, because the activity of AK was assayed with a coupled enzyme system, the initial process is too complicated to follow. The fact that AP5A acts as a competitive inhibitor for the forward reaction and a mixed noncompetitive inhibitor for the backward reaction cannot be explained by the normal random Bi Bi mechanism. However, these inhibition patterns are consistent with an iso-random Bi Bi mechanism in which the substrates can bind to one isoform while the products bind to another isoform of the enzyme. This strongly supports the suggestion that two native forms of AK might be involved in the catalytic reactions. The rate of enzyme conformational changes is on the order of 102 s−1 in the catalytic reactions, which is much higher than that determined by ANS fluorescence probe (about 10−2 s−1, see Ref. 15Zhang H.J. Sheng X.R. Niu W.D. Pan X.M. Zhou J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7448-7456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This perhaps can be explained that substrates decrease whereas ANS increases the activation energy of enzyme conformational changes. It was indeed observed that ANS inhibits the folding of AK, whereas AMP, ADP, and ATP can accelerate the folding (16Zhang H.J. Sheng X.R. Pan X.M. Zhou J.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the two native forms involved in the catalytic cycle are different from those distinguished by ANS probe, and AK might exist in more native forms in equilibrium. The current experimental results provide no information to distinguish the above possibilities. It has been reported that some proteins may exist in more than one distinct folded form in equilibrium. Evidence for distinguishing multiple native forms of staphylococcal nuclease has come from electrophoresis and NMR studies (27Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol.

For calbindin D9K, the evidence of multiple forms has come from not only NMR studies but also from x-ray crystal structures (33Chazin W.J. Kördel J. Drakenberg T. Thulin E. Hofmann T. Forsén S.

These results shed light on the understanding of the protein folding problem but give little information on the biological role of the multiple native forms. Is the multiple native forms are necessary for protein to perform its biological functions or only the results of protein folding? Our results suggest that the multiple native forms are necessary for AK to perform its catalytic function. AK, a small nucleoside monophosphate kinase, undergoes large domain movements during catalysis (23Vonrhein C. Schlauderer G.J. Schulz G.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 483-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), because it has to shield its active center from water to avoid ATP hydrolysis. Because the folded forms of AK must be flexible, multiple native forms with small free energy difference can exist in equilibrium in the absence of substrates. In summary, two rate-limiting steps are involved in the catalytic cycle of AK. Only one form (E 1) of AK can bind with AP5A, so AP5A acts as a competitive inhibitor for the forward reaction and a noncompetitive inhibitor for the backward reaction. We express our sincere thanks to Prof. C. L. Tsou of this institution for reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1881765458,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by an accelerated apoptosis of peripheral lymphocytes and an impairment of the clearance of apoptotic cells. Since changes in DNA methylation and in deoxycytosine and deoxyguanine (GC) content have been shown to enhance the potential of DNA to activate murine and human B lymphocytes, we tested the capacity of lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis (under conditions that mimic the deletion of self-reactive cells after antigen receptor engagement) to generate nucleosomes with a particular base composition. Using two cell culture systems and four apoptosis triggers, we found an increase of deoxymethylcytosine in fragmented chromosomal DNA of apoptotic B and T lymphocytes. However, this increase was not associated with modulation of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase, the enzyme that methylates eukaryotic DNA, which suggests that the changes in DNA methylation patterns are not linked to the process of de novo DNA methylation during cell death. In addition, we could not detect a unique methylation pattern in highly repetitive Alu sequences present in the human genome of SLE subjects, as compared with controls. However, the abnormal DNA methylation of apoptotic nucleosomes was associated with an unusual pattern of nuclease-resistant, GC-rich regions in these DNA fragments. We propose that the combination of an accelerated apoptosis with a defect in the clearance of apoptotic cells results in release of increased amounts of nucleosomes with abnormally methylated, GC-rich DNA and provides an autologous stimulation that could bypass tolerance to self in systemic autoimmune diseases. These findings support the concept that the structure and dynamics of nucleosomes are critical in determining their immunogenicity in SLE."

In this paper, we examine the subcellular distribution and function of the GTPase Rab15. Our biochemical and confocal immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that Rab15 associates with the transferrin receptor, a marker for the early endocytic pathway, but not with Rab7 or the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, markers for late endosomal membranes. Furthermore, Rab15 colocalizes with Rab4 and -5 on early/sorting endosomes, as well as Rab11 on pericentriolar recycling endosomes. Consistent with its localization to early endosomal membranes, overexpression of the constitutively active mutant HArab15Q67L reduces receptor-mediated and fluid phase endocytosis.

Therefore, our functional studies suggest that Rab15 may function as an inhibitory GTPase in early endocytic trafficking. Membrane trafficking through the secretory and endocytic pathways requires the precisely controlled flow of transport vesicles between intracellular compartments. Rab proteins are low molecular weight GTPases associated with the cytoplasmic surface of membrane-bound compartments in the secretory and endocytic pathways (for review, see Refs. 1Ferro-Novick S.

The restricted distribution of each Rab GTPase within the cell is consistent with their proposed role in regulating intracellular transport. Genetic studies in yeast suggest that some Rab GTPases control membrane trafficking by regulating interactions between components of the membrane docking/fusion machinery, through a process involving the binding and hydrolysis of GTP (4Rothman J.E.

However, recent studies on mammalian cells suggest that some Rab GTPases may facilitate vesicle formation, perhaps by mediating the recruitment of vesicle components rather than vesicle budding (for review, see Refs. 8Schimmoller F.

These studies suggest that Rab GTPases fulfill diverse functions in membrane trafficking and that multiple Rab proteins may be required for transport through each membrane compartment. Endocytic compartments are highly specialized both in terms of their organization and function.

Here ligands are sorted away from their receptors and transported to the late endosome, en route to the lysosome for degradation.

In keeping with the specialization of compartments within the endocytic pathway, a number of Rab proteins are associated with distinct endocytic organelles. Rab5 localizes to the plasma membrane and early/sorting endosomes (21Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chavrier P. Parton R.G.

Like Rab5, Rab4 is associated with early/sorting endosomal membranes and is thought to mediate receptor recycling between early/sorting endosomes and the pericentriolar recycling endosome (26van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Rab11 enriches in pericentriolar recycling endosomes and is thought to control receptor recycling via this endosomal compartment (27Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J.

Rab7 and -9 are found on late endosomes, where they regulate distinct transport steps; Rab7, from early to late endosomes and late endosomes to lysosomes (29Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 30Vitelli R. Santello M. Lattero D. Chiarello M. Bifulco M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 33Diaz E. Schimmoller F. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 283-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although Rab22 and -24 have also been localized to endocytic organelles, the role of these GTPases in endocytic membrane trafficking remains unclear (34Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Killisch I. Lütcke A. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1249-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The large number of Rab GTPases associated with early endosomal membranes, while striking, is not surprising given the organization and function of the early endocytic pathway. The early/sorting endosome in particular, is a major sorting station in endocytic trafficking from which several pathways emerge. As such, multiple Rab GTPases would be required to function in concert, regulating vesicle transport through this compartment. In this paper, we have performed a biochemical and functional analysis of Rab15 in CHO cells. Our biochemical and confocal immunofluorescence data indicate that Rab15 specifically colocalizes with the TfR in early endosomal compartments but not with late endosomal markers. Moreover, Rab15 codistributes with Rab4 and -5 on early/sorting endosomes, as well as with Rab11 on the pericentriolar recycling endosome. Consistent with its localization to early endosomal membranes, overexpression of the constitutively active mutant HArab15Q67L reduces receptor-mediated and fluid phase endocytosis. Moreover, our functional studies suggest that Rab15 may function as an inhibitory GTPase in early endocytic trafficking. All materials and chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise stated. Ultrapure sucrose for gradient fractionation was obtained from J. T. Baker Inc. A polyclonal antibody was generated against amino acid residues 125–145 of Rab15 (EQKRQVGREQGQQLAKEYGM) using standard procedures (BAbCo). To determine the subcellular distribution of HArab15, antibodies to the following proteins were used: anti-hemagglutinin antigen (anti-HA) epitope monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (12CA5 from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and HA.11 from BAbCo respectively); synaptophysin/p38 (SYp38, Roche Molecular Biochemicals); the transferrin receptor (TfR) (H68.4, Zymed Laboratories Inc.); soluble Endoplasmic Reticulum protein, Grp78 (α-Grp78, StressGen); constitutive form of the Hsp70 protein, Hsc70 (α-Hsc70, StressGen); Rab4 and -5 (α-Rab4 and α-Rab5, StressGen); Rab7 (α-Rab7, Cytosignal); Rab11 (α-Rab11, Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-c-Myc epitope monoclonal antibody (9E10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibodies against the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (α-CI-MPR) and the NH epitope (anti-NH monoclonal and anti-NH polyclonal antibodies) were the generous gifts of William Brown (Cornell University) and Peter van der Sluijs (Utrecht University, Netherlands), respectively. Anti-IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate and RITC were purchased fromBIOSOURCE, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from ICN Biomedical. Trvb-1 cells stably overexpressing the human transferrin receptor (hTfR) were kindly provided by Timothy McGraw (35McGraw T.E. Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A derivative of Bluescript KSII− (Stratagene) was generated in which an oligonucleotide cassette encoding the 9-amino acid epitope (MYPYDVPDYA) from the influenza HA was directionally cloned into unique HindIII and SmaI sites. A cDNA encoding the open reading frame of rat Rab15 (GenBankTM accession no. M83679) was blunt end-cloned into a unique StuI site immediately 3′ and in frame with the HA epitope. For eukaryotic expression, the HA-tagged Rab15 cDNA fragment (HArab15) was subcloned directly into the uniqueHindIII and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(+)/Zeo (Invitrogen), creating the construct pHArab15/Zeo. A cytosolic form of HArab15 was created by deleting the carboxyl-terminal membrane attachment motif, CWC. Full-length HArab15 template was subject to PCR using an upper primer designed to the 5′ terminus of HArab15 and a lower mutagenic primer designed to the 3′ terminus, lacking the CWC motif. The PCR product was cloned into the unique EcoRV andHindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(−)/G418 to create the construct, pHArab15ΔC/G418. A constitutively active form of HArab15 (HArab15Q67L) was created using a two-step mutagenic PCR protocol. In the first PCR reaction, wild type HArab15 template was subject to PCR using the following mutagenic primers: 5′-TGGGACACAGCAGGCTGGAGAGGTACCAG (upper) and 5′-CTGGTACCTCTCCAGCCCTGCTGTGTCCCA (lower). The mutagenic fragments containing the Q67L mutation were purified and used as a template for a second PCR reaction using primers designed to the 5′ and 3′ termini of the HArab15 sequence and containing the unique restriction sites, EcoRI (5′) and HindIII (3′). The PCR product was cloned directly into pcDNA3.1(−)/G418, creating the construct pHArab15Q67L/G418. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmids encoding Rab4, Rab5, and Rab7, epitope-tagged with the novel hemagglutinin (NH) epitope (pNHrab4-pCB6, pNHrab5-pCB6, and pNHrab7-pcDNA3, respectively), were the generous gift of Peter van der Sluijs (Utrecht University, Netherlands) and have been described elsewhere (36Nagelkerken B.

A CHO cell line stably transfected with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin/p38 (CHOp38) was the generous gift of Pietro de Camilli (Yale University) and has been previously described (38Cameron P.L. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. de Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Wild type CHO cells (CHOwt) were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 7.5% Cosmic calf sera, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (CHO medium). CHOp38 cells were maintained in CHO medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transient and stable transfections were performed using LipofectAmine® Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Stable CHO cell lines were generated by transfection of either CHOwt or CHOp38 cells with 10 μg of the appropriate plasmid and 15 μg of LipofectAmine®reagent. CHO cell lines stably expressing HArab15 were generated by transfecting CHOwt and CHOp38 cells with pHArab15/Zeo. Following transfection, the cells were selected in CHO medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml Zeocin with or without 500 μg/ml G418, to generate cell lines stably expressing HArab15 alone (HArab15:CHOwt) or with synaptophysin (HArab15:CHOp38), respectively. A CHO cell line stably expressing HArab15ΔC (HArab15Δ15:CHOwt) was generated by transfection of CHOwt cells with pHArab15ΔC/G418, followed by selection in CHO medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml of G418. A CHO cell line expressing Rab15 lacking an amino-terminal epitope tag was generated by transfecting CHOwt cells with the construct prab15/G418, containing the open reading frame of Rab15 cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1(−)/G418 (Invitrogen). Cells stably expressing untagged Rab15 (rab15:CHO) were selected with 500 μg/ml G418. For colocalization studies with Rab4, -5, and -7, HArab15:CHOwt cells were transfected with plasmids encoding NH-tagged Rab4, Rab5, or Rab7. Transfected cells were selected with Zeocin and G418, generating cell lines stably co-expressing HArab15 with either NHrab4 (NHrab4/HArab15:CHOwt), NHrab5 (NHrab5/HArab15:CHOwt), or NHrab7 (NHrab7/HArab15:CHOwt). Prior to all experiments, these purified cell lines were incubated with 5–10 mm sodium butyrate for 16–24 h. Western analysis of cell lysates prepared from treated and untreated cells revealed that sodium butyrate treatment did not affect the expression or localization of the endogenous proteins CI-MPR, TfR, Grp78, and Hsc70 (data not shown) in each cell line tested. For immunofluorescence studies, transfected CHO cells were plated on eight-well chamber slides (Nunc) 16–18 h prior to analysis. All subsequent procedures were performed at room temperature. Cells were fixed for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Following fixation, cells were washed three times in wash buffer (0.1 m glycine, 1× PBS) and blocked for 30 min in CHO blocking buffer (2% BSA, 0.02% saponin, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were stained by incubation for 1 h in CHO blocking buffer, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and combinations of the following primary antibodies: 12CA5 or HA.11 (HArab15); SYp38 (synaptophysin); H68.4 (TfR), and α-CI-MPR (CI-MPR). Cells were then washed three times with wash buffer and incubated in CHO blocking buffer, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) containing the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunofluorescent microscopy was performed using a MetaMorph Imaging System and a Zeiss 310 laser scanning microscope (Wayne State University, School of Medicine). For each gradient, two confluent 100-mm plates (8 × 106 cells) of HArab15:CHOp38 cells were harvested in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) and lysed in homogenization buffer by 8–10 passages through a cell cracker (10-μm bore). A postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was produced by centrifugation at 2,800 rpm for 10 min, layered onto a 10–50% linear sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 16–18 h using an SW50.1 rotor (Beckman). The gradient was fractionated from the bottom into 16 aliquots, and the linearity of the gradient was confirmed by measuring the refractive index of each fraction. Gradient fractions were precipitated with 7% trichloroacetic acid (39Serafini T. Stenbeck G. Brecht A. Lottspeich F. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Nature. 1991; 349: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis using 12CA5 (HA epitope) and the following antibodies for the indicated membrane compartments: SYp38 and H68.4 (early endosomes); α-CI-MPR (late endosomes); α-Grp78 (endoplasmic reticulum). Autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometry, and each fraction was expressed as a percentage of the total protein within the gradient. The distributions of lysosomal and Golgi membranes within the gradients were determined by assaying β-hexosaminase (40Messner D.J. Griffiths G. Kornfield S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2149-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and α-mannosidase (41Dewald B. Touster O. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7223-7233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enzyme activities, respectively. In a separate experiment, early and late endosome-enriched membrane fractions were prepared by fractionation of a PNS on a sucrose flotation gradient based on the protocol of Escolaet al. (42Escola J.-M. Grivel J.-C. Chavrier P. Gorvel J.-P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2337-2345PubMed Google Scholar). The relative positions of the early and late endosomal compartments within the gradient was confirmed by the endocytic uptake of the fluid phase marker, horseradish peroxidase (23Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 64: 915-924Scopus (859) Google Scholar). For immunoisolation experiments under nondenaturing conditions, HArab15:CHOp38 cells were harvested in immunoprecipitation buffer (IB; 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) and lysed, and a PNS was produced as detailed above. The protein concentration of the PNS was determined by standard methods (BCA; Pierce). For each reaction, 150 μg of the PNS was mixed for 2 h at 4 °C with the antibodies 12CA5, SYp38, H68.4, or α-CI-MPR, in IB supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 10% FBS (IB/BSA/FBS). Magnetic beads coupled to the appropriate secondary antibody (BioMag, Perkin-Elmer) were preblocked overnight in IB/BSA/FBS, and 50 μg of the blocked beads were added to each reaction for 2 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. The organelle-bead complexes were collected with a magnetic separator and washed three times in IB/BSA/FBS and then three times in IB alone, followed by resuspension in SDS gel load buffer for Western analysis. For immunoisolation of NH-tagged Rab cell lines, 350 μg of the appropriate PNS were incubated with anti-NH monoclonal antibody (37Bottger G. Nagelkerken B. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29191-29197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and processed as detailed above. In immunoisolation studies using gradient fractions, the protein concentration of each fraction was determined, and 150 μg of protein from each fraction was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody in IB/BSA/FBS and processed as described above. Membrane association studies were performed using CHO cells stably expressing wild-type (HArab15:CHOwt) or a mutant form of HArab15 lacking the carboxyl-terminal membrane attachment sequence CWC (HArab15ΔC:CHOwt). A PNS was prepared from these cell lines as described above and centrifuged at 60,000 rpm for 30 min in a TL100.4 rotor (Beckman). The resulting cytosolic fraction was retained, and the membrane pellet was washed with 1 m KCl and recentrifuged as described above. The wash fraction was combined with the previous cytosolic fraction, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA). Equal amounts of membrane and cytosolic proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. For studies using Triton X-114, a PNS prepared from CHO cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant HArab15 was extracted using established protocols (43Johnston P.A. Archer III, B.T. Robinson K. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 1991; 7: 101-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Equivalent volumes of the resulting aqueous and detergent phases were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. For the steady state internalization of AlexaTM488-hTfn, Trvb-1 cells transiently expressing HArab15 or HArab15Q67L were plated onto two-well chamber slides and washed with PBS prior to internalization. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in internalization media (IM; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mg/ml BSA) to deplete endogenous Tfn in the culture media, followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in IM containing 400 μg/ml AlexaTM488-hTfn (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The cells were washed extensively in PBS, 0.1% BSA and costained with the anti-HA antibody 12CA5 and goat anti-mouse RITC secondary antibodies as described above. For steady state internalization studies using horseradish peroxidase (HRP), transiently transfected Trvb-1 cells were incubated with IM containing 2 mg/ml of HRP (Pierce) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following internalization, the cells were processed as described by Bucci et al. (25Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M. Cell. 1992; 70: 715-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). HRP levels were normalized with respect to protein and expressed as a function of time. For 125I-labeled human transferrin (125I-hTfn) studies, human holotransferrin (Sigma) was iodinated (3–7 × 106 cpm/μg) in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, with carrier-free Na-125I (NEN Life Science Products) using IODO-GEN iodination reagent (Pierce), according to the method of Mellman et al. (44Mellman I.S. Plutner H. Steinman R.M. Unkeless J.C. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Duplicate sets of Trvb-1 cells transiently transfected with pHArab15/G418 or pHArab15Q67L/G418 were washed with PBS prior to internalization. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in IM to deplete endogenous Tfn in the culture media, followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in IM containing 3 μg/ml 125I-hTfn (1–5 × 106 cpm/μg) to promote 125I-hTfn internalization. To determine total cell-associated125I-hTfn, one set of cells was washed extensively in ice-cold PBS, 0.1% BSA and lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. To determine internal125I-hTfn levels, the second set of cells was washed three times alternately in PBS, 0.1% BSA and PBS, 25 mm glacial acetic acid (pH 4.2) to remove surface-bound 125I-hTfn. Approximately 80–90% of the 125I-hTfn could be removed by three acid washes. The cells were collected, lysed, and counted. Surface-bound 125I-hTfn was determined by subtracting internal 125I-hTfn levels from the total cell-associated radioactivity. Nonspecific binding of 125I-hTfn was determined by incubating cells in IM containing 3 μg/ml125I-hTfn and a 100-fold excess of unlabeled hTfn. Nonspecific values were routinely less than 10% of the specific binding. Levels of internalized 125I-hTfn were normalized with respect to protein and expressed as a percentage of total125I-Tfn. Duplicate sets of transfected and control Trvb-l cells were treated as described above in the steady state internalization study with the following exceptions. Following endogenous Tfn depletion, cells were incubated on ice for 60 min with 3 μg/ml 125I-hTfn to bind 125I-hTfn to the cell surface, and the cells were washed with PBS to remove any unbound ligand. The cells were then incubated in IM at 37 °C for the indicated times to allow internalization, and the chase medium was collected. Internal, surface, and total 125I-hTfn levels were calculated as described above in the steady state internalization study, and the chase medium was counted as a measurement of recycling. Recycled, internal, and surface 125I-Tfn were expressed as a percentage of prebound 125I-Tfn. To study the subcellular localization of Rab15, we generated a polyclonal antibody against a 16-amino acid peptide sequence specific to Rab15. Western analysis of untransfected CHO cells (con in Fig.1) reveals no significant levels of endogenous Rab15, even following long exposure of the Western blots. In transfected CHO cells stably expressing Rab15, the antibody detects a single 26-kDa immunoreactive band consistent with its predicted molecular weight (Fig. 1 A). Rab15 immunoreactivity was not detected in CHO cells transfected with a control vector only (data not shown). Overexpression of Rab15 does not interfere with the expression of several endogenous proteins, including the TfR and the soluble endoplasmic reticulum protein, Grp78. In immunofluorescence studies, the anti-Rab15 antibody does not detect native Rab15 when overexpressed in CHO, COS, or PC12 cells (data not shown), indicating that the Rab15 antibody recognizes denatured Rab15 only. Therefore, to examine the subcellular distribution of Rab15, we transfected CHO cells with epitope-tagged Rab15. Previous studies have demonstrated that epitope tagging the amino termini of Rab GTPases with small 9-amino acid peptides such as the HA or NH or with larger epitopes from green fluorescent protein does not perturb Rab function or subcellular localization when overexpressed in mammalian cells (37Bottger G.

In this study, we show that both phosphatidic acids and diacylglycerols can serve separately as potent, physiologic activators of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system. Stimulation of superoxide generation by these lipids was dependent upon both Mg2+ and agonist concentration. Activation of NADPH oxidase by phosphatidic acids did not appear to require their conversion to corresponding diacylglycerols by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, since diacylglycerols were much slower than phosphatidic acids to activate the system and required the presence of ATP. Stimulation of the oxidase by dioctanoylglycerol proved to be by a means other than the activation of protein kinase C. Instead, dioctanoylglycerol was converted to dioctanoylphosphatidic acid by an endogenous diacylglycerol kinase present in the cell-free reaction system. This conversion was sensitive to the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor R59949 and explains the markedly slower kinetics of activation and the novel ATP requirement seen with dioctanoylglycerol. The level of dioctanoylphosphatidic acid formed was suboptimal for NADPH oxidase activation but could synergize with the unmetabolized dioctanoylglycerol to activate superoxide generation.

In response to a variety of stimuli, the human neutrophil is capable of the potent and sustained production of superoxide anion (O⨪2). This is achieved through the single-electron reduction of molecular oxygen in a reaction catalyzed by a multicomponent NADPH oxidase system, thus: NADPH + 2O2 → NADP+ + 2O⨪2 + H+. Once formed, O⨪2 is rapidly converted to a battery of reactive oxygen intermediates, including HOCl and H2O2, which then serve as important microbicidal agents of the phagosome. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is composed of at least five unique protein components, two of which, gp91 phox and p22 phox, are integral to the plasma and specific granule membranes and together form the heterodimeric flavocytochrome b 558 (1Dinauer M.C.

Activation of NADPH oxidase occurs when physiological stimuli bind to cell surface receptors, thereby triggering signal transduction events and the generation of lipid-derived second messenger molecules. Key elements of the lipid conversion pathways most likely to be involved are summarized in Fig. 1. (For a comprehensive review of these and related pathways see Ref. 14Dennis E.A. Rhee S.G.

To facilitate the study of phagocyte NADPH oxidase, cell-free systems were devised that contained cytosolic and plasma membrane fractions from unstimulated cells. In these assay systems, O⨪2 generation is initiated by the addition of an anionic amphiphile, such as arachidonate or SDS (28Bromberg Y. Pick E.

In contrast to other cell-free activators (e.g. arachidonic acid, SDS), which have very short lag times (1–3 min), it has been reported that synergistic activation by PA/DAG requires 30–60 min to reach maximal O⨪2-generating activity and that their effect is dependent on the activity of a novel protein kinase (52McPhail L.C.

In this report, we describe for the first time the potent activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system by physiologically attainable concentrations of PA or DAG, in the absence of other agonists. The rates of O⨪2 production achieved were similar to those induced by SDS and arachidonate and were equivalent to rates observed with intact neutrophils. Based on kinetics, nucleotide requirement, and susceptibility to inhibitors, we propose that activation by DAG in this system is dependent upon its conversion to PA. Our results are in accord with intact cell studies, in that they point to PAs as physiologic activators of O⨪2 production, coupling the neutrophil's signal transduction pathways to NADPH oxidase activation. Phosphatidic acids and diacylglycerols were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products.

Membrane fractions were brought to a final concentration of 1.25 × 109cell eq/ml (approximately 5 mg of protein/ml) in 5 mmPIPES, 50 mm KCl, 1.75 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.63 mmEGTA, 0.34 m sucrose, pH 7.3. All purified cell fractions were stored at −80 °C and thawed just prior to use. Neutrophil cytosolic fractions (10 ml) were dialyzed against three successive 6-h changes (3000 ml each) of relax buffer without MgCl2 at 4 °C. Charcoal treatment of dialyzed cytosols and deoxycholate-solubilized membranes was performed as described in Ref. 58Peveri P. Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2494-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. Diacylglycerols and phosphatidic acids, shipped in chloroform on dry ice, were diluted to 10 mm with chloroform and stored in borosilicate glass tubes at −20 °C in 0.3-ml aliquots. Solutions used to activate the cell-free system were made fresh daily. For the diacylglycerols, an aliquot was removed, and the chloroform was evaporated with a stream of N2 gas. Me2SO was then added to restore the concentration to 10 mm. Subsequent dilutions were accomplished in H2O, maintaining a final volume ratio of 1.5:8.5 (Me2SO:H2O). A 10-μl aliquot of diacylglycerols diluted in this fashion was added to 140 μl of reaction mixture to initiate cell-free NADPH oxidase activity. Phosphatidic acid aliquots were similarly evaporated with N2, and subsequently brought to 10 mm with H2O. These solutions were warmed to 37 °C and gently agitated in a sonicating water bath (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics Inc., Plainview, NY) until opalescent. Further dilutions were then made in H2O. Again, 10 μl of agonist was added to reaction mixtures (140 μl) to initiate activity. NADPH oxidase activation was measured in a cell-free system as described previously (54Curnutte J.T. Scott P.J. Mayo L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), utilizing membrane and cytosol fractions purified from unstimulated neutrophils. Membranes were solubilized in deoxycholate before use (54Curnutte J.T. Scott P.J. Mayo L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out at 25 °C, since the use of higher temperatures severely limits oxidase activity in this and similar systems (52McPhail L.C. Qualliotine-Mann D. Waite K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7931-7935Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Reactions (150-μl total volume) were performed in relax buffer containing an optimal concentration of MgCl2 for the agonist used, plus cytochrome c(0.1 mm) and NADPH (0.16 mm). After activation by a variety of stimuli, superoxide production was determined by measuring the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochromec at 550 nm in a ThermoMax® kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA), using a 550 ± 1-nm filter. Maximum reaction velocities were calculated using SoftMax® kinetic analysis software (version 2.01, Molecular Devices). Control wells containing superoxide dismutase (60 μg/ml) were run simultaneously with each test reaction, and maximum velocity measurements from these controls were subtracted from test well values to provide the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable rate of cytochrome c reduction for each reaction. This rate of maximum absorbance change was converted to nmol of O⨪2/min as detailed earlier for this 550-nm filter (59Mayo L.A. Curnutte J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Single reaction kinetic traces were produced using a Kontron Uvikon® 810 dual-beam spectrophotometer (Kontron Electronics, Inc., Redwood City, CA). These reaction mixtures (0.75 ml) were essentially identical to those described above and contained 9.9 × 106 cell eq of cytosol and 3.13 × 106 cell eq of deoxycholate-solubilized membranes. For all cell-free assays performed, complete reaction mixtures were allowed to incubate for 3 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of stimulus. In reactions employing dialyzed cytosol, exogenous nucleotides were added to reconstitute oxidase activity. For all such assays, GTPγS was added to a final concentration of 10 μm; reactions activated with diacylglycerols also required supplemental ATP (100 μm). Cell-free NADPH oxidase assays utilizing membrane vesicles required slightly different conditions for optimal activity. Deoxycholate was completely eliminated from these reaction mixtures (150 μl), and the membrane vesicles required a brief pretreatment at 37 °C with the activating lipid. Specifically, the plasma membrane vesicles (diluted to 2.0 × 108/ml with relax buffer) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of a given concentration of lipid activator. This mixture was then allowed to cool at room temperature for 3 min prior to addition to the assay well. Upon addition, a further amount of the lipid activating species was also added to the total reaction mixture to maintain the concentration present during the preincubation period. Reactions were then followed at 25 °C in the kinetic microplate reader, as outlined above. Complete oxidase reaction mixtures (0.6 ml) supplemented with 41.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were activated with 70 μmdioctanoylglycerol. After 15 min, 0.5-ml aliquots were transferred to 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) containing the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (1 mg/ml). These extraction mixtures were vortexed and allowed to incubate in 15-ml polypropylene tubes for 15 min at 25 °C. CHCl3 (2.1 ml) was added, followed by 2.1 ml of 2.4 n HCl. After thorough mixing, samples were centrifuged 6 min at 300 × g to clarify the solvent interface. The lower (organic) phase was then collected, and the upper (aqueous) phase was washed twice with 2.1 ml of CHCl3. All three organic phases were then pooled and stored on dry ice until analyzed (less than 24 h). These samples were then brought to room temperature, dried under N2, and resuspended in 2 ml of water-saturated CHCl3. Aliquots were taken for scintillation counting, and the remainder was reconcentrated under N2, resuspended in 90 μl of water-saturated CHCl3, and spotted on oxalate-impregnated thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (silica gel 60; EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). Phospholipids were chromatographed as described elsewhere (60Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol.

[32P]Dioctanoylphosphatidic acid was identified by comigration with authentic [32P]dioctanoylphosphatidic acid synthesized from dioctanoylglycerol and [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of diacylglycerol kinase. Dioctanoylphosphatidic acid migrated with an R F of 0.8 relative to [32P]dioleoylphosphatidic acid. Maximum reaction velocities were directly measured from the linear portion of kinetic traces obtained on the dual-beam spectrophotometer and were determined as detailed above for assays run in microplate format. Variances shown represent the mean ± one S.D. Error bars(Figs. 2, 4 B, and 5) are one S.D. in length and are smaller than the symbol size if not depicted. AMBIS β-scanning data were evaluated using AMBIS QuantProbe® (version 3.02) image analysis software. Where statistical significance is reported, thep values given were generated using an unpaired ttest (SigmaStat 2.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).Figure 4Inhibition of cell-free oxidase activation and dioctanoylphosphatidic acid accumulation by the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor R59949. The ability of R59949 to inhibit O⨪2 production in the cell-free system was compared with its ability to block conversion of dioctanoylglycerol to dioctanoylphosphatidic acid. In A, the accumulation of32P-labeled dioctanoylphosphatidic acid was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell-free oxidase reactions (0.6 ml) contained 7.92 × 106 cell eq of dialyzed cytosol, 2.5 × 106 cell eq of deoxycholate-solubilized membranes, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GTPγS, 100 μm ATP, and 0, 1, or 50 μm R59949. [γ-32P]ATP (41.4 μCi) was added to each reaction, and the mixtures were allowed to preincubate at 25 °C for 3 min. As a control, no diglyceride was added to one of the reactions in order to track nonspecific incorporation of radioactive label (no stimulus). For each of the remaining reactions, dioctanoylglycerol was added to 70 μm, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by extraction of lipids in chloroform/methanol, and these extracts were then analyzed by TLC for phospholipid content. Accumulation of [32P]dioctanoylphosphatidic acid was quantified on an AMBIS β-scanning system and is plotted (open bars) in thousands of cpm above background.Shaded bars depict O⨪2 production as measured in duplicate reactions by the cell-free NADPH oxidase assay described in Fig. 3. B shows the inhibitory effect of increasing concentrations of R59949 on O⨪2 production by DAG. Control activity (in the absence of R59949) was 17.9 ± 1.4 nmol O⨪2/min/107 cell eq of membranes (n= 3). The results shown in A are representative of those obtained in duplicate experiments, while those in B are the means ± S.D. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Synergistic activation of NADPH oxidase by dioctanoylphosphatidic acid and dioctanoylglycerol. Superoxide production was measured in the cell-free system using a kinetic microplate reader. Varying concentrations of dioctanoylphosphatidic acid were tested for their ability to initiate NADPH oxidase activation either in the absence of any DAG (●) or in the presence of 70 μm dioctanoylglycerol (○). Reaction mixtures (150 μl) contained 1.98 × 106 cell eq of charcoal-treated dialyzed cytosol, 6.25 × 105 cell eq of charcoal-treated deoxycholate-solubilized membranes, 10 μm GTPγS, and 1 mm MgCl2. ATP was omitted from all assay wells to prevent the dioctanoylglycerol from directly activating the oxidase. Under these conditions, the rate of O⨪2 produced by 70 μm dioctanoylglycerol as sole stimulus was 3.4 ± 2.6 nmol/min/107 cell eq of membranes. Data shown are the means ± S.D. for three experiments. Statistical significance was as follows. *, p = 0.011; **, p = 0.007 (compared with values obtained with PA alone).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In an attempt to provide a link between the elevation of intracellular DAG and PA and the activation of NADPH oxidase in response to various stimuli in the intact cell (see the Introduction), we tested the ability of these lipids to activate the enzyme in a cell-free system.

https://openalex.org/W1941456883,"In a benchmark study, Isojima and colleagues established H6–3C4, the first successful heterohybridoma immortalized from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of an infertile woman who exhibited high sperm-immobilizing antibody titers. The present report demonstrates the identity between the glycoprotein antigens recognized by the human H6–3C4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the murine S19 mAb, generated in our laboratory to sperm agglutination antigen-1 (SAGA-1). Both mAb's recognize N-linked carbohydrate epitopes on the 15–25 kDa, polymorphic SAGA-1 glycoprotein that is localized to all domains of the human sperm surface. Treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C demonstrated that SAGA-1 is anchored in the sperm plasmalemma via a GPI-lipid linkage. Immunoaffinity purification and microsequencing indicated that the core peptide of the SAGA-1 glycoprotein is identical to the sequence of CD52, a GPI-anchored lymphocyte differentiation marker implicated in signal transduction. Comparison of anti-SAGA-1 and anti-CD52 immunoreactivities revealed that the sperm form of CD52 exhibits N-linked glycan epitopes, including the epitope recognized by the infertility-associated H6–3C4 mAb, which are not detected on lymphocyte CD52. Thus, the two populations of the CD52 glycoprotein on lymphocytes and spermatozoa represent glycoforms, glycoprotein isoforms with the same core amino acid sequence but different carbohydrate structures. Furthermore, mAb's to the unique carbohydrate epitopes on sperm CD52 have multiple inhibitory effects on sperm function, including a cytotoxic effect on spermatozoa in the presence of complement. These results are the first to implicate unique carbohydrate moieties of a sperm CD52 glycoform as target epitopes in the anti-sperm immune response of an infertile woman. Furthermore, localization of CD52 on all domains of the sperm surface coupled with the multiple sperm-inhibitory effects of antibodies to its unique carbohydrate moieties suggest opportunities for immunocontraceptive development.—Diekman, A.

https://openalex.org/W2144524373,"Lithostathine is a calcium carbonate crystal habit modifier. It is found precipitated under the form of fibrils in chronic calcifying pancreatitis or Alzheimer's disease. In order to gain better insight into the nature and the formation of fibrils, we have expressed and purified recombinant lithostathine. Analytical ultracentrifugation and quasi-elastic light scattering techniques were used to demonstrate that lithostathine remains essentially monomeric at acidic pH while it aggregates at physiological pH. Analysis of these aggregates by electron microscopy showed an apparently unorganized structure of numerous monomers which tend to precipitate forming regular unbranched fibrils. Aggregated forms seem to occur prior to the apparition of fibrils. In addition, we have demonstrated that these fibrils resulted from a proteolysis mechanism due to a specific cleavage of the Arg11-Ile12 peptide bond. It is deduced that the NH2-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine normally impedes fiber formation but not aggregation. A theoretical model explaining the formation of amyloid plaques in neurodegenerative diseases or stones in lithiasis starting from lithostathine is described. Therefore we propose that lithostathine, whose major function is unknown, defines a new class of molecules which is activated by proteolysis and is not involved in cytoskeleton nor intermediate filament functions.

Chronic calcifying pancreatitis is characterized by a lobular, patchy distribution of fibrotic areas with different intensity from neighboring pancreatic lobules. It increases the concentration of secretory proteins in pancreatic juice and decreases the synthesis of trypsin inhibitor and the ratio of cationic to anionic trypsinogen (1Rinderknecht H. Renner I. Koyama H. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1979; 24: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,2Rinderknecht H. Stace N. Renner I. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1985; 30: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore protein precipitates constitute the first visual stage of the disease. Protein plugs are often found in the ductal and acinar lumina and in the calcified calculi. Morphological studies suggest that mature calculi later observed in chronic calcifying pancreatitis are made of calcite (CaCO3 crystals) deposited on a network of fibrillar proteins mainly composed of a protein called lithostathine. Lithostathine, originally called pancreatic stone protein (3De Caro A. Lohse J. Sarles H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), is a secretory protein mainly produced by pancreatic acinar cells. The secretory form of lithostathine, called S2, comprises 144 amino acids. It tightly binds CaCO3 crystals modifying its crystal habitin vitro (4Geider S. Baronnet A. Cerini C. Nitsche S. Astier J.P. Michel R. Boistelle R. Berland Y. Dagorn J.C. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26302-26306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Trypsin hydrolysis of the Arg-Ile bond in position 11–12 generates a polypeptide of 133 amino acids, called S1, insoluble at physiological pH, which is the form extracted from pancreatic calculi (5De Caro A. Multigner L. Lafont H. Lombardo D. Sarles H. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This form has been independently evidenced in pancreatic juice by Gross and collaborators (6Gross J. Brauer A.W. Bringhurst R.F. Corbett C. Margolies M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5627-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and called pancreatic thread protein because it undergoes fibril formation. The amino acid sequences of pancreatic thread protein and lithostathine S1 are identical. Pancreatic thread protein has been immunolocalized in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease or Down's syndrome (7Ozturk M. De La Monte S.M. Gross J. Wands J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Amino acid comparisons have shown that lithostathine is identical toreg protein (8Stewart T.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 622-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Reg cDNA is expressed in regenerating islets but not in the normal islets (9Terazono K. Uchiyama Y. Ide M. Watanabe T. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) which means that its synthesis is up-regulated in association with β-cell agression and could be a defense mechanism against Type I diabetes mellitus (10Watanabe T. Yonemura Y. Yonekura H. Suzuki Y. Miyashita H. Sugiyama K. Moriizumi S. Unno M. Tanaka O. Kondo H. Bone A.J. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, reg mRNA is expressed in various digestive cancers whereas it is not synthesized in the corresponding normal tissues (9Terazono K. Uchiyama Y. Ide M. Watanabe T. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Kimura N. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Nagura H. Cancer. 1992; 70: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Finally, the overexpression of reg/lithostathine mRNA by cytokines or glucocorticoids has also been shown in inflammatory mechanisms like acute pancreatitis (12Dusetti N.J. Mallo G.V. Ortiz E.M. Keim V. Iovanna J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, lithostathine appears to be a key protein involved in several biochemical events and whose function is unknown. Although lithostathine fibrils have already been observed in vivo, noin vitro studies have been so far undertaken to better understand the formation of polymers and fibrils in physiological conditions. All biochemical reagents were purchased from Prolabo, Carlo Erba, Merck, or Fluka. Trypsin sequencing grade was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Methotrexate and BApNA (N-α-benzoyl-ld-argininep-nitroanilide) were from Sigma. For two-dimensional electrophoresis, resolytes were from BDH and sigmoidal immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 3–10) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The coding sequence of lithostathine was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA previously isolated in our laboratory (13Giorgi D. Bernard J.P. Rouquier S. Iovanna J. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using a forward primer GGCGAAGCTTATGGCTCAGACCAGCTCATAC (ending at +375) and a reverse primer GGCGAAGCTTCTAGTTTTTGAACTTGCAGAC (ending at +2728). The polymerase chain reaction products were then cloned into theEcoRI site of pKCR6 (14Matrisian L.M. Bowden G.T. Krieg P. Fürstenberger G. Briand J.P. Leroy P. Breatnach R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9413-9417Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) using conventional restriction digestion/ligation reactions and sequenced. The lithostathine cDNA construct containing pKCR6 was then purified using the plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen) and used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells. Dhfr −Chinese hamster ovary cells, strain DUKX (15Urlaub G. Chasin L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mg/liter ATP, thymidine, and deoxyadenosine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cell transfections were done with Dosper Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 2 days, the cells were subcultured 1:3 into the same medium without ATP, thymidine, and deoxyadenosine. Macroscopic dhfr + colonies appearing after 10–12 days were pooled and cultured. In order to increase lithostathine production, the dhfr +colonies were subjected to methotrexate selection at 2 μmas described previously (16Kaufman J.R. Method Enzymol. 1990; 185: 537-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Fifty mg of ascites fluid (D4, Immunotech) in 1.5 m glycine, 1.5 mNaCl, pH 8.9, were loaded onto a proteine A-agarose column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), washed with the same buffer, and eluted in 0.1m citric acid, pH 6.0. The yield of purification was about 95%. The antibodies were then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and coupled to 13 ml of an Affi-Gel 10 column (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. One liter of culture medium was centrifugated for 10 min at 3000 rpm to remove cellular debris and clarified by 80% ammonium sulfate fractionation for 2 h. The pellet was then recovered by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 70 min, redissolved in 200 ml of bi-distilled water, and extensively dialyzed against 40 liters of water for 72 h. The dialysate was then adjusted to 500 ml with 50 ml of the 10 times antibody binding buffer (200 mm MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CaCO3, calcium carbonate; <D>, mean diffusion coefficient; (D H)S.S., average size of the hydrodynamic diameter calculated by the singular system method; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; QELS, quasi-elastic light scattering; <R H>, mean hydrodynamic radius; υ, polydispersity; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BApNA, N-α-benzoyl-ld-argininep-nitroanilide 2m NaCl, 10 mm benzamidine, pH 7.3), filtered on 0.45 μm. Immunoadsorption was carried out for 9 h with 150 ml of dialysate, after which the beads were washed successively with 130 ml of 1 times antibody binding buffer, 100 ml of 1.5% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and finally 130 ml of 1 times antibody binding buffer without benzamidine. Lithostathine is eluted with 0.2m glycine, pH 2.8, and concentrated with Vivaspin (Vivascience) at about 2 mg/ml. Samples were kept in this buffer at −20 °C before use to avoid aggregation. For electron microscopy, trypsination, or proteolysis studies, lithostathine was further purified on high performance liquid chromatography by passage through a Mono-S column (Pharmacia) as described previously (17Pignol D. Bertrand J.A. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Proteins. 1995; 23: 604-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to remove degradation products which might have formed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and finally stored at −80 °C. SDS-PAGE was performed on 15% polyacrylamide slab gels. Gels were then stained in 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as essentially described by Hochstrasser and Merril (18Hochstrasser D.F. Merril C.R. Appl. Theor. Electrophor. 1988; 1: 35-40PubMed Google Scholar) and Hochstrasser et al. (19Hochstrasser D.F. Harrington M.G. Hochstrasser A.C. Miller M.J. Merril C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with silver nitrate and scanned on a Personal Densitometer SI (50 μm/pixel, 12 bits/pixel, Molecular Dynamics) and subsequently analyzed on a workstation equipped with the Melanie II two-dimensional PAGE software (Bio-Rad) originally developed by Wilkinset al. (20Wilkins M.R. Sanchez J.C. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 496-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For proteolysis experiments, aliquots of lithostathine were withdrawn, directly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C before use. Molecular masses of the proteins were determined by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight) mass spectrometry. Spectra were recorded in linear mode with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager Elite, Perseptive Biosystems Inc.) equipped with a delayed extraction. External calibration was performed using the single and double charge ion of horse heart myoglobin. The samples were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, Aldrich) in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid as a matrix. Gels stained with R-250 were first incubated for 2 h in 50 mm boric acid, 0.1% SDS, pH 8, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) in 50 mm boric acid, 50 mm Trizma (Tris base) for 8 h at 35 V. The protein bands were then excised with a razor blade and peaks were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (Beckman 125S) on PR C8 reverse phase column (Perkin-Elmer). NH2-terminal sequencing were carried out on a Beckman LF 3000 protein sequencer. When necessary, reduction/alkylation were performed by standard procedures. QELS measurements were performed with a 5-watt argon-ion laser (Model 2017, Spectra Physics) and a SEM 633 goniometer coupled to a real time correlator RTG (Sematech) of 12 channels. The power of the laser ranged from 50 to 500 mW depending on protein concentration. The data were recorded at a scatterring angle of 90° to the incident laser beam and the sampling time was 0.8 μs. Lithostathine samples were analyzed at a constant temperature of 20 °C with a total volume of 100 μl. All proteins solution were dialyzed extensively against the buffers and prefiltered through a 0.45-μm syringe filters (LCR Millex, Millipore) to remove any dust particles that would alter the QELS measurements. Samples were then placed in a 12-mm diameter cylindrical flat bottom-glass cuvette which was immersed in a 80-mm diameter index-matching bath filled with 0.22-μm filtered methaxylene and thermostatted at 20 °C. Solvent density and viscosity were, respectively, taken equal to 1.002 and 1.3329, i.e. the water values. The experiments consist of measuring the time-dependent fluctuations of the scattered light intensity at a scattering vector, q=(4πn/λ)sin(θ/2)Equation 1 where n is the refractive index of the solution and θ the scattering angle. These fluctuations are described by the intensity of the autocorrelation function (ACF) determined by the method of cumulant analysis (21Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 4814-4820Crossref Scopus (2741) Google Scholar), Ln(ACF)=k0−k1t+k2t2Equation 2 where the first cumulant k 1 defines the diffusion coefficient (D) governing the initial decay of the autocorrelation function, k1=Dq2Equation 3 and k 2 is the standard deviation of the distribution. The polydispersity υ of the system is therefore determined by, υ=k2/(k1)2Equation 4 For monodisperse solutions of non-interacting particles, the polydispersity is theoretically equal to zero. For interacting and/or polydisperse particles, i.e. the existence of several types of aggregates, the polydispersity is high (υ > 6%), and the cumulant analysis gave only qualitative information on the molecules in solution. Therefore, to determine a particle size distribution, the QELS data were analyzed by an algorithm based on the singular system and exponential sampling method (22Ostrowsky N. Sornette D. Parker P. Pike E.R. Optica Acta. 1981; 28: 1059-1070Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, it must be borne in mind that, as the inversion of Laplace transform in photon correlation spectroscopy is an ill-posed problem, no single solution exists. The mean hydrodynamic radius (<R H>) was determined using the Stokes-Einstein equation, D0=kBT/6πηRHEquation 5 where k B is the Boltzmann constant,T the absolute temperature, and η the viscosity of the solution. Equilibrium sedimentation and sedimentation velocity were performed using a Beckman Model E ultracentrifuge equipped with an electronic speed control and a rotor temperature internal control. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were done in an AnD rotor at 52,000 rpm and 20 °C using the high-speed procedure (23Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Lithostathine samples were at 1.3 mg/ml in 0.1 m citrate-phosphate, pH 4, and overnight dialyzed against the same buffer before sedimentation equilibrium. Data were collected at 1-h intervals after equilibrium has been established, generally after 20 h, and the fringe displacement was read in the microcomparator. The distribution of a single, homogeneous species within the ultracentrifuge cell at equilibrium can be described by the following equation (derived from the Lamm equation), cr=cmeςEquation 6 where, ς=ω2M(1−νρ)(r2−rm2)/2RTEquation 7 in which c r and c m are the concentrations of the protein at radial position, r, and at a reference position, r m (i.e. the meniscus), respectively. M is the monomer molecular weight,ν the partial specific volume of lithostathine, equal to 0.718 ml/g, as calculated by the method of Lee and Timasheff (24Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar),ω the angular velocity, and R is the gas constant. Solvent density ρ was taken equal to 1.0. Sedimentation velocity experiments were done in 0.1 mphosphate-citrate, pH 4, at 60,000 rpm and 20 °C with protein concentrations ranging from 2 to 5 mg/ml. In experiments using Schlieren optics, two samples were loaded into double sector cells with regular and wedge windows in an AnD rotor. After reaching full centrifugation speed of 60,000 rpm, 10 data sets per run were collected at 4-min intervals. Profiles were recorded on Kodak films and the position of the maxima was measured in a Nikon microcomparator equipped with a digital display. The concentration dependence of the sedimentation coefficients was considered in terms of the standard equation, S=S°(1−gCT)Equation 8 where g is the hydrodynamic coefficient,C T the total concentration of protein expressed in mg/ml, and S° the sedimentation coefficient at zero protein concentration. A drop of 1 mg/ml lithostathine solution was applied to a Formvar-coated copper grid. After 60 s, the grid was dried with a filter paper and stained for 1 min in 1.5% (v/v) uranyl acetate. Specimens were then observed in a Jeol 1220 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Purified lithostathine was tested for trypsin-like activity with BApNA as a substrate and was compared with trypsin activity. Three purified lithostathine concentrations (1, 2, and 4 μm) and three trypsin concentrations (1, 5, and 10 nm) were tested. Experiments were performed at 37 °C in thermostated cuvettes. 30 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide was diluted 1:30 in 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, in a final volume of 1 ml to initiate the reaction (final BApNA concentration 1 mm).p-Nitroanilides liberated by tryptic or trypsin-like activity were measured with a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer at 410 nm at 2-min intervals over a 120-min period. Under these experimental conditions, linearity between p-nitroanilide accumulation and duration of incubation was maintained up to 120 min. Experimental points collected after an incubation time of 15 min were analyzed by linear regression and trypsin-like activity was calculated as the rate of A 410 nm min−1 compared with control without protein and converted to nanomolar min−1using an extinction coefficient for p-nitroanilide of ε410 nm = 8,800 m−1cm−1. Units for specific tryptic activity were expressed in micromole min−1 mg−1. The overall yield of lithostathine production from culture medium after purification onto an immunoaffinity column was about 1 mg/liter. As shown on Fig. 1 A, the recombinant lithostathine migrated as a single spot on two-dimensional PAGE after silver nitrate staining. This indicates the high homogeneity of lithostathine preparation. The apparent molecular mass estimated at 15,500 Da is in good agreement with the theoretical calculated value (16,275 Da). However, when purified from pancreatic juice, lithostathine exhibits several apparent molecular masses from 16 to 22 kDa in SDS-PAGE due to the presence of O-linked glycans attached to the Thr in position 5 (25De Reggi M. Capon C. Gharib B. Wieruszeski J.M. Michel R. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that recombinant lithostathine is not or slightly glycosylated. The pI estimated at 5.0 is slightly different from the theoretical value of 5.66. However, a discrepancy of about 0.5 pH unit is often observed for small proteins which display a low buffer capacity (26Wilkins M.R. Gooley A.A. Wilkins M.R. Williams K.L. Appel R.D. Hochstrasser D.F. Proteome Research: New Frontiers in Functional Genomics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1997: 35-64Google Scholar). By sedimentation equilibrium we determined the molecular weight of native recombinant lithostathine dialyzed overnight against 0.1m citrate-phosphate, pH 4. This gave a molecular weight of 16,200 ± 500 (n = 3) highly compatible with the theoretical monomer value (not shown). The sedimentation velocity experiments realized in 0.1 mm phosphate-citrate buffer, pH 4, demonstrated that lithostathine sedimented as a single and symmetrical peak at s20,w0 = 2.04 ± 0.06 S (Fig. 1 B). This reflects the high degree of homogeneity of the lithostathine preparation. The hydrodynamic non-ideality of lithostathine causes a negative dependence of the sedimentation coefficient s20,w0on protein concentration, which fits well to the equation, s°20,w=2.0×10−13(1−0.031×CT)Equation 9 QELS experiments have been undertaken because of their advantage of rapid analysis, without perturbation of the system, thereby facilitating the study of macromolecules in solution (27Lafont S.

Jurnak F.A. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 125-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TableI summarized the main parameters measured by these experiments. The mean diffusion coefficient (<D>) of lithostathine molecules, which is related to the motion of macromolecules in solution, is about 3 times higher at pH 4 than at pH 8 (1.6 versus 0.6 cm2 s−1). Since the more the diffusion coefficient is high, the more the protein is small, these results indicate that lithostathine forms aggregates at pH 8. Furthermore, <D> does not change with protein concentration (1.66 versus 1.47 cm2s−1 at pH 4 and 0.58 versus 0.55 cm2 s−1 at pH 8 for 6 and 9 mg/ml, respectively). This is well explained by the fact that, when polydispersity in high, small variations of attraction or repulsion between molecules are not detected. In addition, the polydispersity (υ) is about 1.5 times higher at basic than at acidic pH (about 70.4% versus 48.5% for 6 mg/ml and about 79.0%versus 53.1% for 9 mg/ml). Since monodispersity is established for υ < 6% (27Lafont S. Veesler S. Astier J.P. Boistelle R. J. Cryst. Growth. 1994; 143: 249-255Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it clearly indicates that lithostathine solutions are polydispersed. However, at acidic pH the values of the hydrodynamic radius <R H> at 6 and 9 mg/ml are about 1.3 nm whereas at basic pH, both values turn around 38 nm. The calculated ratio of <R H> at basic to acidic pH is about 28. Assuming the packing of spheres, this ratio means the existence of 283 ≈ 22,000 times more molecules in the aggregated forms at basic pH which is in good agreement with micrographs (see Fig. 4 B). Again, these values are independent of the protein concentration (1.28 versus 1.45 nm and 36.8 versus 39.1 nm) because of the high polydispersity of the system. In the presence of 7.5 mmCaCl2, the values for <D> and<R H > are between the values observed at acidic and basic pH. Furthermore, the polydispersity reaches about 90%. Although it seems to form smaller aggregates than at basic pH, this indicates that the system is also disturbed by the presence of CaCl2 and this could be due to re-arrangement of polymers.Table IInteraction parameters obtained from quasi-light scattering measurements of lithostathine solution at different pH and concentrationsBuffersProtein concentration<D>υ<R H>× 10 7 cm 2s −1%nm0.1 m Citrate/phosphate pH 46 mg/ml1.6648.50 ± 1.831.289 mg/ml1.4753.12 ± 3.021.4515 mm Tris, pH 86 mg/ml0.5870.38 ± 1.1436.809 mg/ml0.5578.96 ± 1.1739.1015 mm Tris pH 8 + 7.5 mmCaCl26 mg/ml0.9088.70 ± 2.5323.40After purification by immunoaffinity, lithostathine samples were extensively dialyzed against indicated buffer before subjected to QELS experiments.

This table summarizes the main parameters determined: <D> represents the mean diffusion coefficient, <R H> the mean hydrodynamic radius, and υ the polydispersity of the solution expressed. To gain better insight into the behavior of lithostathine in solution, we looked at the evolution of the particle size distribution (Fig.2). Whatever the conditions, various kinds of populations, those average size is indicated by their hydrodynamic diameter (D H)S.S., coexist in solution. However, a population of about 4.4 nm (6 mg/ml, Fig.2 A) or 5.2 nm (9 mg/ml, Fig. 2 C) is observed at acidic pH only. If we look at the overall shape of lithostathine structure determined by x-ray crystallography (4.5 × 3.0 × 2.5 nm, Ref. 35Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), this population most probably represents the monomers. The diffused intensity varies as the radius to the power of six. Therefore, for the same given intensity, the number of monomers is considerably larger than the polymers. For instance, in Fig.2 A, a population of 4.4 nm represents about 1.5 × 105 and 109 times more than the population of 32 and 140 nm, respectively. The same remarks apply to Fig.2 C. On the contrary, in all other conditions, monomers totally disappeared in aid of several types of aggregates (Fig. 2,B and D). Interestingly, in the presence of CaCl2 at pH 8 (Fig. 2 E), we observed a neopopulation around 7 nm which could be dimers. It therefore seems that Ca2+ ions could play the same role as protons at acidic pH. This observation corroborates the hypothesis of re-arrangement deduced from the data of Table I. In conclusion, our QELS measurements have shown that (i) lithostathine forms aggregates, (ii) the aggregates are of various sizes (polydispersity), and (iii) monomers are only observed at acidic pH. The electrophoretic pattern observed in Fig. 3 A showed that trypsin digestion lead to the transformation of lithostathine S2 into the S1 form as already described by Rouimi et al. (36Rouimi P. Bonicel J. Rovery M. De Caro A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 216: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the amount of soluble S1 is about 1.5 less than the total of lithostathine S2. This indicates that trypsination is concomitant with protein precipitation and the formation of fibrils as shown in Fig.3 B. The packing of homopolymeric fibrils lead to the formation of fibers which can reach about 2 μm in length and 50 nm in width (Fig. 3 B, left). They are made of very regular packing of several fibrils, about six most of the time (Fig. 3 B, right). These results confirm that the Arg11-Ile12 bond in lithostathine S2 is particularly susceptible to trypsin hydrolysis. Prolonged incubation time did not result in an increase trypsin digestion. This observation suggests that these polymers are resistant to proteolysis. To confirm that polymeric species exist prior"
https://openalex.org/W1840457436,"A major goal of gene therapy is to improve target specificity by delivering vectors through alternative cellular receptors. We previously reported that adenoviral vector delivery through basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) receptors enhances both cellular transduction and in vivo efficacy. We now present studies addressing the cellular pathways and mechanisms underlying these events. Cellular receptors for adenoviruses are not required for transduction by FGF2-retargeted vectors. Moreover, αV integrins can antagonize FGF2 retargeting, in contrast to their obligatory role in non-retargeted vector delivery. By contrast, high-affinity FGF receptors, which are overexpressed on potential tumor targets, are required for FGF2-retargeted transduction. Low-affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycan interactions, however, are not a prerequisite, in marked contrast to their obligatory role in FGF2 mitogenic signaling. By comparing receptor expression and ligand binding with transgene expression, we also demonstrate that FGF2 retargeting enhances transduction by mechanisms other than increasing the number of targeted cells. Rather, the use of alternative targeting ligands supports the conclusion that specific receptor interactions and intracellular events serve to enhance transgene expression. Together, these studies highlight the unique delivery and transduction pathways used by FGF2-retargeted adenoviruses, and help define the basis for their enhanced in vivo efficacy.—Doukas, J., Hoganson, D.

Eighteen amino acid substitutions have been identified in bacteriophage P22 coat protein that are defective in folding and cause their folding intermediates to be substrates for GroEL and GroES.

Additional amino acid residues that are critical to the folding process of P22 coat protein were identified by isolating second site suppressors of the tsf coat proteins. Suppressor substitutions isolated from the phage carrying the tsf coat protein substitutions included global suppressors, which are substitutions capable of alleviating the folding defects of numerous tsf coat protein mutants. In addition, potential global and site-specific suppressors were isolated, as well as a group of same site amino acid substitutions that had a less severe phenotype than the tsf parent. The global suppressors were located at positions 163, 166, and 170 in the coat protein sequence and were 8–190 amino acid residues away from the tsf parent. Although the folding of coat proteins with tsf amino acid substitutions was improved by the global suppressor substitutions, GroEL remained necessary for folding.

Therefore, we believe that the global suppressor sites identify a region that is critical to the folding of coat protein. The primary amino acid sequence of a polypeptide encodes all the information necessary to direct the folding pathway so that the final three-dimensional structure of a protein is achieved (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the code directs folding is not well understood. Deciphering the code for protein folding has implications for human health, as there are a number of diseases, such as the amyloid-based diseases, cystic fibrosis, and prion-like diseases, that have been related to the misfolding and aggregation of proteins (2Thomas P.J.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Additionally, recombinant DNA technologies utilized to produce valuable proteins, such as insulin, often have problems with inclusion body formation when those proteins are expressed in heterologous hosts (4Marston F.A.O.

Understanding how the amino acid sequence controls both folding and misfolding will allow us to understand how these diseases and other processes related to misfolding occur. The complex process of folding has been predominantly investigatedin vitro by following the refolding of purified polypeptide chains from the chemically or physically denatured state. Another valuable approach to understanding the nature of protein grammar has been through the use of genetic analysis. Site-directed and randomly induced mutations have revealed residues that are important for different functions, such as stability or activity of the protein (7Beasty A.M. Hurle M. Manz J.T. Stackhouse T. Matthews C.R. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 91-102Google Scholar, 8Goldenberg D.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Shortle D. J. Biol.

Residues of this type have been found in various proteins including tailspike protein of bacteriophage P22 (10Goldenberg D. King J. J. Mol.

Eighteen amino acid substitutions at seventeen different sites in P22 coat protein have been identified that render the production of viable phage temperature-sensitive (14Gordon C.L. King J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27236-27244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the chaperonins GroEL and GroES (17Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) have been shown to recognize and rescue a thermolabile folding intermediate (16Nakonechny W.S. Teschke C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27941-27951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro, the tsf amino acid substitutions do not destabilize the folded monomeric subunit because differential scanning calorimetry and denaturation by pressure or urea coat proteins with tsf substitutions have shown them to be as stable as WT coat protein (19Foguel D. Teschke C.M. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Silva J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,20Galisteo M.L. Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16595-16601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, Teschke (21Teschke C.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated that proteins with tsf amino acid substitutions display altered secondary and tertiary structure as well as increased surface hydrophobicity, which may explain the increased propensity of the folding intermediates with substitutions to aggregate, as they do in vivo. Based on these observations, a basic model for the folding of coat proteins is suggested (Fig.1). We envision the newly synthesized polypeptide forming an intermediate that at permissive temperature proceeds to an assembly-competent coat monomer, which, along with other bacteriophage proteins, proceeds to the mature virion. However, at the nonpermissive temperature, the tsf amino acid substitution creates an aggregation-prone intermediate that forms inclusion bodies. The suppressor substitution would prevent the tsf action. As phage P22 is amenable to genetic manipulation, we have isolated intragenic second site suppressors of the coat protein carrying tsf amino acid substitutions. Traditionally, a search of second site suppressors has been utilized to determine gene product interactions (22Jarvik J. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2738-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Moir D. Botstein D.B. Genetics. 1982; 100: 565-577PubMed Google Scholar, 24Han M. Aroian R.V. Sternberg P.W.

Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). However, in this case, a survey of second site suppressors of coat proteins with tsf amino acid substitutions could be expected to reveal interactions between residues in the affected folding intermediate, and not with proteins that interact with the tsf coat protein because the folding of coat protein into monomeric units normally proceeds without the interaction with other phage proteins (27Prevelige Jr., P.E. Thomas D. King J. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 824-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). If all the tsf substitutions affect the same intermediate in a folding pathway, a set of suppressor amino acid substitutions that stabilize the intermediate might be expected to be repeatedly isolated from several tsf coat protein mutants. Such amino acid substitutions would be known as global suppressors (28Shortle D. Lin B. Genetics. 1985; 110: 539-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intragenic global suppressors of folding mutants have been discovered in tsf mutants of P22 tailspike protein (29Fane B. Villafane R. Mitraki A. King J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 8801-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and destabilizing mutants of cytochromec (32McGee W.A. Nall B.T. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Alternatively, if the tsf amino acid substitutions do not affect the folding in the same way, it would be unlikely that the same suppressor sites would be isolated for several tsf coat protein mutants; instead, site-specific suppressors of tsf coat protein mutants would be isolated. Such suppressors have been found in tsf mutant phage of P22 tailspike protein (29Fane B. Villafane R. Mitraki A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11640-11648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Villafane R. Fleming A. Haase-Pettingell C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 137-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of P22 tailspike protein, both global and site-specific suppressors have been identified, suggesting that its folding intermediate can be stabilized in a variety of ways. Here, we have isolated intragenic second site suppressors of coat proteins that have tsf amino acid substitutions. We found three global suppressors in close proximity to one another that are capable of alleviating the folding defects of seven tsf coat proteins that are located 8–190 residues in the linear amino acid sequence away from its respective suppressor substitution. The majority of suppressor amino acid substitutions are still dependent on GroEL/S action. In addition, we have identified numerous same site and site-specific suppressors, as well as potential global suppressors. The global suppressors identify a region critical to proper folding of coat protein. The bacteria used for most of the experiments were derivatives of Salmonella typhimurium LT2. The amber suppressor minus host DB7136 (leuA414-am, hisC525-am) and its amber suppressor plus derivative DB7155 (leu A414-am, his C525-am, supE20-gln) have been described previously (34Winston R. Botstein D. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 433-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strains DB7000 (leuA414-am) and DB7155 were transformed with pOF39, which carries the groEL/S operon behind its own promoter (35Fayet O. Louarn J.M. Georgopoulous C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This plasmid conferred ampicillin resistance to the cells. TheEscherichia coli strains (36Georgopoulos C.P. Hendrix R.W.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1134-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) DW720 (WT groELand groES) and DW716 (groEL44) were transformed with the plasmid pPR1347 (38Neal B.L. Brown P.K. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7115-7118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encodes for the rfbgene cluster and rfc gene so that the E. colisynthesized the O antigen needed for P22. The plasmid conferred kanamycin resistance to the cells. All phage strains used in these experiments carried the c1-7 allele, which prevents lysogeny. The P22 bacteriophage used in this study were either WT in gene 5 or carried the tsf mutations in gene 5 that lead to 18 amino acid substitutions (14Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Luria broth was prepared as described by Life Technologies, Inc. and was used to support bacterial growth for plating experiments, preparation of phage stocks, and single step growth curve experiments. M9 medium was 0.6% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.05% NaCl, 0.01% NH4Cl. M9/Mg2+ medium was used for phage stock preparation and contained M9 with 2 mm MgCl2. Dilution fluid was used to dilute the phage stocks and contained 0.1% Tryptone, 0.7% NaCl, and 2 mm MgSO4 (15Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) A single fresh plaque was added to 30 ml of LB with logarithmically growing DB7136 cells and aerated by shaking at 30 °C until lysis occurred or a maximum of 6 h. Two to three drops of chloroform were added to ensure complete lysis of infected cells. Samples were chilled on ice for 15 min, and the cell debris was pelleted at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in a SL-50T Sorvall rotor. Phage in supernatant were pelleted by a 90-min centrifugation at 18,000 rpm in the SL-50T rotor. The pellets were drained and resuspended overnight in 2 ml of M9/Mg2+. A second 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm removed residual debris (15Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain independent revertants, plaques were isolated at the nonpermissive temperature for each phage carrying coat protein with a tsf amino acid substitution by plating approximately 106phage on each plate. Each plaque is an independent isolation of the tsf phage (33Villafane R. Fleming A. Haase-Pettingell C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 137-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fane B. King J. Genetics. 1991; 127: 263-277PubMed Google Scholar). Ten to 20 revertant plaques from each plate for each tsf allele were picked and purified three times by plating a single plaque sequentially. Phage stocks were prepared from one purified plaque at 30 °C. To screen the tsf revertants, PASA analysis (40Kwok S. Kellogg D.E. McKinney N. Spasic D. Gorda L. Levenson C. Sninsky J.J.

Pseudorevertants are mutants that retain the tsf amino acid substitution but have an additional substitution elsewhere. Phage stocks of concentrations 1010 to 1011 phage/ml were filter sterilized (Nalgene syringe filter, 0.2 μm syringe filter). Each 100-μl polymerase chain reaction (PCR) vessel contained 1 μl of sterile filtered phage stock (107 to 108 phage), 2.5 units of Amplitaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 200 μmeach nucleotide (Perkin-Elmer, Gene Amp dNTPs), 1× PCR Buffer II, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 pmol each of reverse primer and specific PASA primer (Table I). PCR vessels were exposed for 4 min at 94 °C, 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, followed by 30 s at annealing temperature (varying 70–80 °C), extension for 1 min at 72 °C, and finally 7 min at 72 °C, and then chilled to 4 °C in a Perkin-Elmer Gene Amp PCR system 2400. The optimal conditions for the various PASA-specific primers were determined by changing the annealing temperature. A reverse primer was synthesized to be complimentary to bases 6480–6459 (43Eppler K. Wykoff E. Goates J. Parr R. Casjens S. Virology. 1991; 183: 519-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and another primer was synthesized to be complementary to either the WT nucleotide sequence or to the tsf nucleotide sequence (Table I). The nucleotide numbering is based on the P22 DNA sequence in GenBankTM (accession number M59749). For primer descriptions, the first number represents the 5′-end of the primer and the last number represents the 3′-end of the primer.

Open table in a new tab PCR was utilized to amplify gene 5, which encodes coat protein, from bacteriophage stocks. One μl of filtered phage stock (107–108 phage) was amplified with final concentration of 2.5 units of high efficiency polymerase (Pwo DNA polymerase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals); 200 μmeach ATP, CTP, GTP, and TTP (deoxynucleoside triphosphate set, PCR grade, Roche Molecular Biochemicals); 1× PCR buffer with 0.2 mm MgSO4; and 50 pmol of each forward (14Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reverse primer (Table I). The PCR vessels were exposed to the same procedure as described above except that the annealing temperature was 55 °C. The amplified PCR product was purified using a high pure PCR purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). An agarose gel (1%) was used to determine quantity and purity of PCR-amplified product. The P22 packaging genes have been sequenced, including gene 5, which encodes coat protein (43Eppler K. Wykoff E. Goates J. Parr R. Casjens S. Virology. 1991; 183: 519-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine the sequence of the tsf pseudorevertants, Sequenase, Version 2.0, DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used following the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications. Nine μl of purified PCR product were denatured in the presence of 1 μl of sequencing primer (5–50 pmol/μl) (Table I) for 5 min at 100 °C. The samples were then cooled on ice for 5 min. Dithiothritol, diluted labeling mix (1:5), T7 Sequenase reaction buffer, [α-35S]dATP (NEN Life Science Products), and diluted T7 Sequenase were added to the ice-cold annealed DNA mixture. The reactants were mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Sequencing reactions were terminated by incubation at 45 °C for 5 min with the dideoxy nucleotides. The sequencing primer was selected based on the region of gene 5 to be sequenced (Table I). The reactions were heated to 80 °C prior to loading (4 μl) on a 6% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and 1× glycerol-tolerant gel buffer. GTG buffer was prepared at 20× and contained 1.78 m Tris, 0.57 m taurine, and 0.01m EDTA Na2·2H20, pH 8.9. The sequencing gel was dried and exposed to film (Biomax-MR Kodak) and developed the following day. Phage were either WT in coat protein, carried coat protein with tsf amino acid substitutions, or coat protein with tsf and suppressor amino acid substitutions (tsf/su). The phage were plated at various temperatures from 16 to 41 °C on S. typhimurium DB7136 or DB7155 with and without the plasmid pOF39 or on E. coli DW720 and DW716 strains with the plasmid pPR1347 (38Neal B.L. Brown P.K. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7115-7118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plating efficiencies were calculated by dividing the titer of the phage grown at each temperature by the titer produced when phage were grown at 22 °C on each bacterial strain (14Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Salmonella DB7136 host cells were infected at the nonpermissive temperature with WT phage, phage carrying coat protein with tsf amino acid substitutions, or the double tsf/su amino acid substitutions in coat protein, at a multiplicity of infection of 10. At times after infection, samples were lysed with chloroform and plated at permissive temperature (15Gordon C.L. King J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 427-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of phage produced per cell was calculated. Previously, a group of amino acid substitutions at multiple sites in P22 coat protein have been characterized that cause a tsf phenotype (14Gordon C.L. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9358-9368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These amino acid substitutions identify residues important for proper folding of coat protein. Suppressors of 18 tsf coat protein mutants have been isolated in order to determine the positions of additional amino acids crucial to stabilizing the folding intermediate(s) affected by the tsf amino acid substitutions. Here, we report the isolation of global suppressors of folding mutants in phage P22 coat protein. Over 260 independent revertants of 18 different phage carrying coat protein with a tsf amino acid substitution (Fig. 2) were isolated on S. typhimurium with and without increased GroEL/S levels at the nonpermissive temperature of the tsf parent phage. The reversion frequencies, which ranged from 10−5 to 10−7, were consistent with single nucleotide substitutions (data not shown). To determine whether the revertants were wild-type revertants or pseudorevertants, an analysis known as PASA, described in detail under “Experimental Procedures,” was used to discriminate between the two (40Kwok S. Kellogg D.E. McKinney N. Spasic D. Gorda L. Levenson C. Sninsky J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 41Sommer S.S. Groszbach A.R. Bottema C.D.K.

Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 388-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To confirm the results of PASA analysis, gene 5 of P22 was amplified, and the region corresponding to the original tsf nucleotide substitution was sequenced. Those suppressor mutants that retained the original tsf nucleotide substitution were further sequenced to identify the site of the suppressor nucleotide substitution. The location and identity of second site suppressors was determined by DNA sequence analysis. Intragenic suppressors were isolated from phage carrying the tsf coat protein substitutions A108V, D174N, D174G, S223F, S262F, G282D, T294I, D302G, P310A, G403D, F353L, Y411H, and P418S. While second site suppressors were isolated from the majority of these tsf coat proteins, four of the tsf mutant coat proteins only reverted to the WT amino acid. These mutants were W48Q, P238S, V297A, and V300A. The suppressors of the 14 remaining tsf mutant coat proteins were grouped into five categories: same site substitutions, site-specific suppressors, global suppressors, potential global suppressors, and extragenic suppressors. Intracodon nucleotide substitutions resulting in the change of the tsf substitution to another amino acid were found for D174N, D174G, S262F, D302G, and G403D and have been categorized as same site substitutions (Table II). In addition to these same site suppressors, there were a few suppressors that were found with only one tsf coat protein parent and at a low frequency, which we have categorized as site-specific suppressors (Table III). We also isolated one potential extragenic suppressor of G232D.Table IISame site substitutionsSame site substitutionParent tsf coat protein mutantaNumber in parentheses is the number of times the same site substitution was independently isolated from the tsf parent phage.Intracodon nucleotide substitutionbThe nucleotide preceding the position number is the WT nucleotide.

Open table in a new tab The majority of second site suppressors that were not categorized as site-specific or same site substitutions were found in the amino-terminal region of coat protein. The suppressor amino acid substitutions D163G, T166I, and F170L were independently isolated from seven tsf coat protein mutants, A108V, D174N, D174G, S223F, G282D, T294I, and F353L, and ranged from 8 to 190 in the linear amino acid sequence from the original tsf amino acid substitution (TableIV). These types of suppressors are described as a global suppressors as they were able to suppress the phenotype of multiple tsf parents. In addition, a group of potential global suppressors has been isolated. These suppressors have been categorized as such because the number of tsf parents from which the suppressors had been isolated was fewer than that of the global suppressors. A more extensive search may have found these suppressors to be global suppressors (Table V). In addition, two of the site-specific suppressors, D135H and A136"

Muscle relaxation is mediated by the removal of cytosolic Ca2+ by the Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The ATPase couples active Ca2+transport to the hydrolysis of ATP (1Andersen J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 47-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Mintz E. Guillain F. Biosci.

In an essential reaction step, ATP reacts with Asp-351 to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate (Ca2 E 1 → Ca2 E 1-P), which then converts from an ADP-sensitive form (Ca2 E 1-P) to an ADP-insensitive form (E 2-P) that is more rapidly hydrolyzed. This phosphoenzyme conversion is associated with Ca2+ release toward the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen against the concentration gradient (1Andersen J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

The structural origin of the change of accessibility of the Ca2+ sites and of the essential reduction of Ca2+ affinity upon phosphoenzyme conversion Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P have yet to be elucidated.

Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and in that work were calculated by subtracting two difference spectra obtained with two different types of samples; a normalized difference spectrum of the Ca2 E 1 → Ca2 E 1-P reaction was subtracted from a normalized difference spectrum of the Ca2 E 1 →E 2-P reaction. The use of two different samples in the subtraction and the normalization to identical protein content limit the reliability of these spectra and make it desirable to obtain the phosphoenzyme conversion spectrum more directly. This is possible using time-resolved rapid scan Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 1The abbreviations used are: FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; Ca2+-ATPase, Ca2+transporting ATPase (EC 3.6.1.38); caged ATP, P 3-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyladenosine 5′-triphosphate; Ca2 E 1-P, ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme; E 2-P, ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme; νs, symmetric stretching vibration; νas, antisymmetric stretching vibration spectroscopy (10Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we present here the spectra of the phosphoenzyme conversion reaction obtained in H2O and2H2O after the release of unlabeled ATP or [γ-18O3]ATP. In particular, bands of the putative Ca2+ chelating carboxylate groups and of the phosphoenzyme phosphate group are discussed. Samples for time-resolved infrared spectroscopy of the Ca2 E 1 P →E 2-P reaction were prepared as described previously (8Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) by removal of free water from a sarcoplasmic reticulum suspension equilibrated in H2O or2H2O buffer. Samples were immediately rehydrated with H2O or 2H2O with or without 20% Me2SO. This method resulted in active ATPase samples (6Barth A. Mäntele W. Kreutz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Approximate concentrations were 0.7 mm ATPase, 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mmCaCl2, 20 mm glutathione, 20 mmcaged ATP, 0.5 mg/ml A23187, 2 mg/ml adenylate kinase, and 20% Me2SO in approximately 1 μl of sample volume. Approximately 2–3 mm ATP was released per flash. Caged [γ-18O3]ATP at 91% isotopic enrichment per oxygen atom was a gift of M. R. Webb and J. E. T. Corrie (National Institute for Medical Research, London). Time-resolved FTIR measurements of the Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P reaction were performed at 1 °C with a modified Bruker IFS 66 spectrometer as described previously (10Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Difference spectra for the reaction were obtained by subtracting a spectrum representing predominantly Ca2 E 1-P, and to a small extentE 2-P (recorded 3.3–11 s after photolysis of caged ATP in H2O or after 11–19 s in2H2O), from a spectrum representingE 2-P (recorded after 88 and 146 s in H2O and 2H2O, respectively). The resulting spectrum was normalized as described (10Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to the full amplitude of the absorbance changes associated with the phosphoenzyme conversion reaction. As the difference spectra were obtained directly from the time-resolved measurements, a normalization of spectra to an identical protein concentration is in principle not necessary. However, for a better comparison of samples in H2O and2H2O and to prevent the possible predominance of individual samples with high protein content in the averaged spectra, spectra were normalized to an identical protein concentration before averaging, as described (21Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Absorbance spectra in H2O and 2H2O of the model compound for Ca2+ release EDTA were recorded with and without Ca2+ at 20 °C and pH 12.8. Small variations in the path length between different samples were corrected by normalizing the water absorption of every sample to a single water spectrum that served as a standard for the path length. Sample concentrations were 84 mm. Apart from second-derivative spectra, the following procedure was applied. The original spectrum was smoothed over 24 cm−1 and multiplied by 0.95. This spectrum was then subtracted from the original spectrum, which eliminates broad features of the original spectrum. The resulting spectrum is dominated by the fine-structure in the original spectrum, and thus we term the method “fine-structure enhancement” in the following text. When tested with protein absorbance spectra, this method gives results similar to Fourier self-deconvolution (data not shown). For a clearer presentation, fine- structure enhanced spectra were multiplied by 10 and second-derivative spectra by −15. To assess whether peaks in the fine-structure enhanced spectra correspond to “true” component bands or are the result of artifacts in the band-narrowing procedure (see Fig. 3), the original difference spectra were fitted, and the resulting fit was fine-structure enhanced and compared with the fine-structure enhanced original spectra (data not shown). Interestingly, it was found that the spectral region of 1700–1670 cm−1 can accurately be fitted by only three bands at 1693 (−), 1686 (−), and 1670 cm−1 (+) despite the plateau at 1678/1676 cm−1 in the fine-structure enhanced H2O spectrum (solid line in Fig.3 B). It is not necessary to introduce an additional band in the fitting model to reproduce that plateau. From site-directed mutagenesis studies it is thought that Glu-309, Glu-771, and Asp-800 form part of the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites of Ca2 E 1 and Ca2 E 1-P (4Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, we studied the effect of Ca2+ binding on the infrared spectrum of carboxylate groups using the Ca2+ chelator EDTA. Fig. 1 A shows absorbance spectra in 2H2O of free EDTA (solid line) and of the EDTA complex with Ca2+ (dotted line). The bands near 1590 and 1410 cm−1 can be assigned to the COO− antisymmetric stretching vibration (νas) and the symmetric stretching vibration (νs), respectively. The shoulder at 1612 cm−1 indicates some heterogeneity of the COO−groups, resulting from a small proportion of EDTA with protonated nitrogen atoms (22Sawyer D.T. Tackett J.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 314-316Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Nakamoto K. Morimoto Y. Martell A.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 309-313Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+ release there is a downshift of 4–8 cm−1 for both of the main bands (at 1590 and 1414 cm−1), which translates in the difference spectrum of Ca2+ release (absorbance of free EDTA minus absorbance of the Ca2+ complex) into the two minimum/maximum features at 1590/1568 and 1418/1400 cm−1. When 2H2O is replaced by H2O, the bands of the antisymmetric stretching vibration are downshifted by 6–8 cm−1 for free EDTA and for the complex (data not shown). The band of the symmetric stretching vibration is less sensitive and shifts downwards only for free EDTA (by 2 cm−1). A similar behavior has been observed for sodium acetate (24Tackett J.E. Appl. Spectrosc. 1989; 43: 483-489Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and for Asp and Glu (25Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 26Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Thus, the model spectra have identified marker band pairs for Ca2+ release from carboxylate groups near 1575 and 1410 cm−1. The former is expected to be sensitive to H2O → 2H2O replacement with a higher frequency in 2H2O. Fig.2 A shows the difference spectrum of the phosphoenzyme conversion and Ca2+ release reaction, Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P (solid line), and the respective spectrum in 2H2O buffer (dashed line). Positive bands are characteristic forE 2-P, negative bands for Ca2 E 1-P. Fig.3 A shows the same spectra on an expanded scale. In the phosphoenzyme conversion spectrum, similar band profiles are observed as in the model difference spectrum for Ca2+ release (Fig.1 B) at 1570/1554 and 1411/1399 cm−1 (numbers for H2O). The slight upshift upon H2O →2H2O exchange characteristic for the νas vibration of carboxylate groups (see above) is also notable (1570 → 1572 cm−1, 1554 → 1555 cm−1) and is best seen in Fig. 3 A. However, the shift is less than that observed above for completely exposed carboxylate groups. The lower wavenumber of the 1570/1554 cm−1 band pair as compared with the model spectra (1586/1556 cm−1 in H2O and 1590/1568 cm−1 in 2H2O) is expected because the νas(COO−) band position of free Asp and Glu residues (25Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 26Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) is 2–4 cm−1 (Asp) and 18 cm−1 (Glu) lower than that of EDTA (in H2O and2H2O). These observations support and substantiate the tentative assignment of the band pairs at 1570/1554 and 1411/1399 cm−1 (numbers for H2O) to Ca2+ chelating residues of the ATPase (8Barth A. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The relatively small shift observed for the 1570/1554 cm−1 band pair in2H2O may indicate that these groups are not completely exposed to water. The band at 1638 cm−1 also shows the upshift characteristic of a νas(COO−) band upon H2O → 2H2O replacement (best seen in Fig. 3 A). Other bands absorbing in that region,i.e. the amide I mode of β-sheet structures, and side chain modes of His, Arg, and Lys should either show downshifts of about 10 cm−1 (backbone and His) (26Chirgadze Y.N.

Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and 400 cm−1 (Lys) (31Pinchas S. Laulicht I. Infrared Spectra of Labelled Compounds. Academic Press, London1971: 133-136Google Scholar) or should remain unchanged if the respective groups are inaccessible to 1H → 2H exchange. The position of the 1638 cm−1band is rather unusual for a νas band of a COO− group, which absorbs for model compounds in aqueous solution at 1574 cm−1 (Asp) or at 1560 cm−1(Glu) (25Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). However, a strong salt bridge or hydrogen bond to one of the oxygens of a carboxylate group could shift the band well above 1600 cm−1 (24Tackett J.E. Appl. Spectrosc. 1989; 43: 483-489Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 32Deacon G.B. Phillips R.J. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1980; 33: 227-250Crossref Scopus (4841) Google Scholar), and a reasonable scenario for the band at 1638 cm−1 could be that the parting Ca2+ is replaced by a strong hydrogen bond donor or a positive charge. Bands at 1758 and 1710 cm−1 have tentatively been assigned to the protonation of at least two chelating carboxylate groups (33Barth A. Mäntele W. Kreutz W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25507-25510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is in line with the small downshift observed upon H2O → 2H2O replacement. The largest absorbance changes (up to 0.5% of the total protein absorbance) are observed in the amide I region of the spectrum (1700–1610 cm−1) as are the strongest effects of protein deuteration. In this region, the amide I mode of the polypeptide backbone as well as the side chains of Asn, Gln, Arg, HisH+, and Lys absorb strongly (25Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 26Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 30Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the lower wavenumber part of that region, Asp and Glu COO− groups with strong interactions may contribute as discussed above. Large downshifts (≥30 cm−1) of bands upon H2O → 2H2O replacement are characteristic for the side chain absorptions of Asn, Gln, Lys, and Arg, as are small upshifts as discussed above for COO− bands and downshifts of up to 10 cm−1 for amide I and HisH+ bands. No band shifts are expected for groups that are located in parts of the protein that are not accessible to deuteration. The large number of alterations in this spectral region, when H2O is replaced by 2H2O, makes it difficult to arrive at a unique explanation for the band shifts, and additional experiments as well as data processing were necessary, as described below. The recording of spectra as soon as possible after H2O →2H2O replacement (30 min to 1 h at 1 °C) shows that most of the observed effects take place in protein regions readily accessible to deuteration. The spectrum shortly after deuteration (data not shown) is very similar to the one after prolonged incubation. The only clear exception is the minimum at ∼1630 cm−1 that develops over a few hours of incubation. This position is characteristic of amide I modes of β-sheet structures and of the C=O group of deuterated Asn or Gln residues (26Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Band-narrowing procedures (see “Materials and Methods”) were applied to identify band shifts upon 1H → 2H exchange. Fig. 3 A shows the original difference spectra and Fig. 3, B and C, the resulting spectra after band narrowing. These reveal essentially the same peak positions in H2O and 2H2O (see Fig. 3,B and C), with one exception. The negative band at 1689 cm−1 in the unprocessed original H2O spectrum (solid line in Fig. 3 A) is composed of at least two bands, giving minima in the processed spectrum at 1693 and 1685 cm−1 (solid line in Fig. 3, Band C). The highest wavenumber component of the negative band seems to be nearly unaffected by protein deuteration and is observed in 2H2O at 1692 cm−1. It could be caused by a conformational change of β-sheet or turn structures or an Asn, Gln, or Arg side chain that is located in the core of the protein and is inaccessible to deuteration. The other component of the 1689 cm−1 band seems to shift from its position in the processed spectrum (Fig. 3 B) at 1685 (H2O) to 1677 cm−1(2H2O) and to cancel part of the adjacent positive band observed at 1671 cm−1 in H2O (Fig. 3 A). This shift is characteristic of amide I modes of the polypeptide backbone, and the position then indicates a conformational change of β-sheet or turn structures. These structures are predicted to occur only in the extramembraneous domains of the protein (34Green N.M. Taylor W.R. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. CIBA Found. Symp. 1986; 122: 93-114PubMed Google Scholar, 35Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), and thus the observed conformational change is likely to take place in these protein domains. As the positions of the other bands in the amide I region are hardly affected by deuteration, the isotope effects are the result either of intensity changes or of bands that are not evident after applying the band-narrowing procedures because they are broader than the ones detected. Narrow bands tend to dominate the processed spectra. The bands hardly affected by 1H → 2H exchange are found at 1653, 1638, 1621, and 1607 cm−1. A band at 1653 cm−1 is often observed for α-helical structures and is often hardly affected by H2O→2H2O replacement as observed here. The band at 1638 cm−1, which shifts slightly upward, was tentatively assigned above to a COO− group. The bands at 1621 and 1607 cm−1 seem to retain their position in2H2O with a possible overlap of additional bands in H2O or 2H2O. The band at 1621 cm−1 may be assigned to a β-sheet structure or to the imide group of a Pro residue in a helical or unordered conformation. The imide band is found approximately 20 cm−1 lower than an amide band (36Doyle B.B. Traub W. Lorenzi G.P. Blout E.R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3052-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the band at 1607 cm−1, the position of which seems to be too low for an amide I band, could also be caused by a Pro imide group. Interestingly, there are three Pro residues in the putative Ca2+ binding transmembrane helices M4 and M6, mutation of which affects Ca2+ affinity and phosphoenzyme conversion (4Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alternatively, both bands may be caused by COO− side chain groups not interacting with bulk water. This assumption relies on the fact that the bands do not show the upshift upon H2O → 2H2O replacement characteristic for carboxylate groups in water. None of the three bands in the amide II region (1570–1530 cm−1) shows the strong sensitivity toward 1H → 2H exchange expected for the amide II mode of the protein backbone. The amide II mode of backbone elements accessible to deuteration therefore does not seem to be affected by phosphoenzyme conversion and Ca2+release. Two of the bands (at 1570 and 1554 cm−1) have been tentatively attributed above to the νas vibration of COO− groups. The amide III mode absorbs between 1400 and 1200 cm−1 and is sensitive to deuteration (37Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Hilderson H.J. Ralston G.B. Subcellular Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1994: 329-362Google Scholar). This property is observed in the spectra for the bands at 1337 and 1318 cm−1 (see Fig. 2 A), which therefore might be attributed to amide III modes. The position of these bands is characteristic for turn structures (37Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Hilderson H.J. Ralston G.B. Subcellular Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1994: 329-362Google Scholar), and they are probably related to the amide I band at 1687 cm−1, which has tentatively been assigned to turn or β-sheet structures. Alternatively, the bands at 1337 and 1318 cm−1 may be caused by the δ(COH) mode of Ser, Asp, or Glu with a weakly bonded OH group. As mentioned above, bands of the side chains of Asn, Gln, Arg, and Lys in the amide I region show relatively large shifts upon deuteration. The extinction coefficient of the former three residues is relatively high (25Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 26Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), whereas that of Lys is smaller. Thus, Lys bands may be masked by stronger bands. The HisH+ mode near 1631 cm−1(30Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) shows a 10 cm−1 downshift in2H2O (26Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and absorbs relatively strongly in H2O (30Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These characteristic shifts have not been observed in the spectra, and thus there is no clear evidence for the participation of Asn, Gln, Arg, and HisH+ in the phosphoenzyme conversion and Ca2+ release reaction. This statement holds only for those residues that are accessible to1H → 2H exchange, which should include residues in the ATP binding site, the catalytic site, and at least part of the Ca2+ binding sites, because several bands that were tentatively assigned to the Ca2+ binding sites show an effect upon H2O → 2H2O replacement (see above). The position of the band at 1517 cm−1 and its slight downshift of 2 cm−1 in 2H2O is characteristic for a ring mode of protonated Tyr (25Venyaminov S.Y. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 26Chirgadze Y.N. Fedorov O.V. Trushina N.P. Biopolymers. 1975; 14: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 30Hienerwadel R. Boussac A. Breton J. Diner B. Berthomieu C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14712-14723Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Also, the band pairs at 1283 and 1264 cm−1 may be attributed to the ν(C-O) mode of Tyr but also to a Trp mode, which is observed for indole at 1276 cm−1 (38Lautié A. Lautié M.F. Gruger A. Fakhri S.A. Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Spectrosc. 1980; 36: 85-94Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39Takeuchi H. Harada I. Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Spectrosc. 1986; 42: 1069-1078Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Tyr-763 is involved in the cytoplasmic gate to the Ca2+binding sites (4Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The very small band at 1365 cm−1 might be caused by a δs(CH3) mode of aliphatic side chains. Fig. 2 B shows a comparison between the conversion spectrum obtained with unlabeled ATP and that obtained with [γ-18O3]ATP. With the heavier isotope, phosphate bands are expected to be down-shifted, thereby enabling the identification in the spectrum of alterations to the phosphate group. As the γ-phosphate is transferred to Asp-351 before phosphoenzyme conversion, differences between the spectra with the two isotopes will identify the absorbance of the phosphoenzyme phosphate group. As expected, the two spectra superimpose very well above 1250 cm−1, where phosphate groups do not absorb. However, the band at 1192 cm−1 is reduced upon isotopic substitution. Instead, the intensity is higher for [γ-18O3]ATP between 1180 and 1150 cm−1. A difference spectrum between labeled and unlabeled phosphate group (data not shown) shows that the band at 1192 cm−1 for the unlabeled phosphate seems to shift to 1157 cm−1 for the labeled phosphate, in agreement with the expected isotopic shift of 20–30 cm−1 for phosphate groups (18Barth A. Hauser K. Mäntele W. Corrie J.E.T. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10311-10316Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Takeuchi H. Murata H. Harada I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 392-397Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This identification of a phosphate band in the difference spectrum clearly shows that the conversion reaction considerably changes the environment of the phosphoenzyme phosphate group, thus affecting its electron density distribution and/or binding geometry. The band position at 1192 cm−1 is rather unusual for a phosphate group and could be explained in two ways: (i) a widening of the P–O angles leading to a stronger coupling between the P–O vibrations and thus to a stronger splitting between the νas and νs modes; or (ii) an increase in electron density of some or all of the P–O bonds, either by breaking of the hydrogen bonds to all phosphate oxygens or by strong hydrogen binding to one or two of the phosphate oxygen atoms, thus increasing the electron density in the other P–O bond(s). The band is also affected by H2O → 2H2O replacement, which seems to indicate that the phosphate oxygen interacts with either a water molecule or deuterated protein residues. The active site of E 2-P was shown to be in a closed conformation (41Highsmith S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) shielded from bulk water with a hydrophobic environment detected close to the ribose OH groups of a fluorescent ATP analogue (42Dupont Y. Pougeois R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Nakamoto R.K. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is in contrast to the properties of Ca2 E 1-P, and it is thought that the decrease in the active site water activity upon the Ca2 E 1-P →E 2-P conversion is responsible for the higher hydrolysis rate of E 2-P as compared with Ca2 E 1-P (44De Meis L.

The infrared spectra presented here show that this conformational change has a direct effect on phosphate conformation and/or electron density distribution. Creation of a hydrophobic environment alone however, may not be sufficient to explain the phosphate band at 1192 cm−1, because dehydration of the model compound acetyl phosphate shifts the νas PO32− band only from 1132 to 1177 cm−1 at most (data not shown). Fig.4 shows spectra in2H2O of ATPase phosphorylation Ca2 E 1·ATP → Ca2 E 1-P (solid line) (21Barth A. Mäntele W. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 538-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and of the overall reaction of phosphorylation and phosphoenzyme conversion Ca2 E 1·ATP →E 2-P (dotted line). These spectra were obtained from time-resolved measurements of the same set of samples. Negative bands are characteristic for Ca2 E 1·ATP, positive bands either for Ca2 E 1-P (solid line) or E 2-P (dotted line). (The spectrum of Ca2 E 1·ATP → Ca2 E 1-P also shows a small contribution because of the E 2-P that is already formed, as indicated by the E 2-P marker band near 1750 cm−1.) The spectral region shown includes the amide I region (1700–1610 cm−1) that is sensitive to conformational changes of the protein backbone. The comparison indicates that bands characteristic for Ca2 E 1-P are still present inE 2-P, which is especially obvious for the bands at 1682, 1630, and 1593 cm−1. This finding indicates that at least some of the alterations to the protein conformation induced by ATPase phosphorylation seem to be preserved or even “enhanced” in the subsequent transition to E 2-P. It seems as if the enzyme conformation on the way from Ca2 E 1-P toE 2-P goes further away from the pre-phosphorylation conformation of Ca2 E 1·ATP instead of returning to it. Infrared difference spectra show that the protein conformation changes in the phosphoenzyme conversion reaction, preserving conformational changes of the preceding step of enzyme phosphorylation. β-sheet or turn structures of the extramembraneous domains and most likely α-helical structures seem to be affected. The net change of secondary structures, however, is small (10Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mäntele W. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1841898142,"The major facilitative glucose transporters in muscle, GLUT1 (insulin-independent) and GLUT4 (insulin-dependent), are essential for normal growth and metabolism, but factors controlling their expression during postnatal development are poorly understood. We have therefore determined the role of energy status in regulating muscle GLUT gene expression and function in young, growing pigs on a high (H) or low (L) food intake (H =2L) at 35 degrees C or 26 degrees C. RNase protection assays revealed selective up-regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT4 by mild undernutrition 20-24 h after feeding: mRNA levels were elevated in longissimus dorsi (P<0.001) and rhomboideus (P<0.05), but not in diaphragm or cardiac muscles. Assessment of 2-deoxy-glucose uptake in a small isolated muscle, flexor carpi radialis, showed that the 26L group, which had suboptimal energy balance and the greatest GLUT4 expression, had the highest insulin-independent glucose uptake but the lowest insulin-dependent increment: 20% compared with 70% in the other groups. These novel findings are directly relevant to an understanding of mechanisms underlying the development of insulin resistance and demonstrate 1) muscle-specific up-regulation of GLUT gene expression by postnatal undernutrition that is not related simply to myofiber type, but to whole-body function; and 2) that the degree of GLUT up-regulation and the subcellular distribution and function of GLUT proteins are dependent on energy status."
https://openalex.org/W1880070391,"Ductus arteriosus intimal cushion formation is characterized by fibronectin-dependent smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration. Enhanced fibronectin synthesis in ductus SMC is regulated by the interaction of LC-3, a microtubule-associated protein, with an AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3'-untranslated region of fibronectin mRNA, facilitating its recruitment to polyribosomes for translation. Since nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in posttranscriptional gene regulation and is produced in the ductus, we investigated its mechanistic role in LC-3-mediated fibronectin synthesis. NO production was sevenfold higher in ductus vs. aortic SMC (P<0.005) associated with increased neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) expression. The NOS inhibitor L-NMMA decreased fibronectin synthesis by approximately 45-50% (P<0.05), whereas the NO donor, SNAP, increased ductus fibronectin synthesis approximately onefold (P<0.05); neither agent altered fibronectin mRNA levels. Immunoblotting revealed that SNAP increased and L-NMMA reduced a membrane-associated phosphorylated form of LC-3. RNA gel mobility shift assays confirmed that NO enhanced LC-3 binding to the fibronectin mRNA ARE. Our studies indicate a tissue-specific program in the ductus arteriosus whereby elevated nNOS expression and NO production regulate the posttranscriptional increase in fibronectin synthesis required for SMC motility."
https://openalex.org/W2043538831,"Thin filament-mediated regulation of striated muscle contraction involves conformational switching among a few quaternary structures, with transitions induced by binding of Ca2+ and myosin. We establish and exploitSaccharomyces cerevisiae actin as a model system to investigate this process. Ca2+-sensitive troponin-tropomyosin binding affinities for wild type yeast actin are seen to closely resemble those for muscle actin, and these hybrid thin filaments produce Ca2+-sensitive regulation of the myosin S-1 MgATPase rate. Yeast actin filament inner domain mutant K315A/E316A depresses Ca2+ activation of the MgATPase rate, producing a 4-fold weakening of the apparent Ca2+ affinity and a 50% decrease in the MgATPase rate at saturating Ca2+concentration. Observed destabilization of troponin-tropomyosin binding to actin in the presence of Ca2+, a 1.4-fold effect, provides a partial explanation. Despite the decrease in apparent MgATPase Ca2+ affinity, there was no detectable change in the true Ca2+ affinity of the thin filament, measured using fluorophore-labeled troponin. Another inner domain mutant, E311A/R312A, decreased the MgATPase rate but did not change the apparent Ca2+ affinity.

Cardiac and striated muscle contraction are regulated by conformational changes in the thin filament, which comprises F-actin, tropomyosin, and troponin. Troponin has three subunits: troponin C, which serves as the Ca2+ sensor for the system; troponin I, which inhibits myosin cycling; and troponin T, which binds to tropomyosin, troponin I, troponin C, and F-actin (reviewed in Refs.1Tobacman L.S.

The inhibited or blocked state occurs in the absence of Ca2+ and allows tropomyosin and troponin to inhibit actin-myosin binding and cycling (4McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys.

The Ca2+ state, alternatively viewed as closed or permissive, occurs upon Ca2+ binding to troponin C. It involves tropomyosin movement and possibly other conformational changes, and results in improved myosin binding to the thin filament. The active or open state corresponds to a final shift in the position of the regulatory proteins, which allows myosin to bind strongly to F-actin. This state appears to be required for cross-bridge cycling (4McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar,5Vibert P. Craig R.

Average tropomyosin positions relative to actin have been proposed based on three-dimensional reconstructions using electron micrographs of thin filaments or x-ray diffraction of oriented filaments (6Lehman W.

Only indirect methods such as cross-linking and peptide NMR have been able to suggest where troponin might interact with F-actin (15Levine B.A. Moir A.J.G. Perry S.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Three model systems have been used to generate actin mutants to examine the interactions of actin with myosin and with the regulatory proteins. Actin from the indirect flight muscle of Drosophila provides useful in vivo information as well as the potential for genetically-derived insights (16Molloy J. Kreuz A. Miller R. Tansey T. Maughan D.

Although S. cerevisiae actin has the lowest homology to mammalian muscle actin of these two systems, it is still a relatively high 88% (28Gallwitz D. Sures I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Miller C.J. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16566-16572Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In a study of in vivo effects of mutagenesis, Wertman et al. (30Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) conducted a “clustered charged-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis” inS. cerevisiae, systematically changing groups of two or more charged residues in the actin sequence to alanines. Previous studies suggest that charged residue interactions are important for tropomyosin and troponin binding to actin (8Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Levine B.A. Moir A.J.G. Perry S.V. Eur. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29457-29461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this series of mutants provides a method to test the actin surface for sites of interaction with the regulatory proteins. The present paper employs yeast actin to examine troponin-tropomyosin function. Despite the sequence differences between yeast actin and mammalian muscle actin, tropomyosin and troponin are shown both to bind to yeast actin and to regulate the actin-myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) 1The abbreviations used are: myosin S-1, myosin subfragment 1; DTT, dithiothreitol; dibromo-BAPTA, [1,2-bis -(2-amino-5-bromophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid] tetrasodium salt; 5-nitro-BAPTA, [1,2-bis-(2-amino-5-nitrophenoxy)ethane-N, N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid] tetrasodium salt; IAANS, 2-(4′-iodoacetamidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt; IANBD, 4-(N-iodoacetoxyethyl-n-methyl)-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; tropomyosin-troponinIANBD, tropomyosin-troponin labeled with IANBD ATPase rates in a Ca2+-sensitive manner, very similar to previous results for muscle actin. Charged actin side chains between residues 309 and 326 located in subdomain 3 have been hypothesized by Lorenz et al. (8Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to interact with tropomyosin. Using the charged residue to alanine actin mutants, the present work shows this region to be important in tropomyosin-troponin function. Bovine cardiac tropomyosin, whole troponin as well as the separate subunits troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T were all purified from ether powder using the method of Tobacman and Lee (32Tobacman L.S. Lee R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4059-4064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin S-1 was obtained from rabbit fast skeletal muscle using the method of Weeds and Taylor (33Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Rabbit fast skeletal muscle tropomyosin-troponin was prepared from ether powder using the method as described (34Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant α-tropomyosin, which is unacetylated, was obtained according to Willadsen, et al.(35Willadsen K.A. Butters C.A. Hill L.E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23746-23752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant yeast strains were obtained as a gift from Dr. Drubin's laboratory and were grown to stationary phase in YPD medium at 30 °C for mutant K315A/E316A or 25 °C for mutant E311A/R312A (30Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type actin was obtained from a bakery as cakes of Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, since its sequence is identical to the S. cerevisiae actin and it can be obtained in large quantities (20Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was purified from the wild type and mutant strains using the method from Cook et al. (20Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-actin was polymerized by adding either 3 mm MgCl2 or 2 mmMgCl2 with 50 mm KCl. Polymerization by either solution gave the same results. Bovine cardiac tropomyosin or recombinant α-tropomyosin was labeled at Cys-190 with [3H]iodoacetate (36Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12867-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Conditions and protein concentrations are described in figure legends. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm using a TLA100 rotor (Beckman) for 30 min at 25 °C. The radioactivity of the supernatant was compared with the total radioactivity of the reaction mixture before centrifugation. The McGee-von Hippel equation (34Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A.

Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar), which describes the binding of an extended ligand to a linear lattice, was used to fit the data. K o represents the affinity of one ligand for an isolated binding site, and yis a measure of the cooperativity that arises when two ligands bind to adjacent sites. K app is given by the productK o y, with 50% saturation of actin occurring when the tropomyosin or tropomyosin-troponin concentration equals 1/K o y. Myosin S-1 ATPase activity was measured using the method described by Pollard and Korn (38Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions used were: 25 °C, 7 μm F-actin (either wild type or mutant), 1 μm rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin S-1, 1.2 μm bovine cardiac tropomyosin, 1.2 μm bovine cardiac troponin, 5 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm of either 5,5′-dibromo-BAPTA or 5′-nitro-BAPTA (Molecular Probes). As the concentration of CaCl2 was varied to alter the free Ca2+, the KCl concentration was adjusted to keep the ionic strength constant at 21.5 mm. Six time points were taken at 2-min intervals. The data were corrected for background myosin S-1 ATPase activity. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated using the dissociation constant for 5,5′-dibromo-BAPTA under these conditions, 1 × 106m−1 (39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In half of the experiments, 5′-nitro-BAPTA was used instead because it has a weaker Ca2+ affinity, which facilitates exploration of a higher range of free Ca2+ concentrations. The dissociation constant for 5′-nitro-BAPTA was determined by spectrophotometric titration at 25 °C using the above buffer conditions by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340 nm upon the addition of Ca2+. The data from each titration were fit to a binding equation with a single dissociation constant. The titration was repeated four times, and the average dissociation constant, 6.5 ± 0.4 μm, was used to determine the free Ca2+in the ATPase assays, under these buffer conditions. Using either of the [1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid]-derived chelators gave similar results. The free Ca2+ concentration was also corrected for the CaCl2 already included in the actin buffer. The MgATPase data were fit to Equation 12 derived in Tobacman and Sawyer (39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which describes cooperative Ca2+ binding to a linear array of sites. Bovine cardiac troponin C was labeled with 2-(4′-iodoacetamidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt (IAANS, Molecular Probes) and reconstituted with troponin I and troponin T following the procedure by Tobacman and Sawyer (39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence Ca2+ titrations were performed under the following conditions: 25 °C, 7 μm F-actin (either wild type or mutant), 2 μm bovine cardiac tropomyosin, 0.6 μm bovine cardiac troponin labeled with IAANS, 5 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 3.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 7.5 mm KCL, and 0.5 mm 5,5′-dibromo-BAPTA. Fluorescence measurements employed a SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer outfitted with a stirred water jacket sample holder. The samples were excited at 332 nm, and the emission intensity was monitored at 510 nm. The titrations were performed by sequential additions of CaCl2 to 1.6-ml samples. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated as described elsewhere (39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), taking into account the CaCl2already contained in the actin buffer.

Steady state fluorescence Ca2+ titrations were performed under the following conditions: 25 °C, 5.5 μm F-actin (either wild type or mutant), 0.47 μm rabbit skeletal tropomyosin-troponinIANBD, 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.06), 3.5 mmMgCl2, 6.5 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EGTA. The fluorescence samples were excited at 436 nm, and the emission intensity was monitored at 535 nm. The titrations were performed by sequential additions of CaCl2 to 1.6-ml samples. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated as described (41Tobacman L.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), taking into account the CaCl2 already contained in the actin buffer. Fluorescence data were corrected for dilution and fit to Equation 12 from Ref. 39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The Lorenz model suggests that several residues in the third and fourth subdomain of actin, including residues from 309 to 336, are positioned so they may interact with tropomyosin in the absence of troponin (8Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Two of the yeast actin mutants, E311A/R312A and K315A/E316A, constructed by Wertman et al. (30Wertman K.F. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Genetics. 1992; 132: 337-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) produce nonlethal homozygous yeast strains from which actin can be purified and used to investigate this region. Both of these mutants were selected for initial studies. To detect any alteration in the ability of tropomyosin and troponin to regulate thin filaments containing these mutant actins, Ca2+ titrations of the actin-activated myosin S-1 ATPase rates were conducted. Fig.1 shows the composite normalized data from multiple preparations of each type of yeast actin. Regulated thin filaments including wild type yeast actin increased the myosin S-1 ATPase activity in response to the addition of Ca2+. For the wild type actin, in the absence of Ca2+ the actin-activated rate was only 7% of the rate seen at saturating Ca2+. In the presence of saturating Ca2+, regulated thin filaments containing either E311A/R312A actin or K315A/E316A actin produced only 50% of the thin filament-myosin S-1 MgATPase rate observed with wild type actin. The apparent Ca2+ affinity was 2.6 × 105m−1 for the wild type filament, very similar to results seen with muscle actin (2.4 × 105m−1; Ref. 9Butters C.A. Tobacman J.B. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13196-13202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, this apparent Ca2+ affinity was not significantly different from results seen for E311A/R312A actin (3.1 × 105m−1). However, it was 4-fold higher than the apparent Ca2+ affinity seen for K315A/E316A actin: 6.5 × 104m−1. Given these observations, we chose to focus our studies on mutant actin K315A/E316A. Fig. 1 shows that the thin filament-myosin S-1 MgATPase rate in the presence of saturating Ca2+ concentrations was significantly reduced when K315A/E316A actin was utilized. Importantly, other experiments differing from these by the absence of troponin-tropomyosin showed that the myosin S-1 ATPase rates using wild type F-actin and K315A/E316A F-actin were equivalent, 0.23 ± 0.02 s−1 for wild type and 0.24 ± 0.03 s−1for the mutant (average ± standard error, n = 4). Therefore, the decreased MgATPase rate occurs specifically when the regulatory proteins are present. Ca2+ has a cooperatively activating effect on the thin filament-myosin S-1 MgATPase rate (39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Tobacman L.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and this is also true when yeast actin is used (Y > 1, Fig. 1; Y≈ nH2; Ref. 39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For unclear reasons, the cooperativity was too variable to reliably evaluate any effect of the actin mutations on Ca2+-mediated cooperativity. However, the higher thin filament-myosin S-1 MgATPase rate for wild type actin (in the presence of saturating Ca2+) was not due to a greater cooperative activation by myosin. Rather, myosin S-1 was not acting cooperatively under these conditions. This conclusion is based upon control data (data not shown) indicating that the MgATPase rate was linear with myosin S-1 concentrations up to 6 μm, much higher than the 1 μm used in Fig. 1. This parallels results with muscle actin under similar conditions (9Butters C.A. Tobacman J.B. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13196-13202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We further evaluated the lower apparent Ca2+ affinity by employing IAANS-labeled cardiac troponin to follow the binding of Ca2+ to the regulatory site of troponin C within the thin filament (39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Johnson J.D. Collins J.H. Robertson S.P. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9635-9640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence titrations indicated that the actin mutation had no effect on troponin Ca2+ affinity (6.5 ± 0.4 × 105m−1 for wild type versus 6.8 ± 0.2 × 105m−1 for K315A/E316A actin) (Fig.2 A). However, this result was not definitive, because the IAANS labeling causes a severalfold increase in thin filament regulatory site affinity (39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this may have obscured the effect of the actin mutation. Therefore, rabbit skeletal tropomyosin-troponin was labeled with IANBD, since the ATPase regulation and Ca2+ affinity are unaffected by labeling (40Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7209-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 43Greene L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1279-1285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence titration again, showed that the apparent Ca2+ affinity was similar for regulated thin filaments comprising either wild type or K315A/E316A F-actin,K app = 1.6 ± 0.1 × 106m−1 and K app = 1.5 ± 0.1 × 106m−1, respectively (see Fig. 2 B). The wild type actin result is similar to data reported previously for muscle actin (40Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7209-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In a control MgATPase rate versus pCa experiment using skeletal muscle tropomyosin-troponin IANBD, the actin mutation weakened the Ca2+ K app:K app = 1.8 ± 1.0 × 106m−1 for wild type actin andK app = 2.1 ± 1.3 × 105m−1 when K315A/E316A actin was present (data not shown). The errors are large because the ATPase rates, which are always lower with yeast actin (Fig. 1 and Ref. 21Cook R.K. Root D. Miller C. Reisler E. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2410-2415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were too low for accurate measurement. In contrast to results with cardiac regulatory proteins (44Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), skeletal muscle tropomyosin-troponin-Ca2+decreases the ATPase rate as much as 80% compared with actin alone (45Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thin filament assembly analysis was used to measure any changes in the interactions with the regulatory proteins that would be detectable by a change in their affinities for the mutant actin when compared with wild type actin. Fig. 3 shows the binding of the tropomyosin-troponin complex to either type of yeast actin in either the presence or absence of Ca2+. The figure shows that, at pCa 8, the tropomyosin-troponin complex binds equally tightly to both wild type (▵) and K315A/E316A (+) F-actin (8.3 ± 0.3 versus 7.8 ± 0.7 × 106m−1). The addition of Ca2+ causes an approximately 2-fold decrease in affinity of the regulatory complex for F-actin, a similar decrease to that seen for muscle actin (11Landis C.A. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon the addition of Ca2+, the affinity of the complex for wild type F-actin isK app = 4.0 ± 0.1 × 106m−1, which is slightly greater than the affinity seen for the mutant, K app = 2.8 ± 0.1 × 106m−1. In other words, the charged residues at 315 and 316 (normally present), increase tropomyosin-troponin binding affinity for actin very slightly, by only 1.4-fold. This is smaller than the 4-fold increase in the apparent Ca2+ affinity seen in the ATPase data (Fig. 1). The change in protein-protein binding is insufficient to explain the change in Ca2+ affinity. The wild type data in Fig. 3 data also suggest that yeast actin retains the troponin-tropomyosin interaction sites present in muscle, despite the absence of troponin in S. cerevisiae. Cardiac troponin-tropomyosin affinity for yeast actin is comparable to values determined by the same methods using muscle actin (in contemporaneous data, K app = 6.9 × 106m−1 in the absence of Ca2+, and 2.7 × 106m−1 in the presence of Ca2+ (Ref. 46Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); in older data,K app = 3.5 × 106m−1 (Ref. 47Butters C.A. Willadsen K.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15565-15570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The ATPase assays are conducted at low ionic strength to produce a measurable ATPase rate, whereas the protein-protein binding studies must be done at high ionic strength to prevent unbound tropomyosin-troponin from polymerizing in a way that would preclude binding measurements (36Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12867-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is possible that this high ionic strength decreases the effect of charged actin residues 315 and 316 on tropomyosin-troponin binding to actin, and therefore diminishes the effect of the mutation. To explore the effect of ionic strength on the relative binding affinities of tropomyosin-troponin to wild type versus mutant yeast actin, we varied the KCl concentration (Fig. 4). Unacetylated recombinant α-striated muscle tropomyosin was used instead of cardiac tropomyosin, since it is unable to polymerize and therefore a lower range of ionic strength can be explored (35Willadsen K.A. Butters C.A. Hill L.E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23746-23752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (Polymerization causes non-recombinant muscle tropomyosin-troponin to sediment in the absence of actin, complicating binding measurements unless high ionic strength is used to prevent polymerization (34Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) In a control experiment (data not shown), substituting unacetylated recombinant α-tropomyosin for cardiac tropomyosin in ATPase assays did not alter the effect of the actin mutation. In general, Fig. 4shows that troponin-unacetylated tropomyosin bound slightly less tightly to the mutant F-actin than to the wild type actin (solid bars versus open bars). The data also show that the effect of the actin mutation did not increase at lower ionic strength. This is contrary to what one would expect if high ionic strength decreases the effect of the mutation on the binding of the regulatory complex to actin. The actin affinity of tropomyosin alone is slightly weaker for the K315A/E316A F-actin. A related issue is the effect of the actin mutation on tropomyosin binding to yeast actin filaments in the absence of troponin. This was examined in the presence of 100 mmKCl, because actin-tropomyosin binding is too weak in the absence of troponin to be measured under conditions used in the presence of troponin (Fig. 3, 300 mm KCl). The results (Fig.5) indicate that the binding of tropomyosin to actin occurs with a K app of 2.3 ± 0.6 × 106m−1for the wild type actin (○) and a slightly weakerK app of 1.5 ± 0.1 × 106m−1 for the K315A/E316A actin filament (*). Although these values indicate only a small effect of the mutation, the ratio of the two affinities (wild type:mutant) equals 1.5, which is the same magnitude found in the presence of troponin and Ca2+(Fig. 3). Notably, three-dimensional reconstructions of muscle thin filaments show the position of tropomyosin on the actin filament to be the same under these two conditions (7Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 8Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Lehman W. Craig R. Uman P. Vibert P. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): A15Google Scholar). As in the case of muscle actin (36Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12867-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the presence of myosin S-1 causes tropomyosin to bind very tightly to yeast actin filaments. For both types of yeast actin, the binding of tropomyosin is nearly stoichiometric (+, ▵, Fig. 5). Because binding is very strong, we were unable to measure the effects of the mutation on tropomyosin-actin affinity under these conditions. An emerging but incomplete (48Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) consensus from three-dimensional reconstructions and biochemical studies is that regulation of striated and cardiac muscle contraction can be described by a three-state model for the thin filament (4McKillop D.F.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Actin mutants provide one method to probe the actin surface for residues that interact with the regulatory proteins and thereby influence these three conformations. In this study, we provide evidence that yeast actin can serve as a model system for investigating this process. Regulated thin filaments containing wild type yeast actin showed Ca2+-induced myosin S-1 ATPase activity. The presence of myosin S-1 produces very tight binding of tropomyosin to yeast actin filaments. Both of these observations are comparable to data obtained in experiments differing only by the use of muscle actin (44Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) instead of yeast actin (36Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12867-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41Tobacman L.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 492-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Additionally, muscle actin and wild type yeast actin have comparable affinities for tropomyosin-troponin. Finally, regulated thin filaments have the same Ca2+ affinity at the TnC regulatory site regardless which actin is included. These data indicate that the regulatory proteins interact with yeast actin in a manner very similar to muscle actin. Actin residues 311, 312, 315, and 316 are located in the third subdomain, in a region proposed by Lorenz et al. (8Lorenz M. Poole K.J.V. Popp D. Rosenbaum G. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to bind to tropomyosin in the absence of troponin. Our studies show that tropomyosin binds slightly more weakly to filaments made of the K315A/E316A as compared with wild type filaments. This could indicate that these residues are involved in tropomyosin binding, but this interaction must be weak if present. The myosin S-1 ATPase assays showed an apparent Ca2+affinity for regulated thin filaments containing K315A/E316A that was 25% of the apparent Ca2+ affinity of wild type thin filaments. However, in thin filament assembly studies, there was only a slight decrease; the affinity of the tropomyosin-troponin complex atpCa 4 for the mutant actin was 70% of the affinity for the wild type actin. Initially, a plausible reason for this discrepancy was the difference in the ionic strength between the two assays. The high ionic strength needed for the binding assay might diminish the effects of the two charged actin residues. This hypothesis was tested by examining how ionic conditions affected the binding of troponin-unacetylated tropomyosin to actin, which can be examined under a broader range of conditions than when (acetylated) muscle tropomyosin is used. The results indicate that lower ionic strength does not increase the discrepancy in the binding affinities for the wild type actin filament versus the mutant actin filament. Fig. 6 shows the linkage relationship between tropomyosin-troponin and Ca2+ binding to F-actin. If K 4corresponded to the Ca2+ titration of the actin-activated myosin S-1 ATPase rates, altered 4-fold by the mutation, then there would be a compensatory change in the other association constants,K 1 and/or K 3. (Actin mutations obviously cannot alter K 2.) However, Fig. 3 shows that K 1 is unchanged andK 3 is only slightly changed. Therefore, the linkage relationships suggest that the actin mutation has only a slight effect on Ca2+ binding to the thin filament (this is experimentally confirmed in Fig. 2), and the larger effect on the Ca2+ K app of the ATPase titration implies an effect of the mutation on an additional process. An unproven but plausible possibility for such a process is suggested by previous studies in which a nonlinear relationship was found between myosin S-1 MgATPase activity and troponin saturation with Ca2+ (9Butters C.A. Tobacman J.B. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13196-13202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This nonlinear relationship indicated that (when using muscle actin) Ca2+ binding to two adjacent troponins was necessary to activate the myosin S-1 MgATPase rate. This non-linear behavior may be exaggerated in the presence of the actin mutation. It is significant that the decreased myosin S-1 ATPase rates observed with K315A/E316A actin occurred only when the regulatory proteins were present. We suggest that these charged residues in actin subdomain 3 interact weakly with the regulatory proteins in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Further, we suggest that they more strongly influence the back and forth transitions between the Ca2+state and the myosin-induced state of the thin filament, and that access to the myosin-induced state is required for cross-bridge cycling. Similarly, the neutralization of the charge on actin residues 311 and 312 might also alter the ability of the regulatory complex to control actin-myosin interactions. A more specific possibility is that residues 311 and 312 normally impede the transition from the myosin-induced state to the Ca2+ state of the thin filament. Mutation to Ala could then promote reversal of strong cross-bridge binding. This would explain not only the current MgATPase data (reversal before product release), but also a preliminary report using in vitro motility to examine the yeast actin mutant E311A/R312A (49Gerson J.H. Bobkova E. Homsher E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): A57Google Scholar). These studies showed that motility rates were similar for E311A/R312A F-actin and wild type F-actin alone, but in the presence of the regulatory proteins the sliding speed was increased for the E311A/R312A thin filaments when compared with the wild type, implying faster cross-bridge detachment. The present studies are not intended to suggest that troponin and tropomyosin interact exclusively with subdomain 3 of actin. Thin filament reconstructions suggest that tropomyosin may contact the other subdomains, and the interactions of troponin with actin remain obscure. Furthermore, two previous actin mutagenesis studies are relevant. Saekiet al. (27Saeki K. Sutoh K. Wakabayashi T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14465-14472Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) used Dictyostelium actin mutants to propose that subdomain 4 interacts with tropomyosin in the “on” state of the thin filament. Bing et al. (17Bing W. Razzaq A. Sparrow J. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15016-15021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) used the limited amount of actin that could be purified fromDrosophila to observe that actin subdomain 2 mutant E93K has abnormal in vitro motility in the presence of tropomyosin (17Bing W. Razzaq A. Sparrow J. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15016-15021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The combined results of our data and these earlier studies suggest that several areas of actin participate in interactions with the regulatory proteins. In summary, yeast actin interacts with the regulatory proteins in a manner similar to muscle actin and thus can serve as a model system for muscle regulation. Neutralizing the charge on the actin residues 315 and 316 or 311 and 312 by mutation to alanine inhibits myosin activity when the regulatory proteins are present. For the former mutant, there is a 4-fold decrease in the apparent Ca2+ affinity as well as a 50% lower MgATPase activity in the presence of saturating Ca2+. Also, the K315A/E316A mutation slightly weakens tropomyosin binding to actin, specifically under conditions when it is normally found on the inner domain of F-actin (tropomyosin alone; tropomyosin-troponin-Ca2+). These results suggest that charged residues on the surface of the actin inner domain are important for thin filament activation.

The TIMP family includes four members, designated TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4, each of which can inactivate the active forms of MMPs by formation of a tight 1:1 non-covalent complex (3Matrisian L.M. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Although the TIMPs are largely interchangeable in their MMP-inhibitory abilities, it has become clear that they have certain properties that are specific to particular family members, supporting the idea that they have unique as well as shared physiological roles. For instance, compared with TIMP-2, -3, and -4, TIMP-1 is a poor inhibitor of the membrane-type MMP group of MMPs, several of which function as cell surface activators of progelatinase-A (MMP-2 (4Cowell S.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2535-2538PubMed Google Scholar)). TIMP-1 also stands out in its ability to form a complex with pro-gelatinase-B (MMP-9) (8Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), through which it regulates the rate of pro-MMP-9 activation (9Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16518-16521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Finally, TIMPs show highly individual patterns of expression in vivo and in vitro (2Denhardt D.T. Feng B. Edwards D.R. Cocuzzi E.T. Malyankar U.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,11Edwards D.R. Leco K.J. Lim M.S. Phillips B.W. Raja J. Sharma R.

Of the four timp genes, timp-1 and -3are both highly inducible in diverse cell types in vitro, in response to stimuli such as serum, phorbol ester, and transforming growth factor-β (12Edwards D.R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14061-14071Google Scholar), whereas timp-2 expression remains largely constitutive under most stimulatory conditions (15De Clerk Y.A. Darville M.I. Eackhout Y. Rousseau G.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the developing mouse embryo, strong expression of Timp-1 is restricted to sites where extensive tissue remodeling is occurring, particularly at sites of osteogenesis in the limbs, digits, ribs, vertebrae, and skull (16Nomura S. Hogan B. Wills A.J. Heath J.K. Edwards D.R. Development. 1989; 105: 575-583PubMed Google Scholar, 17Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Tight spatio-temporal control of expression is also seen in the adult ovary and uterus during pregnancy under the influence of paracrine and endocrine factors (18Leco K.J. Edwards D.R. Schultz G.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 45: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, many tissues express Timp-1 at a low basal level that can only be detected by sensitive techniques such as ribonuclease protection assay, possible reflecting a tissue maintenance function (16Nomura S. Hogan B. Wills A.J. Heath J.K. Edwards D.R. Development. 1989; 105: 575-583PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work from several laboratories has shown that expression ofTimp-1 is controlled principally at the level of transcription (19Edwards D.R. Parfett C.L.J. Denhardt D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3280-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Ponton A. Coulombe B. Steyaert A. Williams B.R.G. Skup D. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) which therefore dictates that a detailed analysis of its transcriptional regulation be performed. Thetimp-1 genes from mouse, rat, and human have been cloned and their promoter and regulatory regions analyzed (19Edwards D.R. Parfett C.L.J. Denhardt D.T. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5041-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In several characteristics Timp-1 resembles a housekeeping gene, including the absence of a canonical TATA box, the presence of Sp1 sites, and multiple transcription start sites (25Gewert D.R. Coulombe B. Castelino M. Skup D. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Coulombe B. Ponton A. Daigneault L. Williams B.R.G. Skup D. Mol. Cell.

Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additionally, the promoter proximal region contains several cis-acting regulatory elements that have been shown to be important for conveying transcriptional induction in response to stimuli. Most notable is a highly conserved region that has an AP1-(activator protein-1) binding motif in close proximity to a PEA3/Ets domain, an arrangement found in many other AP1-responsive genes (29Logan S.K. Garbedian M.J. Campbell C.E. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 774-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have demonstrated the importance of both of these regions, but clearly, the AP1 element is the principal site for conferring stimulatory responses following serum stimulation in vitro (27Campbell C.E. Flenniken A.M. Skup D. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7199-7206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 774-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AP1-binding site is a non-consensus form (5′-TGAGTAA-3′) that differs by a single base from the consensus AP1-binding motif (5′-TGAGTCA-3′) found in most AP-1-responsive genes, including inducible MMPs such as human collagenase (mmp-1), stromelysin-1 (mmp-3), and gelatinase-B (mmp-9) (30Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 31Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). We previously showed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that in addition to the ability of the Timp-1 −59/−53 AP-1 site to bind complexes containing Fos and Jun proteins, other proteins could bind that showed no affinity for the consensus collagenase AP-1 sequence (otherwise known as the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element) (28Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We therefore undertook a more detailed investigation of the characteristics of the Timp-1 AP-1 site, in conjunction with a search for further important regulatory elements in the promoter proximal zone of the gene. We report here that single-strand versions of the Timp-1 AP-1 site bind distinct nuclear factors and that the consensus AP-1-binding site does not share this ability. Furthermore, similar single-strand DNA binding activity is also seen at a site further upstream, at −115/−100. These interactions affect the basal expression of Timp-1, rather than its induction in response to serum stimulation. We speculate that these promoter-interacting single-stranded DNA-binding proteins may be significant factors in the dual housekeeping/inducible behavior ofTimp-1 and other genes. Murine fibroblast C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (DMEM/F12) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Inc.). Whereas antibiotics were added for experimental procedures (1% antibiotic/antimycotic, Life Technologies, Inc.), routine maintenance of cells was done free of antibiotics. All transient transfections were performed by the Chen and Okayama (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) procedure essentially as described previously (28Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml and grown overnight in DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS. To transfect the cells, 20 μg of plasmid was brought up to 900 μl of final volume in TE, followed by the addition of 100 μl of CaCl2 (2.5 m). The mixture was then added dropwise to 1 ml of 2× BES-buffered saline (50 mm BES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4) with constant vortexing, which enables the formation of DNA-calcium phosphate precipitates. Precipitation proceeded for exactly 20 min, and 1 ml of the mixture was added dropwise to each of two plates of cells. The cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 97% (v/v) air, 3% (v/v) CO2. After the transfection, the medium was exchanged for fresh DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS medium, and the culture dishes were returned to 95% (v/v) air, 5% CO2 for 8 h. The medium was then exchanged for serum-free DMEM/F12 overnight. The cells were stimulated for 24 h with serum as described above or given fresh serum-free media for basal conditions. Following stimulation, cell extracts were collected by harvesting with reporter lysis buffer as per manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase reporter assays were performed using the luciferase assay system according to manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 20 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent, and then light emission was immediately measured on a luminometer (TD-20, Promega, Madison WI). Luciferase transfections were standardized to CAT activity by cotransfection with a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven CAT construct (CMV-CAT). CAT assays were performed using standard methodology previously described (28Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). First, 20 μg of protein extract was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with [14C]chloramphenicol (0.0002 μCi) in Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), in a final volume of 100 μl. Next, 20 μl of 4 mm acetyl coenzyme A was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by extraction with 900 μl of ethyl acetate. The sample was then lyophilized, resuspended in 20 μl of ethyl acetate, and spotted onto a thin layer chromatography plate. Chromatography was performed in an atmosphere containing 95% chloroform, 5% methanol. Finally, the plates are exposed onto x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). All transfections were standardized with the Hirt's assay for DNA input as described (33Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Nuclear pellets (remaining from the cell lysate extraction) were lysed in 0.5 ml of Hirt's solution (0.6% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA) for 10 min at room temperature. This was followed by the addition of 60 μl of 5m NaCl and 20 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml), which was then incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After the protease digestion, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm, and the supernatant was retained and extracted with 1:1 phenol:chloroform. The samples were then prepared for slot-blot transfer by mixing 50 μl of supernatant with 16.7 μl of 1 m HCl for 5 min to denature, followed by the addition of 117 μl of neutralization solution (0.9 m NaOH, 2.25 m NaCl) for 15 min. The volume was increased to 510 μl with buffer (1.4 mTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1.5 m NaCl) and then loaded onto a slot-blot manifold for transfer onto duralon-UV membranes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Following transfer, the samples were fixed by UV cross-linking, hybridized to specific probes (pBLCAT3 or pGL2-basic), and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). Intensity of signal (measured densitometrically) was then used to standardize the reporter expression to amount of input plasmid. Inserts for a deletion series of theTimp-1 promoter were generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using standard protocols with the primers shown in TableI. The constructs, corresponding to −223/+47, −195/+47, −180/+47, −165/+47, −140/+47, −125/+47, and −95/+47, contain 5′ XhoI and 3′ SacI restriction sites, which enabled directional cloning into the luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL2-basic (Promega).Table IPCR primers for construct synthesisNameSequenceSac223GGGAGCTCAAGCTTTAGGCGCTCTCTCTSac 195GGGAGCTCTCAAGGCCGCCAGGAAGGACSac 180GGGAGCTCAGGACTGTGCATGACGTGGASac 165GGGAGCTCGTGGAGCTGGGGGAAGGGGGSac 150GGGAGCTCGGGGGCGCAGTGGGCTGGCTSac 125GGGAGCTCAGGAGGGAGTATCTTTGGGTSac 95GGGAGCTCGCCCGCCCCTAGGCTTTGACXho 47GGCTCGAGATCTGCGATGATGGCGGCAcoll.AP1 topGTGGGTGGATGAGTCATGCGTCCAGGAAGcoll.AP1 botCTTCCTGGACGCATGACTCATCCACCCACmutAP1 topCAGCGGTGGGTGGAGGAGTGATGCGTCCAGGAAGmutAP1 botCTTCCTGGACGCATCACTCCTCCACCCACCGCTGmutPEA3 topTGAGTAATGCGTCCTTGAAGCCTGGAGGCAmutPEA3 botTGCCTCCAGGCTTCAAGGACGCATTACTCAHind −115mut1CCAAGCTTGAGGAGTGGTTTATCCTGGGGCCCGHind −115CCAAGCTTATCTTTGGGTTTATCCTGGGBam +47AAGGATCCCTGCGATGATGGCGGCAGGGThe table shows the sequences of all oligonucleotides used in the design of deletion and mutant constructs.

Directionality is mentioned for all other primers. The −223/+47 CAT constructs (coll.AP1, mutAP1, and mutPEA3) were created using a two-step PCR mutagenesis strategy utilizing the WT −223/+47 construct (in pBluescript) described previously (28Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) as a template. The first step involves two separate reactions, using sense and antisense primers incorporating specific mutations from the wild-type sequence (Table I) and either T3 or T7 primers. In this manner, T3 and the appropriate antisense primer amplified the upstream half of the fragment (containing the mutation) and T7 and the corresponding sense primer amplified the downstream half. The products were then mixed and used as a template for the second round of PCR, using T3 and T7 only as primers. Full-length constructs will only be amplified if the upstream and downstream halves anneal, thereby generating the mutant constructs. Following PCR, the fragments were digested with HindIII/Sau3A and cloned into pBLCAT3. The constructs were verified by sequencing. The −115/+47 constructs (WT, coll.AP1 and mutAP1) were produced by PCR using the templates described above for mutant and coll.AP1. In the case where the ssT1 was mutated, the primer contained specific sequence changes to amplify a mutant product (Mut1; see Table I). The PCR fragments were then restricted with HindIII/BamHI and cloned into linearized pBLCAT3. Oligonucleotides for electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Southwestern blotting were synthesized by the UCDNA synthesis laboratory (University of Calgary, Canada) (TablesI and II). If annealing of the DNA was required to produce double-stranded probes, equimolar amounts of sense and antisense strands were diluted to 1 μg/μl in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl and heated to 95 °C. To facilitate annealing, the oligonucleotides were allowed to cool slowly to 4 °C.Table IIElectromobility shift assay primersNameSequenceColl.AP1-botGATCCGGCTGACTCATCAColl.AP1-topAGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCG−125/−95 botGATCCCCAGGATAAACCCAAAGATACTCCCTCCTA−125/−95 topAGCTTAGGAGGGAGTATCTTTGGGTTTATCCTGGG−123/−110 topAGCTTGAGGGAGTATCTTTG−123/−110 botGATCCAAAGATACTCCCTCA−115/−100 topAGCTTATCTTTGGGTTTATCCG−115/−100 botGATCCGGATAAACCCAAAGATA−108/−92 topAGCTTGGTTTATCCTGGGGCCCG−108/−92 botGATCCGGGCCCCAGGATAAACCA−115/−100 top mut1AAAGCTTGATGAGTCGTTTATCCG−115/−100 top mut2AAAGCTTATCTTTGGTCAGCCGCG−115/−100 top MUT −115/−114AAAGCTTCGCTTTGGGTTTATC−115/−100 top MUT −113/−111AAAGCTTATTGGTGGGTTTATC−115/−100 top MUT −110/−108AAAGCTTATCTTGATGTTTATC−115/−100 top MUT −107/−105AAAGCTTATCTTTGGACCTATC−115/−100 top MUT −104/−102AAAGCTTATCTTTGGGTTCGCGTimp-1 −63/−49 topAGCTTGGATGAGTAATGCGTimp-1 −63/−49 botGATCCGCATTACTCATCCAThe sequence of all EMSA primers is listed.

Single-stranded probes were generated by adding 60 ng of oligonucleotide to a modified T4-polynucleotide kinase (PNK) buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mMgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm EDTA, 25% polyethylene glycol, w/v) with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 units of T4-PNK. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then stopped with 50 μl of 25 mm EDTA. The probes were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, and unincorporated dNTPs were removed using G-50 spun columns. Duplex fill-in probes were generated by adding 60 ng of annealed oligonucleotide to 0.5 mm dATP, dGTP, dTT, 20 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml), 1× REACT buffer 2 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.5 units of large fragment of DNA polymerase I. Reactions were incubated at 15 °C for 15 min and then terminated by phenol/chloroform extraction. Unincorporated dNTPs were removed by running the reaction through a G-50 column. A total of 2 × 107 10T1/2 cells (either unstimulated or serum-stimulated for 30 min or 3 h) were scraped in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After a brief centrifugation (10 s, 12,000 rpm), the cells were decanted and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Cells were visually inspected for lysis, centrifuged briefly again, and the supernatant aspirated. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in 3 volumes of high salt buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm DTT) with protease inhibitors (0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin) and extracted on ice for 20 min. Extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min (4 °C), and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The protein concentration of the nuclear extract was determined by Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's directions. Radiolabeled probe (40,000 cpm) was incubated with 4 μg of 10T1/2 cell nuclear extract in 1× binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) in the presence of nonspecific competitors (0.5 μg of Sau3A cut pBluescript plasmid and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)), with a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The binding reaction was electrophoresed on a 7% polyacrylamide gel (38:2 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 1× TBE buffer (90 mmTris-HCl, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) which had been prerun for at least 30 min at 4 °C. The gels were run for 1.5 h at 10 V/cm2 at 4 °C to retain the stability of the protein-DNA complexes. Completed gels were dried onto Whatman 3M paper (Bio-Rad, model 583 gel dryer) and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Biomax). Nuclear extracts (30 μg) were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mini-gel (Bio-Rad) in an equal volume of loading buffer (5% SDS, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 200 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue), using a lane of pre-stained molecular weight markers as a standard (Life Technologies, Inc.). The samples were then transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad transblot transfer medium) using the mini-trans-blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) as per manufacturer's directions. The blot was blocked for 1 h at 4 °C in Blotto (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% skim milk powder) with gentle agitation, followed by soaking overnight at 4 °C in binding buffer (25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). The next day, the samples were soaked in binding buffer with single-stranded, end-labeled probe (100,000 cpm/ml) for 6 h to overnight at 4 °C. Following the probing, the blots were rinsed 4 times in binding buffer for 8 min at 4 °C and air-dried. The washed blots were then exposed to Biomax x-ray film (Kodak). We showed previously that the 5′-TGAGTAA-3′ motif at −59/−53 in theTimp-1 promoter was able to bind AP-1 and activate transcription from a linked promoter (28Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowie A. Hassell J.A. Heath J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have confirmed the importance of this site in both the human and mouse promoters (29Logan S.K. Garbedian M.J. Campbell C.E. Werb Z. J. Biol.

However, we found that this sequence was able to associate with additional proteins besides Fos/Jun AP-1, which were unable to bind to a consensus collagenase AP-1 site (5′-TGAGTCA-3′), and we speculated that this unusual AP1-binding site might convey additional properties to the Timp-1 promoter (28Edwards D.R.

To test the involvement of the −59/−53 AP-1 site in promoter activity, we incorporated point mutations that either convert the site to a consensus AP1 motif (coll.AP1), or render it non-functional (mut AP1). In addition we introduced an inactivating mutation into the neighboring PEA3/Ets-binding site (Fig. 1). Transient transfection assays were carried out using CAT reporter plasmids carrying these alternative versions of the −223/+47 region of theTimp-1 promoter. The mutAP1 construct confirmed that a functional AP1-binding motif is essential for maximal basal and serum-inducible gene expression. In contrast, mutation of the PEA3/Ets site led to a more modest reduction of activity, to about 60% of the maximum observed with the wild-type promoter. Fig. 1 also shows that the unusual Timp-1 AP1 and the consensus AP1 sites have equivalent abilities to drive both basal and serum-stimulated expression of CAT in the context of the −223/+47 region. We examined in more detail the nature of the nuclear factors that are able to interact with the −59/−53 AP1 and the collagenase AP1 sites. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using an annealed, PNK-labeled double-stranded probe corresponding to sequences from −63 to −49 (Fig.2). It is important to note that this procedure may produce a mixed population of single- and double-stranded probes if one of the oligonucleotides is present in slight excess over its partner. Two complexes were resolved using 7% polyacrylamide gels. A slow migrating complex labeled A was competed by both unlabeled −63/−49 Timp-1 and collagenase AP1 sequences (lanes 3 and 4). Band A was also supershifted when anti-Fos or anti-Jun antibodies were added to the binding reactions (data not shown). These data identify shift A as AP1 bound to the −63/−49 probe, confirming our previous data and other reports (28Edwards D.R. Rocheleau H. Sharma R.R. Wills A.J. Cowi"
https://openalex.org/W1711023319,"Several types of ionic channels on the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope communicate with the nuclear cisternae. These are distinct from nucleocytoplasmic pathways, the nuclear pores that span the double membrane of the envelope and are the route for RNA and protein traffic in the nucleus. Recent data indicate that the nuclear pores may also function as ion channels. The most probable candidate for nucleocytoplasmic ion flux is a 300–400 pS pathway observed in many nuclear preparations. Morphological and functional studies of nuclear envelope suggest a tight relationship between the large conductance channel and the pore complex. However, there is no direct evidence for gating of the nuclear pore or its ability to open and close as a conventional channel. This study shows that in liver nuclei isolated from newborn mouse, there is a substantial correspondence between the number of pores and the number of channels recorded during patch-clamp. This is not the case for adult nuclei. Although pore density is comparable, some nuclear cytoskeletal components, such as actin and nonmuscle myosin, show a significant increase in the adult preparation. Previous studies demonstrate the presence of these two proteins in association with the pore complex. Here we show that by using actin filament disrupter, we were able to increase the number of active channels in adult isolated nuclei. We suggest that a functional interaction between actin filaments and the nuclear pore complex could regulate nucleocytoplasmic permeability.—Tonini, R., Grohovaz, F., LaPorta, C. A. M., Mazzanti, M.

https://openalex.org/W1818064691,"The effects of growth factors have been shown to depend on the position of a cell in the cell cycle. However, the physiological basis for this phenomenon remains unclear. Here we show that the majority of both CEINGE clone3 (cl3) and human embryonic kidney 293 cells, when arrested in a quiescent phase (G(0)), responded to platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) with non-oscillatory Ca(2+) signals. Furthermore, the same type of Ca(2+) response was also observed in CEINGE cl3 cells (and to a lesser extent in HEK 293 cells) blocked at the G(1)/S boundary. In contrast, CEINGE cl3 cells synchronized in early G(1) or released from G(1)/S arrest responded in an oscillatory fashion. This cell cycle-dependent modulation of Ca(2+) signaling was not observed on epidermal growth factor and G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation and was not due to differences in the expression of PDGF receptors (PDGFRs) during the cell cycle. We demonstrate that inhibition of sphingosine-kinase, which converts sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate, caused G(0) as well as G(1)/S synchronized cells to restore the oscillatory Ca(2+) response to PDGF-BB. In addition, we show that the synthesis of sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate is regulated by the cell cycle and may underlie the differences in Ca(2+) signaling after PDGFR stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2130784526,"To study the role of transmembrane (TM) domains interactions in the activation of the insulin receptor, we have replaced the insulin receptor TM domain with that of glycophorin A (GpA), an erythrocyte protein that spontaneously forms detergent-resistant dimers through TM–TM interactions. Insulin receptor cDNA sequences with the TM domain replaced by that of GpA were constructed and stably transfected in CHO cells. Insulin binding to cells and solubilized receptors was not modified. Electrophoresis after partial reduction of disulfide bonds revealed an altered structure for the soluble chimeric receptors, seen as an altered mobility apparently due to increased interactions between the β subunits of the receptor. Insulin signaling was markedly decreased for cells transfected with chimeric receptors compared with cells transfected with normal receptors. A decrease in insulin-induced receptor kinase activity was observed for solubilized chimeric receptors. In conclusion, substitution by the native GpA TM domain of the insulin receptor results in structurally modified chimeric receptors that are unable to transmit the insulin signal properly. It is hypothesized that this substitution may impose structural constraints that prevent the proper changes in conformation necessary for activation of the receptor kinase. Other mutants modifying the structure or the membrane orientation of the glycophorin A TM domain are required to better understand these constraints.—Gardin, A., Auzan, C., Clauser, E., Malherbe, T., Aunis, D., Crémel, G., Hubert, P.

Arginine 187 of LMO is highly conserved within the family ofl-α-hydroxyacid oxidizing enzymes (Lê, K. H. D., and Lederer, F. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20877–20881). By comparison with the equivalent residue in flavocytochrome b2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pike, A. D., Chapman, S. K, Manson, F. D. C,. Reid, G. A., Gondry, M., and Lederer, F. (1996) inFlavins and Flavoproteins (Stevenson, K. J., Massey, V., and Williams, C. H., Jr., eds) pp. 571–574, University of Calgary Press, Calgary, AB, Canada), arginine 187 might be expected to have an important role in catalytic efficiency and substrate binding in LMO. Histidine 240 is predicted to be close to the substrate binding site of LMO, although it is not conserved within the enzyme family. Arginine 187 has been replaced with methionine (R187M), and histidine 240 has been replaced with glutamine (H240Q).l-Lactate oxidation by R187M is very slow. The binding ofl-lactate to the mutant enzyme appears to be very weak, as is the binding of oxalate, a transition state analogue. The binding of pyruvate to the reduced enzyme is also very weak, resulting in complete uncoupling of enzyme turnover, with H2O2 and pyruvate as the final products. In addition, anionic forms of the flavin are unstable. The K d for sulfite is increased nearly 400-fold by this mutation. The semiquinone form of R187M is also thermodynamically unstable, although the overall midpoint potential for the two-electron reduction of R187M is only 34 mV lower than for the wild-type enzyme. H240Q more closely resembles the wild-type enzyme. The steady-state activity of H240Q is completely coupled. The k cat is similar to that for the wild-type enzyme.

It is a member of the FMN-dependent family of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of l-α-hydroxy acids, including l-lactate oxidase (2Maeda-Yorita K. Aki K. Sagai H. Misaki H. Massey V.

LMO is unique within this family in that dissociation of the initial oxidation product, pyruvate, occurs much more slowly than the reaction of the reduced enzyme-pyruvate complex with oxygen (1Ghisla S.

The resultant H2O2decarboxylates pyruvate within the active site of the enzyme and the final products, acetate, CO2, water, are then released (Fig. 1, inner pathway). The other members release their initial oxidation product rapidly from the reduced enzyme, resulting in the α-keto acid and H2O2 as final products in the outer, or uncoupled, pathway. The gene for LMO in M. smegmatis has been cloned and sequenced (10Giegel D.A. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6626-6632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1989; 264: 3624-3628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which show a strong similarity in the folding pattern around the flavin (13Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.I. Mathews F.S. Lederer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3198-3207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a model of the active site of LMO has been made (Fig. 2). A number of conserved amino acids have been assigned putative roles in LMO (10Giegel D.A. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6626-6632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which have been tested by site-directed mutagenesis. Histidine 290 was proposed to be the active site base responsible for the abstraction of the α-proton from l-lactate to form a carbanion intermediate during catalysis (14Ghisla S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6729-6735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schonbrunn A. Abeles R.H. Walsh C.T. Ghishla S. Ogata H. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutation of histidine 290 to glutamate (16Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7989-7993PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in an enzyme that was able to bind lactate but was unable to catalyze oxidation of l-lactate to pyruvate. Lysine 266 was proposed to be placed near to the N(1)-C(2)O locus of the flavin and responsible for the tight binding of sulfite to LMO (17Massey V. Müller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A.

Chem. 1969; 244: 4007-4016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as stabilization of the flavin anionic semiquinone (19Massey V. Ghisla S. Moore E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9640-9650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue to methionine (20Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in a 17,000-fold increase in the K d for sulfite binding to the enzyme and a thermodynamically unstable flavin anionic semiquinone with an unusual absorbance spectrum. The rate of reduction of this mutant form withl-lactate was also significantly decreased as compared with the wild-type enzyme. Three amino acid residues were suggested to be in suitable positions to form hydrogen bonds with l-lactate and thus aid substrate binding. These are tyrosine 44, tyrosine 152, and arginine 293. Both of these tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanine, and arginine 293 was replaced with lysine (21Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7994-8000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, the binding affinity of l-lactate for the mutant enzyme did not decrease, but the rates of reduction withl-lactate decreased significantly. The stability of the oxalate-enzyme complex, a transition-state analog (14Ghisla S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6729-6735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also found to be compromised to different extents with the mutant enzymes, and a linear relationship between k red forl-lactate and K d for oxalate binding was found (21Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7994-8000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This provided a clear demonstration that a number of individual residues contribute to the lowering of the energy of the transition state. Arginine 187 in LMO is also completely conserved within this enzyme family (7Lê K.H.D. Lederer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20877-20881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The known structures of recombinant flavocytochrome b2 (12Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and glycolate oxidase in the presence (22Stenberg K. Lindqvist Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and absence (4Lindqvist Y. Brändén C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3624-3628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of bound active site inhibitors show that the equivalent residues in these enzymes (arginine 289 and arginine 164, respectively) are close to the active site and may therefore be involved in catalysis. Mutation of arginine 289 to lysine in flavocytochrome b2 (23Pike A.D. Chapman S.K Manson F.D. C,. Reid G.A. Gondry M. Lederer F. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, AB, Canada1996: 571-574Google Scholar) resulted in a 4-fold increase inK m toward l-lactate and a 12-fold decrease in k cat in steady-state assays. In the present study, arginine 187 has been replaced with methionine. Attempts were also made to replace arginine 187 with lysine. However, the protein was expressed only in the form of inclusion bodies, and no soluble enzyme was obtained. Methionine has similar spatial requirements to arginine but lacks the positive charge of the guanidinium side chain. The effects of this mutation on the redox properties, and on the binding of substrate and a transition state analog to the enzyme, are discussed. Histidine 240 has no equivalent histidine residue in lactate oxidase or any other α-hydroxy acid oxidase. However, the present active site model of LMO places this residue in reasonably close proximity to the substrate binding site. Histidine 240 was therefore replaced with glutamine in order to probe potential interactions with the substrate and potential role of this residue in the modulation of oxidase/monooxygenase activity. Materials and instrumentation were as described previously (24Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in 10 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and at 25 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Enzyme solutions were protected from light as much as possible because LMO is susceptible to photoreduction to the semiquinone species. The vectors used for the production of R187M and H240Q and the expression plasmid were as described earlier (20Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenesis of arginine 187 (codon CGG) to methionine was performed with the oligonucleotide 5′-TTCGGTTGGATGCCAAGGGAC*CTCACGA-3′ (the codon for methionine is underlined). A silent mutation (marked with an asterisk) was also introduced at residue aspartate 190 to create aDraII site (5′-GGGNCCT-3′). The mutagenesis of arginine 187 to lysine was performed with the oligonucleotide 5′-TTCGGTTGGAAGCCG*AGGGATCTCACGA-3′ (the codon for lysine is underlined). A silent mutation (marked with an asterisk) was also introduced for the codon at residue proline 188 to eliminate aStyI site (5′-CCAAGG-3′). The mutagenesis of histidine 240 (codon CAC) to glutamine was performed with the oligonucleotide 5′-CCGATTTCTGGCAGGGCCTGTTC-3′ (the codon for glutamine is underlined). This mutation also introduced a DraII site. Successful mutagenesis was screened for by the addition of aDraII site (R187M or H240Q) or elimination of aStyI site (R187K). The SacI-Xcmfragment (486 base pairs), which contains both mutation sites, was ligated into the appropriate position of the expression plasmid pUM01 to give new plasmids pSAS1 (R187M) and pSAS2 (H240Q). Successful insertion was confirmed by digesting with Eco0109I (R187M or H240Q), which recognizes the DraII site, or withStyI (R187K), and by plasmid sequencing. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3).pLysS containing the plasmid pSAS1 or pSAS2 was grown in six 1-liter flasks of Terrific Broth and purified as described previously (20Müh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical wet weight yield of cells was 30–35 g. Most of the mutant proteins were obtained in the form of inclusion bodies. Only the soluble fraction was isolated, with a typical yield of 30–40 mg of enzyme. The purity of the protein was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207783) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue. The extinction coefficients for mutant enzymes were determined by denaturing the protein with SDS. 10 μl of 10% SDS was added to 1 ml of enzyme solution. The enzyme solution was then incubated at 45 °C for 10 min. The extinction coefficient for the enzyme-bound flavin was determined from the change in absorbance spectrum due to the release of FMN. The concentration of free FMN was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 12,500m−1 cm−1 at 445 nm. Additions of a concentrated stock solution of sodium sulfite were made to 1-ml samples of 14 μm R187M to a final sulfite concentration in the range of 5–100 μm. The reactions were followed by bleaching of the enzyme absorbance spectrum, and the rates and extent of complex formation estimated from plots of the decrease in absorbance at 460 nm with time. Details of stopped flow instrumentation and analysis programs have been described previously (26Hunt J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18904-18914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loading and reaction syringes of the stopped flow apparatus were filled overnight with an enzymatic oxygen-scrubbing system consisting of protocatechuate dioxygenase (0.2 units ml−1) and protocatechuate (200 μm) to ensure anaerobiosis prior to each experiment. The apparatus was then flushed with anaerobic buffer before loading enzyme and substrate solutions. A solution of R187M at a concentration of 19 μm, containing protocatechuate dioxygenase (0.2 units ml−1), was treated with alternate cycles of evacuation and re-equilibration with oxygen-free argon in a tonometer. Protocatechuate (200 μm) was then added from a side-arm in order to maintain anaerobiosis. One syringe of the stopped flow apparatus was filled with the anaerobic enzyme solution, and the other syringe was filled with an anaerobic solution ofl-lactate. The l-lactate was made anaerobic in its syringe by bubbling with oxygen-free argon for 15 min.l-Lactate concentrations in the range of 100–500 mm (before mixing) were used. The total ionic strength of each l-lactate solution was made up to 600 mmby addition of the appropriate concentration of ammonium sulfate. The reduction of enzyme-bound flavin was followed by the decrease in absorbance at 460 nm. R187M was reduced enzymatically with xanthine oxidase, xanthine, and benzyl viologen. The enzyme solution at a concentration of 19 μm, containing 0.7 μm xanthine oxidase and 1.4 μm benzyl viologen, was treated with alternate cycles of evacuation and reequilibration with oxygen-free argon in a tonometer. Xanthine (470 μm) was then added from a side arm, and the anaerobic enzyme solution was left to reach full reduction overnight. One syringe of the stopped flow apparatus was filled with the reduced enzyme solution, and the other was filled with 10 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, that had been bubbled with varied concentrations of oxygen for 15 min. The oxidation of enzyme-bound flavin was followed by the increase in absorbance at 460 and 375 nm. H2O2 formation by R187M was measured colormetrically by the oxidation of o-dianisidine in the presence of horseradish peroxidase as described previously (9Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).l-Lactate concentrations in the range of 50–250 mm were used, and the total ionic strength of the assays was made up to 300 mm with ammonium sulfate. All assays were carried out in air-saturated buffer. Turnover was measured by following the enzyme absorbance at 458 nm in a stopped flow apparatus.l-Lactate concentrations in the range 2.5–160 mm were used in air-saturated buffer, and so oxygen concentration was limiting. Under these conditions, a steady-state level of reduced enzyme is determined by the relative rates of reduction by l-lactate and oxidation by oxygen, and the absorbance at 458 nm is an indicator of the amount of oxygen consumed at any given time. The data were analyzed according to the method of Gibson et al. (27Gibson Q.H. Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3927-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield values fork cat, K mlactate, and K moxygen. Samples of R187M were slowly reduced with xanthine oxidase, xanthine, and benzyl viologen in the presence of either roseo-FAD (midpoint redox potential (E m) = −246 mV at pH 7.0) or anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (E m = −184 mV at pH 7.0). A 1.16-ml sample of 14 μm R187M containing 35 nm xanthine oxidase, 1 μm benzyl viologen, and redox dye (3.3 μm roseo-FAD or 20 μmanthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate) was treated with alternate cycles of evacuation and re-equilibration with oxygen-free argon in an anaerobic cuvette. Reduction of the system was then started by the addition of 36 μl of 10 mm xanthine from a side arm, and the reaction was followed by changes in the absorbance spectrum between 300 and 700 nm. The extent of reduction of roseo-FAD was estimated from the change in absorbance at 509 nm, which is isosbestic for the reduction of oxidized enzyme to the semiquinone. The extent of semiquinone formation in the presence of roseo-FAD was estimated from the absorbance changes 373 nm, once the absorbance changes at this wavelength due to dye reduction were subtracted using a ratio of absorbance changes at 509 nm to changes at 373 nm of 8.7. The extent of reduction of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate was estimated from the change in absorbance at 418 nm, which is isosbestic for the reduction of the oxidized enzyme to the semiquinone. The extent of enzyme semiquinone formation in the presence of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate was estimated from the absorbance changes at 373 nm, once the absorbance changes at this wavelength due to dye reduction were subtracted using a ratio of absorbance changes at 418 nm to 373 nm of 0.87. In order to calculate the difference in redox potential between the dye and theE ox-E sq couple, the log (ox/red) of the dye was plotted versus the log (ox/sq) of the enzyme-bound flavin according to the method of Minneart (28Minneart K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes were reduced photochemically using glycine as a photoreductant and 5-deazaflavin as a catalyst as described previously (24Sun W. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17226-17233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic stability of the semiquinone was tested by the addition of benzyl viologen from a side arm after the photoreduction was complete. Disproportionation of the semiquinone was then followed until equilibrium was reached. Protocatechuate dioxygenase (0.2 units ml−1) and protocatechuate (200 μm) were also included in order to maintain anaerobiosis. Equal volumes of 18.6 μm R187M and potassium oxalate in the concentration range of 100 mm to 1 m were mixed in a spectrophotometer cell (final concentration, 50 mm to 0.5m). Ammonium sulfate was added to the oxalate solution to bring the final concentration of oxalate plus ammonium sulfate to 0.5m in order to maintain a constant ionic strength for all of the data points. Binding of oxalate to the enzyme was followed by recording the absorbance spectrum between 300 and 700 nm until no further change was noted. The absorbance spectra of R187M in its oxidized, semiquinone, and reduced forms are shown in Fig.3. The spectra of all three species are like those of the wild-type enzyme. The spectrum of oxidized R187M has absorbance peaks at 460 nm (ε = 10, 750m−1 cm−1) and at 373 nm and a ratio of A 280/A 460 of 10.6. The spectrum of the semiquinone form of the enzyme is typical of an anionic semiquinone, with absorbance peaks at 372 nm (ε = 15, 530 m−1 cm−1) and a sharper peak at 404 nm (ε = 13, 150 m−1cm−1). A plot of A 460 versus A 404 (Fig. 3, inset) indicates that the spectrum shown in Fig. 3 represents at least 90% formation of the anionic semiquinone. The absorbance spectrum of H240Q as isolated from E. coli is shown in Fig. 4. It is similar to the wild-type enzyme, with peaks at 372 and 458 nm. However, there is a slight shoulder at 350 nm, and the extinction coefficient at 458 nm is lower than for the wild-type enzyme, with estimates varying from 8300 to 9400 m−1 cm−1 from different batches of enzyme. Another mutant LMO, R293K (21Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7994-8000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., New York1994: 201-210Google Scholar) was isolated in a form with an extinction coefficient at 456 nm of 6,700m−1 cm−1. On treatment with methyl methane-thiosulfonate (MMTS), the A 456 of R293K increased 1.4-fold. This phenomenon was therefore attributed to part of the flavin being in an equilibrium N(5) adduct with a protein cysteine residue (29Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. Yagi K. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., New York1994: 201-210Google Scholar). On treatment with MMTS, the extinction coefficient of H240Q at 458 nm increased to 11,500m−1 cm−1 (Fig. 4). The semiquinone spectrum of H240Q closely resembles that of the wild-type enzyme and of R187M, with peaks at 372 and 404 nm (data not shown). The spectrum of H240Q fully reduced with l-lactate is also essentially identical to those of wild-type enzyme and of R187M. The absorbance changes observed on the addition of sulfite to R187M (Fig. 5) are typical of the formation of a flavin N(5)-sulfite adduct (16Müh U. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7989-7993PubMed Google Scholar, 17Massey V. Müller F. Feldberg R. Schuman M. Sullivan P.A. Howell L.G,. Mayhew S.G. Matthews R.G. Foust G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3999-4006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the rate of formation of this adduct and the concentration of sulfite required for its formation indicate that sulfite binding has been adversely affected by this mutation. The association of sulfite with the enzyme is sufficiently slow to allow measurement of its rate in a standard spectrophotometer, and a plot of apparent first order rate constant versus sulfite concentration (Fig. 5,inset) yields a second order rate constant ofk on = 11.6 m−1s−1 (wild-type enzyme, 1.29 × 104m−1 s−1). From the yintercept, k off is determined as 2.5 × 10−4 s−1 (wild-type enzyme, 7.2 × 10−4 s−1). Thus, the K destimated from kinetic measurements is 21.5 μm, a value much higher than that determined in the same way for the wild-type enzyme, of 5.6 × 10−8m (1Ghisla S. Massey V. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 243-289Google Scholar). The observed 380-fold increase in K d is thus due largely to a decrease in the rate constant of association. TheK d can also be estimated from the total change inA 460 from the reaction at the same sulfite concentrations and yields a K d of 22.2 μm. This value is in excellent agreement with the kinetically determined value. Under anaerobic conditions, R187M is reduced slowly by l-lactate (Fig.6). The reaction was monitored in a stopped flow apparatus by the decrease in flavin absorbance at 460 nm with time. The observed reaction is monophasic, with little or no saturation behavior observed. A linear fit ofk obs versus lactate concentration over the range 50–250 mml-lactate is shown in the inset of Fig. 6, the slope of which yields a second order rate constant of 13.5 m−1min−1. A hyperbolic fit of the same data yielded an apparent K d for l-lactate of 0.9m and a limiting rate of 0.27 min−1. These data contrast greatly with those obtained for wild-type LMO, in which biphasic reactions were observed (9Lockridge O. Massey V. Sullivan P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 8097-8106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first phase of the reaction showed a clear hyperbolic dependence on lactate concentration, yielding a dissociation constant of 50 mm for the binding ofl-lactate to the enzyme, and a limiting rate of 230 s−1. The rate of the second phase of the reaction was independent of lactate concentration and was shown to be due to the dissociation of the reduced enzyme-pyruvate complex. The present data show no evidence of a reduced enzyme-pyruvate complex. The reaction of O2 with reduced R187M was monitored by the increase in flavin absorbance at 460 nm and at 375 nm with time. The reaction at 460 nm appeared to be biphasic. The major phase of the reaction resulted in over 90% of the total absorbance change and shows a linear dependence on O2 concentration. The smaller phase of the reaction is very difficult to fit accurately and was attributed to the presence of a small amount of enzyme-bound flavin semiquinone in the sample. This would have arisen from slight reoxidation of the sample by traces of O2 in the stopped flow apparatus, followed by the one-electron reduction of the reoxidized enzyme by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system used to reduce the enzyme (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The reaction monitored at 375 nm is monophasic and shows the same O2 dependence as the major phase of the reaction observed at 460 nm. Plots ofk obs versus [O2] (data not shown) yield a second order rate constant of 2.6 × 105 and 2.5 × 105m−1 min−1 at 460 and 375 nm, respectively (wild-type enzyme, 5 × 105m−1 min−1). The rate of formation of H2O2 was determined by the oxidation of o-dianisidine in the presence of horseradish peroxidase in air-saturated buffer. Measurements were made at l-lactate concentrations in the range 50–250 mm. The rates of formation of H2O2are similar to the pseudo-first order rate constants measured for the reaction of lactate with R187M in Fig. 6. A plot of turnoverversus l-lactate concentration has a slope of 14.7 m−1 min−1 (data not shown). These data suggest that the reduction of lactate is rate-limiting during enzyme turnover (consistent with the present data on the separate half-reactions) and that all of the enzyme turnover gives rise to H2O2 as a final product. The spectra in Fig. 3 indicate that the one-electron reduction of R187M proceeds via the formation of approximately 90% of an anionic semiquinone. Thermodynamically, this would suggest that the redox potential of theE sq-E red couple is 150 mV below that of the E ox-E sqcouple. However, the apparent stability of the semiquinone form of R187M is due to the slow rate of reaction of this species with reduced methyl viologen rather than its thermodynamic stability. Flavin anionic semiquinone can also be formed from R187M by photoreduction (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Fig.7 shows a sample in which 68% of the enzyme was photoreduced to the semiquinone. This species was stable for several hours. On the addition of 100 μm benzyl viologen, the sample slowly disproportionated, eventually reaching equilibrium after 24 h, when 22% of the photoreduced enzyme remained in the semiquin"

We constructed cDNAs encoding chimeric β-subunits between the gastric H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunits and co-transfected them with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA in HEK-293 cells. A chimeric β-subunit that consists of the cytoplasmic plus transmembrane domains of Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit and the ectodomain of H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit assembled with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and expressed the K+-ATPase activity. Therefore, the whole cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit were replaced by those of Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit without losing the enzyme activity. However, most parts of the ectodomain of H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit were not replaced by the corresponding domains of Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit. Interestingly, the extracellular segment between Cys152 and Cys178, which contains the second disulfide bond, was exchangeable between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase, preserving the K+-ATPase activity intact. Furthermore, the K+-ATPase activity was preserved when the N-terminal first 4 amino acids (67DPYT70) in the ectodomain of H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit were replaced by the corresponding amino acids (63SDFE66) of Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit. The ATPase activity was abolished, however, when 4 amino acids (76QLKS79) in the ectodomain of H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit were replaced by the counterpart (72RVAP75) of Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit, indicating that this region is the most N-terminal one that discriminates the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit from that of Na+,K+-ATPase.

Chow D.C. Smolka A. Forte J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1236: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Gastric H+,K+-ATPase is closely related to Na+,K+-ATPase from the structural and functional viewpoints. Amino acid identity of the α-subunits of these ATPases is as high as 62% (2Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas that of the β-subunit is 29–37% (13Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12123-12126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit was stably assembled with Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit in the microsomal membrane of Xenopus oocytes (14Noguchi S. Maeda M. Futai M. Kawamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and also led to an increased ouabain binding at the plasma membrane, accompanied by increased Rb+ uptake and Na+,K+pump current (15Horisberger J.-D. Jaunin P. Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Sachs G. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19131-19134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained from co-expression in yeast cells (16Eakle K.A. Kim K.S. Kabalin M.A. Farley R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2834-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the contrary, H+,K+-ATPase was not functionally expressed in HEK-293 cells under co-transfection with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNAs (17Asano S. Hoshina S. Nakaie Y. Watanabe T. Sato M. Suzuki Y. Takeguchi N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C669-C674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, there should be some difference in stringency for the functional α-β assembly between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. Recently, there have been several reports for the co-expression of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit with the chimeric β-subunits between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. Chimeric cRNAs between the Na+,K+- and H+,K+-ATPase β-subunits and the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cRNA were co-injected in Xenopus oocytes, and it was found that the transmembrane domain of Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit was important for efficient assembly with the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, and both the transmembrane domain and the ectodomain of the β-subunit modulated the transport activity of Na+,K+ pump (18Jaunin P.

Similar chimeric β-subunits together with the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit were expressed in yeast cells, and it was found that the ectodomain of H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit was primarily responsible for the effect on K+ affinity (19Eakle K.A. Kabalin M.A. Wang S.-G. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6550-6557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the structure of β-subunit was involved in the interaction of Na+,K+-ATPase with Na+ (20Eakle K.A. Lyu R.-M. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13937-13947Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). From the replacement of the first S-S loop segment (Cys127–Cys150) of the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit with the corresponding segment of the H+,K+-ATPase, Arg148 in the β-subunit was found to be essential for the functional expression of Na+,K+-ATPase (21Ueno S. Kusaba M. Takeda K. Maeda M. Futai M. Izumi F. Kawamura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). More recently, several chimeric β-subunits between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase were prepared and expressed with the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit to study the compatibility of these β-subunits for the α-β assembly and Na+,K+-ATPase activity (22Ueno S. Takeda K. Izumi F. Futai M. Schwartz W. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, there have been no reports for the functional expression study on H+,K+-ATPase using chimeric β-subunits between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. In this study, we expressed the chimeric β-subunits, some of which had been constructed previously (22Ueno S. Takeda K. Izumi F. Futai M. Schwartz W. Kawamura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit in HEK-293 cells and studied the compatibility between the H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunits in α-β assembly and functional expression of H+,K+-ATPase. HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) were a kind gift from Dr. Jonathan Lytton (University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada). pcDNA3 vector was obtained from Invitrogen Co. (San Diego, CA).

In the processes to create restriction sites such as EcoRV, SphI, andEcoT22I in the hog H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNA, mutations such as Asp95 → Glu, Ser151 → Ala, and Phe179 → Ile were incorporated, respectively (22Ueno S.

Introduction of site-directed mutations between SnaBI and EcoRV sites of the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit was carried out by sequential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) steps as described elsewhere (6Asano S.

Two kinds of flanking sequence primers were prepared, one is the 5′-flanking sense primer, 5′-GCAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGG-3′ (sequence in pBluescript II vector), and the other is the 3′-flanking antisense primer, 5′-CGTGCTGTCAGACACGTTG-3′ (close to the EcoRV site of the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNA). Additionally, sense and antisense oligonucleotides, each 21 bases long containing mutated bases near the center, were designed (referred as the sense mutating primer and antisense mutating primer). In the first PCR amplification step, the NsH chimeric β-subunit cDNA or H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNA was used as a template DNA. Two fragments were prepared in this step: one between the 5′-flanking sense primer and the antisense mutating primer, and the other between the sense mutating primer and the 3′-flanking antisense primer. Each amplified fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis, combined, and incubated with the 5′-flanking sense primer and the 3′-flanking antisense primer in the second PCR amplification. The amplified fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis, subcloned in pCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector (Stratagene), and sequenced. PCR was routinely carried out in the presence of 200 μm each dNTP, 500 nm primers, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase for 30 cycles. After sequencing, the fragment amplified in the second PCR was digested with AatII and EcoRI and ligated back into the relevant position of the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit or the NsH chimeric β-subunit construct. DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain termination method using an Autoread DNA sequencing kit and an ALFexpress DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell culture of HEK-293 was carried out as described previously (7Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol.

Cells were harvested 2 days after the DNA transfection. Membrane fractions of HEK cells were prepared as described previously (7Asano S. Tega Y. Konishi K. Fujioka M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol.

Anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit antibody, Ab1024, was previously raised against the C-terminal peptide (residues 1024–1034) of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (PGSWWDQELYY) (26Asano S. Arakawa S. Hirasawa M. Sakai H. Ohta M. Ohta K. Takeguchi N. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 30 μg of membrane fraction was treated with Endo H or PNGase F following the manufacturer's instructions. For EndoH digestion, 30 μg of membrane fraction was treated with 10 milliunits of Endo H in a solution containing 0.1% SDS, 1 m 2-mercaptoehanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, at 37 °C overnight. For PNGase F digestion, 30 μg of membrane fraction was treated with 1 unit of PNGase F in a solution containing 0.1% SDS, 1% n-octylglucoside, 1 m2-mercaptoehanol, 30 mm EDTA, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, at 37 °C overnight. Membrane fractions (1 mg) of HEK cells expressing the α-β complex was incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was incubated with an anti-α-subunit antibody, Ab1024, at a 1:100 dilution, and 10 μl of ImmunoPure immobilized protein A (Pierce) at 4 °C for 12 h. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed four times with the lysis buffer followed by two washes in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The pellet was solubilized in the sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The proteins were separated on SDS-polyacylamide gel and blotted. The β-subunit in the blot was detected by an anti-β-subunit antibody, 2B6, in combination with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, which was preabsorbed with rabbit serum. When indicated, the precipitated proteins were deglycosylated, that is, immunoprecipitated samples were treated with PNGase F as described above, solubilized in the sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted. H+,K+-ATPase activity was measured from the decrease in the amount of NADH coupled with regeneration of ATP from ADP (“coupled-enzyme assay”) in 1.2 ml of a reaction mixture containing 50 μg of membrane protein, 3 mm MgCl2, 800 μm ATP, 160 μm NADH, 0.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 3 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.75 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm ouabain, 15 mm KCl, and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The decrease in the amount of NADH was measured at 37 °C from the absorbance at 340 nm by a Beckman spectrophotometer as described elsewhere (27Morii M. Hayata Y. Mizoguchi K. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4068-4072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). H+,K+-ATPase activity, defined as the SCH 28080-sensitive K+-ATPase, was calculated as the difference between the K+-ATPase activities in the presence and absence of 50 μm SCH 28080. When the K+-ATPase activity was measured as a function of K+ concentrations, the ATPase activity was measured from the measurement of inorganic phosphate released from ATP. K+-ATPase activity was measured in 1 ml of solution containing 50 μg of membrane protein, 3 mmMgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 5 mmNaN3, 2 mm ouabain, and 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, in the presence and absence of various concentrations of KCl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold stop solution containing 12% perchloric acid and 3.6% ammonium molybdate. Inorganic phosphate released was measured from the absorbance at the wavelength of 320 nm as described elsewhere (28Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The K+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between activities in the presence and absence of KCl. The K+-ATPase activity was sensitive to 50 μm SCH 28080. Inorganic phosphate released in the enzyme reaction with the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase was 4–5 times higher than the background level of inorganic phosphate released in the absence of enzyme. Values of K+-ATPase activity measured from colorimetric assay of released inorganic phosphate were comparable with those measured in coupled enzyme assay. Protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard. First, we used two series of chimeric β-subunits that were constructed using β-subunits of hog gastric H+,K+-ATPase and T. californica Na+,K+-ATPase as shown in Fig.1. One set of chimeras (NxH series) was prepared by successively exchanging 5′-portion of the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNA with the corresponding portion of the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNA (Fig. 1 A). The other set of chimeras (HxNyH series) was prepared by replacing a middle portion of the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit (between adjacent unique restriction sites) with the corresponding portion of the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit (Fig.1 B). Fig.2 shows Western blot patterns of the membrane fractions of the transfectants, detected by using an anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit antibody. When the cells were transfected with the wild-type α-subunit cDNA in the absence of the β-subunit cDNA, a single faint band was detected around 95 kDa, which represents the expression of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (lane 8 in both panels A and B in Fig. 2). The expression of the α-subunit increased when the cells were co-transfected with the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNA (lane 1 in both panels A and B in Fig.2). A similar increase in expression of the α-subunit was also observed when the cells were co-transfected with the NsH chimeric β-subunit cDNA (lane 2 in both panels A andB in Fig. 2) or HpNeH chimeric β-subunit cDNA (lane 6 in Fig. 2 B). However, there was no increased expression of the α-subunit when co-expressed with other chimeric β-subunits including NvH, NmH, NpH, NeH (Fig.2 A), HsNvH, HvNmH, HmNpH, and HeN chimeras (Fig.2 B) and the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit (lane 7 in Fig. 2 A). Fig. 3 shows Western blot patterns of the membrane fractions of the transfectants, detected by using an anti-gastric H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit antibody, 2B6 (23Toh B. Gleeson P.A. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Callaghan J.M. Goldkorn I. Jones C.M. Martinelli T.M. Mu F. Humphris D.C. Pettitt J.M. Mori Y. Masuda T. Sobieszczuk P. Weinstock J. Mantamadiotis T. Baldwin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6418-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The epitope of this monoclonal antibody is located on the C-terminal of the β-subunit. Therefore, this antibody reacted neither with the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit (lane 7 in Fig. 3 A) nor HeN chimera (lane 7 in Fig. 3 B). When the cells were co-transfected with both the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit and β-subunit cDNAs, dense doublet bands with a lower molecular mass (48–50 kDa) (βc) and a smear band with a higher molecular mass (60–70 kDa) (βm) were observed (lane 1 in both panels A and B in Fig.3). Similar patterns were observed when the cells were co-transfected with the α-subunit cDNA plus NsH (lane 2 in bothpanels A and B in Fig. 3), HvNmH (lane 4 in Fig. 3 B), or HpNeH chimeric β-subunit cDNA (lane 6 in Fig. 3 B). The β-subunits with higher molecular masses (60–70 kDa) (βm) were resistant to Endo H, while they were digested with PNGase F. After treatment with PNGase F, molecular mass of the β-subunit decreased from 60–70 kDa to about 30 kDa (protein core of the β-subunit) (data not shown). On the other hand, the β-subunits with lower molecular masses (40–48 kDa) (βc) were digested with both Endo H and PNGase F, resulting in the appearance of single bands with about 30 kDa (data not shown). These results indicate that the 60–70-kDa band represents the β-subunit with complex-type (Endo H-resistant) carbohydrate chains and that the bands with lower molecular masses (around 40–48 kDa) represent the β-subunits with high mannose-type (Endo H-sensitive) carbohydrate chains. Therefore, some part of the wild-type, NsH, HvNmH, and HpNeH chimeric β-subunits are supposed to leave an endoplasmic reticulum compartment. However, no smear band with a higher molecular mass (βm) was observed when the cells were co-transfected with the α-subunit cDNA plus other chimeric β-subunit cDNAs such as NvH, NmH, NpH, NeH, HsNvH, and HmNpH cDNAs. The apparent molecular masses of the bands with smaller size (βc) was variable in the chimeric β-subunits. There are six putativeN-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)) in the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit and three in the wild-type Torpedo Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit as shown in Fig. 1. All of the putativeN-glycosylation sites have been shown to contain carbohydrate chains in both ATPases (29Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tyagarajan K. Lipniunas P.H. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10200-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Beggah A.T. Jaunin P. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10318-10326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The present chimeric β-subunits contain different numbers of putativeN-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). This gave different apparent molecular masses for βc as shown on the gels (Fig.3). Fig.4 (A and B) shows Western blot patterns of the samples immunoprecipitated with the anti-α-subunit antibody and then detected with the anti-β-subunit antibody, 2B6. In Fig. 4 (A and B), every lane shows a nonspecific band with a molecular mass of 60 kDa. This band was observed even when the immunoprecipitation reaction was carried out in the absence of membrane fraction or when the cells were transfected only with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA (data not shown). Although the anti-mouse secondary antibody used in the Western blot had been pre-absorbed with rabbit serum, the antibody was likely to cross-react with the rabbit antibody. The anti-α-antibody co-precipitated proteins with molecular masses of 70 kDa (βm in panels A and B in Figs. 4) and 48 kDa (βc in panels A andB in Fig. 4) when the cells were co-transfected with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA plus wild-type H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit (lane 1 in both panels A and B in Fig. 4), chimeric β-subunit NsH (lane 2 in Fig. 4A), or HpNeH cDNA (lane 5 in Fig. 4 B). This pattern was similar to that observed in the Western blot of the β-subunits in the membrane fractions (Fig. 3). On the other hand, no β-subunit-related band was observed when the cells were transfected only with the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit cDNA (data not shown). When the cells were co-transfected with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA plus chimeric β-subunit NvH, NmH, NpH, NeH (Fig. 4 A), HsNvH, HvNmH, or HmNpH (Fig. 4 B) cDNAs, a single band or doublet bands with molecular mass of 40–48 kDa (βc) were observed. The amount of these bands was much smaller than those observed in the samples with the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit (lane 1 in both panels A andB in Fig. 4), NsH chimera (lane 2 in Fig.4 A), or HpNeH chimera (lane 5 in Fig.4 B). When the precipitated samples were treated with PNGase F, the molecular mass of the bands shifted to 30–35 kDa on the blot (CP in panels C and D in Fig. 4), indicating that the precipitated proteins detected with 2B6 were the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit or its chimeric β-subunits. The bands with molecular masses of 70 kDa represent the β-subunits with complex-type carbohydrate chains (βm), and those around 48 kDa represent the β-subunits with high mannose-type carbohydrate chains (βc). These results indicate that all the chimeric β-subunits as well as the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit assembled with H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. As shown in Fig. 2, the NsH chimeric β-subunit increased the expression of the α-subunit in the membrane, whereas the NvH chimeric β-subunit did not. Therefore, it is likely that some structure that is important for the stabilization of the α-subunit is located in the portion between Tyr45(SnaBI site) and Ile96 (EcoRV site) of the β-subunit. Because Tyr45 is in the transmembrane domain (from Trp37 to Ile66) located about one quarter of the domain length from the cytoplasmic/membrane boundary, it is not clear whether the whole transmembrane domain of the H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit is replaceable with the corresponding domain of the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit, preserving its ability to stabilize the α-subunit in the membrane. Here, we constructed a new chimera termed NNH (Fig.1 A) by replacing the whole cytoplasmic plus transmembrane domains of H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit with the corresponding domains of Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunits. As shown in Fig. 5, the expression level of the α-subunit was similar between the cells expressing the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase α-β complex (lane 1) and α-NNH complex (lane 2). Therefore, the chimeric H+,K+-ATPase β-subunit, in which the whole cytoplasmic plus transmembrane domains were replaced with the corresponding domains of the Na+,K+-ATPase β-subunit, stabilized the α-subunit in the membrane. The anti-α-antibody also co-precipitated β-subunit proteins with molecular masses of 70 kDa (βmin Fig. 6 A) and 48 kDa (βc in Fig. 6 A) when the cells were co-transfected with the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA plus NNH chimera (lane 1 in Fig. 6).Figure 6Western blots with the anti-β-subunit antibody of the membrane fraction of HEK cells immunoprecipitated with the anti-α-subunit antibody. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with the wild-type H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit cDNA plus NNH (lanes 1), SDFE (lanes 2) or RAVP (lanes 3) cDNAs. The solubilized membrane fractions were incubated with an anti-α-subunit antibody, Ab1024, and protein A-coated beads. The precipitated preparations were treated with (B) or without PNGase F (A), separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted with anti-β-subunit antibody, 2B6. βm, βC, and CP represent the β-subunit with complex-type (mature) carbohydrate chains and that with high mannose type (core) carbohydrate chains and c"

 Carl Djerassi
 --who launched the sexual revolution of the 1960s when he synthesized the first steroid oral contraceptive--discusses how the start of the new millennium will be the era of conception (at least in the affluent countries of the world). This contrasts with the last 50 years of the 20th century, which, thanks to the Pill, were the decades of contraception. Djerassi discusses the ethical and social implications of the continued improvements to assisted reproductive technologies (ART), which are enabling older women to conceive and bear children even beyond menopause."
