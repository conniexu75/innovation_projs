https://openalex.org/W1496181682,"Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are the dominant product of eukaryotic transcription. These products range from short microRNAs (miRNAs) to long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). Circular RNAs composed of exonic sequences represent an understudied form of ncRNA that was discovered more than 20 years ago. Using a TaqMan-based reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay, we analyzed the relationship between cir-ITCH expression and colorectal cancer (CRC) in a total of 45 CRCs and paired adjacent non-tumor tissue samples. We found that cir-ITCH expression was typically down-regulated in CRC compared to the peritumoral tissue. This result, as well as several follow-up experiments, showed that cir-ITCH could increase the level of ITCH, which is involved in the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Therefore, our results showed that cir-ITCH plays a role in CRC by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1202082646,"Trichoderma harzianum strain SQR-T037 is a biocontrol agent that has been shown to enhance the uptake of nutrients (macro- and microelements) by plants in fields. The objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of SQR-T037 to P and microelement (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) nutrition in tomato plants grown in soil and in hydroponic conditions. Inoculation with SQR-T037 significantly improved the biomass and nutrient uptake of tomato seedlings grown in a nutrient-limiting soil. So we investigated the capability of SQR-T037 to solubilise sparingly soluble minerals in vitro via four known mechanisms: acidification by organic acids, chelation by siderophores, redox by ferric reductase and hydrolysis by phytase. SQR-T037 was able to solubilise phytate, Fe2O3, CuO, and metallic Zn but not Ca3(PO4)2 or MnO2. Organic acids, including lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid and succinic acid, were detected by HPLC and LC/MS in two Trichoderma cultures. Additionally, we inoculated tomato seedlings with SQR-T037 using a hydroponic system with specific nutrient deficiencies (i.e., nutrient solutions deficient in P, Fe, Cu or Zn and supplemented with their corresponding solid minerals) to better study the effects of Trichoderma inoculation on plant growth and nutrition. Inoculated seedlings grown in Cu-deficient hydroponic conditions exhibited increases in dry plant biomass (92%) and Cu uptake (42%) relative to control plants. However, we did not observe a significant effect on seedling biomass in plants grown in the Fe- and Zn-deficient hydroponic conditions; by contrast, the biomass decreased by 82% in the P-deficient hydroponic condition. Thus, we demonstrated that Trichoderma SQR-T037 competed for P (phytate) and Zn with tomato seedlings by suppressing root development, releasing phytase and/or chelating minerals. The results of this study suggest that the induction of increased or suppressed plant growth occurs through the direct effect of T. harzianum on root development, in combination with indirect mechanisms, such as mineral solubilisation (including solubilisation via acidification, redox, chelation and hydrolysis)."
https://openalex.org/W1165005403,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by well-known motor symptoms, whereas the presence of cognitive non-motor symptoms, such as emotional disturbances, is still underestimated. One of the major problems in studying emotion deficits in PD is an atomising approach that does not take into account different levels of emotion elaboration. Our study addressed the question of whether people with PD exhibit difficulties in one or more specific dimensions of emotion processing, investigating three different levels of analyses, that is, recognition, representation, and regulation.Thirty-two consecutive medicated patients with PD and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Participants performed a three-level analysis assessment of emotional processing using quantitative standardised emotional tasks: the Ekman 60-Faces for emotion recognition, the full 36-item version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes (RME) for emotion representation, and the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) for emotion regulation.Regarding emotion recognition, patients obtained significantly worse scores than controls in the total score of Ekman 60-Faces but not in any other basic emotions. For emotion representation, patients obtained significantly worse scores than controls in the RME experimental score but no in the RME gender control task. Finally, on emotion regulation, PD and controls did not perform differently at TAS-20 and no specific differences were found on TAS-20 subscales. The PD impairments on emotion recognition and representation do not correlate with dopamine therapy, disease severity, or with the duration of illness. These results are independent from other cognitive processes, such as global cognitive status and executive function, or from psychiatric status, such as depression, anxiety or apathy.These results may contribute to better understanding of the emotional problems that are often seen in patients with PD and the measures used to test these problems, in particular on the use of different versions of the RME task."
https://openalex.org/W1100159290,"In industrial and organizational psychology, there is a long tradition of studying personality as an antecedent of work outcomes. Recently, however, scholars have suggested that personality characteristics may not only predict, but also change due to certain work experiences, a notion that is depicted in the dynamic developmental model (DDM) of personality and work. Upward job changes are an important part of employees’ careers and career success in particular, and we argue that these career transitions can shape personality over time. In this study, we investigate the Big Five personality characteristics as both predictors and outcomes of upward job changes into managerial and professional positions. We tested our hypotheses by applying event history analyses and propensity score matching to a longitudinal dataset collected over five years from employees in Australia. Results indicated that participants’ openness to experience not only predicted, but that changes in openness to experience also followed from upward job changes into managerial and professional positions. Our findings thus provide support for a dynamic perspective on personality characteristics in the context of work and careers."
https://openalex.org/W753208388,"A population of 178 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed using a single seed descendant from a cross between G. hirsutum. acc DH962 and G. hirsutum. cv Jimian5, was used to construct a genetic map and to map QTL for fiber and yield traits. A total of 644 polymorphic loci were used to construct a final genetic map, containing 616 loci and spanning 2016.44 cM, with an average of 3.27 cM between adjacent markers. Statistical analysis revealed that segregation distortion in the intraspecific population was more serious than that in the interspecific population. The RIL population and the two parents were phenotyped under 8 environments (two locations, six years), revealing a total of 134 QTL, including 64 for fiber qualities and 70 for yield components, independently detected in seven environments, explaining 4.40–15.28% of phenotypic variation (PV). Among the 134 QTL, 9 common QTL were detected in more than one environment, and 22 QTL and 19 new QTL were detected in combined analysis (E9). A total of 26 QTL hotspot regions were observed on 13 chromosomes and 2 larger linkage groups, and some QTL clusters related to fiber qualities or yield components were also observed. The results obtained in the present study suggested that to map accurate QTL in crops with larger plant types, such as cotton, phenotyping under multiple environments is necessary to effectively apply the obtained results in molecular marker-assisted selection breeding and QTL cloning."
https://openalex.org/W809661071,"Adoptive T cell therapy represents a promising treatment for cancer. Human T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognize and kill tumor cells in a MHC-unrestricted manner and persist in vivo when the CAR includes a CD28 costimulatory domain. However, the intensity of the CAR-mediated CD28 activation signal and its regulation by the CTLA-4 checkpoint are unknown. We investigated whether T cells expressing an anti-CD19, CD3 zeta and CD28-based CAR (19-28z) displayed the same proliferation and anti-tumor abilities than T cells expressing a CD3 zeta-based CAR (19z1) costimulated through the CD80/CD28, ligand/receptor pathway. Repeated in vitro antigen-specific stimulations indicated that 19-28z+ T cells secreted higher levels of Th1 cytokines and showed enhanced proliferation compared to those of 19z1+ or 19z1-CD80+ T cells. In an aggressive pre-B cell leukemia model, mice treated with 19-28z+ T cells had 10-fold reduced tumor progression compared to those treated with 19z1+ or 19z1-CD80+ T cells. shRNA-mediated CTLA-4 down-regulation in 19z1-CD80+ T cells significantly increased their in vivo expansion and anti-tumor properties, but had no effect in 19-28z+ T cells. Our results establish that CTLA-4 down-regulation may benefit human adoptive T cell therapy and demonstrate that CAR design can elude negative checkpoints to better sustain T cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1524971550,"Gene expression analysis in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) fruit has drawn considerable attention with the availability of genome sequences to understand the regulatory mechanism of fruit development and to improve its quality. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a routine technique for gene expression analysis. However, appropriate reference genes for transcript normalization in watermelon fruits have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of 12 genes for their potential use as reference genes in watermelon fruits. Expression variations of these genes were measured in 48 samples obtained from 12 successive developmental stages of parthenocarpic and fertilized fruits of two watermelon genotypes by using qRT-PCR analysis. Considering the effects of genotype, fruit setting method, and developmental stage, geNorm determined clathrin adaptor complex subunit (ClCAC), β-actin (ClACT), and alpha tubulin 5 (ClTUA5) as the multiple reference genes in watermelon fruit. Furthermore, ClCAC alone or together with SAND family protein (ClSAND) was ranked as the single or two best reference genes by NormFinder. By using the top-ranked reference genes to normalize the transcript abundance of phytoene synthase (ClPSY1), a good correlation between lycopene accumulation and ClPSY1 expression pattern was observed in ripening watermelon fruit. These validated reference genes will facilitate the accurate measurement of gene expression in the studies on watermelon fruit biology."
https://openalex.org/W854599702,"Streptococcus suis, more particularly serotype 2, is a major swine pathogen and an emerging zoonotic agent worldwide that mainly causes meningitis, septicemia, endocarditis, and pneumonia. Although several potential virulence factors produced by S. suis have been identified in the last decade, the pathogenesis of S. suis infections is still not fully understood. In the present study, we showed that S. suis produces membrane vesicles (MVs) that range in diameter from 13 to 130 nm and that appear to be coated by capsular material. A proteomic analysis of the MVs revealed that they contain 46 proteins, 9 of which are considered as proven or suspected virulence factors. Biological assays confirmed that S. suis MVs possess active subtilisin-like protease (SspA) and DNase (SsnA). S. suis MVs degraded neutrophil extracellular traps, a property that may contribute to the ability of the bacterium to escape the host defense response. MVs also activated the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway in both monocytes and macrophages, inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may in turn contribute to increase the permeability of the blood brain barrier. The present study brought evidence that S. suis MVs may play a role as a virulence factor in the pathogenesis of S. suis infections, and given their composition be an excellent candidate for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2148840139,"Indices of relative abundance do not control for variation in detectability, which can bias density estimates such that ecological processes are difficult to infer. Distance sampling methods can be used to correct for detectability, but in rainforest, where dense vegetation and diverse assemblages complicate sampling, information is lacking about factors affecting their application. Rare species present an additional challenge, as data may be too sparse to fit detection functions. We present analyses of distance sampling data collected for a diverse tropical rainforest bird assemblage across broad elevational and latitudinal gradients in North Queensland, Australia. Using audio and visual detections, we assessed the influence of various factors on Effective Strip Width (ESW), an intuitively useful parameter, since it can be used to calculate an estimate of density from count data. Body size and species exerted the most important influence on ESW, with larger species detectable over greater distances than smaller species. Secondarily, wet weather and high shrub density decreased ESW for most species. ESW for several species also differed between summer and winter, possibly due to seasonal differences in calling behavior. Distance sampling proved logistically intensive in these environments, but large differences in ESW between species confirmed the need to correct for detection probability to obtain accurate density estimates. Our results suggest an evidence-based approach to controlling for factors influencing detectability, and avenues for further work including modeling detectability as a function of species characteristics such as body size and call characteristics. Such models may be useful in developing a calibration for non-distance sampling data and for estimating detectability of rare species."

In-house software YACTA quantified automatically lung density histogram (10th-90th percentile in 5th percentile steps). Longitudinal changes in VSs and in the percentiles of attenuation histogram were obtained in 20 untreated patients and 20 patients treated with pirfenidone. Pearson correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between VSs and selected percentiles.In follow-up MDCT, visual overall extent of parenchymal abnormalities (OE) increased in median by 5%/year (interquartile: 0%/y; +11%/y). Substantial difference was found between treated and untreated patients in HU changes of the 40th and of the 80th percentiles of density histogram. Correlation analysis between VSs and selected percentiles showed higher correlation between the changes (Δ) in OE and Δ 40th percentile (r=0.69; p<0.001) as compared to Δ 80th percentile (r=0.58; p<0.001); closer correlation was found between Δ ground-glass extent and Δ 40th percentile (r=0.66, p<0.001) as compared to Δ 80th percentile (r=0.47, p=0.002), while the Δ reticulations correlated better with the Δ 80th percentile (r=0.56, p<0.001) in comparison to Δ 40th percentile (r=0.43, p=0.003).There is a relevant and fully automatically measurable difference at MDCT in VSs and in histogram analysis at one year follow-up of IPF patients, whether treated or untreated: Δ 40th percentile might reflect the change in overall extent of lung abnormalities, notably of ground-glass pattern; furthermore Δ 80th percentile might reveal the course of reticular opacities."
https://openalex.org/W1840422911,"The incidence of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium hospital infections has been steadily increasing. With the goal of discovering new vaccine antigens, we systematically fractionated and purified four distinct surface carbohydrates from E. faecium endocarditis isolate Tx16, shown previously to be resistant to phagocytosis in the presence of human serum. The two most abundant polysaccharides consist of novel branched heteroglycan repeating units that include signature sugars altruronic acid and legionaminic acid, respectively. A minor high molecular weight polysaccharide component was recognized as the fructose homopolymer levan, and a glucosylated lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was identified in a micellar fraction. The polysaccharides were conjugated to the CRM197 carrier protein, and the resulting glycoconjugates were used to immunize rabbits. Rabbit immune sera were evaluated for their ability to kill Tx16 in opsonophagocytic assays and in a mouse passive protection infection model. Although antibodies raised against levan failed to mediate opsonophagocytic killing, the other glycoconjugates induced effective opsonic antibodies, with the altruronic acid-containing polysaccharide antisera showing the greatest opsonophagocytic assay activity. Antibodies directed against either novel heteroglycan or the LTA reduced bacterial load in mouse liver or kidney tissue. To assess antigen prevalence, we screened a diverse collection of blood isolates (n = 101) with antibodies to the polysaccharides. LTA was detected on the surface of 80% of the strains, and antigens recognized by antibodies to the two major heteroglycans were co-expressed on 63% of these clinical isolates. Collectively, these results represent the first steps toward identifying components of a glycoconjugate vaccine to prevent E. faecium infection.

https://openalex.org/W2337115100,"Frequent extreme heat events are the serious threat to rice production, but the historical trend of heat stress associated with phenology shift and its impact on rice yield over a long period are poorly known. Based on the analysis of observed climate and phenology data from 228 stations in South China during 1981-2010, the spatio-temporal variation of post-heading heat stress was investigated among two single-season rice sub-regions in the northern Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River (S-NMLYtz) and Southwest Plateau (S-SWP), and two double-season early rice sub-regions in the southern Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River (DE-SMLYtz) and Southern China (DE-SC). Post-heading heat stress was more severe in DE-SMLYtz, west S-NMLYtz and east S-SWP than elsewhere, because of rice exposure to the hot season during post-heading stage. The spatial variation of post-heading heat stress was greater in single-season rice region than in double-season early rice region due to the greater spatial variation of heading and maturity dates. Post-heading heat stress increased from 1981 to 2010 in most areas, with significant increases in the east of double-season early rice region and west S-SWP. Phenology shift during 1981-2010 mitigated the increasing trends of heat stress in most areas, but not in west S-SWP. Post-heading heat stress played a dominated role in the reduction of rice yield in South China. Grain yield was more sensitive to post-heading heat stress in double-season early rice region than that in single-season rice region. Rice yield decreased by 1.5%, 6.2%, 9.7% and 4.6% in S-NMLYtz, S-SWP, DE-SMLYtz and DE-SC, respectively, because of post-heading heat stress during 1981-2010, although there were some uncertainties. Given the current level and potential increase of post-heading heat stress in South China, the specific adaptation or mitigation strategies are necessary for different sub-regions to stabilize rice production under heat stress."
https://openalex.org/W792457189,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in peripheral blood has been suggested as risk modifier in various types of cancer. However, its influence on melanoma risk is unclear. We evaluated the association between mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood and melanoma risk in 500 melanoma cases and 500 healthy controls from an ongoing melanoma study. The mtDNA copy number was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Overall, mean mtDNA copy number was significantly higher in cases than in controls (1.15 vs 0.99, P<0.001). Increased mtDNA copy number was associated with a 1.45-fold increased risk of melanoma (95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.97). Significant joint effects between mtDNA copy number and variables related to pigmentation and history of sunlight exposure were observed. This study supports an association between increased mtDNA copy number and melanoma risk that is independent on the known melanoma risk factors (pigmentation and history of sunlight exposure)."
https://openalex.org/W800360063,"Cationic cell-penetrating peptides have been widely used to enhance the intracellular delivery of various types of cargoes, such as drugs and proteins. These reagents are chemically similar to the multi-basic peptides that are known to be potent proprotein convertase inhibitors. Here, we report that both HIV-1 TAT47-57 peptide and the Chariot reagent are micromolar inhibitors of furin activity in vitro. In agreement, HIV-1 TAT47-57 reduced HT1080 cell migration, thought to be mediated by proprotein convertases, by 25%. In addition, cyclic polyarginine peptides containing hydrophobic moieties which have been previously used as transfection reagents also exhibited potent furin inhibition in vitro and also inhibited intracellular convertases. Our finding that cationic cell-penetrating peptides exert potent effects on cellular convertase activity should be taken into account when biological effects are assessed."
https://openalex.org/W953521445,"Thrombin is a serine protease of the chymotrypsin family that acts both as a procoagulant and as an anticoagulant by cleaving either factor VIII, factor V and fibrinogen or protein C, respectively. Numerous previous studies have shown that electropositive regions at a distance from the active site, so called exosites, are of major importance for the cleavage by human thrombin. Upstream of all the known major cleavage sites for thrombin in factor VIII, factor V and fibrinogen are clusters of negatively charged amino acids. To study the importance of these sites for the interaction with the exosites and thereby the cleavage by thrombin, we have developed a new type of recombinant substrate. We have compared the cleavage rate of the minimal cleavage site, involving only 8-9 amino acids (typically the P4-P4' positions) surrounding the cleavage site, with the substrates also containing the negatively charged regions upstream of the cleavage sites. The results showed that addition of these regions enhanced the cleavage rate by more than fifty fold. However, the enhancement was highly dependent on the sequence of the actual cleavage site. A minimal site that showed poor activity by itself could be cleaved as efficiently as an optimal cleavage site when presented together with these negatively charged regions. Whereas sites conforming closely to the optimal site were only minimally enhanced by the addition of these regions. The possibility to mimic this interaction for the sites in factor V and factor VIII by recombinant substrates, which do not have the same folding as the full size target, indicates that the enhancement was primarily dependent on a relatively simple electrostatic interaction. However, the situation was very different for fibrinogen and protein C where other factors than only charge is of major importance."
https://openalex.org/W939925800,"Association mapping is a powerful approach to detect associations between traits of interest and genetic markers based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in molecular plant breeding. In this study, 150 accessions of worldwide originated durum wheat germplasm (Triticum turgidum spp. durum) were genotyped using 1,366 SNP markers. The extent of LD on each chromosome was evaluated. Association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers with ten agronomic traits measured in four consecutive years was analyzed under a mix linear model (MLM). Two hundred and one significant association pairs were detected in the four years. Several markers were associated with one trait, and also some markers were associated with multiple traits. Some of the associated markers were in agreement with previous quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses. The function and homology analyses of the corresponding ESTs of some SNP markers could explain many of the associations for plant height, length of main spike, number of spikelets on main spike, grain number per plant, and 1000-grain weight, etc. The SNP associations for the observed traits are generally clustered in specific chromosome regions of the wheat genome, mainly in 2A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 1B, and 6B chromosomes. This study demonstrates that association mapping can complement and enhance previous QTL analyses and provide additional information for marker-assisted selection."

The objectives of the current study were to analyse and model the relationships among climate, vector and malaria disease in district of Visakhapatnam, India to understand malaria transmission mechanism (MTM).Epidemiological, vector and climate data were analysed for the years 2005 to 2011 in Visakhapatnam to understand the magnitude, trends and seasonal patterns of the malarial disease. Statistical software MINITAB ver. 14 was used for performing correlation, linear and multiple regression analysis.Perennial malaria disease incidence and mosquito population was observed in the district of Visakhapatnam with peaks in seasons. All the climatic variables have a significant influence on disease incidence as well as on mosquito populations. Correlation coefficient analysis, seasonal index and seasonal analysis demonstrated significant relationships among climatic factors, mosquito population and malaria disease incidence in the district of Visakhapatnam, India. Multiple regression and ARIMA (I) models are best suited models for modeling and prediction of disease incidences and mosquito population. Predicted values of average temperature, mosquito population and malarial cases increased along with the year. Developed MTM algorithm observed a major MTM cycle following the June to August rains and occurring between June to September and minor MTM cycles following March to April rains and occurring between March to April in the district of Visakhapatnam. Fluctuations in climatic factors favored an increase in mosquito populations and thereby increasing the number of malarial cases. Rainfall, temperatures (20°C to 33°C) and humidity (66% to 81%) maintained a warmer, wetter climate for mosquito growth, parasite development and malaria transmission.Changes in climatic factors influence malaria directly by modifying the behaviour and geographical distribution of vectors and by changing the length of the life cycle of the parasite."

Furthermore, the endogenous metal sensors are shown to out-compete FrmR. The metal-sensing FrmRE64H mutant has tighter metal affinities than FrmR by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Gain of cobalt sensing by FrmRE64H remains enigmatic because the cobalt affinity of FrmRE64H is substantially weaker than that of the endogenous cobalt sensor.

One facet of the solution is that the kinetics of access to different metals can vary from sensor to sensor, for example due to interactions with specific donor molecules, including metallochaperones (1Foster A.W.

Thus, a weaker binding metal can nonetheless be more effective at triggering the conformational changes that alter gene expression (10McGuire A.M. Cuthbert B.J. Ma Z. Grauer-Gray K.D.

For metal-dependent de-repressors and co-repressors the coupling free energy, ΔGCmetal-sensor·DNA, is typically larger for more effective metals (9Guerra A.J. Giedroc D.P. Metal site occupancy and allosteric switching in bacterial metal sensor proteins.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2012; 519: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, here we see how a metal can also become effective without increasing ΔGCmetal-sensor·DNA, if KDNA of the apo-form of a de-repressor is suitably weakened, to confer two mechanistic advantages in favor of Zn(II)- detection. Contrary to general dogma, here ΔGCZn(II)-sensor·DNA is smaller in the Zn(II)-sensing mutant relative to the nonsensing wild type protein. In the course of a collaborative program to characterize the complement of metal sensors from Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain SL1344 (hereafter referred to as Salmonella), we identified two genes encoding proteins with sequence similarity to members of the CsoR/RcnR family of DNA-binding and metal-responsive transcriptional de-repressors (14Higgins K.A.

Blattner F.R. Global transcriptional effects of a suppressor tRNA and the inactivation of the regulator frmR.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CsoR forms a three helix bundle that assembles into tetramers (15Liu T. Ramesh A. Ma Z. Ward S.K. Zhang L. George G.N. Talaat A.M. Sacchettini J.C. Giedroc D.P. CsoR is a novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis copper-sensing transcriptional regulator.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The sensory Cu(I) site exploits a conserved Cys-thiolate from the N-terminal end of helix α2 of one subunit in combination with an HXXXC motif from within helix α2′ of a second subunit (Fig. 1A) (15Liu T.

Three ligands in similar locations (with HXXXC replaced by HXXXH), along with additional ones from the N-terminal region of helix α1′, are recruited to the sensory metal site of RcnR (Fig. 1B) (17Iwig J.S.

A single residue variant of E. coli RcnR (H3E) also responds to Zn(II) (31Higgins K.A. Chivers P.T. Maroney M.J.

In a global screen to discover the consequences of the read-through of amber stop codons, E. coli FrmR (which has such a stop) emerged as the transcriptional repressor of the frmRAB operon (30Herring C.D. Blattner F.R. Global transcriptional effects of a suppressor tRNA and the inactivation of the regulator frmR.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). FrmA has formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and the operon was subsequently shown to respond to exogenous formaldehyde (30Herring C.D. Blattner F.R.

Purification, characterization, and partial sequence of the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli: a Class III alcohol dehydrogenase.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This operon is de-repressed during anaerobic respiration using trimethylamine N-oxide as the terminal electron acceptor where endogenous formaldehyde is generated as a by-product of trimethylamine N-oxide demethylation (34Denby K.J. Rolfe M.D. Crick E. Sanguinetti G. Poole R.K. Green J. Adaptation of anaerobic cultures of Escherichia coli K-12 in response to environmental trimethylamine-N-oxide.Environ.

Al-Shahrour F. Dopazo J. Saraiva L.M.

Microbiol. 2009; 75: 6110-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). There are no published studies of the Salmonella FrmR homologue. At least two potential metal ligands are retained in Salmonella FrmR, namely Cys at the N terminus of helix α2 but HXXXE (rather than HXXXH of paralogous Salmonella RcnR) at helix α2′ (Fig. 1, A and B). Despite sequence similarity between FrmR and other CsoR/RcnR family members, whether or not (any) FrmRs de-repress gene expression in response to metals remains untested. Recent studies have shown that relative affinity, relative allostery, and relative access determine the ability of metal sensors to respond selectively in vivo (1Foster A.W. Osman D. Robinson N.J. Metal preferences and metallation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 28095-28103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This is exemplified by comparing metal affinities (Kmetal) and metal-responsive allostery (ΔGCmetal-sensor·DNA) among multiple metal sensors, and for multiple metals in Synechocystis PCC 6803 (1Foster A.W. Osman D. Robinson N.J. Metal preferences and metallation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 28095-28103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Patterson C.J. Pernil R.

Chem. 2012; 287: 12142-12151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, InrS responds to nickel in vivo and has a KNi(II) that is substantially tighter than KNi(II) of cobalt-sensing CoaR and Zn(II)-sensing ZiaR or Zur (a representative from each family of metal sensors that is present in this organism) (18Foster A.W. Patterson C.J. Pernil R. Hess C.R. Robinson N.J. Cytosolic Ni(II) sensor in cyanobacterium: nickel detection follows nickel affinity across four families of metal sensors.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 12142-12151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Provided the distribution of Ni(II) follows thermodynamic equilibrium predictions, as the [Ni(II)] rises, InrS will be the first to respond, de-repressing expression of nrsD (encoding a Ni(II)-efflux protein) and preventing [Ni(II)] from approaching KNi(II) of the other sensors (18Foster A.W. Patterson C.J. Pernil R. Hess C.R. Robinson N.J. Cytosolic Ni(II) sensor in cyanobacterium: nickel detection follows nickel affinity across four families of metal sensors.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 12142-12151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For Zn(II), KZn(II) of nickel-sensing InrS is similar to Zn(II)-sensing ZiaR, but crucially the allosteric mechanism of ZiaR is more responsive to Zn(II) compared with InrS (ΔGCZn(II)-ZiaR·DNA > ΔGCZn(II)-InrS·DNA) (11Foster A.W. Pernil R. Patterson C.J. Robinson N.J. Metal specificity of cyanobacterial nickel-responsive repressor InrS: cells maintain zinc and copper below the detection threshold for InrS.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92: 797-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus ZiaR will require a lower fractional Zn(II) occupancy than InrS to de-repress its target gene ziaA (encoding a Zn(II)-efflux ATPase). In this manner, ZiaR can prevent [Zn(II)] from exceeding the threshold where occupancy of DNA by InrS becomes sufficiently low for aberrant expression of nrsD to occur (11Foster A.W. Pernil R. Patterson C.J. Robinson N.J. Metal specificity of cyanobacterial nickel-responsive repressor InrS: cells maintain zinc and copper below the detection threshold for InrS.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 92: 797-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, cobalt sensing does not correlate with relative affinity, and CoaR has the weakest KCo(II) in the set of sensors (6Patterson C.J. Pernil R. Dainty S.J. Chakrabarti B. Henry C.E. Money V.A. Foster A.W. Robinson N.J. Co(II)-detection does not follow KCo(II) gradient: channelling in Co(II)-sensing.Metallomics. 2013; 5: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the cobalt effector may be preferentially channelled to CoaR, and thus relative access has been invoked as the explanation for selective detection of cobalt (6Patterson C.J. Pernil R. Dainty S.J. Chakrabarti B. Henry C.E. Money V.A. Foster A.W. Robinson N.J. Co(II)-detection does not follow KCo(II) gradient: channelling in Co(II)-sensing.Metallomics. 2013; 5: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In summary, it is hypothesized that the sensor, which is triggered by a metal, is simply the most responsive within a cells' set of sensors, based upon relative affinity, relative allostery, and relative access (1Foster A.W. Osman D. Robinson N.J. Metal preferences and metallation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 28095-28103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is now tested via a mutation conferring gain-of-metal sensing. Here, the Co(II), Zn(II)-, and Cu(I)-binding affinities of Salmonella FrmR are determined and compared with equivalent data for the cognate sensors of these metals, namely Salmonella homologues of RcnR, Zn(II)-sensing ZntR and Zur, and Cu(I)-sensing CueR. FrmR is found not to sense metals within cells, yet an E64H substitution (creating a Salmonella RcnR-like helix α2′ HXXXH motif) gains responsiveness to cobalt and Zn(II) in vivo. By comparing the biochemical properties of Salmonella FrmR with FrmRE64H, and then relating these parameters to endogenous sensors for cobalt, Zn(II), and Cu(I), the relative properties that, in combination, enable metal sensing are identified. S. enterica sv. typhimurium strain SL1344 was used as wild type, and strain LB5010a was used as a restriction-deficient modification-proficient host for DNA manipulations. Both were a gift from J. S.

Carbenicillin (100 μg ml−1), kanamycin (50 μg ml−1), and/or chloramphenicol (10 μg ml−1) were added where appropriate. Cells were transformed to antibiotic resistance as described (37Sambrook J.

All generated plasmid constructs were checked by sequence analysis. Primers are listed in supplemental Table S1.

Mutagenesis was performed using strain LB5010a and selection of mutants achieved using LB medium supplemented with chloramphenicol. Mutations were subsequently moved to SL1344 or derivatives using P22 phage transduction and validated by PCR using primers 5 and 6 for frmR or primers 7 and 8 for gshA. The antibiotic resistance cassette from the ΔfrmR::cat locus was removed using the helper plasmid pCP20 carrying the FLP recombinase. PfrmRA or PfrmRA-frmR was amplified from SL1344 genomic DNA using primer 9 and either primer 10 (for PfrmRA) or 11 (for PfrmRA-frmR) and ligated into pGEM-T. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate PfrmRA-frmRE64H and PfrmRA-frmRDOWN was conducted via the QuikChange® protocol (Stratagene) using pGEM-PfrmRA-frmR as template and primers 12–23. Codon optimization of the frmRE64H coding region to generate PfrmRA-frmRE64HUP (supplemental Table S2) was achieved using GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.) and optimization for Salmonella typhimurium. The rcnR-PrcnA region was amplified from SL1344 genomic DNA using primers 24 and 25. Digested fragments were cloned into the SmaI/BamHI site of pRS415 (39Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N.

https://openalex.org/W1164204152,"The study of latitudinal gradients can yield important insights into adaptation to temperature stress. Two strategies are available: resistance by limiting damage, or tolerance by reducing the fitness consequences of damage. Here we studied latitudinal variation in resistance and tolerance to frost and heat and tested the prediction of a trade-off between the two strategies and their costliness. We raised plants of replicate maternal seed families from eight populations of North American Arabidopsis lyrata collected along a latitudinal gradient in climate chambers and exposed them repeatedly to either frost or heat stress, while a set of control plants grew under standard conditions. When control plants reached maximum rosette size, leaf samples were exposed to frost and heat stress, and electrolyte leakage (PEL) was measured and treated as an estimate of resistance. Difference in maximum rosette size between stressed and control plants was used as an estimate of tolerance. Northern populations were more frost resistant, and less heat resistant and less heat tolerant, but-unexpectedly-they were also less frost tolerant. Negative genetic correlations between resistance and tolerance to the same and different thermal stress were generally not significant, indicating only weak trade-offs. However, tolerance to frost was consistently accompanied by small size under control conditions, which may explain the non-adaptive latitudinal pattern for frost tolerance. Our results suggest that adaptation to frost and heat is not constrained by trade-offs between them. But the cost of frost tolerance in terms of plant size reduction may be important for the limits of species distributions and climate niches."
https://openalex.org/W1510935418,"Since the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in the eastern hemisphere, numerous surveillance programs and studies have been undertaken to detect the occurrence, distribution, or spread of avian influenza viruses (AIV) in wild bird populations worldwide. To identify demographic determinants and spatiotemporal patterns of AIV infection in long distance migratory waterfowl in North America, we fitted generalized linear models with binominal distribution to analyze results from 13,574 blue-winged teal (Anas discors, BWTE) sampled in 2007 to 2010 year round during AIV surveillance programs in Canada and the United States. Our analyses revealed that during late summer staging (July-August) and fall migration (September-October), hatch year (HY) birds were more likely to be infected than after hatch year (AHY) birds, however there was no difference between age categories for the remainder of the year (winter, spring migration, and breeding period), likely due to maturing immune systems and newly acquired immunity of HY birds. Probability of infection increased non-linearly with latitude, and was highest in late summer prior to fall migration when densities of birds and the proportion of susceptible HY birds in the population are highest. Birds in the Central and Mississippi flyways were more likely to be infected compared to those in the Atlantic flyway. Seasonal cycles and spatial variation of AIV infection were largely driven by the dynamics of AIV infection in HY birds, which had more prominent cycles and spatial variation in infection compared to AHY birds. Our results demonstrate demographic as well as seasonal, latitudinal and flyway trends across Canada and the US, while illustrating the importance of migratory host life cycle and age in driving cyclical patterns of prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W1525702510,"Doxorubicin has been shown to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells through proteolytic activation of CREB3L1 (cAMP response element binding protein 3-like 1), a transcription factor synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor. Upon doxorubicin treatment, CREB3L1 is cleaved so that the N-terminal domain of the protein can reach the nucleus where it activates transcription of genes that inhibit cell proliferation. These results suggest that the level of CREB3L1 in cancer cells may determine their sensitivity to doxorubicin.Mice transplanted with 6 lines of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were injected with doxorubicin to observe the effect of the chemotherapy on tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics analyses were performed to compare CREB3L1 levels in types of cancer known to respond to doxorubicin versus those resistant to doxorubicin.Higher levels of CREB3L1 protein are correlated with increased doxorubicin sensitivity of xenograft RCC tumors (p = 0.017 by Pearson analysis). From patient tumor biopsies we analyzed, CREB3L1 was expressed in 19% of RCC, which is generally resistant to doxorubicin, but in 70% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that is sensitive to doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is used as the standard treatment for cancers that express the highest levels of CREB3L1 such as osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma but is not generally used to treat those that express the lowest levels of CREB3L1 such as RCC.Identification of CREB3L1 as the biomarker for doxorubicin sensitivity may markedly improve the doxorubicin response rate by applying doxorubicin only to patients with cancers expressing CREB3L1."
https://openalex.org/W1778150298,"The transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) is activated by Toll-like receptors and controlled by mechanotransduction and changes in the cytoskeleton. In this study we combine 3-D predictive protein modelling and in vitro experiments with in silico simulations to determine the role of the cytoskeleton in regulation of NF-κB. Simulations used a comprehensive agent-based model of the NF-κB pathway, which includes the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) complex and signalling intermediates, as well as cytoskeletal components. Agent based modelling relies on in silico reproductions of systems through the interactions of its components, and provides a reliable tool in investigations of biological processes, which require spatial considerations and involve complex formation and translocation of regulatory components. We show that our model faithfully reproduces the multiple steps comprising the NF-κB pathway, and provides a framework from which we can explore novel aspects of the system. The analysis, using 3-D predictive protein modelling and in vitro assays, demonstrated that the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα is sequestered to the actin/spectrin complex within the cytoskeleton of the resting cell, and released during IL-1 stimulation, through a process controlled by the IL-1RI co-receptor TILRR (Toll-like and IL-1 receptor regulator). In silico simulations using the agent-based model predict that the cytoskeletal pool of IκBα is released to adjust signal amplification in relation to input levels. The results suggest that the process provides a mechanism for signal calibration and enables efficient, activation-sensitive regulation of NF-κB and inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W1951642440,"In-vivo voltammetry has successfully been used to detect dopamine release in rodent brains, but its application to monkeys has been limited. We have previously detected dopamine release in the caudate of behaving Japanese monkeys using diamond microelectrodes (Yoshimi 2011); however it is not known whether the release pattern is the same in various areas of the forebrain. Recent studies have suggested variations in the dopaminergic projections to forebrain areas. In the present study, we attempted simultaneous recording at two locations in the striatum, using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) on carbon fibers, which has been widely used in rodents. Responses to unpredicted food and liquid rewards were detected repeatedly. The response to the liquid reward after conditioned stimuli was enhanced after switching the prediction cue. These characteristics were generally similar between the ventral striatum and the putamen. Overall, the technical application of FSCV recording in multiple locations was successful in behaving primates, and further voltammetric recordings in multiple locations will expand our knowledge of dopamine reward responses."
https://openalex.org/W820447481,"Shanghai is the most developed city in China and has a soaring population. This study uses forensic epidemiology to determine the relationship between unnatural deaths and the development in Shanghai, based on recently released forensic autopsy cases from the 2000s at the Shanghai Public Security Bureau (SPSB). There were 5425 accidental deaths, 2696 homicides, 429 suicides, 186 natural deaths, and 1399 deaths of undetermined cause. There was a male-to-female ratio of 2.02:1, and the average age was 40.9±18.7 years. Traffic accidents (84.2%) were the number one cause of accidental deaths, which decreased during the study period. Sharp force injury (50.6%) was the leading cause of homicides, different from Western countries, where firearms are the leading cause. Hanging (24.5%) was the leading cause of suicides, whereas drug and chemical intoxication was the leading cause in the previous decade; pesticide ingestion decreased in the 2000s. In addition to traffic accidents, manual strangulation was the leading cause of death in childhood fatalities. Children under age 2 were vulnerable to homicides. In the 2000s, there were a large number of drug overdoses, and illegal medical practices and subway-related deaths first appeared in Shanghai. A new type of terrorist attack that involved injecting people with syringes in public places was reflected in the SPSB archives. The forensic epidemiology and changes in unnatural deaths in this decade reflected their relationship with the law, policy and changes in Shanghai. Illegal medical practices, subway-related deaths and terrorist attacks were closely related to the development in Shanghai. Identifying the risks of unnatural deaths will improve public health."
https://openalex.org/W822857197,"We examined the relationship between the community structure of wood-decaying fungi, detected by high-throughput sequencing, and the decomposition rate using 13 years of data from a forest dynamics plot. For molecular analysis and wood density measurements, drill dust samples were collected from logs and stumps of Fagus and Quercus in the plot. Regression using a negative exponential model between wood density and time since death revealed that the decomposition rate of Fagus was greater than that of Quercus. The residual between the expected value obtained from the regression curve and the observed wood density was used as a decomposition rate index. Principal component analysis showed that the fungal community compositions of both Fagus and Quercus changed with time since death. Principal component analysis axis scores were used as an index of fungal community composition. A structural equation model for each wood genus was used to assess the effect of fungal community structure traits on the decomposition rate and how the fungal community structure was determined by the traits of coarse woody debris. Results of the structural equation model suggested that the decomposition rate of Fagus was affected by two fungal community composition components: one that was affected by time since death and another that was not affected by the traits of coarse woody debris. In contrast, the decomposition rate of Quercus was not affected by coarse woody debris traits or fungal community structure. These findings suggest that, in the case of Fagus coarse woody debris, the fungal community structure is related to the decomposition process of its host substrate. Because fungal community structure is affected partly by the decay stage and wood density of its substrate, these factors influence each other. Further research on interactive effects is needed to improve our understanding of the relationship between fungal community structure and the woody debris decomposition process."
https://openalex.org/W1154417654,"Often we must balance being prepared to act quickly with being prepared to suddenly stop. The stop signal task (SST) is widely used to study inhibitory control, and provides a measure of the speed of the stop process that is robust to changes in subjects' response strategy. Previous studies have shown that preparation affects inhibition. We used fMRI to separate activity that occurs after a brief (500 ms) warning stimulus (warning-phase) from activity that occurs during responses that follow (response-phase). Both of these phases could contribute to the preparedness to stop because they both precede stop signals. Warning stimuli activated posterior networks that signal the need for top-down control, whereas response phases engaged prefrontal and subcortical networks that implement top-down control. Regression analyses revealed that both of these phases affect inhibitory control in different ways. Warning-phase activity in the cerebellum and posterior cingulate predicted stop latency and accuracy, respectively. By contrast, response-phase activity in fronto-temporal areas and left striatum predicted go speed and stop accuracy, in pre-supplementary motor area affected stop accuracy, and in right striatum predicted stop latency and accuracy. The ability to separate hidden contributions to inhibitory control during warning-phases from those during response-phases can aid in the study of models of preparation and inhibitory control, and of disorders marked by poor top-down control."
https://openalex.org/W1962995077,"Factor B is a serine-protease zymogen in the horseshoe crab coagulation cascade, and it is the primary substrate for activated factor C, the LPS-responsive initiator of the cascade. Factor C is autocatalytically activated to α-factor C on LPS and is artificially converted to β-factor C, another activated form, by chymotrypsin. It is not known, however, whether LPS is required for the activation of factor B. Here we found that wild-type factor B expressed in HEK293S cells is activated by α-factor C, but not by β-factor C, in an LPS-dependent manner and that β-factor C loses the LPS binding activity of factor C through additional cleavage by chymotrypsin within the N-terminal LPS-binding region. Surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance analyses revealed that wild-type factor B binds to LPS with high affinity comparable with that of factor C, demonstrating that factor B is the second LPS-binding zymogen in the cascade. An LPS-binding site of wild-type factor B was found in the N-terminal clip domain, and the activation rate of a clip domain deletion mutant was considerably slower than that of wild-type factor B. Moreover, in the presence of LPS, Triton X-100 inhibited the activation of wild-type factor B by α-factor C. We conclude that the clip domain of factor B has an important role in localizing factor B to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria or LPS released from bacteria to initiate effective proteolytic activation by α-factor C.

We conclude that the clip domain of factor B has an important role in localizing factor B to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria or LPS released from bacteria to initiate effective proteolytic activation by α-factor C. Several protease zymogens are involved in proteolytic cascades triggered on the surfaces of biologic substances derived from host tissues, cells, or invading pathogens to amplify and propagate various biologic reactions, such as blood coagulation and complement systems in mammals (1Davie E.W.

The complement system.Cell Tissue Res. 2011; 343: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In horseshoe crabs, a proteolytic cascade comprising four serine-protease zymogens—factor C, factor G, factor B, and the proclotting enzyme—plays a pivotal role in hemolymph coagulation (3Kawabata S. Immunocompetent molecules and their response network in Horseshoe Crabs.in: Söderhäll K. Invertebrate Immunity. Springer Science + Business Media, New York2010: 122-136Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar): factor C triggers the hemolymph coagulation cascade in response to stimulation with bacterial LPS, which activates factor B to convert the proclotting enzyme to the clotting enzyme, thereby promoting transformation of the clottable protein coagulogen to coagulin. On the other hand, factor G directly activates the proclotting enzyme in response to stimulation with β-1,3-d-glucans (3Kawabata S. Immunocompetent molecules and their response network in Horseshoe Crabs.in: Söderhäll K. Invertebrate Immunity. Springer Science + Business Media, New York2010: 122-136Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Factor C contains an LPS-binding site located in the N-terminal Cys-rich region, and a tripeptide sequence of -Arg36-Trp37-Arg38- in this region is essential for LPS recognition (4Koshiba T. Hashii T. Kawabata S. A structural perspective on the interaction between lipopolysaccharide and factor C, a receptor involved in recognition of gram-negative bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3962-3967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In addition, the N-terminal Arg residue of factor C and the distance between the N terminus and the tripeptide are absolutely required for specific protein-protein interactions to form multiple oligomers of factor C on the surface of LPS, leading to autocatalytic activation (5Kobayashi Y. Shiga T. Shibata T. Sako M. Maenaka K. Koshiba T. Mizumura H. Oda T. Kawabata S.

Trypsinogen is activated by cleavage of the -Arg15-Ile16- bond in chymotrypsinogen numbering by enteropeptidase, following insertion of the newly appearing N-terminal Ile16 into the Ile16 cleft to form a salt bridge between the α-amino group of Ile16 and the side chain of Asp194, leading to conformational changes in the substrate binding site and the oxyanion hole required for enzymatic catalysis (6Bode W. Huber R. Induction of the bovine trypsinogen: trypsin transition by peptides sequentially similar to the N-terminus of trypsin.FEBS Lett. 1976; 68: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, factor C is converted to α-factor C in the presence of LPS, and autocatalytic cleavage occurs within the -Phe737-Ile738- bond (see Fig. 1). On the other hand, this peptide bond is artificially cleaved by chymotrypsin, which produces another activated form, β-factor C (5Kobayashi Y. Shiga T. Shibata T. Sako M. Maenaka K. Koshiba T.

We hypothesize that the clip domain of factor B is involved in a specific interaction between factor B and α-factor C on LPS, leading to the proteolytic activation of factor B. It is not clear, however, whether LPS is required for the activation of factor B. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying factor B activation, we prepared several recombinants of factor B expressed in the HEK293 mutant cell line, the same as that used for studies of factor C (5Kobayashi Y.

In brief, recombinant proteins were expressed in HEK293S GnTI− cells and secreted into the culture medium. HEK293S GnTI− cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. DMEM supplemented with plasmids containing the inserts of the recombinant proteins (1.8 μg/ml), polyethylenimine (2.7 μg/ml), 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2% fetal bovine serum was used to transfect HEK293S GnTI− cells at 80–90% confluence. Culture media were collected 5 days after transfection and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 30 min. Collected culture media containing wild-type factor C with the histidine tag and the cleavage site of factor Xa were mixed with 0.1 volumes of 0.5 m NaH2PO4-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 1.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m imidazole and applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (1.0 × 5.0 cm). The column was washed with 50 mm NaH2PO4-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole, and wild-type factor C was eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4-NaOH, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 20–200 mm imidazole.

The concentrations of these three recombinant proteins were determined by the Micro BCATM protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Wild-type factor C (170 nm, 20 μg/ml) was activated by LPS (360 nm, 6 μg/ml) or chymotrypsin (200 nm, 5 μg/ml) for 10 or 30 min, respectively, at 37 °C; 0.1 mm tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone was added to stop the reaction with chymotrypsin.

The amidase activity of α-factor C or β-factor C in the presence or absence of LPS was assayed with 0.4 mm Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-pNA. Wild-type factor B (120 nm, 5.0 μg/ml) was activated by α-factor C or β-factor C in the presence or absence of LPS for 5 min at 37 °C. The amidase activity of activated factor B was assayed with 0.4 mm Boc-Leu-Thr-Arg-MCA, as described previously (5Kobayashi Y. Shiga T. Shibata T. Sako M. Maenaka K. Koshiba T. Mizumura H. Oda T.

Molar concentrations of pNA and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released were measured, respectively, by absorbance at 405 nm and fluorometrically with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm. β-Factor C was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the N-terminal sequence of the stained band was analyzed by Edman degradation (Genostaff, Tokyo, Japan). To prepare the antibodies against factor B and the L chain of factor C, synthesized peptide antigens were used. Peptides of FPKTRNDNEC and Cys-GDLDFSGPRSQ for factor B or those of Cys-GKYYRDDSRDDDYVQ and Cys-ADDSRTERRWVLEG for the L chain of factor C were used to immunize rabbits (Scrum, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% or 12% slab gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with polyclonal antibody against factor B or factor C, monoclonal antibody 2C12 against factor C (21Miura Y. Tokunaga F. Miyata T.

Precision Plus Protein Dual Color standards (Bio-Rad) were used to determine apparent molecular mass. Streptavidin-immobilized Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated with or without biotinylated LPS for 1 h at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1.5 μm BSA. Sepharose obtained by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 3 min was washed with 1.0 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. The resulting LPS-immobilized Sepharose or control Sepharose was incubated with samples in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1.5 μm BSA in the presence or absence of free LPS for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times. Sepharose reacted with the recombinant proteins was obtained by centrifugation and subjected to Western blotting. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed as described previously (5Kobayashi Y. Shiga T. Shibata T. Sako M. Maenaka K. Koshiba T. Mizumura H. Oda T. Kawabata S.

Biotinylated LPS (2.3 μm in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl) was immobilized on a sensor chip SA of a BIAcore X system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Wild-type factor B was injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in the running buffer, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. The change in the mass concentration on the sensor chip was monitored as a resonance signal using the program supplied by the manufacturer. Sensorgrams of the interactions obtained using the various concentrations of wild-type factor B (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 nm) were analyzed by the BIAevaluation program, version 3.0 (GE Healthcare). The interaction of wild-type factor B with LPS was also examined using the 27-MHz quartz crystal microbalance, Affinix Q (Initium Co., Tokyo, Japan). Biotinylated LPS was immobilized onto a 27-MHz electrode by Biotin-SAM formation reagent (Dojindo Laboratories, Mashiki-machi, Kumamoto, Japan). The biotin-SAM was prepared by immersing a clean electrode in 0.1 mm Biotin-SAM solution dissolved in ethanol at room temperature for 2 h. The Biotin-SAM-coated electrode was rinsed with ethanol and washed with water. Then avidin (20 μg/ml) was immobilized on the Biotin-SAM-coated electrode in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. After washing the avidin-immobilized electrode with water, biotinylated LPS was immobilized on the electrode in the same buffer. The LPS-immobilized electrode was washed with water several times for removal of the excess LPS and then soaked in the same buffer. Wild-type factor B was added to the solution and monitored continuously for frequency changes at 25 °C. The frequency changes in response to the various concentrations of these proteins were assessed, and the dissociation constant was determined according to the published method (22Sato T. Serizawa T. Okahata Y. Recognition of monosialoganglioside (GM3) reconstituted in sphingomyerin and glucosylceramide membranes against wheat germ agglutinin: quantitative analyses by a quartz crystal microbalance.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Native factor B purified from horseshoe crab hemocytes was purified as a two-chain form of the zymogen consisting of L and H chains through proteolytic cleavage of the -Arg103-Ser104- bond (site 1) by unknown protease(s) (Fig. 1) (23Nakamura T. Horiuchi T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Purification and properties of intracellular clotting factor, factor B, from horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) hemocytes.J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, wild-type factor B expressed in HEK293S GnTI− cells contained not only the two-chain form but also a single-chain form of the zymogen indicated by Factor B in Fig. 2A. Wild-type factor B was activated by α-factor C in the presence of LPS (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether LPS is required for the activation of wild-type factor B, β-factor C was used as an activator, because it was very difficult to completely remove LPS from the enzyme fraction of α-factor C. Unexpectedly, β-factor C did not activate wild-type factor B, even in the presence of LPS (Fig. 2B). Factor B was proteolytically cleaved at two sites within the -Arg103-Ser104- (site 1) and the -Ile124-Ile125- (site 2) bonds (Fig. 1) (9Muta T. Oda T. Iwanaga S.

Purification and properties of intracellular clotting factor, factor B, from horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) hemocytes.J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cleavage within the site 1 bond yielded the two-chain form of zymogen, consisting of the L and H chains. On the other hand, cleavage within the site 2 bond to convert the H chain into the B chain was essentially required for the activation of factor B (23Nakamura T. Horiuchi T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Purification and properties of intracellular clotting factor, factor B, from horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) hemocytes.J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of factor B is followed by the appearance of the B chain. As expected, α-factor C effectively activated wild-type factor B to induce the appearance of the B chain of factor B in the presence of LPS (Fig. 2C, left panel). In contrast, β-factor C did not cleave the site 2 bond of wild-type factor B (Fig. 2C, right panel) under the same conditions, suggesting that artificial activation of factor C by chymotrypsin causes a loss of its original potency to activate factor B. The L chain of wild-type factor C was cleaved by incubation with LPS or chymotrypsin and converted into the single band of the B chain, indistinguishable between the two cases by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). To confirm whether the additional proteolytic cleavage(s) of the H chain of factor C occurred during incubation with LPS or chymotrypsin, the time course of the cleavage reaction of the H chain was monitored by Western blotting. Incubation with chymotrypsin, but not with LPS, slightly decreased the apparent molecular weight of the H chain to that of the ΔH chain (Fig. 3B). The N-terminal sequence analysis of the ΔH chain revealed the sequence of Xaa-Lys-Pro-Xaa-Asp-Asp-Leu- (where Xaa is an unidentified residue by Edman degradation), corresponding to the sequence of Cys41-Lys42-Pro43-Cys44-Asp45-Asp46-Leu47- (Table 1), indicating that additional cleavage by chymotrypsin occurs within the -Tyr40-Cys41- bond, close to the tripeptide motif for LPS recognition. To confirm whether β-factor C retains LPS binding ability, β-factor C was incubated with LPS-immobilized Sepharose. As a result, β-factor C exhibited no significant affinity for LPS-immobilized Sepharose (Fig. 3C). This demonstrated that β-factor C loses the original LPS binding ability of factor C by additional proteolytic cleavage of the -Tyr40-Cys41- bond, despite retaining sufficient amidase activity against the peptide substrate, and that the interaction between α-factor C and LPS is essentially required for the activation of factor B.TABLE 1The N-terminal sequence analyses of β-factor CCycle 1Cycle 2Cycle 3Cycle 4Cycle 5Cycle 6Cycle 7Amino acid(Cys)LysPro(Cys)AspAspLeuYield (pmol)—a—, not detectable.6.03.0—3.24.74.3a —, not detectable.

Biochem. 1988; 103: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether Triton X-100 inhibits the activation of factor B by α-factor C, wild-type factor B was incubated with α-factor C in the presence of LPS (0.44 nm) and various concentrations of Triton X-100. Triton X-100 strongly inhibited the activation of wild-type factor B by α-factor C above the critical micelle concentration of Triton X-100 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, Triton X-100 did not inhibit the amidase activity of the activated factor B (Fig. 4B). In addition, monitoring the appearance of the H and B chains of factor B confirmed that, in the presence of Triton X-100, α-factor C cleaved the site 1 bond of wild-type factor B, but not the site 2 bond required for the activation of factor B (Fig. 4C). To confirm the LPS binding capacity of factor B, wild-type factor B was incubated with LPS-immobilized Sepharose. Wild-type factor B exhibited LPS binding activity, and free LPS competitively inhibited the binding of wild-type factor B to the LPS-immobilized Sepharose (Fig. 5A). The LPS binding parameters of wild-type factor B were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Fig. 5B and Table 2). Moreover, the dissociation constant of wild-type factor B was also determined to be Kd = 1.03 × 10−8 ± 0.44 × 10−8 m by quartz crystal microbalance analysis (Fig. 5C). These results revealed that wild-type factor B binds to LPS with high affinity comparable with that of factor C.TABLE 2LPS binding parameters of wild-type factor C and wild-type factor B by surface plasmon resonance analysiskakdKdm−1s−1s−1mFactor CaThese parameters are cited from data obtained in Ref. 5.4.29 × 106 ± 2.50 × 1063.25 × 10−3 ± 0.42 × 10−37.58 × 10−10Factor B1.71 × 106 ± 0.73 × 1065.98 × 10−3 ± 0.88 × 10−33.49 × 10−9a These parameters are cited from data obtained in Ref. 5Kobayashi Y.

Open table in a new tab A mutant factor B without the clip domain (Δclip-factor B) was prepared, and its LPS binding activity was examined. ΔClip-factor B exhibited no binding activity against LPS-immobilized Sepharose (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the clip domain of factor B (GST-clip) bound to LPS-immobilized Sepharose (Fig. 6B). To clarify the functional role of the clip domain, wild-type factor B or Δclip-factor B was activated by α-factor C in the presence of LPS, and the resulting amidase activity was measured. Activation of Δclip-factor B was considerably slower than that of wild-type factor B (Fig. 6C). Consistent with this phenomenon, the B chain appeared much more slowly in the activation of Δclip-factor B than in that of wild-type factor B (Fig. 6, D and E). These findings indicate that the clip domain of factor B contains the LPS-binding region with an essential function in the activation by α-factor C in the presence of LPS. Proteolytic activation of factor B requires cleavage within the -Ile124-Ile125- bond (site 2) by α-factor C, a comparable reaction to the LPS-induced autocatalytic cleavage within the -Phe737-Ile738-bond of factor C (Fig. 1). We found that wild-type factor B is efficiently activated by α-factor C, but not by β-factor C, through cleavage within the site 2 bond of factor B in an LPS-dependent manner (Fig. 2). We also found that β-factor C loses the original LPS binding ability of factor C during artificial activation by chymotrypsin through cleavage within the -Tyr40-Cys41- bond (Fig. 3). This cleavage site is very close to the -Arg36-Trp37-Arg38- sequence, the unique tripeptide motif for LPS recognition (4Koshiba T. Hashii T. Kawabata S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 3962-3967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that this additional cleavage by chymotrypsin disrupts an expected loop structure around the tripeptide motif required for the LPS binding of factor C. The specific activities of α-factor C and β-factor C used in this study were 7.4 and 6.6 units/nmol against Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-pNA in the presence of LPS (0.44 nm), respectively. Interestingly, α-factor C under the same conditions exhibited no amidase activity against a peptide substrate for chymotrypsin, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA. These findings suggest that a specific conformational state around the site 2 bond of factor B induced by interaction with LPS is crucial for proteolytic activation by α-factor C. Wild-type factor B exhibited LPS binding activity with the dissociation constant obtained by surface plasmon resonance or quartz crystal microbalance analysis comparable with that of wild-type factor C (Table 2 and Fig. 5), and Δclip-factor B lost its original LPS binding ability. Moreover, the clip domain of factor B (GST-clip) retained LPS binding activity (Fig. 6B), indicating that factor B is the second LPS-binding protease zymogen in the coagulation cascade after factor C and that the LPS-binding site of factor B is located in the clip domain. In addition, in the presence of LPS, Triton X-100 strongly inhibited activation of wild-type factor B by α-factor C above the critical micelle concentration, suggesting that Triton X-100 mixes into LPS to form an ineffective surface for the proteolytic activation of factor B by α-factor C. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a clip domain with LPS binding affinity. We concluded that the clip domain of factor B has an important function in localizing factor B to the surface of Gram-negative bacteria or LPS released from bacteria to initiate efficient activation by α-factor C. The mammalian blood coagulation cascade involves several serine-protease zymogens and proceeds to the proteolytic activation, as follows (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. The coagulation cascade: initiation, maintenance, and regulation.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar): the extrinsic pathway begins with autocatalytic activation of a vitamin K-dependent zymogen factor VII, after which the other vitamin K-dependent zymogens, including factor IX, factor X, and prothrombin, are activated in that order in the presence of protein cofactors of tissue factor, factor V, and factor VIII. These vitamin K-dependent zymogens are all recruited to the reaction center through specific interactions between the N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain of each zymogen, coordinating Ca2+ ions, and the surfaces of phospholipids released from platelets or tissues at injured sites. This concentration mechanism of protease zymogens on the phospholipid surface has important roles for inducing efficient proteolytic activation at local sites and preventing the coagulation reaction from spreading to the whole body. We found that a similar strategy occurs in horseshoe crab hemolymph coagulation: the cascade begins with autocatalytic activation of an LPS-responsive zymogen factor C, and another LPS-binding zymogen factor B is then activated. The two zymogens are recruited to the reaction center through specific interaction between the N-terminal Cys-rich region of factor C or the N-terminal clip domain of factor B and the surface of LPS released from Gram-negative bacteria. The basic strategies of the two proteolytic cascades triggered in biologic substances to amplify and regulate various biologic reactions must be evolutionarily conserved. Recently, human caspase-4 and its mouse ortholog caspase-11 (caspase-4/11), which are cysteine-protease zymogens, were identified as intracellular LPS-binding zymogens (25Shi J. Zhao Y. Wang Y. Gao W. Ding J. Li P. Hu L. Shao F. Inflammatory caspases are innate immune receptors for intracellular LPS.Nature. 2014; 514: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These are activated in response to the complex formation with LPS internalized into the cytosol to induce pyroptosis and secretion of IL-1β (26Rathinam V.A. Vanaja S.K. Waggoner L. Sokolovska A.

Horseshoe crab hemolymph coagulation is an ideal model system for understanding the reaction mechanism of proteolytic cascades on the surfaces of biologic substances. A reagent prepared from hemocyte lysates of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus was used for a sensitive test to detect endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria, which is called the “Limulus test” (28Armstrong P.B.

https://openalex.org/W1124106674,"Advanced MRI studies have revealed regional alterations in the sensorimotor cortex of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). However, the organizational features underlying the relapsing phase and the subsequent remitting phase have not been directly shown at the functional network or the connectome level. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize MS-related centrality disturbances of the sensorimotor network (SMN) and to assess network integrity and connectedness.Thirty-four patients with clinically definite RRMS and well-matched healthy controls participated in the study. Twenty-three patients in the remitting phase underwent one resting-state functional MRI, and 11 patients in the relapsing-remitting phase underwent two different MRIs. We measured voxel-wise centrality metrics to determine direct (degree centrality, DC) and global (eigenvector centrality, EC) functional relationships across the entire SMN.In the relapsing phase, DC was significantly decreased in the bilateral primary motor and somatosensory cortex (M1/S1), left dorsal premotor (PMd), and operculum-integrated regions. However, DC was increased in the peripheral SMN areas. The decrease in DC in the bilateral M1/S1 was associated with the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and total white matter lesion loads (TWMLLs), suggesting that this adaptive response is related to the extent of brain damage in the rapid-onset attack stage. During the remission process, these alterations in centrality were restored in the bilateral M1/S1 and peripheral SMN areas. In the remitting phase, DC was reduced in the premotor, supplementary motor, and operculum-integrated regions, reflecting an adaptive response due to brain atrophy. However, DC was enhanced in the right M1 and left parietal-integrated regions, indicating chronic reorganization. In both the relapsing and remitting phases, the changes in EC and DC were similar.The alterations in centrality within the SMN indicate rapid plasticity and chronic reorganization with a biased impairment of specific functional areas in RRMS patients."

Presumptive MDR-TB patients from peripheral microscopy centres serving 60% of the total population of Bangladesh were included in the study. Attrition and turnaround time for MDR-TB diagnosis by Xpert MTB/RIF and treatment initiation were calculated between July 2012 and June 2014.Of 836 presumptive MDR-TB patients referred from 398 peripheral microscopy centres, 161 MDR-TB patients were diagnosed. The number of diagnosed MDR-TB patients was less than country estimates of MDR-TB patients (2000 cases) during the study period. Among those referred, pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition was 17% and 21% respectively. Median turnaround time for MDR-TB testing, result receipt and treatment initiation was four, zero and five days respectively. Farmers (RR=2.3, p=0.01) and daily wage laborers (RR=2.1, p=0.04) had twice the risk of having pre-diagnosis attrition. Poor record-keeping and unreliable upkeep of presumptive MDR-TB patient databases were identified as challenges at the peripheral microscopy centres.There was a low proportion of pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition in patients with presumptive and confirmed MDR-TB under programmatic conditions. However, the recording and reporting system did not detect all presumptive MDR-TB patients, highlighting the need to improve the system in order to prevent morbidity, mortality and transmission of MDR-TB in the community."
https://openalex.org/W837689107,"Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), a unique mitochondrial structure common to trypanosomatid parasites, contains thousands of DNA minicircles that are densely packed and can be topologically linked into a chain mail-like network. Experimental data indicate that every minicircle in the network is, on average, singly linked to three other minicircles (i.e., has mean valence 3) before replication and to six minicircles in the late stages of replication. The biophysical factors that determine the topology of the network and its changes during the cell cycle remain unknown. Using a mathematical modeling approach, we previously showed that volume confinement alone can drive the formation of the network and that it induces a linear relationship between mean valence and minicircle density. Our modeling also predicted a minicircle valence two orders of magnitude greater than that observed in kDNA. To determine the factors that contribute to this discrepancy we systematically analyzed the relationship between the topological properties of the network (i.e., minicircle density and mean valence) and its biophysical properties such as DNA bending, electrostatic repulsion, and minicircle relative position and orientation. Significantly, our results showed that most of the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental observations can be accounted for by the orientation of the minicircles with volume exclusion due to electrostatic interactions and DNA bending playing smaller roles. Our results are in agreement with the three dimensional kDNA organization model, initially proposed by Delain and Riou, in which minicircles are oriented almost perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the kDNA disk. We suggest that while minicircle confinement drives the formation of kDNA networks, it is minicircle orientation that regulates the topological complexity of the network."

Alterations of white matter in the corpus callosum correlated with disease severity as assessed by the revised ALS functional rating scale.SWI is capable of indicating iron and myelin disturbances in white matter of ALS patients. The SWI patterns observed in this study suggest that widespread alterations due to iron disturbances occur in patients with ALS and correlate with disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W2230548884,"Population scale sequencing of whole human genomes is becoming economically feasible; however, data management and analysis remains a formidable challenge for many research groups. Large sequencing studies, like the 1000 Genomes Project, have improved our understanding of human demography and the effect of rare genetic variation in disease. Variant calling on datasets of hundreds or thousands of genomes is time-consuming, expensive, and not easily reproducible given the myriad components of a variant calling pipeline. Here, we describe a cloud-based pipeline for joint variant calling in large samples using the Real Time Genomics population caller. We deployed the population caller on the Amazon cloud with the DNAnexus platform in order to achieve low-cost variant calling. Using our pipeline, we were able to identify 68.3 million variants in 2,535 samples from Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project. By performing the variant calling in a parallel manner, the data was processed within 5 days at a compute cost of $7.33 per sample (a total cost of $18,590 for completed jobs and $21,805 for all jobs). Analysis of cost dependence and running time on the data size suggests that, given near linear scalability, cloud computing can be a cheap and efficient platform for analyzing even larger sequencing studies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W805654293,"A well-known challenge in estimating the mortality risks of obesity is reverse causality attributable to illness-associated and smoking-associated weight loss. Given that the likelihood of chronic and acute illnesses rises with age, reverse causality is most threatening to estimates derived from elderly populations.I analyzed data from 12,523 respondents over 50 years old from a nationally representative longitudinal dataset, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The effects of both baseline body weight and time-varying weight change on mortality are estimated, adjusting for demographic and socio-economic variables, as well as time-varying confounders including illness and smoking. Body weight is measured by body mass index (BMI). In survival models for mortality, illness and smoking were lagged to minimize bias from reverse causality in estimates of the effect of weight change. Furthermore, because illness both causes and is caused by changes in BMI, I used a marginal structural model (MSM) rather than standard adjustment to control confounding by this and other time-dependent factors.Overall, relative to normal weight, underweight and Class II/III at baseline are associated with hazard ratios that are 2.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-3.37) and 1.82 (1.54-2.16) respectively, whereas overweight and Class I obesity do not significantly lower or raise the mortality risks. Furthermore, relative to stable weight change, all types of weight change lead to significantly increased risk of mortality. Specifically, large weight loss results in a mortality risk that is nearly 3.86 (3.26-4.58) times of staying in the stable weight range and small weight loss is about 1.81 (1.55-2.11 ) times riskier. In contrast, large weight gain and small weight gain are associated with hazard ratios that are 1.98 (1.67-2.35) and 1.20 (1.02-1.41) respectively.Being underweight or severe obese at baseline is associated with excess mortality risk, and weight change tend to raise mortality risk. Both the confounding by illness and by smoking lead to overestimates of the effects of being underweight at baseline and of weight loss, but underestimates the effect of being obese at baseline."
https://openalex.org/W937991166,"In alpine regions cows are often equipped with bells. The present study investigated the impact of wearing a bell on behaviour and heart rate variability in dairy cows. Nineteen non-lactating Brown-Swiss cows with bell experience were assigned to three different treatments. For 3 days each, cows were equipped with no bell (control), with a bell with inactivated clapper (silent bell) or with a functional bell (functional bell). The bells weighed 5.5 kg and had frequencies between 532 Hz and 2.8 kHz and amplitudes between 90 and 113 dB at a distance of 20 cm. Data were collected on either the first and third or on all 3 days of each treatment. Whereas duration of rumination was reduced with a functional bell and a silent bell compared with no bell, feeding duration was reduced with a silent bell and was intermediate with a functional bell. Head movements were reduced when wearing a silent bell compared with no bell and tended to be reduced when wearing a functional compared to no bell. With a functional bell, lying duration was reduced by almost 4 hours on the third day of treatment compared with the first day with a functional bell and compared with no bell or a silent bell. All additional behavioural measures are consistent with the hypothesis of a restriction in the behaviour of the cows wearing bells, although this pattern did not reach significance. There was no treatment effect on heart rate variability, suggesting that the bells did not affect vago-sympathetic balance. An effect of experimental day was found for only 1 out of 10 behavioural parameters, as shown by a decrease in lying with a functional bell on day 3. The results indicate behavioural changes in the cows wearing a bell over 3 days, without indication of habituation to the bell. Altogether, the behavioural changes suggest that the behaviour of the cows was disturbed by wearing a bell. If long-lasting, these effects may have implications for animal welfare."
https://openalex.org/W1148793001,"Terpios hoshinota, an encrusting cyanosponge, is known as a strong substrate competitor of reef-building corals that kills encountered coral by overgrowth. Terpios outbreaks cause significant declines in living coral cover in Indo-Pacific coral reefs, with the damage usually lasting for decades. Recent studies show that there are morphological transformations at a sponge's growth front when confronting corals. Whether these morphological transformations at coral contacts are involved with physiological outperformance (e.g., higher metabolic activity or nutritional status) over other portions of Terpios remains equivocal. In this study, we compared the indicators of photosynthetic capability and nitrogen status of a sponge-cyanobacteria association at proximal, middle, and distal portions of opponent corals. Terpios tissues in contact with corals displayed significant increases in photosynthetic oxygen production (ca. 61%), the δ13C value (ca. 4%), free proteinogenic amino acid content (ca. 85%), and Gln/Glu ratio (ca. 115%) compared to middle and distal parts of the sponge. In contrast, the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), which is the indicator usually used to represent the integrity of photosystem II, of cyanobacteria photosynthesis was low (0.256~0.319) and showed an inverse trend of higher values in the distal portion of the sponge that might be due to high and variable levels of cyanobacterial phycocyanin. The inconsistent results between photosynthetic oxygen production and Fv/Fm values indicated that maximum quantum yields might not be a suitable indicator to represent the photosynthetic function of the Terpios-cyanobacteria association. Our data conclusively suggest that Terpios hoshinota competes with opponent corals not only by the morphological transformation of the sponge-cyanobacteria association but also by physiological outperformance in accumulating resources for the battle."
https://openalex.org/W1191406996,"Advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) are the result of post-translational changes to proteins, which ultimately compromise their structure and/or function. The identification of methods to prevent the formation of these compounds holds great promise in the development of alternative therapies for diseases such as diabetes. Plants used in traditional medicine are often rich sources of anti-glycation agents. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the anti-glycation activity of one such compound, Oncocalyxone A (Onco A). Using spectrofluorimetric techniques, we determined that Onco A inhibits AGE formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Its IC50 value (87.88 ± 3.08 μM) was almost two times lower than the standard anti-glycation compound aminoguanidine (184.68 ± 4.85 μM). The excellent anti-glycation activity of Onco A makes it an exciting candidate for the treatment of diseases associated with excessive accumulation of AGE. However, additional studies are necessary to identify its mechanism of action, as well as the in vivo response in suitable model organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2340339363,"Synonymous codon usage bias (SCUB) is a common event that a non-uniform usage of codons often occurs in nearly all organisms. We previously found that SCUB is correlated with both intron number and exon position in the plant nuclear genome but not in the plastid genome; SCUB in both nuclear and plastid genome can mirror the evolutionary specialization. However, how about the rules in the mitochondrial genome has not been addressed. Here, we present an analysis of SCUB in the mitochondrial genome, based on 24 plant species ranging from algae to land plants. The frequencies of NNA and NNT (A- and T-ending codons) are higher than those of NNG and NNC, with the strongest preference in bryophytes and the weakest in land plants, suggesting an association between SCUB and plant evolution. The preference for NNA and NNT is more evident in genes harboring a greater number of introns in land plants, but the bias to NNA and NNT exhibits even among exons. The pattern of SCUB in the mitochondrial genome differs in some respects to that present in both the nuclear and plastid genomes."

Mouse embryonic eyelid closure is a well defined model to study the genetic control of developmental programs. Using this model, we investigated how exposure to dioxin-like environmental pollutants modifies the genetic risk of developmental abnormalities. Our studies reveal that mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase 1 (MAP3K1) signaling is a focal point of gene-environment cross-talk. Dioxin exposure, acting through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), blocked eyelid closure in genetic mutants in which MAP3K1 signaling was attenuated but did not disturb this developmental program in either wild type or mutant mice with attenuated epidermal growth factor receptor or WNT signaling. Exposure also markedly inhibited c-Jun phosphorylation in Map3k1+/− embryonic eyelid epithelium, suggesting that dioxin-induced AHR pathways can synergize with gene mutations to inhibit MAP3K1 signaling. Our studies uncover a novel mechanism through which the dioxin-AHR axis interacts with the MAP3K1 signaling pathways during fetal development and provide strong empirical evidence that specific gene alterations can increase the risk of developmental abnormalities driven by environmental pollutant exposure.

The genetic code is the blueprint of organogenesis. Gene mutations, sequence variations, and structural alterations of the chromatin are the common causes of birth defects. Most defects, however, do not have a clear-cut inheritance pattern but have complex etiologies involving environmental influences and gene-environment interactions. As such, although the gene alterations establish a vulnerable biological state, the diseases occur only when unfavorable environmental conditions are also present (1Brent R.L. Environmental causes of human congenital malformations: the pediatrician's role in dealing with these complex clinical problems caused by a multiplicity of environmental and genetic factors.Pediatrics. 2004; 113: 957-968PubMed Google Scholar). The interplay between genes and the environment is essentially responsible for individual diversity, phenotype variability, and etiologic heterogeneity of a myriad of disorders during development. To date, methods to capture the non-additive effects of gene-environment interactions are still lacking. This has limited our ability to identify the causative agents for many severe, costly, and often deadly congenital diseases.

DLCs are highly toxic and are released into the environment as by-products of incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and wood and incineration of municipal and industrial wastes. These chemicals are persistent in the environment and accumulate in soil, food, water, and wildlife, and the general population is exposed through ingestion of contaminated food and water. Because pregnant women transfer a fraction of their body burden to fetuses, the developmental toxicity of dioxin has been a serious concern (7Birnbaum L.S.

Notwithstanding the fact that the epidemiological causative association between dioxin exposure and birth defects is yet to be established, studies in model systems have shown that TCDD is a potent teratogen (8Carney S.A.

In this work, we explored the genetic influences of dioxin exposure in the embryonic eyelid closure model and identified a novel gene-environment interaction mechanism in TCDD teratogenicity. We show that although TCDD exposure in utero did not affect eyelid development in wild type mice it blocked eyelid closure when MAP3K1 signaling was attenuated by gene mutation. Our data provide empirical evidence that specific pre-existing genetic conditions can increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes of exposure to environmental agents.

Mouse mating, handling, and genotyping used standard protocols. Pregnant dams were treated on various GDs by oral gavage with either corn oil (vehicle) or chemicals dissolved in corn oil. Mice were housed in a vivarium accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care; the animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. All experiments involving mice were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health standards for the care and use of experimental animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Cincinnati. TCDD and many dioxin-like chemicals are toxic compounds and probable human carcinogens; all personnel were therefore instructed in safe handling procedures. Lab coats, gloves, and masks were worn at all times, and contaminated materials were collected separately for disposal by the Hazardous Waste Unit or by independent contractors. The carcasses of chemical-pretreated mice were treated as contaminated biological materials. For histology and immunohistochemistry, the embryonic/fetal heads were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight. The tissues were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound and frozen or in paraffin. The entire eye was processed for sagittal sections at 5–8 μm. For complete histological evaluation, H&E staining was performed on three consecutive sections at every 15 sections throughout the eye, and images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described before using specified antibodies (18Mongan M. Wang J. Liu H. Fan Y. Jin C. Kao W.Y. Xia Y.

The heterozygous mutants, however, have normal eyelid closure, underscoring the recessive nature of the mutant alleles. As suspected in most complex diseases, the mutant alleles may not produce a phenotype by themselves, but they increase the susceptibility to injury by environmental stressors. To test this hypothesis, we treated the pregnant dams carrying wild type and heterozygous embryos with TCDD at 12.5 days postcoitus and examined the eyelids in GD17.5–18.5 fetuses. The exposed wild type, Dkk2+/−, Egfr+/ΔOSE, and Gab1+/ΔOSE fetuses had fully closed eyelids indistinguishable from the unexposed fetuses (Table 2 and data not shown). In striking contrast, most exposed Map3k1+/− fetuses displayed an open eye phenotype (Fig. 1B).TABLE 2Eyelid development in genetic mutant miceGenotypeEyelid status (no. fetuses)OpenClosedEgfr+/ΔOSE010EgfrΔOSE/ΔOSE60Gab1+/ΔOSE010Gab1ΔOSE/ΔOSE60Dkk2+/−, TCDD09Egfr+/ΔOSE, TCDD01Gab1+/ΔOSE, TCDD02 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the open eye was due to failure of eyelid closure or to premature eyelid opening, we performed a histological examination of fetuses at different developmental stages. Regardless of genotype and exposure to TCDD, all GD15.5 fetuses had widely opened eyelids that were morphologically identical (Fig. 1C). The GD16.5 fetuses had the upper and lower eyelids fused in unexposed Map3k1+/− and exposed wild type but had the eyelid partially open in TCDD-treated Map3k1+/− fetuses. Thus, the open eye phenotype in the TCDD-exposed Map3k1 hemizygotes was the result of defective eyelid closure. Exposure to TCDD on different GDs could produce a varying magnitude of responses (26Couture L.A. Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S.

To explore the time window of eyelid development vulnerability to exposure, we treated the pregnant dams with a single dose of 50 μg/kg TCDD on GD12.5, GD13.5, or GD14.5 (Fig. 2A). Although all Map3k1+/− GD17.5 fetuses displayed the open eye phenotype when TCDD was administered on GD12.5, 30% of the fetuses had the phenotype when TCDD was administered on GD13.5, and none of the Map3k1+/− fetuses had detectable eyelid defects when TCDD was administered on GD14.5 (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the effective dose, we gavaged the pregnant dams with different TCDD doses and examined the fetuses on GD17.5. When administered on GD12.5, 50 μg/kg TCDD induced open eyes in all Map3k1+/− fetuses, whereas 25 μg/kg TCDD caused the phenotype in 40% of fetuses, and 5 μg/kg TCDD did not have an effect (Fig. 2B). When administered on GD13.5, 75, 65, and 50 μg/kg TCDD led to the open eye phenotype in 70, 50, and 10% of the Map3k1+/− fetuses, respectively (Fig. 2C). Two or more dams under each treatment condition were examined, and the open eye phenotype was not correlated with a specific litter or litter size. It is important to note that none of the wild type fetuses (n = 106) exhibited defective eyelid development, and there was no overt maternal toxicity under any of the treatment conditions, consistent with previous reports (27Weber H. Birnbaum L.S. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) in pregnant C57BL/6N mice: distribution to the embryo and excretion.Arch.

In addition, wild type and Map3k1+/− fetuses exposed to high doses of TCDD (25 or 50 μg/kg) exhibited cleft palates and hypoplastic Harderian glands (data not shown) comparable with the dosing conditions that induce the cleft palate phenotype established by others (28Gritli-Linde A.

Based on previous determinations using isotopically labeled TCDD, the above doses given to the pregnant dams are estimated to correspond to 1.7–25 ng per embryo (27Weber H.

Birnbaum L.S. Farland W.H. Gasiewicz T.A. Comparisons of estimated human body burdens of dioxinlike chemicals and TCDD body burdens in experimentally exposed animals.Environ. Health Perspect. 1995; 103: 820-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, real life environmental exposures are persistent, continuous, and long term. To mimic environmental exposure, we treated pregnant dams repeatedly on GD10.5, GD11.5, and GD12.5 with lower TCDD doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 μg/kg. The 2.5 μg/kg dose did not affect eyelid closure in the fetuses regardless of genotype, but the 5 and 10 μg/kg doses, although having no effect on eyelid closure in the wild type fetuses, caused the open eye phenotype in all of the Map3k1+/− fetuses (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our data show that in addition to its toxicity in causing cleft palates, Harderian gland hypoplasia, and other developmental defects TCDD blocks embryonic eyelid closure when exposure occurs on or before GD12.5. The toxicity manifests itself only in the Map3k1 hemizygotes, indicating that genetic susceptibility is a pre-requisite for TCDD toxicity in eyelid development. Most biological effects of dioxin are mediated by the AHR, a ligand-activated basic helix-loop-helix-Per-Arnt-Sim transcription factor. To evaluate whether AHR activation was involved in eyelid development, we examined the effects of a mixture of PCBs, including PCB77, PCB126, and PCB169 (Table 1), which like TCDD are AHR agonists. The composition of the mixture was based on the ratio of these compounds in foodstuff and through the work of others has been established and accepted for environmental health research (31Curran C.P. Vorhees C.V. Williams M.T. Genter M.B. Miller M.L. Nebert D.W. In utero and lactational exposure to a complex mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls: toxicity in pups dependent on the Cyp1a2 and Ahr genotypes.Toxicol. Sci. 2011; 119: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We treated the pregnant dams repeatedly with the PCB mixture at GD11.5 and GD12.5 and examined fetuses at GD17.5. Similar to TCDD, the PCBs caused open eye phenotype in Map3k1 hemizygotes but not in wild type fetuses (Fig. 3A). To test genetically the role of AHR in TCDD-induced eyelid defects, we used fetuses from the cross of Map3k1+/+Ahr+/− with Map3k1−/−Ahr+/− mice. After TCDD exposure at GD12.5, the majority of Map3k1+/− GD17.5 fetuses had open eyes when the Ahr genotype was Ahr+/+ or Ahr+/−, but all of them had eyelids fully closed when it was Ahr−/− (Fig. 3, B and C). Although most Map3k1+/−Ahr+/− fetuses had their eyes closed, a few had eyes slightly open (Fig. 3C). Ligand binding induces AHR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where AHR heterodimerizes with the AHR nuclear translocator or interacts with other transcription factors (32Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mimura J. Molecular mechanisms of AhR functions in the regulation of cytochrome P450 genes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The nuclear AHR complexes cause highly cell-specific transcriptome changes, leading to biological end points that include developmental toxicity (33Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor: studies using the AHR-null mice.Drug. Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1194-1198PubMed Google Scholar). The well established AHR transcription target is Cyp1a1, which codes for enzymes responsible for the metabolism and detoxification of exogenous chemicals and toxic responses (34Nebert D.W. Roe A.L. Dieter M.Z. Solis W.A. Yang Y. Dalton T.P. Role of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor and [Ah] gene battery in the oxidative stress response, cell cycle control, and apoptosis.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). In the liver and skin of exposed fetuses, we detected a robust CYP1A1 induction in Ahr+/+ and Ahr+/− but not Ahr−/− fetuses (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the level of CYP1A1 was the same in wild type and Map3k1 mutant mice, ruling out the possibility that MAP3K1 signaling is required for AHR activity in gene induction (Fig. 3E). MAP3K1 is a member of the MAP3K superfamily responsible for activation of the MAP2K-MAPK cascades. In the developing eyelid, MAP3K1 is expressed abundantly in the epithelial cells and is required for activation of the Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), leading to phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun (13Zhang L.

https://openalex.org/W774391212,"Background Long-term hypoxia (LTH) is an important stressor related to health and disease during development. At different time points from fetus to adult, we are exposed to hypoxic stress because of placental insufficiency, high-altitude residence, smoking, chronic anemia, pulmonary, and heart disorders, as well as cancers. Intrauterine hypoxia can lead to fetal growth restriction and long-term sequelae such as cognitive impairments, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and schizophrenia. Similarly, prolonged hypoxic exposure during adult life can lead to acute mountain sickness, chronic fatigue, chronic headache, cognitive impairment, acute cerebral and/or pulmonary edema, and death. Aim LTH also can lead to alteration in metabolites such as fumarate, 2-oxoglutarate, malate, and lactate, which are linked to epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Importantly, during the intrauterine life, a fetus is under a relative hypoxic environment, as compared to newborn or adult. Thus, the changes in gene expression with development from fetus to newborn to adult may be as a consequence of underlying changes in the metabolic profile because of the hypoxic environment along with developmental maturation. To examine this possibility, we examined the metabolic profile in carotid arteries from near-term fetus, newborn, and adult sheep in both normoxic and long-term hypoxic acclimatized groups. Results Our results demonstrate that LTH differentially regulated glucose metabolism, mitochondrial metabolism, nicotinamide cofactor metabolism, oxidative stress and antioxidants, membrane lipid hydrolysis, and free fatty acid metabolism, each of which may play a role in genetic-epigenetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W849188255,"Collagen-induced arthritis is a B cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Recently published studies have demonstrated that in some rare cases pathogens can confer protection from autoimmunity. Trypanosoma brucei parasites are tsetse fly transmitted extracellular protozoans causing sleeping sickness disease in humans and Nagana in livestock in sub-Saharan endemic areas. In the past, we demonstrated that trypanosome infections impair B cell homeostasis and abolish vaccine-induced protection against unrelated antigens. Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice. We observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type II collagen titers of the different IgG isotypes in the serum. Treatment of infected mice with Berenil, a trypanocidal drug, restored the development of CIA-associated clinical symptoms. Interestingly, these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized DBA/1 prone mice with T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Together, these results demonstrate that T. brucei infection is impairing the maintenance of the antigen specific plasma B cell pool driving the development of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice."
https://openalex.org/W758294159,"The South American Transition Zone (SATZ) is a biogeographic area in which not only orogeny (Andes uplift) and climate events (aridification) since the mid-Miocene, but also Quaternary glaciation cycles had an important impact on the evolutionary history of the local flora. To study this effect, we selected Munroa argentina, an annual grass distributed in the biogeographic provinces of Puna, Prepuna and Monte. We collected 152 individuals from 20 localities throughout the species' range, ran genetic and demographic analyses, and applied ecological niche modeling. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses based on cpDNA and AFLP data identified three phylogroups that correspond to the previously identified subregions within the SATZ. Molecular dating suggests that M. argentina has inhabited the SATZ since approximately 3.4 (4.2-1.2) Ma and paleomodels predict suitable climate in these areas during the Interglacial period and the Last Glacial Maximum. We conclude that the current distribution of M. argentina resulted from the fragmentation of its once continuous range and that climate oscillations promoted ecological differences that favored isolation by creating habitat discontinuity."
https://openalex.org/W830104454,"We previously identified several peptide sequences that mimicked the terminal sugars of complex glycans. Using plant lectins as analogs of lectin-type cell-surface receptors, a tetravalent form of a peptide with the sequence NPSHPLSG, designated svH1C, bound with high avidity to lectins specific for glycans with terminal 5-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-galactose (Gal)/N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) sequences. In this report, we show by circular dichroism and NMR spectra that svH1C lacks an ordered structure and thus interacts with binding sites from a flexible conformation. The peptide binds with high avidity to several recombinant human siglec receptors that bind preferentially to Neu5Ac(α2,3)Gal, Neu5Ac(α2,6)GalNAc or Neu5Ac(α2,8)Neu5Ac ligands. In addition, the peptide bound the receptor NKG2D, which contains a lectin-like domain that binds Neu5Ac(α2,3)Gal. The peptide bound to these receptors with a KD in the range of 0.6 to 1 μM. Binding to these receptors was inhibited by the glycoprotein fetuin, which contains multiple glycans that terminate in Neu5Ac(α2,3)Gal or Neu5Ac(α2,6)Gal, and by sialyllactose. Binding of svH1C was not detected with CLEC9a, CLEC10a or DC-SIGN, which are lectin-type receptors specific for other sugars. Incubation of neuraminidase-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with svH1C resulted in binding of the peptide to a subset of the CD14+ monocyte population. Tyrosine phosphorylation of siglecs decreased dramatically when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with 100 nM svH1C. Subcutaneous, alternate-day injections of svH1C into mice induced several-fold increases in populations of several types of immune cells in the peritoneal cavity. These results support the conclusion that svH1C mimics Neu5Ac-containing sequences and interacts with cell-surface receptors with avidities sufficient to induce biological responses at low concentrations. The attenuation of inhibitory receptors suggests that svH1C has characteristics of a checkpoint inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1679535342,"Insulators are cis-elements that control the direction of enhancer and silencer activities (enhancer-blocking) and protect genes from silencing by heterochromatinization (barrier activity). Understanding insulators is critical to elucidate gene regulatory mechanisms at chromosomal domain levels. Here, we focused on a genomic region upstream of the mouse Ccnb1ip1 (cyclin B1 interacting protein 1) gene that was methylated in E9.5 embryos of the C57BL/6 strain, but unmethylated in those of the 129X1/SvJ and JF1/Ms strains. We hypothesized the existence of an insulator-type element that prevents the spread of DNA methylation within the 1.8 kbp segment, and actually identified a 242-bp and a 185-bp fragments that were located adjacent to each other and showed insulator and enhancer activities, respectively, in reporter assays. We designated these genomic regions as the Ccnb1ip1 insulator and the Ccnb1ip1 enhancer. The Ccnb1ip1 insulator showed enhancer-blocking activity in the luciferase assays and barrier activity in the colony formation assays. Further examination of the Ccnb1ip1 locus in other mammalian species revealed that the insulator and enhancer are highly conserved among a wide variety of species, and are located immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site of Ccnb1ip1. These newly identified cis-elements may be involved in transcriptional regulation of Ccnb1ip1, which is important in meiotic crossing-over and G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle."

The objective of this study was to report the first population-based cancer surveillance of infants in Taiwan.Cancer frequencies and incidence rates among subjects aged <1 year for the period 1995-2009 were obtained from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Types of cancers were grouped according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. Rates and trends were analyzed by sex and disease groups and further compared with that of other countries.A total of 900 infants were diagnosed with cancers, giving an incidence rate of 250.7 per million person-years from 1995 to 2009. The male-to-female incidence rate ratio was 1.22. Overall, leukemias (56.3 per million) were the most common cancer, followed by germ cell neoplasms (43.2) and neuroblastomas (41.8). The incidence increased by 2.5% annually during the 15-year study period and was predominantly contributed by male infants (3.5%). Compared with other countries, the rate of hepatoblastoma in Taiwan was second to that from Beijing (China) and 2 to 5 times greater compared with the US, France, the North of England and Osaka (Japan). The rates of germ cell neoplasms were 2 to 4 times greater in Taiwan.The current data suggests that cancer incidence rate among male infants was rising in Taiwan. The factors associated with higher rates of hepatoblastoma and germ cell neoplasms warrant further investigation on similar ethnic groups of different areas to elucidate the potential environmental impacts while controlling for race."

According to many codes and standards, strut-and-tie model (STM) is recommended as a rational approach for deep beam analyses. This research focuses on the STM recommended by ACI 318-11 and AASHTO LRFD and uses experimental results to modify the strut effectiveness factor in STM for reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams. This study aims to refine STM through the strut effectiveness factor and increase result accuracy. Six RC deep beams with different shear span to effective-depth ratios (a/d) of 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, and 2.00 were experimentally tested under a four-point bending set-up. The ultimate shear strength of deep beams obtained from non-linear finite element modeling and STM recommended by ACI 318-11 as well as AASHTO LRFD (2012) were compared with the experimental results. An empirical equation was proposed to modify the principal tensile strain value in the bottle-shaped strut of deep beams. The equation of the strut effectiveness factor from AASHTTO LRFD was then modified through the aforementioned empirical equation. An investigation on the failure mode and crack propagation in RC deep beams subjected to load was also conducted."
https://openalex.org/W1917148724,"Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are involved in proliferative and differentiation physiological responses. Deregulation of FGFR-mediated signaling involving the Ras/PI3K/Akt and the Ras/Raf/ERK MAPK pathways is causally involved in the development of several cancers. The caspase-3/p120 RasGAP module is a stress sensor switch. Under mild stress conditions, RasGAP is cleaved by caspase-3 at position 455. The resulting N-terminal fragment, called fragment N, stimulates anti-death signaling. When caspase-3 activity further increases, fragment N is cleaved at position 157. This generates a fragment, called N2, that no longer protects cells. Here, we investigated in Xenopus oocytes the impact of RasGAP and its fragments on FGF1-mediated signaling during G2/M cell cycle transition. RasGAP used its N-terminal Src homology 2 domain to bind FGFR once stimulated by FGF1, and this was necessary for the recruitment of Akt to the FGFR complex. Fragment N, which did not associate with the FGFR complex, favored FGF1-induced ERK stimulation, leading to accelerated G2/M transition. In contrast, fragment N2 bound the FGFR, and this inhibited mTORC2-dependent Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation and ERK2 phosphorylation but not phosphorylation of Akt on Thr-308. This also blocked cell cycle progression. Inhibition of Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation and entry into G2/M was relieved by PHLPP phosphatase inhibition. Hence, full-length RasGAP favors Akt activity by shielding it from deactivating phosphatases. This shielding was abrogated by fragment N2. These results highlight the role played by RasGAP in FGFR signaling and how graded stress intensities, by generating different RasGAP fragments, can positively or negatively impact this signaling.

Consequently, increasing efforts are currently focusing on the development of strategies to target FGF/FGFR signaling for cancer therapy. FGF receptor pleckstrin homology Src homology 2 and 3, respectively oligonucleotide polyproline germinal vesicle breakdown. FGF binding to FGFRs promotes their phosphorylation and activation, which initiates various intracellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and the Ras/ERK MAPK pathways (13Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cellular signaling by fibroblast growth factor receptors.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). The recruitment and the activation of proteins implicated in the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade occur in an ordered sequence of events through the successive docking of FRS2, Grb2, and PI3K to the autophosphorylated FGFR (4Furdui C.M.

Cell. 2006; 21: 711-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PI3K activation leads to the recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, allowing Akt phosphorylation on two key activating residues, Thr-308 and Ser-473 (14Cybulski N. Hall M.N. TOR complex 2: a signaling pathway of its own.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 620-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The activation loop of Akt is phosphorylated on Thr-308 by another FGFR-recruited kinase, PDK1, and on Ser-473 by the mTORC2 complex (15Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating downstream.Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Thr-308 is a prerequisite for kinase activation, whereas the phosphorylation of Ser-473 seems to further increase Akt activity. However, Akt-dependent responses can be activated in the absence of Ser-473 phosphorylation (15Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating downstream.Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4689) Google Scholar). Akt further interacts with other cell cycle partners and anti-apoptotic substrates to promote cell survival. Akt is deregulated in a large variety of cancers. Radiotherapy relapse has been associated with persistent Akt phosphorylation (16Kumar A. Rajendran V. Sethumadhavan R. Purohit R. AKT kinase pathway: a leading target in cancer research.Sci.

Similar to Ras activators, the Ras modulator p120 RasGAP associates, through its N-terminal part, with the phosphorylated FGFR (18Pamonsinlapatham P. Hadj-Slimane R. Lepelletier Y. Allain B.

Regulation of Ras activity by RasGAP is complex, however, because its N-terminal moiety positively participates in Ras signaling (21Duchesne M. Schweighoffer F. Parker F. Clerc F. Frobert Y.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with a positive effect of RasGAP on Ras signaling is the observation that RasGAP, downstream of FGFR activation, is a co-activator of the Src kinase to stimulate the Ras/MAPK cascade and cell cycle progression (24Cailliau K. Browaeys-Poly E. Vilain J.P. RasGAP is involved in signal transduction triggered by FGF1 in Xenopus oocytes expressing FGFR1.FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The p120 RasGAP protein was shown to be sequentially cleaved at two cleavage sites by graded increases in caspase-3 activity (25Yang J.Y. Michod D. Walicki J. Widmann C.

Caspase-3 and RasGAP: a stress-sensing survival/demise switch.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 83-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The first cleavage of RasGAP occurs at very low caspase-3 activity, generating two fragments, including an N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–455), called fragment N, that exerts a potent anti-apoptotic signal mediated by the activation of the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway (22Yang J.Y. Widmann C. The RasGAP N-terminal fragment generated by caspase cleavage protects cells in a Ras/PI3K/Akt-dependent manner that does not rely on NFκB activation.J. Biol.

Cell. 2005; 16: 3511-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the manner in which fragment N activates this pathway remains poorly understood. The increase of caspase activity above a certain threshold leads to further cleavage of fragment N at position 157 that generates two fragments called N1 (amino acids 1–156) and N2 (amino acids 157–455). The cleavage of fragment N abrogates its capacity to activate Akt (29Bulat N. Jaccard E. Peltzer N. Khalil H. Yang J.Y. Dubuis G. Widmann C. RasGAP-derived fragment N increases the resistance of beta cells towards apoptosis in NOD mice and delays the progression from mild to overt diabetes.PLoS One. 2011; 6e22609 Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This inactivates the anti-apoptotic function of fragment N so that caspases are no longer hampered in their ability to kill cells (28Yang J.Y. Walicki J. Michod D. Dubuis G. Widmann C.

Fragment N2 strongly potentiates cell death and sensitizes tumor cells, but not normal cells, to the killing action of several genotoxins (30Annibaldi A. Michod D. Vanetta L. Cruchet S. Nicod P.

Fragment N2 also inhibits cell adhesiveness and cell migration in a DLC1-dependent manner (32Barras D. Lorusso G. Rüegg C. Widmann C. Inhibition of cell migration and invasion mediated by the TAT-RasGAP317–326 peptide requires the DLC1 tumor suppressor.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 5163-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as well as hampering breast cancer metastatic progression (31Barras D.

Cancer. 2014; 135: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The rationale for optimal targeting of the FGF/FGFR pathway in cancers must incorporate the notion that the therapeutic treatment needs to discriminate as much as possible between normal cells and tumor cells. Studies on the regulation of cell division by growth factors are sometimes difficult to interpret due to the other cellular actions that these receptors exert. Biological systems where specific FGFR responses on cell cycle can be analyzed are therefore useful to overcome this difficulty. The Xenopus oocyte has long been used for this purpose (33Browaeys-Poly E. Cailliau K. Vilain J.P.

It offers the advantage of a large cell in which specific growth factor receptors and cytosolic regulators can be expressed and analyzed for signaling using biochemical techniques. Xenopus oocytes express no endogenous FGFR and only one tyrosine kinase receptor for insulin. They are naturally arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Their activation by the physiological inducer progesterone, by insulin, or by ligands of heterologously expressed growth factor receptors allows their synchronized progression into the M phase of the cell cycle (also called the maturation process) (36Nebreda A.R. Ferby I. Regulation of the meiotic cell cycle in oocytes.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Using this model, the signaling complexes and the various cascades elicited by different FGFR isoforms and by FGFR from breast cancer cells have been successfully characterized (24Cailliau K.

In the present study, we used this powerful integrated cellular system to investigate the impact of RasGAP and its caspase-3-generated fragments on the signaling events triggered by FGFR stimulation. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured at confluence in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mm HEPES, 2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. After anesthesia with MS 222 (1 g/liter; Sandoz), Xenopus laevis ovaries were surgically removed and placed in ND96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH), supplemented with streptomycin/penicillin (50 μg/ml; Eurobio), sodium pyruvate (225 μg/ml; Sigma), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (30 μg/ml; Sigma). Stage VI oocytes were harvested by using a 1-h treatment with collagenase A (1 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science) followed by a manual defolliculation. The oocytes were kept at 19 °C in the ND96 medium. For each experiment, 20 oocytes isolated from three animals were used. Fragment N, fragment N2, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were produced as described previously (26Yang J.Y. Michod D.

https://openalex.org/W2130275016,"Sexual selection and aerodynamic forces affecting structural properties of the flight feathers of birds are poorly understood. Here, we compared the structural features of the innermost primary wing feather (P1) and the sexually dimorphic outermost (Ta6) and monomorphic second outermost (Ta5) tail feathers of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from a Romanian population to investigate how sexual selection and resistance to aerodynamic forces affect structural differences among these feathers. Furthermore, we compared structural properties of Ta6 of barn swallows from six European populations. Finally, we determined the relationship between feather growth bars width (GBW) and the structural properties of tail feathers. The structure of P1 indicates strong resistance against aerodynamic forces, while the narrow rachis, low vane density and low bending stiffness of tail feathers suggest reduced resistance against airflow. The highly elongated Ta6 is characterized by structural modifications such as large rachis width and increased barbule density in relation to the less elongated Ta5, which can be explained by increased length and/or high aerodynamic forces acting at the leading tail edge. However, these changes in Ta6 structure do not allow for full compensation of elongation, as reflected by the reduced bending stiffness of Ta6. Ta6 elongation in males resulted in feathers with reduced resistance, as shown by the low barb density and reduced bending stiffness compared to females. The inconsistency in sexual dimorphism and in change in quality traits of Ta6 among six European populations shows that multiple factors may contribute to shaping population differences. In general, the difference in quality traits between tail feathers cannot be explained by the GBW of feathers. Our results show that the material and structural properties of wing and tail feathers of barn swallows change as a result of aerodynamic forces and sexual selection, although the result of these changes can be contrasting."
https://openalex.org/W845471481,"The neurobiology of reaching has been extensively studied in human and non-human primates. However, the mechanisms that allow a subject to decide-without engaging in explicit action-whether an object is reachable are not fully understood. Some studies conclude that decisions near the reach limit depend on motor simulations of the reaching movement. Others have shown that the body schema plays a role in explicit and implicit distance estimation, especially after motor practice with a tool. In this study we evaluate the causal role of multisensory body representations in the perception of reachable space. We reasoned that if body schema is used to estimate reach, an illusion of the finger size induced by proprioceptive stimulation should propagate to the perception of reaching distances. To test this hypothesis we induced a proprioceptive illusion of extension or shrinkage of the right index finger while participants judged a series of LEDs as reachable or non-reachable without actual movement. Our results show that reach distance estimation depends on the illusory perceived size of the finger: illusory elongation produced a shift of reaching distance away from the body whereas illusory shrinkage produced the opposite effect. Combining these results with previous findings, we suggest that deciding if a target is reachable requires an integration of body inputs in high order multisensory parietal areas that engage in movement simulations through connections with frontal premotor areas."
https://openalex.org/W1957054327,"Bats account for ~20% of mammalian species, and are the only mammals with true powered flight. For the sake of their specialized phenotypic traits, many researches have been devoted to examine the evolution of bats. Until now, some whole genome sequences of bats have been assembled and annotated, however, a uniform resource for the annotated bat genomes is still unavailable. To make the extensive data associated with the bat genomes accessible to the general biological communities, we established a Bat Genome Database (BGD). BGD is an open-access, web-available portal that integrates available data of bat genomes and genes. It hosts data from six bat species, including two megabats and four microbats. Users can query the gene annotations using efficient searching engine, and it offers browsable tracks of bat genomes. Furthermore, an easy-to-use phylogenetic analysis tool was also provided to facilitate online phylogeny study of genes. To the best of our knowledge, BGD is the first database of bat genomes. It will extend our understanding of the bat evolution and be advantageous to the bat sequences analysis. BGD is freely available at: http://donglab.ecnu.edu.cn/databases/BatGenome/."
