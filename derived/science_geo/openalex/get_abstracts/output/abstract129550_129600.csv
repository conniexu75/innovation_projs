https://openalex.org/W2046774437,"Caveolae are microdomains of the plasma membrane that have been implicated in organizing and compartmentalizing signal transducing molecules. Caveolin, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal structural component of caveolae membranein vivo. Recently, we and other laboratories have identified a family of caveolin-related proteins; caveolin has been re-termed caveolin-1. Here, we examine the cell-type and tissue-specific expression of caveolin-2. For this purpose, we generated a novel mono-specific monoclonal antibody probe that recognizes only caveolin-2, but not caveolins-1 and -3. A survey of cell and tissue types demonstrates that the caveolin-2 protein is most abundantly expressed in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, skeletal myoblasts (L6, BC3H1, C2C12), fibroblasts, and 3T3-L1 cells differentiated to adipocytes. This pattern of caveolin-2 protein expression most closely resembles the cellular distribution of caveolin-1. In line with these observations, co-immunoprecipitation experiments with mono-specific antibodies directed against either caveolin-1 or caveolin-2 directly show that these molecules form a stable hetero-oligomeric complex. The in vivo relevance of this complex was further revealed by dual-labeling studies employing confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. Our results indicate that caveolins 1 and 2 are strictly co-localized within the plasma membrane and other internal cellular membranes. Ultrastructurally, this pattern of caveolin-2 localization corresponds to caveolae membranes as seen by immunoelectron microscopy. Despite this strict co-localization, it appears that regulation of caveolin-2 expression occurs independently of the expression of either caveolin-1 or caveolin-3 as observed using two different model cell systems. Although caveolin-1 expression is down-regulated in response to oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, caveolin-2 protein levels remain unchanged. Also, caveolin-2 protein levels remain unchanged during the differentiation of C2C12 cells from myoblasts to myotubes, while caveolin-3 levels are dramatically induced by this process. These results suggest that expression levels of caveolins 1, 2, and 3 can be independently up-regulated or down-regulated in response to a variety of distinct cellular cues."

(1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 3938–3644). The TGF-β receptor down-regulation enables cells to escape from the inhibition of differentiation by TGF-β. To clarify how the cell-matrix interaction regulates these phenotypic changes, signaling pathways were examined in murine MC3T3-E1 cells. Attachment of cells to COL(I) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and enhanced MAPK activity. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase by herbimycin A, destruction of focal adhesion by cytochalasin D, or overexpression of antisense FAK mRNA prevented the activation of ERK/MAPK and the increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Transient expression of a MAPK-specific phosphatase, CL100, also suppressed the elevation of ALP activity. In addition, introduction of a constitutively active MAPK kinase enhanced ALP activity in the absence of collagen production. TGF-β receptor down-regulation was abrogated by treatments that inactivate FAK, whereas the expression of CL100 had no effect. These results demonstrate that COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction facilitates differentiation and down-regulates TGF-β receptors via the activation of FAK and its diverse downstream signals. These signaling pathways may play an important role in the sequential differentiation of osteoblasts during bone formation. Interaction of type I collagen (COL(I)) with α2β1 integrin causes differentiation and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor down-regulation in osteoblastic cells (Takeuchi, Y., Nakayama, K., and Matsumoto, T.

Cells of osteoblast lineage exert various functions depending upon their differentiation stages to maintain bone formation.

Mineralization of newly formed matrix takes place thereafter (1Stein G. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). To form bones with structural integrity and physical strength, it appears to be of critical importance to maintain the sequential development of these multiple osteoblastic phenotypes.Using osteoblastic cells from bone or of clonal origin, various hormones and cytokines are shown to affect the differentiation process and functional properties of these cells (1Stein G. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 2Centrella M. Horowitz M.C. Wozney J.M. McCarthy T.L. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 27-39PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these factors, matrix COL(I) is required for the differentiation of osteoblasts (3Franceschi R. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 4Quarles L. Yohay D.A. Lever L.W. Caton R. Wenstrup R.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the effect of COL(I) on the development of osteoblastic properties is mediated by the interaction of COL(I) with cell-surface α2β1 integrin and that the interaction also causes down-regulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptors without affecting the expression of the receptor mRNA (5Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting the translocation of TGF-β receptors from cell surface to intracellular compartments. Because TGF-β potently stimulates matrix protein synthesis but inhibits differentiation of osteoblasts (5Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the down-regulation of its receptors may serve to facilitate further maturation of osteoblasts and mineralization of newly formed matrix. However, the mechanism and the intracellular pathways that control the differentiation and TGF-β receptor down-regulation of osteoblastic cells by COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction remain unclear.Accumulating evidence indicates that stimulation of β1 integrin by matrix proteins initiates intracellular signaling pathways in many types of cells (6Meredith J.E.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). One of the initial events triggered by the stimulation of β1 integrin is the association of its cytoplasmic domain with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytosolic non-receptor tyrosine kinase, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK (10Parsons J.T. Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J. Leu T.H. Richardson A. Otey C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 18: 109-113Crossref Google Scholar). FAK-deficient mice display severe defects of mesodermal development in embryogenesis (11Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The phenotype of FAK-deficient mice is strikingly similar to the fibronectin-deficient phenotype (12George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that FAK uniquely mediates matrix-integrin interactions in cellular processes. Phosphorylated FAK associates with and activates several signal transduction molecules including Src and Grb2 (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), which may cause the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via Ras (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), although MAPK can be activated in response to integrin ligation irrespective of FAK activation when an adaptor protein Shc is recruited and phosphorylated (13Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). FAK also activates diverse signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase (7Clark E.A. Brugger J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar).MAPK plays diverse roles in the control of the proliferation and differentiation of various cells (14Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar, 15Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a member of MAPK, is activated by integrin stimulation in fibroblasts (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 16Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T.

Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The activation of PI-3 kinase is associated with recycling via early endosomes (18Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fray F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and endocytosis by activating Rho family proteins (19Schmalzing G. Richter H.P. Hansen A. Schwarz W. Just I. Aktories K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation and the intracellular translocation of TGF-β receptors by the COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction may be mediated by these signaling cascades and that FAK is the immediate transducer of extracellular signals from α2β1 integrin. The present study was undertaken to identify signal transduction pathways for osteoblastic differentiation and TGF-β receptor down-regulation triggered by COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction.DISCUSSIONProduction of COL(I) is one of the earlier events associated with osteoblastic differentiation. Following the synthesis of COL(I), sequential expression of ALP and osteocalcin is observed (1Stein G. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the interaction of matrix COL(I) with cell-surface α2β1 integrin on MC3T3-E1 cells is required for osteoblastic differentiation of these cells (5Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism whereby cell-matrix interaction affects the differentiation of osteoblasts has been unclear. The present studies demonstrate that the attachment of MC3T3-E1 cells to COL(I) via α2β1 integrin activates FAK-MAPK pathway by stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation of these signaling molecules. These results are in agreement with the previous observations in fibroblasts that aggregation of β1 integrin family via attachment to extracellular matrix triggers localized intracellular accumulation of 20 signal transducing molecules, including Ras, Raf, MAPKK, ERK/MAPK, and RhoA, followed by the activation of ERK/MAPK (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The importance of the present results lies in the observation that this signaling cascade is required for the differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Thus, disruption of the cascade at any point curtails the stimulation of ALP activity as follows: the first step is the COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction, and blockade of the interaction by an anti-α2β1 integrin antibody (5Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or by suppressing collagen synthesis (3Franceschi R. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 5Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) inhibited the elevation of ALP activity. Although α1β1 and α3β1 integrins are also receptors for COL(I), α2β1 integrin appears to be the functional receptor for COL(I) in osteoblastic cells (5Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The second step is tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK triggered by the COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction. Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity by herbimycin A or destruction of the integrity of focal adhesion by cytochalasin D (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 20Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) prevented tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK as well as the increase in ALP activity. The essential role of FAK activation in this signaling cascade for osteoblastic differentiation is further corroborated by the fact that the expression of antisense FAK mRNA in osteoblastic cells prevented the increase in ALP activity. The third step is the activation of ERK/MAPK. ERK/MAPK was tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated upon attachment of MC3T3-E1 cells to COL(I), which was suppressed in cells expressing antisense FAK mRNA. Thus, ERK/MAPK is stimulated presumably via the activation of FAK. Inactivation of ERK/MAPK by transient expression of a MAPK-specific phosphoprotein phosphatase, CL100 (22Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gotoh Y. Masuyama N. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suppressed the elevation of ALP activity by COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction, and its activation by a constitutively active MAPKK (SESE-MAPKK) stimulated the ALP activity, suggesting that ERK/MAPK mediates the signal for osteoblastic differentiation.Receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases are shown to play an important role in the regulation of the proliferation and differentiation of various types of cells via the activation of MAPK. However, it is as yet unclear how the same signaling pathway controls such diverse cellular events (26Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). For instance, EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activates cell growth, whereas nerve growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase initiates differentiation of neuronal cells (14Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar, 27Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although both kinases activate MAPK, the time course of its activation by the former is rapid and transient, while that by the latter is slow and sustained. Similar to these observations, basic fibroblast growth factor stimulates its receptor tyrosine kinase and MAPK cascade in a rapid and transient time course (28Tsao H. Aletta J.M. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15471-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and strongly inhibits ALP activity but stimulates proliferation in osteosarcoma cells (29Rodan S.B. Wesolowski G. Yoon K. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19934-19941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. 2Y. Takeuchi, unpublished observations.In contrast, MAPK activation by COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction in osteoblastic cells is slow and sustained. These different processes of MAPK activation may cause discrete nuclear localization of the active kinase and may explain diverse effects of the single kinase (14Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar).Although the present studies demonstrate that the signaling pathway from β1 integrin to ERK/MAPK via FAK is required for osteoblastic differentiation, it may not be sufficient for stimulating differentiation. In fact, the β1 integrin-FAK-ERK/MAPK cascade is widely present among mesenchymal cells (8Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 9Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 16Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Tobe K. Ueki K. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. Kadowaki T. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 269-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions induced by integrins are reported to cause co-localization of signaling molecules including growth factor receptors (26Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), which may facilitate the interactions of these molecules (6Meredith J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.-D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Several members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family are potent stimulators of osteoblastic differentiation (30Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar, 31Yamaguchi A. Katagiri T. Ikeda T. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Kahn A.J. Suda T. Yoshiki S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Our recent observations demonstrate that MC3T3-E1 cells possess types I and II BMP receptors and express BMP-2 mRNA, and extracellular matrix synthesized by these cells exhibit immunostaining with anti-BMP-2 antibody. 3M. Suzawa, Y. Takeuchi, and T. Matsumoto, unpublished observations. Therefore, the possibility remains that COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction may, in addition to transduce its own signal via FAK-MAPK pathway, allow co-localization of BMP receptors on osteoblastic cells to generate additional signals for promoting osteoblastic differentiation. Alternatively, there may be a cross-talk between these intracellular signaling pathways. The inter-relationship and the relative roles of these pathways in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation remain to be clarified.The down-regulation of TGF-β receptors induced by COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction was prevented by herbimycin A or cytochalasin D, and was abrogated in cells expressing antisense FAK mRNA.2 The receptor down-regulation was also prevented by wortmannin but not by the inactivation of ERK/MAPK with transient expression of CL100. In contrast, the elevation of ALP activity was prevented by the inactivation of ERK/MAPK but not by wortmannin. These results suggest that the down-regulation of TGF-β receptors by COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction is mediated via pathways susceptible to wortmannin but not MAPK and that the elevation of ALP activity is not mediated via the former pathways but the latter one after FAK activation. FAK is directly associated with and activates PI-3 kinase (7Clark E.A. Brugger J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar, 32Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and integrin-mediated signaling pathways also include phospholipase A2 and C (7Clark E.A. Brugger J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Wortmannin not only inhibits PI-3 kinase but also affects these phospholipases (33Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because FAK activation was not affected and ERK/MAPK activity was only partially suppressed by wortmannin in our experiments, it is possible that FAK activation generates several distinct signaling pathways to cause diverse effects in osteoblastic cells. The fact that the down-regulation of TGF-β receptors is susceptible to wortmannin is intriguing if it occurs through translocation of the receptors, because PI-3 kinase binds to platelet-derived growth factor receptor through its SH2 domain and directly mediates the receptor trafficking (18Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fray F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). PI-3 kinase is also implicated in clathrin-independent endocytosis via activation of small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (19Schmalzing G. Richter H.P. Hansen A. Schwarz W. Just I. Aktories K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to PI-3 kinase, other wortmannin-sensitive signaling molecules, phospholipase A2 and C, are also involved in cytoskeletal changes (7Clark E.A. Brugger J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Thus, these molecules may be implicated in the internalization of TGF-β receptors to cause their down-regulation. However, the cytoplasmic domain of TGF-β receptors lacks SH2 binding domains, and the mechanism that causes their down-regulation has yet to be elucidated.The most striking effect of TGF-β in osteoblasts is the stimulation of matrix protein synthesis including COL(I). TGF-β also enhances the expression of α2β1 integrin in osteoblastic cells (34Heino J. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21806-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is expected to facilitate the interaction of osteoblasts with COL(I). In contrast, TGF-β strongly inhibits the differentiation of osteoblasts (35Harris S. Bonewald L.F. Harris M.A. Sabatini M. Dallas S. Feng J.Q. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Wozney J. Mundy G.R. J. Bone Miner.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The observations presented herein suggest that the signaling cascades initiated by COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction can directly facilitate osteoblastic differentiation on the one hand via the FAK-MAPK pathway, and, at the same time, enable osteoblasts to escape from the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on the differentiation of osteoblasts by the down-regulation of TGF-β receptors via FAK-mediated pathway(s) sensitive to wortmannin. These observations illustrate the importance of cell-matrix interactions in the regulation of the sequential development of osteoblastic phenotypes during the bone formation process. Cells of osteoblast lineage exert various functions depending upon their differentiation stages to maintain bone formation. Production of type I collagen (COL(I) 1The abbreviations used are: COL(I), type I collagen; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; TGF, transforming growth factor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ERK, extracellular signals-regulated kinase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MEM, minimum essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; mAb, monoclonal antibody.1The abbreviations used are: COL(I), type I collagen; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; TGF, transforming growth factor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ERK, extracellular signals-regulated kinase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MEM, minimum essential medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; mAb, monoclonal antibody.) is one of the earlier events during this process, followed by sequential expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin. Mineralization of newly formed matrix takes place thereafter (1Stein G. Lian J.B. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 424-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar).

Res. 1992; 7: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the effect of COL(I) on the development of osteoblastic properties is mediated by the interaction of COL(I) with cell-surface α2β1 integrin and that the interaction also causes down-regulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptors without affecting the expression of the receptor mRNA (5Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting the translocation of TGF-β receptors from cell surface to intracellular compartments. Because TGF-β potently stimulates matrix protein synthesis but inhibits differentiation of osteoblasts (5Takeuchi Y. Nakayama K. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3938-3944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the down-regulation of its receptors may serve to facilitate further maturation of osteoblasts and mineralization of newly formed matrix. However, the mechanism and the intracellular pathways that control the differentiation and TGF-β receptor down-regulation of osteoblastic cells by COL(I)-α2β1 integrin interaction remain unclear. Accumulating evidence indicates that stimulation of β1 integrin by matrix proteins initiates intracellular signaling pathways in many types of cells (6Meredith J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). One of the initial events triggered by the stimulation of β1 integrin is the association of its cytoplasmic domain with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytosolic non-receptor tyrosine kinase, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK (10Parsons J.T. Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J. Leu T.H. Richardson A. Otey C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 18: 109-113Crossref Google Scholar). FAK-deficient mice display severe defects of mesodermal development in embryogenesis (11Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The phenotype of FAK-deficient mice is strikingly similar to the fibronectin-deficient phenotype (12George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that FAK uniquely mediates matrix-integrin interactions in cellular processes. Phosphorylated FAK associates with and activates several signal transduction molecules including Src and Grb2 (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), which may cause the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via Ras (9Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), although MAPK can be activated in response to integrin ligation irrespective of FAK activation when an adaptor protein Shc is recruited and phosphorylated (13Wary K.K.

To identify and characterize additional cell-surface proteins that might form complexes with integrins, we designed a systematic approach based on a three-step monoclonal antibody screening protocol. After immunizing mice with integrin complexes, we screened for mAbs to integrin-associated proteins by (i) flow cytometry to select mAbs reactive with the cell surface, (ii) flow cytometry to eliminate anti-integrin mAbs, and (iii) high and low stringency immunoprecipitation. By applying this approach we have discovered novel interactions between two integrins (α3β1and α6β1) and the EMMPRIN/basigin/OX47/M6 protein. The latter molecule is a widely distributed cell-surface protein with two immunoglobulin-like domains (25Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) subunits were previously described. HT1080 cells were surface-labeled with NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) or Na125I according to established protocols and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Brij 96, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected onto Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) that were pre-bound with mAb, followed by four washes with the immunoprecipitation buffer. For immunoprecipitation under stringent conditions, the immunoprecipitation buffer was supplemented with 0.2% SDS. Immune complexes were eluted from beads with Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under non-reduced conditions. 125I-Labeled proteins were detected using O-XAR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1–20 days at −70 °C. Biotin-labeled proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized with peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma) using Renaissance Chemiluminescent Reagents (NEN Life Science Products). In some experiments 1% Brij 96 in lysis and washing buffers was substituted by 1% octyl glucoside. Re-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described earlier (11Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein complexes were immunopurified using anti-EMMPRIN (8G6) or anti-integrin mAb-conjugated Sepharose 4B from nonstringent (without 0.2% SDS) Brij 96 lysates of surface-biotinylated HT1080 cells. After five washes, the protein complexes were dissociated for 30 min at 4 °C with Brij 96 buffer containing 0.2% SDS. The eluates were subsequently reprecipitated with mAbs directly coupled to Sepharose 4B. Protein complexes were purified from HT1080 cells using anti-α3 mAb A3-IVA5-coupled Sepharose 4B. After washing, α3β1-containing protein complexes immobilized on antibody-coupled Sepharose beads were used for immunization of an RBF/DnJ mouse. After three injections (each time with complexes derived from 5 × 107–108cells), mouse serum was collected and tested by immunoprecipitation to verify antibody production. Four days after the fourth injection, hybridoma clones were produced as described previously (39Pasqualini R. Bodorova J. Ye S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were then analyzed as described below. For 8G6 antigen/EMMPRIN purification, two human placentas (∼400 g each) were blended in a Waring blender and then solubilized in 2 liters of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 65,000 × g). To remove background bead-binding material, the lysate was sequentially preincubated in batch with Sepharose beads coupled to protein A, Sepharose 4B beads conjugated with BSA, and beads coupled to an irrelevant mAb. The lysate was then incubated in batch with Sepharose 4B beads coupled to mAb 8G6 for 2 h. The beads (2 ml packed volume) were collected and washed with 100-bed volumes of RIPA buffer, and protein was eluted with elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100). Eluted fractions were immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by silver staining. The fraction containing the most antigen was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The 45–55-kDa EMMPRIN protein was visualized by Ponceau S staining and then excised. Amino-terminal sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 470A gas-phase sequenator equipped with a 120A phenylhydantoin amino acid analyzer (Harvard Microsequencing Facility, Cambridge, MA). Cells were incubated with control mAb P3 or specific mAb, washed twice, and then labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). For immunofluorescence analyses, HT1080 cells were grown for 12–16 h on glass coverslips, fixed for 15 min with 2% formaldehyde, in PBS containing 5% sucrose and 5 mm MgCl2, permeabilized for 2 min with 1% CHAPS in PBS, and blocked for 1 h with 20% FCS in PBS. Cells were then stained with mAb to integrin α2 (VIIC6) or MHC class I (W6/32) diluted in 20% FCS in PBS. Finally, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse serum (Tago Co.) before the coverslips were mounted with FluorSave (Calbiochem) and immunofluorescence examined using a Zeiss Axioscop. For co-localization experiments, paraformaldehyde-fixed and permeabilized HT1080 cells were first incubated with a combination of mouse anti-EMMPRIN mAb, 8G6, and rabbit polyclonal sera (against human α3 integrin cytoplasmic domain or anti-Tyr(P)). Staining was further visualized with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse serum and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum. Fig.1 shows that from 1% Brij 96 extracts of Na125I-labeled HT1080 cells, subunit-specific anti-integrin mAbs co-immunoprecipitated not only the expected α and β subunits of ∼150 and 130 kDa but also additional surface-labeled proteins. For example, at least 7–8 additional 125I-labeled proteins were obtained using mAb to α3 (lane h) and β1 (lane k). These other proteins were either absent or less prominent in precipitations using mAb to α2 (lane g), α5 (lane i), or α6 (lane j). Also, most of the additional proteins were not present if more stringent solubilization and immunoprecipitation conditions (1% Brij 96, 0.2% SDS) were utilized (Fig. 1, lanes a–e). A control antibody yielded only a few background proteins (lanes f and l). Integrin co-immunoprecipitation experiments from several other cell lines (data not shown) yielded cell-surface proteins with sizes similar to those co-immunoprecipitated in Fig. 1. To identify additional integrin-associated cell-surface proteins (such as those seen in Fig. 1, lane h), a strategy for systematic selection of mAbs was developed. We focused on proteins complexed with α3β1, because of the apparent abundance of diverse cell-surface proteins associated with that integrin. Beads coated with antibody A3-IVA5 were used to purify α3β1-containing protein complexes from the HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line, and mice were immunized with integrin complexes directly immobilized on the beads. Next, 712 hybridoma clones were prepared, and then mAbs were screened by a three-step protocol. In step 1, flow cytometry was utilized to show that 95 of the 712 hybridoma clones secreted antibodies that recognize cell-surface structures on HT1080 cells. To eliminate antibodies directly recognizing human α3 or β1subunits (step 2), mAb clones were next tested for staining of CHO, CHO-α3, CHO-β1, or CHO-α3β1 transfectants. Of the 95 mAbs from step 1, 12 stained α3 or β1 transfectants, but not untransfected CHO cells, and thus are likely to be anti-α3 or -β1 integrin antibodies. The remaining 83 antibodies (after steps 1 and 2) are candidates to recognize cell-surface structures distinct from but potentially associated with the α3β1 integrin. An example of one of these is hybridoma clone 8G6, selected in step 1 because it stained the surface of HT1080 cells (Fig.2, top right). The 8G6 mAb was retained after step 2, because it did not show preferential binding to a CHO-α3β1 transfectant (Fig. 2,bottom right) compared with CHO cells (Fig. 2, middle right). The presence of human α3 integrin on HT1080 cells and CHO-α3β1 transfectants, but not CHO cells, is confirmed in the left panels of Fig. 2. In step 3, non-stringent immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to determine which mAbs might co-precipitate integrin-like proteins. Of the 83 mAbs tested, 16 mAbs co-immunoprecipitated integrin-like proteins of 120–150 kDa, together with several other proteins. Examples of these are mAb 5C11 (Fig.3, lane d) and mAb 8G6 (lane j). In contrast, mAb 7C3 (lane f) and 8D8 (lane h) are examples of the 67 mAbs that did not co-precipitate detectable integrin-like proteins. The results of mAb screening are summarized in Table I.Table ISelection of mAbs to α3β1-associated proteinsA. Hybridoma clones screened712B. Screening protocol: 1.

The 5C11 mAb precipitated fewer total proteins under stringent conditions (Fig. 3, lane c) compared with non-stringent conditions (Fig. 3, lane d). A protein of 27–29 kDa was seen in lane c, but the presence of several other proteins made it difficult to determine which protein was directly recognized by mAb 5C11. The associated protein defined by this antibody will be more fully described elsewhere. Under non-stringent conditions, multiple biotin-labeled proteins were precipitated by mAb 8G6 (Fig. 3, lane j). In contrast, only 45–55-kDa protein bands were seen using 8G6 under stringent conditions (Fig. 3, lane i). Notably, under stringent detergent conditions, 14 other mAbs (all selected as in Table I) co-precipitated 45–55-kDa proteins nearly identical to that obtained using 8G6. To characterize the 45–55-kDa protein(s) further, we utilized 8G6-coated Sepharose beads to purify ∼400 pmol of protein from ∼800 g of human placenta. Purified material, visualized by silver staining, is shown in Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and4). Amino-terminal amino acid analysis revealed a perfect match, at 22 of 24 positions (Fig. 4 B), between the purified protein and the amino terminus of the human EMMPRIN/M6 antigen (25Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar,28Kasinrerk W. Fiebiger E. Stefanova I. Baumruker T. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 847-854PubMed Google Scholar). Confirming conclusively that mAb 8G6 recognizes human EMMPRIN, CHO cells transfected with EMMPRIN cDNA gained the 8G6 epitope as detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 4 C). Three additional mAbs (6C6, 7E7, and 4F10) that recognize the 45–55-kDa protein also showed strong reactivity toward the EMMPRIN-transfected CHO cells (not shown). To confirm that EMMPRIN is indeed associated with α3β1 integrin, and to determine which other integrins might be associated, we carried out three sets of experiments. First, by Western blotting we detected β1 integrins within an EMMPRIN immune complex (Fig.5 A, lane b) but not in an MHC class I complex (Fig. 5 A, lane a). Notably, anti-β1 antibodies reacted with both immature (pre-β1) and mature forms of β1 in the whole cell lysate (Fig. 5 A, lane c), but only mature β1 was associated with EMMPRIN (Fig. 5 A, lane b). Second, in re-immunoprecipitation experiments, both the α3β1 and α6β1integrins but not α2β1 or α5β1 could be recovered from mAb 8G6 immunoprecipitates of EMMPRIN (Fig. 5 B, lanes a–d). Third, mAb 8G6 re-precipitated EMMPRIN only from α3 and α6 but not α2 or α5immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5 C, lanes a–d). Notably, the size of the EMMPRIN associated with integrins (Fig. 5 C) appears a little smaller than the total EMMPRIN as seen in Figs. 3 and4 A. Possibly, a smaller form of EMMPRIN could selectively associate with integrins. Alternatively, excess glycosylation in the larger forms of EMMPRIN could block access of tyrosines to iodination (used in Fig. 5), while not blocking availability for silver staining (used in Fig. 4 A) or access of amino groups to biotin (used in Fig. 3). To establish whether integrin-EMMPRIN complexes may be present on the cell surface, intact HT1080 cells were treated with the cleavable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). The mAb 8G6 was then used to immunoprecipitate EMMPRIN under stringent conditions to disrupt non-covalent interactions with integrins, and precipitated proteins were subsequently analyzed under reducing conditions to disrupt covalent cross-linker bonds. As indicated, without cross-linker mAb 8G6 precipitated only EMMPRIN (Fig. 6,lane b), but in the presence of 1 mmdithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), additional proteins resembling integrins were present (lane d). These proteins co-migrate with α3β1 (lane e) but likely contain α6β1 as well as α3β1. Besides α3β1, a small amount of 45–55-kDa protein co-migrating with EMMPRIN was also present in the α3immunoprecipitate prepared from the cells treated with cross-linker (lane e). In contrast, proteins resembling EMMPRIN are not typically seen in stringent α3 immunoprecipitations in the absence of cross-linking (e.g. see Fig. 1, lane h). In HT1080 cells grown on coverslips for 24–72 h, EMMPRIN and α3β1 were found to strongly co-localize at cell-cell contact sites, as seen by immunofluorescent double staining (Fig.7, A and B). In control experiments, mAb to MHC class I (Fig. 7 C) and integrin α2β1 (Fig. 7 D) showed even staining of cell surfaces, and some intracellular staining, but no appreciable staining of cell-cell contact sites. When HT1080 cells are plated on laminin substrates, the α3β1, α6β1, and TM4SF proteins localize into focal complexes (24Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2595-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a type of complex that contains phosphotyrosine and is assembled at the periphery of spread cells (45Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar). However, EMMPRIN does not appear to localize in focal complexes. In HT1080 cells plated on a laminin-5-containing ECM substrate, focal complexes (at the cell periphery) were prominently stained with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Fig.8 B). In marked contrast, double staining with mAb 8G6 showed that EMMPRIN was evenly distributed on the cell surface, with elevated levels at cell-cell contacts, but was essentially absent from focal complexes (Fig. 8 A). Given the difference in their cellular localization (focal complexes versus cell-cell contact sites), we hypothesized that EMMPRIN-α3β1 and TM4SF-α3β1 complexes may be distinct. To examine this issue further, we carried out immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether CD81, one of the most predominant TM4SF proteins on HT1080 cells, was present in α3β1-EMMPRIN complexes. As indicated, anti-CD81 mAb precipitated an abundance of the 22-kDa CD81 molecule, together with proteins co-migrating with α3β1, but no proteins resembling EMMPRIN (Fig. 9, lane b). Conversely, anti-EMMPRIN mAb 8G6 precipitated an abundance of the 45–55-kDa EMMPRIN protein and proteins resembling α3β1 but no proteins co-migrating with CD81 (lane c). From proteins precipitated using anti-EMMPRIN mAb 8G6, re-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly showed the α3β1 integrin (Fig. 9, lane d) but no detectable CD81 (lane e). Thus, CD81 does not appear to associate with EMMPRIN. Non-stringent precipitation with an anti-α3 mAb yielded a range of proteins (Fig. 9,lane a), but those corresponding to the 22-kDa CD81 protein and the 44–55-kDa EMMPRIN doublet were not very prominent. It is becoming increasingly apparent that full understanding of integrin functional activities may require understanding of integrin associations with other cell-surface molecules (see Introduction). Here we describe a novel approach for identifying cell-surface proteins that associate with integrins. Our screening protocol is based on well established techniques (flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation) and requires only 3–4 days to identify mAbs that recognize integrin-associated proteins. Our protocol has two important advantages over alternative approaches used previously (such as the yeast two hybrid screening or affinity chromatography with integrin fragments). First, selected mAbs recognize proteins that interact with intact integrin molecules. Thus we may avoid adventitious interactions that arise upon un-natural presentation of fragments. Second, use of immunoprecipitation early in screening provides a reliable assessment of protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, cross-linking subsequent to immunoprecipitation provides an early control for the authenticity of putative associations in the context of intact cells. In a previous study, we immunized mice with intact cells from a mammary epithelial cell line, screened all of the antibodies by immunoprecipitation, and thus identified a novel association between integrins and the TM4SF protein CD63 (10Berditchevski F. Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17784-17790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our current immunization and antibody selection protocol is designed to generate fewer irrelevant antibodies upon initial immunization, and it requires many fewer time-consuming immunoprecipitations. Furthermore, it seems likely that this approach could be easily applied to identify proteins associated with other integrins or with other cell-surface proteins (e.g.. see the accompanying paper (46Tachibana I. Bodorova J. Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29181-29189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)). Various co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown previously that αIIbβ3, α3β1, α6β1, and α4β1integrins associate with several TM4SF proteins, including CD9, CD53, CD63, CD81, and CD82 (10Berditchevski F.

As mentioned here, mouse immunization with α3β1 complexes yielded mAb 5C11. As will be fully described elsewhere, the 5C11 mAb recognizes the TM4SF protein PETA-3/SFA-1. This result confirms and extends the concept that nearly all TM4SF proteins may associate with certain integrins. Perhaps the more novel finding is that specific integrins (α3β1and α6β1) can associate with EMMPRIN (25Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar), a widely distributed 44–45-kDa cell-surface protein with two immunoglobulin domains. Integrin/EMMPRIN association was established by means of reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments, and α3β1/EMMPRIN association was confirmed by cell-surface cross-linking and immunofluorescence co-localization experiments. The human EMMPRIN (25Biswas C. Zhang Y. DeCastro R. Guo H. Nakamura T. Kataoka H. Nabeshima K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 434-439PubMed Google Scholar) protein is named for itsextracellular matrixmetalloproteinase induction (29Kataoka H. DeCastro R. Zucker S. Biswas C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3154-3158PubMed Google Scholar) and is identical to the M6 leukocyte activation antigen (28Kasinrerk W. Fiebiger E. Stefanova I. Baumruker T. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 847-854PubMed Google Scholar). Also, EMMPRIN is highly homologous to a rat molecule named OX-47 (27Fossum S. Mallett S. Barclay A.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or CE9 (47Nehme C.L. Cesario M.M. Myles D.G. Koppel D.E. Bartles J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the mouse basigin (26Miyauchi T. Kanekura T. Yamaoka A. Ozawa M. Miyazawa S. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or gp42 (48Altruda F. Cervella P. Gaeta M.L. Daniele A. Giancotti F. Tarone G. Stefanuto G. Silengo L. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 85: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) molecule, and the chicken HT7 (49Seulberger H. Lottspeich F. Risau W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or neurothelin (50Schlosshauer B. Bauch H. Frank R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 159-166PubMed Google Scholar) molecule. Previous analyses have shown that EMMPRIN size variation results from glycosylation heterogeneity (28Kasinrerk W. Fiebiger E. Stefanova I. Baumruker T. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 847-854PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, by screening a cDNA expression library with polyclonal sera raised against partially purified integrin β1 subunit (51Tarone G. Mascarello P. Zibetti M. Giancotti F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), Altruda and co-workers (48Altruda F. Cervella P. Gaeta M.L. Daniele A. Giancotti F. Tarone G. Stefanuto G. Silengo L. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 85: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) cloned the mouse EMMPRIN/gp42 molecule. Although this earlier study lacks firm biochemical evidence for the EMMPRIN-integrin interactions, to some extent it foreshadows our current finding. From co-immunoprecipitation studies we estimate that at least 2–5% of the total α3β1 (and α6β1) integrin may be associated with EMMPRIN. However, this may be an underestimation due to the technical limitations of immunoprecipitation. Indeed, a much larger proportion of both α3β1 and EMMPRIN appears to be co-localized by immunofluorescence and thus at least are in proximity, if not directly associated. The EMMPRIN/basigin/HT7/OX-47/CE9/neurothelin molecule has been proposed to be a blood-brain barrier molecule (49Seulberger H. Lottspeich F. Risau W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but knock out mice lacking this gene have not yet displayed alterations in blood-brain barrier function (52Igakura T. Kadomatsu K. Taguchi O. Muramatsu H. Kaname T. Miyauchi T. Yamamura K. Arimura K. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Also, EMMPRIN has been suggested to be involved in cell-cell interactions. For example, a mAb against the chicken HT7/neurothelin protein caused a perturbation in cell contact-dependent maturation of glial cells in vitro (53Fadool J.M. Linser P.J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Indeed, our immunofluorescent studies showed that EMMPRIN co-localizes with α3β1 integrin in cell-cell contacts and therefore may potentially interact with one another in a receptor-ligand fashion. In this regard, several transmembrane proteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily act as ligands for various integrins. For example, VCAM-1 binds to α4β1 and α4β7(54Lobb R.R. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1722-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar); CD31/PECAM-1 binds to the αVβ3integrin (55Piali L. Hammel P. Uherek C. Bachmann F. Gisler R.H. Dunon D. Imhof B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); and ICAM-1, ICAM-2 and ICAM-3 bind to αLβ2 (56Patarroyo M. Immunobiology. 1994; 191: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, expression of moderate to high levels of EMMPRIN in CHO cells did not result in increased adhesion to α3-positive cells (not shown). Also, EMMPRIN-integrin co-precipitation was not diminished in the presence of EDTA, an agent known to inhibit nearly all integrin-ligand interactions (not shown). Furthermore, unlike EMMPRIN, no established integrin immunoglobulin-like ligands (VCAM-1, CD31, and ICAM) have ever been shown to co-precipitate with soluble integrins in detergent lysates. Therefore, it is possible that α3β1 and α6β1 associate with EMMPRIN in lateral fashion, similar to interactions of β3 integrins with CD47 (5Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 6Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Reinhold M.I. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), another IgSF protein. Several lines of evidence suggest that integrin-TM4SF and integrin-EMMPRIN complexes may represent two separate entities on the cell surface. First, immunofluorescence studies clearly showed that EMMPRIN is distributed in regions of cell-cell contact and diffusely throughout the membrane but not in focal complexes. In contrast, TM4SF proteins such as CD63 and CD81 can readily localize to focal complexes at the periphery of a spread cell, in a pattern that looks quite distinct from EMMPRIN (24Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2595-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Second, α3 integrin was readily re-precipitated from an EMMPRIN immunoprecipitation, but the most prominent TM4SF protein on HT1080 cells, CD81, could not be detected. Finally, neither EMMPRIN itself nor EMMPRIN-integrin complexes appear to associate with phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity (not shown). In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity is readily detected in association with several TM4 proteins and TM4-integrin complexes (24Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2595-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of integrin-EMMPRIN association is unclear. The preferential association of EMMPRIN with mature β1integrins suggests that the interaction may not play a role during integrin chain association or biosynthetic processing. So far we have found that functions of mature integrins such as cell-cell adhesion or adhesion to extracellular matrix were not altered by either ectopic EMMPRIN expression or anti-EMMPRIN antibodies (not shown). Also, preliminary evidence suggests that α3β1-EMMPRIN association is not regulated by cell adhesion, since the stoichiometry of the α3β1-EMMPRIN interaction was comparable on K562 suspension cells and on HT1080 adherent cells. However, it is perhaps more than a coincidence that both EMMPRIN (29Kataoka H. DeCastro R. Zucker S. Biswas C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3154-3158PubMed Google Scholar) and α3β1 (57Larjava H. Lyons J.G.

Gokaslan Z.L. Rao J.S. Cancer Lett. 1996; 103: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) may help to regulate matrix metalloproteinase production. Future studies will be aimed at determining the extent to which the physical association between EMMPRIN and α3β1 (or α6β1) may play a role in adhesion-induced matrix metalloproteinase production. In conclusion, here we have demonstrated a new strategy for characterization of cell-surface proteins that form complexes with integrins. By using this approach we have discovered that integrins (α3β1 and α6β1) not only associate with TM4SF proteins but also with EMMPRIN, a member of the Ig superfamily. This represents the first clear demonstration that the EMMPRIN/basigin/OX47/M6 molecule can associate with other proteins. We thank Bryan P. Toole (Tufts University) for EMMPRIN cDNA and Osamu Yoshie (Shionogi Institute, Osaka, Japan) for anti-TM4SF antibodies.

Our laboratory has previously isolated one such protein, RACK1, and demonstrated that this protein displays specificity for PKCβ. We have recently shown that at least part of the PKCε RACK-binding site on PKCε lies within the unique V1 region of this isozyme (Johnson, J. A., Gray, M. O., Chen, C.-H., and Mochly-Rosen, D.

Similar to RACK1, β′-COP contains seven repeats of the WD40 motif and fulfills the criteria previously established for RACKs. Activated PKCε colocalizes with β′-COP in cardiac myocytes and binds to Golgi membranes in a β′-COP-dependent manner.

Our finding that β′-COP can also serve as a selective anchoring protein (RACK) for activated PKCε provides a possible mechanism by which PKC regulates Golgi function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have used the recombinant V1 fragment of PKCε to screen a rat heart cDNA library for a PKCε-specific RACK. One clone, pRACK2, contained a partial open reading frame encoding a 481-residue protein homologous to the C-terminal half of human and bovine β′-COP (15Harrison-Lavoie K.J. Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Collison K.S. Nutland E. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2847-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,18Stenbeck G. Harter C. Brecht A. Herrmann D. Lottspeich F. Orci L. Wieland F.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2841-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A full-length 906-amino acid open reading frame was obtained by RACE and identified as rat β′-COP (GenBank™ accession numberAF002705) as it was found to be 97% identical to human β′-COP at the amino acid level. Therefore, β′-COP protein, one of a seven-protein coatomer complex that forms the coat of COPI-coated transport vesicles (8Salama N.R. Schekman R.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), binds the V1 region of PKCε in the overlay cloning procedure. Similar to RACK1 (the RACK for PKCβ), β′-COP contains seven internal repeats of the WD40 motif (Fig.1, A and B). This motif is also present in the G protein β-subunit, which is an anchoring protein for another translocating protein kinase, the G protein receptor kinase, and in other proteins involved in multimeric protein/protein interactions (19Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar).To determine if β′-COP is a RACK, we tested whether recombinant β′-COP and β′-COP fragments bind PKCε in vitro. Fragments or full-length β′-COP fused to MBP were immobilized on an amylose column, and binding of rat brain PKCε was measured using the column overlay assay (Fig. 1 C). Recombinant β′-COP did not bind PKC when the β′-COP was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by the overlay assay (3Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), indicating that the native conformation of β′-COP is important for PKCε binding (data not shown). Because a RACK should bind only activated PKC (3Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of PS and DG on PKC binding. As expected for a calcium-independent, novel PKC isozyme, PKCε binding to β′-COP required PS and DG and was calcium-independent; in fact, calcium inhibited PKCε binding (Fig.1 C). Furthermore, binding of PKCε to β′-COP was saturable at ∼10 nm PKCε (Fig. 1 D). Finally, binding of PKCε to β′-COP was not inhibited by an excess of a pseudosubstrate peptide (Fig. 1 D, lane 9 versus lane 8), and β′-COP was not a PKC substrate (data not shown). Rather, as in the case of RACK1 (7Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of substrate increased in the presence of β′-COP. 2M. M. Rodriguez and D. Mochly-Rosen, unpublished observation.Therefore, β′-COP fulfills the criteria previously established for RACKs (3Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar).The V1 region of PKCε selectively inhibits PKCε translocation and function in intact myocytes (5Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and therefore should mediate the interaction of PKCε with β′-COP. In vitro, the V1 fragment of PKCε bound to the C-terminal fragment, but not the N-terminal fragment of β′-COP (Fig.2 A). In contrast, PKCε holoenzyme bound to both fragments (Fig. 1 C). These data suggest that the PKCε/β′-COP interaction involves more than one site on either or both molecules. However, the PKCε V1 fragment inhibited PKCε holoenzyme binding to β′-COP by 60% (Fig.2 B), indicating that the V1 region of PKCε contains at least part of the β′-COP-binding site on PKCε. It is interesting to note that two binding sites on RACK1 for PKCβ were also found (7Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), suggesting a common theme in PKC/RACK interactions.Figure 2A, the PKCε V1 fragment binds N-terminal and full-length β′-COP. N-terminal (amino acids 1–449), C-terminal (amino acids 425–906), or full-length β′-COP-MBP fusion proteins were immobilized on amylose columns, and column overlay assays were carried out with 1 μm PKCε V1-FLAG fragment in the absence of activators. The recombinant protein and any associated proteins were eluted with wash buffer containing 20 mmmaltose and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibodies (IBI). These antibodies gave one major band of 21 kDa that disappeared when FLAG antibodies were immunoabsorbed with FLAG peptide or another FLAG-containing recombinant protein (data not shown). The PKCε V1 fragment does not appear to bind C-terminal β′-COP. Results are representative of three independent experiments, and averaged data from these three experiments are provided below the figure. B, the PKCε V1 fragment inhibits binding of rat brain PKC to full-length β′-COP. Full-length β′-COP-MBP fusion protein was immobilized on amylose columns. Overlay buffer with or without 1 μm PKCε V1 fragment was added, and the columns were incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to addition of rat brain PKC and PS/DG as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The recombinant protein and associated proteins were eluted with wash buffer containing 20 mm maltose and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-PKCε antibodies. Results are representative of three independent experiments, and averaged data from these three experiments are provided below the figure. C, activated PKCε binds to β′-COP better than other PKC isozymes. Purified recombinant PKC isozymes (1 μg each) expressed in Sf9 cells were activated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and applied to full-length β′-COP-MBP fusion protein immobilized on amylose columns. Binding was determined with isozyme-specific antibodies as described for B, except that only one-fourth of the eluate was loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel for analysis. As standard for comparison, increasing amounts of recombinant isozymes (indicated in ng above each lane) were also included in the Western blot analysis (left lanes in each panel). Using these standards, we found that >250 ng of PKCε bound to β′-COP as compared with 25 ng of PKCβI, 20 ng of PKCδ, and <1 ng of the other isozymes. Hence, PKCε binding to β′-COP was at least an order of magnitude better than the binding of the other isozymes. D, activated PKCβ does not compete for PKCε binding to β′-COP. The experiment was carried out as described for C, except that activated PKCε was added after preincubation of β′-COP with activated PKCβ (1 μg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further demonstrate the specificity of PKCε binding to β′-COP, we compared the binding of purified recombinant PKC isozymes to immobilized β′-COP (Fig. 2 C). When using equal amounts of each isozyme, PKCε binding to β′-COP was at least an order of magnitude better than the binding of the other isozymes. In addition, preincubation of β′-COP with PKCβI (Fig. 2 D) or concomitant incubation with both isozymes (data not shown) did not inhibit subsequent binding of PKCε to β′-COP. Together, these data show preferred binding of PKCε by β′-COP in vitro.If β′-COP is a PKCε-selective RACK, β′-COP should colocalize with activated PKCε in cells. Indeed, immunofluorescence studies showed that β′-COP colocalized with activated PKCε to cross-striated structures in cardiac myocytes (Fig.3 B). Immunostaining at the perinucleus and cell/cell contacts was also observed with both anti-β′-COP and anti-PKCε antibodies. None of the other PKC isozymes or RACKs localize to these structures in either control or 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated cells (2Disatnik M.-H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibodies used for the immunostaining is shown in Fig. 3(D and E); no immunostaining was observed after absorption with the corresponding protein. Image analysis indicated that fluorescence intensities for β′-COP and PKCε correlated (p < 0.01). Moreover, using a defined visual threshold to isolate background from signal arising from brighter discrete cellular structures gave a highly significant overlap between β′-COP and PKCε staining (p < 0.001). Therefore, activated PKCε is in close proximity to β′-COP in cardiac myocytes, suggesting a direct association between the two molecules. Using commercially available antibodies to another coatomer protein, β-COP (Sigma), we observed a faint perinuclear staining, but no cross-striated staining. These data may suggest that β′-COP, but not the full coatomer complex, localizes to cross-striated structures. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the antibody recognition site on β-COP is hidden by an associated protein when the coatomer complex is present on the cross-striated structures. Future studies with multiple anti-coat protein antibodies will elucidate this question.In addition, if β′-COP is a PKCε-selective RACK, β′-COP should co-immunoprecipitate with PKCε-specific antibodies and PKCε should co-immunoprecipitate with anti-β′-COP antibodies. This is shown in Fig. 3 F. β′-COP was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCε antibodies, but not with control immunoglobulin. (Immunoprecipitating anti-PKCβ antibodies are currently not available and therefore could not be used in the assay.) In addition, although there is a similar amount of PKCβ immunoreactivity compared with PKCε immunoreactivity in this preparation, some of PKCε, but no PKCβ, co-immunoprecipitated with anti-β′-COP antibodies. This is not seen with control immunoglobulin. These data suggest that at least some of the cellular β′-COP associates with PKCε even after extensive dilution, homogenization, and cell fractionation.β′-COP assembles as part of the coatomer complex and binds to Golgi membranes in a GTP-dependent manner. To further demonstrate the interaction between β′-COP and PKCε, we used cell systems where β′-COP/Golgi interaction has been characterized. Using purified rat liver Golgi membranes and rat brain cytosol in binding experiments, we tested if PKCε bound to Golgi membranes and determined whether association of PKCε with Golgi membranes was dependent on β′-COP binding to this structure (Fig. 4). GTPγS stimulates binding of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), and thus COPI coatomer binding, to Golgi membranes (10De Matteis M.A. Santini G. Kahn R.A. Di Tullio G. Luini A. Nature. 1993; 364: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the increased binding of β′-COP to the Golgi membranes seen in the presence of GTPγS was associated with a corresponding increase in PKCε binding (Fig. 4). Furthermore, treatment with brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal metabolite that inhibits GTPγS-stimulated coatomer binding to Golgi membranes, resulted in reduced β′-COP association and a corresponding reduction of PKCε association with the Golgi membranes (Fig. 4). Although 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment augments PKCε binding to Golgi membranes (data not shown), PKCε binding was seen without the addition of PKC activators. A plausible explanation for this is that DG or other fatty acid activators were generated on the Golgi membrane as a result of GTPγS activation of phospholipase D, for example. Nevertheless, these results show that the level of PKCε bound to Golgi membranes is dependent on factors that affect β′-COP/Golgi association. Furthermore, these data are in agreement with our hypothesis that PKCε associates with β′-COP and suggest that PKCε may have a role in coatomer function and vesicular transport.Figure 4A, shown is the binding of β′-COP and PKCε to Golgi membranes. Similar to β′-COP, binding of PKCε to rat liver Golgi membranes is GTPγS-dependent. Binding was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane 1, in the absence of GTPγS, control; lane 2, with 20 μm GTPγS; lane 3, with 40 μg/ml BFA and 20 μm GTPγS. B, quantitative analysis of four experiments run in duplicate gave the following results for PKCε binding when PKCε binding in the presence of GTPγS was normalized as 100%: control (without GTPγS), 10 ± 5%; and BFA and GTPγS, 40 ± 9%. Quantitative analysis gave the following results for β′-COP binding to Golgi membranes when β′-COP binding in the presence of GTPγS was normalized at 100%: control (without GTPγS), 15 ± 7%; and BFA and GTPγS, 35 ± 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are substantial data indicating that some PKC isozymes (including PKCε) are localized on the Golgi complex and that PKC plays a role in constitutive membrane trafficking in general and in Golgi function in particular (10De Matteis M.A. Santini G.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for such localization and for the regulation of secretory function by PKC are unknown. We propose that a direct interaction between PKCε and β′-COP is one of the mechanisms sustaining the Golgi-specific localization of some PKC isoforms. In NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing PKCε, PKCε binds to the Golgi apparatus, at least in part, via the C1 region of PKCε and appears to regulate Golgi function (20Lehel C. Oláh Z. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Lehel C. Oláh Z. Jakab G. Szállási Z. Petrovics G. Harta G. Blumberg P.M. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19651-19658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has not yet been determined whether the C1 region of PKCε also binds β′-COP. However, these data are in agreement with our findings in Fig. 1, which demonstrate that the V1 fragment contains only part of the β′-COP (RACK)-binding site on PKCε.The mechanism by which PKCε exerts its action on secretion remains to be resolved, but a number of possibilities are raised by the direct interaction of PKC with a COPI protein. Activation of PKC enhances binding of ARF and β-COP to Golgi membranes and stimulates vesicle formation (10De Matteis M.A. Santini G. Kahn R.A. Di Tullio G. Luini A. Nature. 1993; 364: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that Golgi-associated PKC may control the activation of ARF (12Simon J.-P. Ivanov I.E. Shopsin B. Hersh D. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16952-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the PKC isozyme(s) responsible for the effects seen in these studies was not determined. This may suggest a model in which ARF, by promoting COPI binding to the Golgi complex and hence sustaining PKCε localization and activity on it, initiates a positive feedback loop that reinforces its own binding to these membranes. In addition, the COPI coatomer subunits β-COP and δ-COP appear to undergo regulated phosphorylation (22Sheff D. Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Mellman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7230-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that phosphorylation of these COPI components by PKCε may result in different COPI conformation. Such COPI conformation changes could result in a shift in the bimodal interaction, allowing it to engage with its receptors on Golgi membranes, and produce a shift in the anterogradeversus retrograde membrane flux along the secretory pathway (23Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The essential role of DG in vesicle formation (9Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) further supports the involvement of PKC in control of budding. A further possible target of PKC relevant to its role in regulating Golgi function could be phospholipase D, which is enriched on Golgi membranes. Phospholipase D activity is stimulated by ARF and appears to be involved in vesicle formation (24Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been known for some time that phospholipase D is also activated by PKC (25Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1450-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the isozyme responsible is a matter of some debate (26Kiss K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A noncatalytic role for PKC has been proposed (28Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and noncatalytic involvement of PKCα in porcine brain phospholipase D activation was recently suggested by Sternweis and co-workers (29Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Jiang X. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4504-4510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Finally, noncatalytic PKC activation of phospholipase D has been proposed to mediate vesicle coat assembly in an in vitro model system, but the isozyme required was not identified (12Simon J.-P. Ivanov I.E. Shopsin B. Hersh D. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16952-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although PKCα and PKCβ have been linked to phospholipase D activation, PKCε has also been implicated in a number of studies (26Kiss K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 81-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) including one using cardiac myocytes (30Eskildsen-Hemond Y.E.G. Bezstarosti K. Dekkers D.H.W. Engelmann B. Lamers J.M.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: A136Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 3, β′-COP was also found on cross-striated structures in cardiac myocytes. Since these structures are not characteristic Golgi structures, we wanted to determine the significance of this finding. Several cell types, including cardiac myocytes, appear to be resistant to BFA treatment, and hence, β′-COP association with Golgi and cross-striated structures could not be dissected. This still leaves the question of β′-COP/PKCε complex function at these structures. We previously found that PKCε mediates inhibition of contraction rate (negative chronotropy) (5Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and resistance to ischemia-induced cell death (31Gray M.O. Mochly-Rosen D. Honbo N.Y. Karliner J.S. Circulation. 1995; 92: I137Crossref Google Scholar). Together with the finding that β′-COP is the anchoring RACK for activated PKCε, the data suggest that regulation of these functions may be mediated by secretion of autocrine factors. Alternatively, localization in cardiac myocytes of β′-COP to cross-striations in addition to Golgi membranes may suggest a novel role for β′-COP in this cell type,i.e. anchoring PKCε close to substrates that are not involved in COPI function. Localization of β′-COP and PKCε at cross-striated elements may bring PKCε into contact with contractile proteins such as troponin (32Katoh N. Wise B.C. Kuo J.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and/or with sarcoplasmic reticulum PKC substrates such as phospholamban (33Limas C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 1378-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Finally, the complex may actually lie on T-tubules, plasma membrane invaginations that penetrate deep into the myofibrils close to the Z-lines (34Forbes M.S. Sperelakis N. Tissue & Cell. 1980; 12: 467-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).In summary, we have shown that β′-COP fulfills the criteria for a PKCε-selective RACK: it binds activated PKCε better than any other isozyme, and PKC binding is dose-dependent and saturable. β′-COP co-immunoprecipitates and colocalizes with activated PKCε in cardiac myocytes. Finally, β′-COP mediates PKCε binding to Golgi membranes. The significance of β′-COP as a PKCε-selective RACK remains to be fully determined, but the study of PKCε/β′-COP interaction should lead to new insights into PKCε-specific functions. Anchoring proteins appear to be essential components of a number of signal transduction pathways (1Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar).

In the continued presence of fluorescent Aβ microaggregates for 4 days, microglia took up huge amounts of Aβ and became engorged with undigested material.

The major component of the dense plaques is β-amyloid (Aβ), a fragment of a larger, membrane spanning glycoprotein called β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) (5Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The predominant forms of β-amyloid are the 1–40 and 1–42 fragments. There is substantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that progressive cerebral accumulation of Aβ is an early and perhaps necessary feature of the disease. The strongest evidence causally linking Aβ to AD is the discovery of mutations within the βAPP coding sequence that segregate with disease phenotypes in autosomal dominant familial cerebral amyloidoses. Although less than 20 families harboring these mutations have been found worldwide, these individuals have been shown to develop the classical AD-type pathology indicating that the mutations are associated with the development of AD and not a related disease (6Greenberg B.D.

All the βAPP mutations are missense changes flanking the Aβ domain and may alter the normal proteolysis that leads to production of the Aβ protein (6Greenberg B.D. Savage M.J. Howland D.S. Ali S.M. Siedlak S.L. Perry G. Siman R. Scott R.W. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 153-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Several of these AD-linked missense mutations in βAPP have been shown in cell culture (7Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos L.J. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

Also, mutations within the presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 genes, that are responsible for the most common form of early-onset AD, appear to cause AD by influencing the proteolytic processing of βAPP (12Marx J. Science. 1996; 274: 1838-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutations within the two genes are associated with enhanced production of Aβ-(1–42) in primary fibroblasts and increased levels of Aβ-(1–42) in plasma samples obtained from patients (14Querfurth H.W. Wijsman E.M. St G. Hyslop P.H. Selkoe D.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 28: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with mutant presenilin cDNAs secrete elevated levels of Aβ-(1–42) and introducing mutant presenilin-1 transgenes into transgenic mice expressing wild-type human βAPP results in overproduction of Aβ-(1–42) in the brain (16Citron M. Westaway D. Xia W. Carlson G. Diehl T. Levesque G. Johnson-Wood K. Lee M. Seubert P. Davis A. Kholodenko D. Motter R. Sherrington R. Perry B. Yao H. Strome R. Lieberburg I. Rommens J. Kim S. Schenk D. Fraser P. Hyslop P.S.G. Selkoe D.J. Nature Med. 1997; 3: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Based on these and other observations, it is likely that aberrant metabolism of βAPP can be a primary event in the pathogenesis of AD. However, not all AD cases that result from mutations of APP are attributable to an overproduction of Aβ (17Cai X. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 18Shaffer L.M. Dority M.D. Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C. Younkin S.G. Brunden K.R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Moreover, dominantly transmitted mutations within the βAPP or presenilin genes account for only about 10% of AD cases. In most cases, AD occurs in the absence of a prior history of the disease in other family members. One pathway of Aβ-induced neuron damage may involve inflammatory cells such as reactive microglia. Microglia found in normal adult brain are highly ramified, quiescent cells that become activated during central nervous system injury (1Giulian D. Haverkamp L.J. Yu J.H. Karshin W. Tom D. Li J. Kirkpatrick J. Kuo Y.-M. Roher A.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6021-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rio-Hortega P.d. Penfield W. Cytology and Cellular Pathology of the Nervous System. Paul P. Hocker, Inc., New York1932: 481-584Google Scholar). In the brains of patients with AD, activated microglia are associated with virtually every amyloid deposit and are concentrated in regions of compact amyloid deposits (20Dickson D.W. Lee S.C. Mattiace L.A. Yen S.H. Brosnan C. Glia. 1993; 7: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) where they surround and infiltrate into the β-amyloid plaques (21Wegiel J. Wisniewski H.M. Acta Neuropathol. 1990; 81: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Quantitative histopathology has determined that more than 80% of core plaques are associated with clusters of reactive microglia, whereas less than 2% of diffuse Aβ deposits show such an association (22Giulian D. Li J. Bartel S. Broker J. Li X. Kirkpatrick J.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7712-7726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive microglia are also found associated with plaques that develop in a transgenic model expressing mutant βAPP (10Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R. Berthelette P. Blackwell C. Carr T. Clemens J. Donaldson T. Gillespie F. Guido T. Hagopian S. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Lee M. Leibowitz P. Lieberburg I. Little S. Masliah E. McConlogue L. Montoya-Zavala M. Mucke L. Paganini L.

Very little is known, however, about the function of the microglia surrounding the plaques. Histological evidence has implicated microglia in AD brain as plaque-attacking scavenger cells, as sources of cytokines (23Griffin W.S. Stanley L.C. Ling C. White L. MacLeod V. Perrot L.J.

Kirkpatrick J. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 27: 119-137Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar), as producers of Aβ (25Frackowiak J. Wisniewski H.M. Wegiel J. Merz G.S. Iqbal K. Wang K.C. Acta. Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1992; 84: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and as secretors of complement proteins (26Rogers J. Cooper N.R. Webster S. Schultz J. McGeer P.L. Styren S.D. Civin W.H. Brachova L. Bradt B. Ward P. Lieberburg I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10016-10020Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 27Meda L. Cassatella M.A. Szendrei G.I. Otvos J.L. Baron P. Villalba M. Ferrari D. Rossi F. Nature. 1995; 374: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Activated microglia proliferate, exhibit phagocytic activity removing infectious agents or remnants of dying brain tissue, and produce a number of secreted factors such as proteases and cytotoxic agents that induce death of neurons and demyelination of oligodendrocytes (27Meda L.

Akiyama H. Tooyama I. McGeer E.G. Glia. 1993; 7: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Therefore it is likely that the microglia surrounding senile plaques in AD brains are the main scavengers and removers of Aβ peptides from the brain (28Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study had reported that amyloid cores isolated from the brains of AD patients are ingested by cultured microglia, and then collected and stored in phagosomes. Some of the ingested, non-degraded amyloid remained within the phagosomes for up to 20 days, suggesting a very limited effectiveness of microglia in degrading Aβ fibrils (25Frackowiak J. Wisniewski H.M. Wegiel J. Merz G.S. Iqbal K. Wang K.C. Acta. Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1992; 84: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils were observed in microglial phagosomes as demonstrated by light microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy. However, degradation of the fibrils was not measured directly or quantified. It has also been reported that synthetic Aβ peptides accumulate in cultured human skin fibroblasts and are resistant to degradation for 3 days (33Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A different result, however, was obtained in a study that used microglia to degrade Aβ peptides. It was reported that rat microglial cultures and an activated human monocyte cell line could degrade Aβ-(1–42) added to the culture medium. The ability of cells to degrade soluble Aβ was evaluated by adding synthetic Aβ-(1–42) to cell cultures and then measuring the amount of Aβ remaining in the medium after an 8-h incubation with the cells. Degradation of Aβ was measured by the loss of immunoreactive material in Western blots. It was also found that microglia could remove Aβ fibrils immobilized as plaque-like deposits on culture dishes (18Shaffer L.M. Dority M.D. Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C. Younkin S.G. Brunden K.R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The amount of immobilized Aβ was assessed by phase-contrast imaging and thioflavin T staining of the dots before and after incubation with the cells. However, the question of whether the decrease in Aβ was due to degradation or just to internalization by the cells was not addressed directly. We had found that microglia from mouse central nervous system rapidly internalize aggregates of Aβ-(1–42) peptides that, by electron microscopy, resemble the amyloid fibrils found in AD plaques (34Paresce D.M. Ghosh R. Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro model in which Aβ microaggregates were added to cell culture media, we found that primary cultures of microglia internalize aggregates of fluorescently labeled or radioiodinated Aβ peptide. This uptake was mediated by a type A scavenger receptor that also mediated internalization of acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL). Binding of Aβ to scavenger receptors was also reported by El-Khoury et al. (35El-Khoury J. Hickman S.E. Thomas C.A. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. Loike J.D. Nature. 1996; 382: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In this paper we examine the degradation of those Aβ fibrils taken up by microglia via the scavenger receptor. We carried out kinetic comparisons of the degradation rate of Aβ aggregates to that of two other proteins previously shown to be internalized by microglial cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (34Paresce D.M. Ghosh R. Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). We found a slow but significant degradation of Aβ microaggregates by microglia. The balance between degradation and production may be important in the net accumulation of plaque proteins in AD. We prepared primary cultures of mixed glia from newborn mice and then isolated the weakly adherent microglia from cell monolayers according to previously described methods (28Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nakajima K. Hamanoue M. Shimojo M. Takei N. Kohsaka S. Biomed. Res. 1989; 10: 411-423Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To prepare primary cultures of mixed glia we obtained neocortical tissues of newborn mice, removed the meninges, minced and incubated the tissues in 2.5% trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) and 0.01% deoxyribonuclease I (DNase) (Worthington) in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 37 °C. The tissue was triturated with fire-polished pipettes in 0.1 μg/ml DNase in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 350 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The supernatant was passed through a 145-μm mesh, re-centrifuged for 5 min, resuspended, passed through a 33-μm mesh, and centrifuged one more time. Cells were resuspended in growth medium then plated in 75-cm2 flasks coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of about 1.5–2.0 × 107 cells per flask (about 5 cortices per flask). The mixed glial cultures were grown in bicarbonate-buffered DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified air atmosphere. The mixed glial cultures were grown for 1 week before microglia were collected from the flasks. Microglia were harvested by orbital shaking for 20 min in DMEM or where noted, in DMEM with 12 mm lidocaine (Sigma). Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 350 × g and plated onto 35-mm diameter plastic tissue culture dishes in which a 7-mm diameter hole was punched in the bottom and a polylysine-coated number 1 glass coverslip was attached beneath the hole (37Salzman N.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at a density of 104-105 cells/coverslip. Shaking one 75-cm2 flask of mixed glial cultures usually yielded enough microglia for 10 coverslips. For 125I-Aβ uptake experiments, microglia were plated on poly-d-lysine coated 24-well trays at the same density (105 cells/well). We used the uptake of fluorescent acetylated low-density lipoprotein (DiI-Ac-LDL) by microglia to assess the purity of our microglial cultures because microglia, unlike astroglia or oligodendroglia, have the Ac-LDL receptor (28Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that over 95% of the cells harvested after shaking took up DiI-Ac-LDL. Astroglia were identified by immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein mouse monoclonal antibodies were provided by Dr. Wilma Friedman (Columbia University). We found that our enriched microglial cultures contained less than 1% of glial fibrillary acidic protein positve astroglia. We used the methods described by Giulian et al. (22Giulian D. Li J. Bartel S. Broker J. Li X. Kirkpatrick J.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7712-7726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to distinguish microglia from blood macrophages and found no contamination by other types of macrophages. Just after seeding microglia were round, but after a day in culture, the cells exhibited two predominant morphologies: an elongated, ramified form and an ameboid form. Ramified cells are generally viewed as resting or quiescent microglia that lack phagocytic properties (28Giulian D. Baker T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but we found the two cell types did not differ in their ability to bind and take up DiI-Ac-LDL. 1–42 β-amyloid peptide was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). The lyophilized powder was diluted in sterile water to 5 μg/ml and kept at −80 °C. Fluorescent β-amyloid was prepared by derivatizing it with Cy3, an orange fluorescing carbocyanine dye (Biological Detection Systems Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aβ-(1–42) was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.3, then added to the Cy3 dye. The labeled protein was separated from excess, unconjugated dye by dialysis. This stock of Cy3-Aβ at pH 9.3 was kept at 4 °C. 125I-Labeled Aβ was prepared using the chloramine-T method as described (34Paresce D.M. Ghosh R. Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 38Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). 500 μg of Aβ was iodinated in 0.05m sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0. The excess 125I was removed by passage over a G-15 Sephadex column and dialysis against borate buffer for 6 h at room temperature. The specific activity of the 125I-labeled Aβ was 713 cpm/ng. Ac-LDL and α2M were iodinated using the same chloramine-T method (38Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The specific activity of 125I-labeled Ac-LDL was 796 cpm/ng and that of α2M was 276 cpm/ng. It has been shown that these iodinated proteins retain the ability to bind specifically to their receptors (38Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 39Tabas I. Zha X. Beatini N. Myers J.N. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22547-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl-LDL was prepared by acetylation of LDL with acetic anhydride as described previously (40Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar) and provided by Dr. Ira Tabas (Columbia University, NY). Acetyl-LDL was labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described (41Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) was purified, converted to the receptor-binding form, and conjugated to either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as described previously (42Salzman N.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2067-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or Cy3 (Biological Detection Systems Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FITC-labeled, fixable, 70-kDa dextrans were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). For all our studies on the uptake of Cy3-labeled Aβ and unlabeled Aβ microaggregates, the peptide was pre-aggregated before being added to microglial cultures. Aβ was initially diluted in water while vortexing, mixed well, then further diluted in labeling medium (serum-free DMEM medium without bicarbonate, buffered with 20 mm HEPES to pH 7.4, and containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Labeling medium also contained 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin radioimmunoassay grade (Sigma). Aβ peptide was allowed to aggregate for 1 h at room temperature, and Cy3-Aβ was allowed to aggregate at room temperature for 15 min before being added to microglial cultures. All labeling was done in air at 37 °C. Prior to any fluorescent labeling, the cells were rinsed twice with dye-free labeling medium. We diluted the Cy3-Aβ in pH 7.4 labeling medium (DMEM with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), allowed it to aggregate for 15 min at room temperature, and then added the medium to the microglia in coverslip dishes. The cells were incubated in the same way with Cy3-labeled α2M in labeling medium. After the cells were incubated for a short time (5–15 min) with labeling medium containing fluorescently-labeled peptides, the medium and fluorescent peptides were washed away. The cells were then incubated in medium with no added peptides, rinsed 3 times in labeling medium, 3 times with chase medium with no serum, then 3 more times with serum containing chase medium which was microglial culture medium. The cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde freshly diluted in medium 1 (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4). Cells were grown in 24-well plates for 2–3 days before the start of the experiment.125I-Labeled Aβ (1 μg/ml) was formed into aggregates as described for Cy3-Aβ. The cells were washed three times with labeling medium and then incubated with the radiolabeled peptides for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified air atmosphere. The cells were rinsed extensively as described for the fluorescent labeling experiments, then incubated with chase medium for varying times. At the end of the chase, the medium bathing the cells was removed and the radioactivity was measured. The cells were rinsed three times in chase medium then three times with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1 m NaOH. The chase medium was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 1 h and centrifuged to separate the soluble fraction from the trichloroacetic acid precipitable fraction. The radioactivity of each fraction was counted. Radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter, and the protein content of each well was measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay reagent. Where indicated, excess Ac-LDL or excess α2M were added as competitive inhibitors to the incubation medium along with the radiolabeled peptides and maintained in the labeling medium for the entire incubation. The radioactivity of these background dishes was subtracted from the values for the control experiments. All radioactive experiments were conducted with 3 wells per condition and repeated at least three times on separate days. Microglia were rinsed with labeling medium, then incubated with unlabeled Aβ microaggregates (5 μg/ml) or unlabeled α2M (50 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed three times with labeling medium, fixed, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100, then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a monoclonal antibody specific to Aβ (Senetek PLC, St. Louis, MO) or α2M (Genzyme Diagnostics Medix Biotech Subsidiary, San Carlos, CA). The cells were rinsed three times over 15 min, then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Control dishes were incubated with only the secondary antibody. Antibodies used for Aβ immunofluorescence were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% normal goat serum. Antibodies used for α2M immunofluorescence were diluted similarly but instead of serum, with 1% goat anti-rabbit IgG. Fluorescence microscopy and digital image collection were performed using a Leitz Diavert fluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics (Tucson, AZ) cooled CCD camera as described previously (43Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quantification was carried out with a × 25 magnification objective to obtain a large number of cells per field, whereas the images for visualization purposes were obtained at a higher magnification (× 63, NA 1.4 objective) as described previously (44Mayor S. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 929-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Fields used for quantification were selected at random throughout the dish and focused using phase-contrast optics before viewing the fluorescence. Digital fluorescence images were obtained, and the background signal was removed from the images as described previously (34Paresce D.M. Ghosh R. Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 45Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cells were identified in the image using an intensity threshold set at the mean pixel intensity for the entire image plus the standard deviation of the pixel intensity. Objects of the size of cells and above the threshold intensity were identified using MetaMorph software routines (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Total fluorescence intensity was taken as the sum of all intensity in these objects, which then was divided by the number of cells in the field to calculate the average fluorescence intensity per cell. The percentage of total intensity per cell remaining after various chase times was determined for Aβ microaggregates and α2M. Fluorescence images of cells were obtained with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad Microscience, Cambridge, MA) as described previously (46Ghosh R. Maxfield F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that microaggregates of Aβ labeled with 125I or Cy3 are internalized by mouse microglial cells via the scavenger receptor (34Paresce D.M. Ghosh R. Maxfield F.R.

We present evidence here that IL-1 not only stimulates a dramatic increase in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity but also induces the physical interaction of its type I receptor with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. Furthermore, two PI 3-kinase-specific inhibitors, wortmannin and a dominant-negative mutant of the p85 subunit, inhibited IL-1-induced activation of both NFκB and AP-1. Transient transfection experiments indicated that whereas overexpression of PI 3-kinase may be sufficient to induce AP-1 and increase nuclear c-Fos protein levels, PI 3-kinase may need to cooperate with other IL-1-inducible signals to fully activate NFκB-dependent gene expression. In this regard, cotransfection studies suggested that PI 3-kinase may functionally interact with the recently-identified IL-1-receptor-associated kinase to activate NFκB. Our results thus indicate that PI 3-kinase is a novel signal transducer in IL-1 signaling and that it may differentially mediate the activation of NFκB and AP-1.

The biological processes of growth, differentiation, and immunity are dependent on the highly regulated action of transcription factor families such as NFκB and activator protein-1 (AP-1). 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein 1; IL-1, interleukin 1; IL-1RI, type I IL-1 receptor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IRAK, IL-1 receptor-associated protein kinase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PKC, protein kinase C. These two transcription factors participate not only in normal physiology but in diseased conditions as well. Extracellular stimuli such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), viruses, and UV light are among the known potent inducers of NFκB (1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). Of these, IL-1, which is a major proinflammatory cytokine, is responsible for mediating numerous host responses, including fever, activation of lymphocytes, and the induction of acute-phase proteins (2O'Neill L.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of IL-1 have been associated with various pathological conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (2O'Neill L.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although several biological activities of IL-1 have been characterized, the molecular mechanisms by which its signals are transduced from the plasma membrane to affect gene transcription in the nucleus remain to be elucidated. One of the most prominent IL-1-inducible signals, one which requires the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), involves the rapid and dramatic activation of NFκB and AP-1 and results in the induction of discrete sets of genes (2O'Neill L.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since IL-1RI shares no significant homology with conserved protein kinase domains, it is unlikely to have any intrinsic protein kinase activity (3Sims J.E. Acres R.B. Grubin C.E. McMahan C.J. Wignall J.M. March C.J. Dover S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8946-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and may need to recruit specific cytoplasmic proteins to transmit its signals. One such protein, recruited to the receptor in response to IL-1 stimulation, is theIL-1 receptor-associated proteinkinase (IRAK), which bears significant homology to theDrosophila protein Pelle (4.271, 1128–1131Cao, Z., Henzel, W. J., and Gao, X. (1996) 271,1128–1131.Google Scholar). Although there is no evidence linking IRAK directly to NFκB activation, studies on the function of Pelle have demonstrated its importance in the activation of Dorsal, the mammalian equivalent of NFκB. Recently, IRAK has been shown to physically associate with a protein belonging to the TNFreceptor-associated factor family called TRAF6 (5Cao Z. Xiaong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). In contrast to TNF, which recruits TRAF2 to activate NFκB, IL-1-induced activation of NFκB is mediated by TRAF6 (5Cao Z. Xiaong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which the recruitment of TRAFs to the IL-1 and TNF receptors leads to the activation of NFκB are not understood. NFκB is normally inactive and kept sequestered in the cytoplasm by its interaction with the inhibitory subunit IκB (1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, IκB is rapidly phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and then degraded, resulting in the release and subsequent nuclear translocation of active NFκB (1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). In addition to the TRAFs, several other factors appear to play a role in NFκB activation. Although some interact with the TRAFs (6Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.-B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), others such as Raf kinase, tyrosine kinases, reactive oxygen intermediates, and sphingomyelinases have also been reported (1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). AP-1 is predominantly a heterodimeric complex of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins, and its activation is mainly due to induction of c-Fos synthesis and the phosphorylation of both c-Jun and c-Fos (7Lewin B. Cell. 1991; 64: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) may up-regulate c-Fos synthesis (8Jhun B.H. Rose D.W. Seely B.L. Rameh L. Cantley L. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7466-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulate the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (9Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), which might then lead to the phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun. Other studies have implicated PI 3-kinase in epidermal growth factor-induced AP-1 activation (10Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takanayagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S-i. Mizuno K. Hirai S-i. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase consists of a catalytic subunit (p110) associated with a regulatory polypeptide (p85) (11Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent interactions between the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit and the phosphotyrosine-containing YXXM motif present on several cytokine/growth factor receptors have been reported (11Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated lipid products generated by this enzyme may act as second messengers to activate protein kinases such as the Akt gene product (12Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar) or certain isoforms of protein kinase C (13Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J. Ballas L.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32358-32367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its reported interactions with Ras (14Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar) and its potential ability to activate several signaling pathways (9Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) underscore the importance of PI 3-kinase in various cellular functions. We have demonstrated that the acute-phase gene serum amyloid A 1 and 3 (15Huang J.H. Rienhoff Jr., H.Y. Liao W.S.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Li X. Liao W.S.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Li X. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15192-15201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are highly inducible by cytokines such as IL-1 and shown that NFκB is critical for their expression (16Li X. Liao W.S.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Li X. Liao W.S.-L. J. Biol.

In this study, we investigated the signaling events that lead to NFκB and AP-1 activation in IL-1-stimulated cells. Our results indicate a prominent role for PI 3-kinase in the activation of both NFκB and AP-1. HepG2 and KB cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained at 37 °C in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Wortmannin and phosphatidylinositol were from Sigma. PD98059 was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc., and staurosporine was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were serum-starved for 4 h before treatment with various inhibitors and IL-1. Nuclear extracts were prepared and electrophoretic mobility shift assays reactions performed as described earlier (19Schreiber E. Mathias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of 2.5 μg were incubated with radiolabeled probe. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. The results presented here are representative of at least three independent experiments. KB or HepG2 cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes overnight. Cells were serum-starved for 4 h before treatment for the indicated times with or without IL-1. Whole cell lysates were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 mm benzamidine. After 20 min on ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g. The supernatant was then utilized for PI 3-kinase assays as described earlier (20Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and the labeled [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was resolved by thin layer chromatography (21Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, whole cell lysates were prepared as described above and incubated with anti-p85 PI 3-kinase antibodies (Santa Cruz) or anti-IL-1R type I antibodies (Santa Cruz) for 1 h before incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (1 h). The immune complexes were boiled in Laemmli buffer and resolved on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, proteins were probed with anti-IL-1R type antibodies or anti-p85 PI 3-kinase antibodies in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham) using goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. HepG2 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected the next day with the (NFκB)3/CAT or (AP-1)2/CAT reporters and various expression vectors. Transfections were done using the Polybrene method. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were treated with cytokines or left untreated for 20 h. All other procedures were performed as described elsewhere (22Chen H.-M. Liao W.S.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6766-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A forward primer 5′-GCGGCGGCAACCATGGCCGGG-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-TCTGCCGGTACCAACACATCAGCTCTGGAATTC3-′ containing a KpnI restriction site were used to amplify IRAK cDNA from a HeLa cDNA library by the polymerase chain reaction. A 2.1-kilobase polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the p85DN vector SRα (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stevens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) from which the p85DN cDNA had been excised after digestion with EcoRI and KpnI. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 10 min before being permeabilized with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 for 2 min. Cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with c-Fos polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) for 60 min. After washing, these cells were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 45 min. The coverslips were washed several times and then inverted on glass slides containing 90% glycerol and sealed. Cells were then observed under a Nikon Diaphot TMD-EF inverted microscope with epi-fluorescence attachment. All other procedures were performed as described in the Santa Cruz Research Applications (Santa Cruz). To identify potential mediators of IL-1 signaling, we used gel mobility shift assays to examine the ability of various inhibitors to block the activation of NFκB and AP-1 by IL-1. Epidermoid carcinoma KB or hepatoma HepG2 cells were stimulated with IL-1 after pretreatment with either wortmannin, a potent PI 3-kinase inhibitor (24Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), PD98059, an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (25Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar), or staurosporine, a general protein kinase inhibitor. Whereas DNA binding activities of both NFκB and AP-1 were potently induced by IL-1, their activation was inhibited completely in cells pretreated with wortmannin (Fig. 1,A and B). Inhibition by wortmannin was observed in both KB and HepG2 cells, indicating that the wortmannin-sensitive mechanism in NFκB activation may be a general mechanism. PD98059, which inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, also had an inhibitory effect but was less effective than wortmannin (Fig. 1). Consistent with earlier reports (26Meichle A. Schutze S. Hensel G. Brunsing D. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8339-8343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), staurosporine had little or no effect on the activation of NFκB or AP-1 by IL-1. The concentration of wortmannin that we used has been shown to selectively inhibit PI-3 kinase activity (24Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To determine if PI 3-kinase activity is indeed regulated by IL-1, cytokine-treated cell extracts were assayed for PI 3-kinase activity with phosphatidylinositol as substrate. Insulin, a known potent activator of PI 3-kinase activity (11Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was included as positive control. Treatment of KB cells with IL-1 or insulin resulted in elevation of PI-3 kinase activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2). Within 7 min, insulin stimulated PI 3-kinase activity by about 27-fold (Fig. 2 A), which is comparable to the fold-activation reported by others (27Endemann G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The insulin-stimulated increase in PI 3-kinase activity declined rapidly thereafter. In contrast, IL-1 stimulated PI 3-kinase with much faster induction kinetics (3 min) and to a greater magnitude (108-fold). Like insulin, the IL-1-stimulated increase in PI 3-kinase activity was also transient. Similar results were obtained in HepG2 cells (data not shown). IL-1-inducible PI 3-kinase activity was dependent on the presence of phosphatidylinositol in the assays and was inhibited completely by 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (data not shown). The presence of detergent in these assays has little effect on PI 4-kinase activity and thus differentiates the activity of PI 3-kinase from that of any contaminating PI 4-kinase. Pretreatment of cells with wortmannin prevented the stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity by IL-1 (Fig.2 B), further linking PI 3-kinase functionally to NFκB and AP-1 activation. The kinetics of PI 3-kinase activation preceded that of NFκB (5–10 min) and AP-1 (30 min), consistent with a role for PI 3-kinase in the activation of these transcription factors. The stimulation of PI 3-kinase by platelet-derived growth factor and other growth factors involves the physical association of PI 3-kinase with their receptors (11Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of this enzyme recognize and associate with the phosphotyrosine-containing YXXM (11Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) or YVXV motif (28Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Maina F. Longati P. Panayotou G. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4600-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) present on those receptors. Analysis of the human IL-1RI protein sequence revealed one tyrosine residue located at amino acid 496 of the cytoplasmic domain that matched the YXXM motif (YEKM). Similar sequence motifs are also found in the mouse IL-1RI and the Drosophila Toll protein. This raises the possibility that in response to IL-1 stimulation, the SH2 domain of p85 might also physically associate with the human IL-1RI through the phosphorylated Y496EKM sequence. To test whether this interaction between p85 and IL-1RI exists, polyclonal antibodies against the p85 PI 3-kinase and IL-1RI were used to coimmunoprecipitate their associated proteins. The immunoprecipitates were then Western-blotted with anti-IL-1RI (for anti-p85 precipitate) and anti-p85 antibodies (for anti-IL-1RI precipitate). In two different cell lines, KB and HepG2, IL-1RI could be detected in the anti-p85 PI 3-kinase immune complexes (Fig. 3 A). The association of IL-1RI with p85 PI 3-kinase was dependent entirely on IL-1 stimulation. Furthermore, their association was time-dependent, with maximal association achieved at 0.5 min after IL-1 addition, and little or no interaction was detected after 3 min (Fig. 3 A). The physical coupling of these two proteins was further confirmed in converse experiments wherein anti-IL-1RI immune complexes coprecipitated p85 PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3 B). Since wortmannin blocked the activation of both NFκB and AP-1, the role of PI-3 kinase in the activation of these two transcription factors was explored further by transient transfection assays. The functional importance of PI 3-kinase was evaluated by cotransfection of an (NFκB)3/CAT reporter plasmid, with either the dominant-negative mutant of the p85 regulatory subunit (p85DN) or p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. To demonstrate that PI-3 kinase functions as a mediator in NFκB activation, we first employed a dominant-negative mutant of PI 3-kinase, p85DN (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stevens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) in these cotransfection assays. When p85DN was overexpressed, it inhibited IL-1-induced (NFκB)3/CAT expression by approximately 70% (Fig. 4 A), implicating PI 3-kinase as an important mediator of NFκB activation. To ascertain the specificity of this inhibition, we tested its effect on the induction of a T1 kininogen/CAT reporter gene. We have previously shown that this reporter can be induced by a combination of IL-6 and Dex (22Chen H.-M. Liao W.S.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6766-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that the induction does not involve NFκB. In contrast to the (NFκB)3/CAT reporter, the induction of the T1 kininogen/CAT gene was unaffected by overexpression of p85DN, suggesting that its inhibition on NFκB-dependent gene expression was specific. Overexpression of p110 induced CAT activity approximately 3-fold and in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, when p110-transfected cells were further stimulated with IL-1, synergistic activation of the (NFκB)3/CAT reporter was observed (Fig. 4 C). Maximal synergism was observed at suboptimal concentrations of IL-1 (data not shown). In addition, this synergism between IL-1 and p110 was dependent on the dose of p110 used for transfection, the best effect being achieved with 5–10 μg of transfected p110 DNA. Induction of the (NFκB)3/CAT reporter by IL-1 and its synergistic activation by IL-1 and p110 can be blocked by IκB (Fig.4 C), the inhibitory subunit of NFκB. This indicates that induction of the reporter gene by these stimuli specifically involved NFκB activation. As a control, the mutant (NFκB)3/CAT reporter construct that lacks a functional NFκB binding site was nonresponsive regardless of the treatment. The effect of p110 overexpression on an (AP-1)2/CAT reporter was also examined by cotransfection studies. In contrast to its effects on the (NFκB)3/CAT reporter, overexpression of p110 alone induced the (AP-1)2/CAT reporter to the same extent as IL-1 treatment (Fig. 5 E), and no additional increase was observed upon inclusion of IL-1, indicating that the reporter could be fully activated by p110 alone. Furthermore, p85DN blocked IL-1-induced AP-1 activation completely (Fig.5 E). Our data are therefore consistent with recent reports for a role of PI-3 kinase in epidermal growth factor-induced AP-1 activation (10Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takanayagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S-i. Mizuno K. Hirai S-i. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and further demonstrate the involvement of PI-3 kinase in IL-1-induced AP-1 activity. Activation of AP-1 involves a dramatic elevation of c-Fos protein that can then dimerize with Jun proteins to produce AP-1 complexes. There is evidence that PI 3-kinase is involved in the activation of c-Fos synthesis (8Jhun B.H. Rose D.W. Seely B.L. Rameh L. Cantley L. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7466-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since IL-1 up-regulates c-Fos mRNA (2O'Neill L.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and there is a dramatic induction of c-Fos protein in IL-1-treated cells (Fig. 5 B), we examined the ability of overexpressed PI 3-kinase to induce c-Fos protein levels. Overexpression of p110 PI 3-kinase induced c-Fos, as evidenced by the intense staining of nuclei in about 3–5% of the cells (Fig.5 D), which correlates with the percentage of our transfection efficiency in these cells. No cells stained above background levels in control cells (Fig. 5 A) or cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 5 C). These results suggest that overexpression of PI 3-kinase is sufficient to induce c-Fos protein levels and further emphasize its role in the activation of AP-1 by IL-1. Our results showed that the p85DN mutant of PI-3 kinase inhibited the activation of NFκB by IL-1, and yet overexpression of the p110 catalytic subunit was unable to fully activate the (NFκB)3/CAT reporter gene. We reasoned that since p110 can synergize with IL-1 to induce CAT activity, PI 3-kinase may need to cooperate with other IL-1-inducible signals or pathways to activate NFκB. We cotransfected IRAK expression plasmid (4.271, 1128–1131Cao, Z., Henzel, W. J., and Gao, X. (1996) 271,1128–1131.Google Scholar) with the (NFκB)3/CAT gene to test for its ability to activate NFκB. A dose-dependent increase in CAT activity was observed with a maximal induction of 13-fold at 15 μg of IRAK (Fig. 6 and data not shown), implicating IRAK as a potential mediator of IL-1-induced NFκB activation. When p110 and IRAK were coexpressed with the reporter gene, a synergistic activation of the reporter was observed (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that these molecules may cooperate in vivo to activate NFκB. We next evaluated the possibility that IRAK would synergize with IL-1. IRAK, like PI 3-kinase, synergized with IL-1 (Fig. 6 B) to a comparable extent (compare Figs. 4 C with 6B), and interestingly, this effect was blocked by coexpression of the p85DN mutant of PI-3 kinase (Fig. 6 B). We have presented evidence to indicate that the interaction of PI 3-kinase with IL-1RI is one of the early events in IL-1-stimulated cells and that PI 3-kinase may be indispensable for the activation of NFκB and AP-1 by IL-1. Our results show that wortmannin blocked the activation of both transcription factors by IL-1. Interestingly, wortmannin, which is a fungal metabolite, has been shown in experimental animals to exert anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects (24Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 29Gunther R. Kishore P.N. Abbas H.K. Mirocha C.J. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1989; 11: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether these effects can be accounted for, at least in part, by its inhibitory effects on NFκB activation. Since wortmannin blocked the activation of NFκB and AP-1 by IL-1, it was predicted that IL-1 would stimulate PI 3-kinase activity. Indeed, IL-1 stimulated PI 3-kinase activity very potently and with rapid kinetics of activation. The activation kinetics of NFκB and AP-1 have been well established and are slower in comparison to those for PI 3-kinase in IL-1-treated cells, consistent with a role for this enzyme in their activation. PI 3-kinase has been attributed with both lipid kinase and protein kinase activities, and since wortmannin inhibits both, it is difficult to assess at this time the relative importance of each activity in IL-1 signaling. Wortmannin has recently been shown to inhibit phospholipase A2 at concentrations that earlier were thought to be selective for PI 3-kinase (30Cross M.J. Stewart A. Hodgkin M.N. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25352-25355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We therefore used a dominant negative mutant, p85DN, of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase to verify the importance of this enzyme in the activation of NFκB and AP-1. p85DN has been used previously to confirm a role for PI 3-kinase in various cellular functions (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stevens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Consistent with our wortmannin experiments, overexpression of p85DN strongly inhibited the activation of NFκB- and AP-1- dependent gene expression by IL-1. PI 3-kinase therefore appears to be essential for their activation by IL-1. The cytoplasmic domain of IL-1RI protein contains a sequence (Y496EKM) which fits the YXXM motif that has been demonstrated to mediate direct physical interaction between receptor proteins and PI 3-kinase. Our coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that the IL-1RI and PI 3-kinase do interact and that this association is induced very rapidly by IL-1. Although these data strongly suggest that the interaction between p85 PI 3-kinase and IL-1RI is direct, the presence of an accessory factor that links these two proteins cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, this Y496EKM motif is within the 50-amino acid (477–527) region in the IL-1RI cytoplasmic domain found to be essential for IL-1 signal transduction (32Heguy A. Baldari C.T. Macchia G. Telford J.L. Melli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2605-2609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar sequence motifs are also found in the mouse IL-1RI and the Drosophila Toll protein, which is equivalent to human IL-1RI. Various studies have indicated that for the YXXM motifs to be capable of binding to p85 PI 3-kinase, the tyrosine residues must be phosphorylated (Ref. 33Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, see references in Ref. 34Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Several receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that could potentially phosphorylate these sites and lie upstream of PI 3-kinase in various signaling pathways have been implicated (11Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In one study, a sequence in the insulin receptor substrate-1 containing a PI 3-kinase binding motif and several flanking amino acid residues was evaluated as a substrate for different nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (35Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A. Goldberg A.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25146-25151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides in protein kinase assays, it was determined that the tyrosine kinases differed in their tolerance for various amino acid substitutions, and in particular, an aspartate immediately N-terminal to the tyrosine was indispensable. In this context, it may be noted that in addition to other acidic amino acids, there is an aspartic acid (Asp495) immediately adjacent to the Y496EKM sequence on the IL-1RI. This suggests that the Y496EKM sequence on the IL-1RI may be a good substrate for tyrosine kinases and may facilitate direct interaction between IL-1RI and PI 3-kinase. An IL-1-inducible tyrosine kinase activity has been reported but not identified (36Iwasaki T. Uehara Y. Graves L. Rachie N. Bomsztyk K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The involvement of tyrosine kinase activities in the steps leading to NFκB activation has been reported for various inducers (see references in Ref. 1Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). Overexpression of p110 was sufficient to induce the AP-1/CAT reporter and to increase nuclear c-Fos protein levels as potently as IL-1. These results are consistent with recent reports that epidermal growth factor-induced activation of AP-1 requires PI 3-kinase (10Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takanayagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S-i. Mizuno K. Hirai S-i. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to the AP-1 reporter, we observed that although overexpression of p110 activated the NFκB/CAT gene in a dose-dependent manner, the activation was much less than what we normally observe with IL-1. Addition of IL-1 to p110-overexpressing cells, however, resulted in a synergistic activation of the NFκB/CAT reporter. It appears therefore that whereas PI 3-kinase is necessary for IL-1-induced activation of NFκB, its overexpression is not sufficient to fully activate this transcription factor. To identify signaling molecules that can cooperate with PI 3-kinase, we expressed the IRAK in various cotransfection experiments. We show evidence here that overexpression of IRAK is sufficient to activate the NFκB reporter in a dose-dependent manner. To address the possibility that IRAK and PI 3-kinase cooperate to activate NFκB, we followed two approaches. We cotransfected various doses of IRAK with the p110-expression vector and the NFκB/CAT reporter. A clear synergism with p110 could be observed at lower doses of IRAK. In the second approach, since IRAK synergized with IL-1, we used the dominant negative mutant p85DN to test whether PI 3-kinase may be involved. Cotransfection of p85DN inhibited the synergism between IRAK and IL-1, lowering the CAT activity levels to those activated by IRAK in the absence of IL-1. In addition to providing further evidence for the involvement of PI 3-kinase in IL-1-induced activation of NFκB, these data support the idea that to mediate NFκB activation, PI 3-kinase cooperates with molecules such as IRAK that possibly lie on other signaling pathways (Fig. 7). Similar observations have been made for TNF- and CD40l-induced activation of NFκB (37Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). While TRAF2 overexpression is sufficient to activate NFκB, it was recently shown that TRAF2 may need a coactivator protein TRAF family member-associated NFκB activator. In contrast to TRAF2, overexpression of TRAF family member-associated NFκB activator alone was unable to activate NFκB. The function of PI 3-kinase in transcription factor activation may not be limited to NFκB and AP-1, for it has been implicated recently in the activation of STAT3 (38Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Whereas the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 plays a prominent role in its activation, phosphorylation of this factor on a specific serine residue is important and may require PI 3-kinase. The mechanisms by which activated PI 3-kinase may ultimately result in the activation of NFκB and AP-1 are unclear. However, several signaling molecules have been shown to affect directly or indirectly the pathway leading to the activation of these transcription factors. For example, two atypical forms of protein kinase C, aPKCζ (39Diaz-Meco M.T. Berra E. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano L. Dominguez I. Diaz-Golpe V. Lain De Lera M.T. Alcami J. Paya C.V. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.-L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4770-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and aPKCλ (10Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takanayagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S-i. Mizuno K. Hirai S-i. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), have been shown to be involved in NFκB and AP-1 activation, respectively. Since the phosphorylated lipid products of PI 3-kinase activate various isoforms of PKC in vitro, including aPKCζ (40Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKC may lie downstream of PI 3-kinase. aPKCζ activity was recently reported to be stimulated by IL-1 in rat renal mesangial cells (41Rzymkiewicz D.M. Tetsuka T. Daphna-Iken D. Srivastava S. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17241-17246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Small G-proteins and the protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) are among the other signaling molecules that have been implicated in the activation of NFκB. Physical interaction between the small GTPase Cdc42 and PI 3-kinase may result in the stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity (42Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Cdc42 appears to be required for the activation of NFκB by TNF (44Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), and our results suggest that the mechanism may involve interactions with PI 3-kinase. Finally, MEKK1, a key mediator of the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, has recently been implicated as an upstream regulator of the 700-kDa IκB kinase (45Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of PI 3-kinase activates the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway (9Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), it would be of interest to determine if it is involved in the up-regulation of MEKK1 activity in IL-1-stimulated cells. It is not known whether any of these proteins, Cdc42, PKCs, or MEKK1, interact with IRAK and if they do, whether those interactions would account for the synergism between PI 3-kinase and IRAK in NFκB activation. Since our results suggested that PI 3-kinase may functionally interact with IRAK to activate NFκB, we are currently investigating the molecular basis of such interactions. It is hoped that in addition to providing greater insights into the mechanisms employed by IL-1 for NFκB activation, these studies would also reveal the identity of the downstream targets of both IRAK and PI 3-kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2027188394,"A major issue in lipid signaling relates to the role of particular phospholipase A2 isoforms in mediating receptor-triggered responses. This has been difficult to study because of the lack of isoform-specific inhibitors. Based on the use of the Group VI Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL), we previously suggested a role for the iPLA2 in mediating phospholipid fatty acid turnover (Balsinde, J., Bianco, I. D., Ackermann, E. J., Conde-Frieboes, K., and Dennis, E. A. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92: 8527–8531). We have now further evaluated the role of the iPLA2 in phospholipid remodeling by using antisense RNA technology. We show herein that inhibition of iPLA2 expression by a specific antisense oligonucleotide decreases both the steady-state levels of lysophosphatidylcholine and the capacity of the cell to incorporate arachidonic acid into membrane phospholipids. These effects correlate with a decrease in both iPLA2 activity and protein in the antisense-treated cells. Collectively these data provide further evidence that the iPLA2 plays a major role in regulating phospholipid fatty acyl turnover in P388D1 macrophages. In stark contrast, experiments with activated cells confirmed that the iPLA2 does not play a significant role in receptor-coupled arachidonate mobilization in these cells, as manifested by the lack of an effect of the iPLA2antisense oligonucleotide on PAF-stimulated arachidonate release.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The PLA2s catalyze the hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acyl moiety of phospholipids, generating a free fatty acid and a 2-lysophospholipid, both of which may serve significant biological roles. The latter reaction is particularly relevant when the free fatty acid generated is arachidonic acid (AA), as this is the common precursor of the biologically active eicosanoids, i.e. the prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxane, and lipoxins (2Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence data, nine different PLA2 Groups have been identified to date (1Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). However, based on biochemical properties and structural features, the PLA2 superfamily can be subdivided into three main types, i.e. the Ca2+-dependent secretory enzymes (sPLA2), the Ca2+-dependent cytosolic enzymes (cPLA2) and the Ca2+-independent cytosolic enzymes (iPLA2). It is difficult to demonstrate specificity of function for a single PLA2 isoform in vivo because most of the PLA2 inhibitors currently available are not isoform-specific. However, bromoenol lactone (BEL) had been regarded as a specific iPLA2 inhibitor since it manifests greater than 1000-fold selectivity for the iPLA2 versus the sPLA2 and cPLA2(3Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A.

We recently found that BEL inhibits AA esterification into P388D1 cell phospholipids in a dose-dependent and saturatable manner, with the decrease being directly related to inhibition of both cellular iPLA2 activity and steady-state lysophospholipid levels (5Balsinde J.

These data, along with the finding that the process takes place in a Ca2+-independent manner, led us to implicate the iPLA2 as the enzyme providing the lysophospholipid acceptors employed in the reaction (5Balsinde J.

Recently however, BEL has been found to inhibit another cellular phospholipase, the Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, with similar potency to that shown for the iPLA2 (7Balsinde J.

This has now allowed us to achieve the specific inhibition of the iPLA2 by using antisense RNA technology. In this manner, the inherent lack of specificity associated with the use of chemical inhibitors such as BEL is circumvented.

As a control, the sense complement of ASGVI-18 was used (SGV-18; 5′-ACC CAU UCC GGG UGA AGG AG). Both ASGVI-18 and SGVI-18 contained phosphorothioate linkages to limit degradation. The transfection procedure was adapted from that described by Locati et al. (13Locati M. Lamorte G. Luini W. Introna M. Bernasconi S. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Biol.

Briefly, 2.5 × 105 cells were cultured in the presence of different oligonucleotide concentrations in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 90% air and 10% CO2. A final concentration of 10% fetal bovine serum was then added, and the cells were kept in culture for an additional 48-h time period. The culture medium was supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids. Oligonucleotide treatment and culture conditions were not toxic for the cells as assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay and by quantitating adherent cell protein. After the treatment described above, the cells were placed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EGTA for 60 min, washed, and then exposed to exogenous [3H]AA (5 nm, 0.5 μCi/ml). After 10 min, supernatants were removed, and the cell monolayers were gently washed with buffer containing 5 mg/ml albumin to remove the labeled AA that had not been incorporated into cellular lipids. The cell monolayers were scraped twice with 0.5% Triton X-100, and total lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41814) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were separated from the rest of cellular lipids by thin-layer chromatography withn-hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1). In this system, phospholipids remain at the origin of the plate. Radioactivity content in phospholipids was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. When BEL was used (25 μm), it was added to the cells 30 min before addition of [3H]AA. The cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]choline or 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]ethanolamine for 2 days. When oligonucleotides were used, they were added to the cells at the same time as the radioactive compounds. Cellular uptake of the radioactive compounds was not affected by the oligonucleotides. Afterward, the cell monolayers were scraped in 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100. For separation of lyso-PC and lyso-PE, the lipids were extracted with ice-cold n-butyl alcohol and separated by thin-layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:40:6:0.6) as a solvent system. Spots corresponding to lyso-PC or lyso-PE were scraped into scintillation vials, and the amount of radioactivity was estimated by liquid scintillation counting. The cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and homogenized by 25 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer consisting of 20 mmTris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μmleupeptin, 20 μm aprotinin, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5. The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to separate nuclei. Samples (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membranes with a buffer consisting of 5% nonfat milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 60 min. Membranes were then incubated with anti-iPLA2 antiserum at a 1:200 dilution for 30 min and then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Homogenates from P388D1cells were prepared by sonication as described previously (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D.

The reaction was stopped by adding 0.75 ml of choloroform/methanol (1:2). The products were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (14Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41814) Google Scholar) and separated by thin-layer chromatography with n-hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1) as a mobile phase. The standard procedure for activating the cells with LPS and PAF has been previously described (4Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (106 cells/ml), labeled for 20 h with 0.5 μCi/ml of [3H]AA, were placed in serum-free medium for 1 h before the addition of LPS (200 ng/ml) for 1 h. Subsequently, 10 μl of a 10 mg/ml albumin solution was added per well (final concentration of albumin in each well was 0.1 mg/ml), and after 5 min, PAF (100 nm) was added. After a 15-min incubation period, supernatants were removed, cleared of detached cells by centrifugation, and assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The iPLA2 of P388D1 cells, now designated as a Group VI PLA2(1Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), is an 80–85 kDa protein that shows no specificity for the fatty acid present at the sn-2 position of the phospholipid (16Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme appears to be implicated in regulating basal phospholipid remodeling in P388D1 cells (4Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows that treatment of the P388D1 cells with an iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide (referred to as ASGVI-18) led to a marked decrease in their capacity to incorporate exogenous [3H]AA into membrane phospholipids. This inhibition was not due to loss of cell viability, as judged by trypan blue exclusion and by quantitation of adherent cell protein. Cell viability was further assessed by monitoring [3H]thymidine incorporation, which was the same in control or oligonucleotide-treated cells (not shown). AA incorporation experiments carried out in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 in the incubation medium instead of 1 mm EGTA gave the same results, in agreement with previous data (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). More importantly, ASGVI-18 reduced the iPLA2activity of cell homogenates by 75–80% (Fig. 1 B). A polyclonal antibody against the Group VI iPLA2 has recently become available (12Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This antibody was generated to a glutathione S-transferase fusion of the C-terminal half of the hamster Group VI iPLA2 (12Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Using this antibody, we observed a 55–60% decrease of the immunoreactive band, detected by Western blot, in homogenates from ASGVI-18-treated cells compared with control or sense-treated cells (Fig. 1 C). The dose dependence and time course of the effect of the iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide was investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Concentrations of ASGVI-18 below 1 μm exerted little effect; whereas, maximal effects were observed at an oligonucleotide concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 2 A). Oligonucleotide concentrations higher than 10 μm induced excessive detachment of the cells from the plastic wells and, therefore, could not be used. Consistent with an antisense-type inhibition, ASGVI-18 decreases cellular AA esterification at all times measured (Fig. 2 B). The above experiments determined incorporation of AA at short times in cells that were already deficient in iPLA2. Thus it was important to determine whether iPLA2 depletion changes the endogenous AA pools. To that end, experiments were conducted wherein the radioactive AA was added at the time the cells were exposed to the oligonucleotides. As AA incorporation into phospholipids in P388D1 takes place very rapidly (10Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it will be completed long before the cellular iPLA2 levels begin to drop as a result of the antisense treatment. Thus, the relative distribution of AA among phospholipids in iPLA2-depleted cells can be determined and compared with that in control untreated cells. As shown in Table I, the relative distribution of AA among phospholipids did not change after ASGVI-18 treatment, indicating that ASGVI-18 treatment does not change the endogenous AA pools.Table IEffect of ASGVI-18 on the distribution of AA among phospholipidsPhospholipidControlSGVI-18ASGVI-18%PC33 ± 1028 ± 328 ± 5PE55 ± 560 ± 357 ± 5PI15 ± 314 ± 120 ± 6P388D1 cells were labeled with [3H]AA (0.5 μCi/ml) at the time they were treated with SGVI-18, ASGVI-18, or neither (control) as indicated. After 2 days, the amount of AA in the different lipid classes was determined after separation by thin-layer chromatography. Data are given as a percentage of the total radioactivity found in all phospholipid classes and are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent determinations. Open table in a new tab P388D1 cells were labeled with [3H]AA (0.5 μCi/ml) at the time they were treated with SGVI-18, ASGVI-18, or neither (control) as indicated. After 2 days, the amount of AA in the different lipid classes was determined after separation by thin-layer chromatography. Data are given as a percentage of the total radioactivity found in all phospholipid classes and are expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent determinations. Fig. 3 shows that ASGVI-18 treatment of P388D1 cells resulted in a 50–55% decrease of the steady-state levels of lyso-PC, which corresponds well with the decrease in AA incorporation into phospholipids shown in Fig.1 A. Lyso-PC levels in SGVI-18-transfected cells were the same as those found in control untreated cells (Fig. 3). Within experimental error, no effect of ASGVI-18 on lyso-PE levels could be detected (data not shown). Collectively, the above data suggest that selective inhibition of iPLA2 expression by antisense RNA technology reduces AA incorporation due to a decrease in the amount of cellular lyso-PC acceptors available for the esterification reaction. These data are consistent with our previous results using BEL to inhibit the iPLA2 (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, it is now known that BEL also inhibits the Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, which is another key enzyme in phospholipid metabolism (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the specificity of BEL in our previous studies (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar), it seemed important to study the effects of BEL on AA esterification in antisense-treated cells. The results from these experiments are summarized in Fig. 4. In agreement with our previous data (8Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8576-8580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), AA incorporation into phospholipids was blocked up to 60% by BEL in control and SGVI-18-treated cells. In ASGVI-18-treated cells, which already showed a 60% decrease in AA incorporation, BEL was ineffective in further increasing this inhibition (Fig. 4). We have previously found that BEL has no effect on the relative distribution of AA among the different phospholipids of P388D1 cells (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The above data suggest that the Group VI iPLA2 may function as a housekeeping enzyme involved in the regulation of basal deacylation/reacylation reactions among phospholipids. To further assess its role in cellular function, we sought to assess its role during receptor activation conditions. The effect of ASGVI-18 on LPS/PAF-stimulated AA release from P388D1 cells is shown in Fig.5. Stimulation of murine P388D1 macrophages with nanomolar amounts of the inflammatory mediator PAF results in negligible cellular responses unless the cells are first treated with LPS. LPS acts just as a primer,i.e. it does not stimulate the P388D1 cells by itself but enables the cells to optimally respond to PAF (23Asmis R. Dennis E.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 744: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides both slightly decreased the AA release response, which was detected both in resting and PAF-activated cells. However, the ratio of stimulated versus unstimulated release remained the same under all conditions (Fig. 5). This result indicates that the iPLA2 does not play a significant role in mediating agonist-induced AA mobilization in these cells. It is now well established that the availability of free AA limits the synthesis of the biologically active eicosanoids (2Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar). As AA is mainly found esterified at the sn-2 position of cellular phospholipids, PLA2 has emerged as a key enzyme responsible for controlling the levels of free fatty acid (18Dillon D.A. Chen X. Zeimetz G.M. Wu W.-I. Waggoner D.W. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10361-10366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the amount of free AA available for eicosanoid synthesis represents a balance between what is being liberated by the activated PLA2s, minus what is reincorporated back into phospholipids by the highly active acyltransferases (19Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus, free fatty AA levels are also efficiently controlled by the AA reacylation pathway (19Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Even under resting conditions, the capacity of certain cells such as macrophages to incorporate AA into phospholipids via reacylation reactions is exceedingly high (6Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Johnson S.B. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5002-5007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus these cells should possess a basal PLA2 activity high enough to account for their high AA reacylation capacity. Interestingly, AA incorporation into phospholipids in macrophages is Ca2+-independent,i.e. it takes place normally at free Ca2+concentrations lower than 10 nm (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As under these conditions neither the cPLA2 nor the sPLA2 must be active, these results suggest that the enzyme providing lysophospholipid acceptors for the AA reacylation pathway is an iPLA2. Further evidence for such a role was obtained by the use of BEL (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Using this inhibitor, we found a direct correlation between endogenous iPLA2 activity, steady-state lysophospholipid levels, and AA incorporation capacity of the cells (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). However, BEL, being selective for the iPLA2 over the other PLA2s (3Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), is not devoid of other effects. For example, we have recently found that BEL also potently blocks the Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, a key enzyme in cellular phospholipid metabolism (7Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The inherent problems associated with the use of chemical inhibitors can be potentially circumvented by inhibiting expression of the iPLA2 with antisense RNA oligonucleotides. Using this strategy, we have succesfully achieved the specific inhibition of the macrophage Group VI PLA2 and confirmed our previous findings with BEL. Thus, the iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide ASGVI-18 reduces the cellular iPLA2activity by 75–80% (Fig. 1 B) and iPLA2 protein by at least 50–60% (Fig. 1 C), which results in a decrease of the capacities of the cells to incorporate AA into phospholipids (Figs. 1 A and 2) as well as the steady-state lyso-PC levels (Fig. 3). These latter effects correspond precisely, and are specific, as parallel experiments using the sense control SGVI-18 did not reproduce any of the effects induced by ASGVI-18. Specificity of ASGVI-18 is also stressed by the fact that sPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides do not affect macrophage AA esterification (10Balsinde J. Barbour S.E. Bianco I.D. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These results provide definitive evidence for the key role that the iPLA2 plays in regulating basal phospholipid remodeling reactions in macrophages. Strikingly, ASGVI-18 treatment was found to significantly decrease the steady state of lyso-PC levels but not of lyso-PE. It is likely that our inablity to detect any effect of ASGVI-18 on lyso-PE levels merely reflects some sort of experimental limitations. However, it could indicate as well that the Group VI iPLA2 preferentially attacks PC over PE in vivo even though the enzyme has been found to lack headgroup specificity in vitro (12Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 16Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that PC pools within the cells are more accesible to iPLA2 attack than the PE pools. Interestingly, in regards to AA metabolism, it is lyso-PC, not lyso-PE, that is the major acceptor for esterification of free AA (19Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Over time, the AA accumulates into PE as a consequence of direct transfer from PC by CoA-independent transacylase, not by direct acylation of lyso-PE with AA (19Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Therefore, selective inhibition of lyso-PC but not of lyso-PE would result in decreased labeling of phospholipids with AA, and the ratio AA-PC to AA-PE remaining unchanged. This is exactly what was found in the experiments determining the effect of ASGVI-18 treatment on AA distribution among phospholipids (Table I). Thus, the current data give additional support to the notion that the different phospholipid classes and subclasses serve different roles for AA incorporation and redistribution within different pools (19Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, we were not able to achieve complete inhibition of the iPLA2 but did achieve a 60% or 80% disappearance at best, as judged by protein content or activity, respectively. This reduces AA incorporation into phospholipids by about 60% in antisense-treated cells. It could thus be argued that achieving 100% inhibition of Group VI iPLA2 expression would result in almost complete ablation of the capacity of the cell to incorporate AA into phospholipids. However, the fact that the decrease in iPLA2 protein detected by Western blot does not correspond with the decrease in cellular iPLA2 activity suggests the possibility that, in addition to the iPLA2, the antibody used may be recognizing another 85 kDa-protein in P388D1macrophages. If this were the case, then the remainder of the 85-kDa protein band that is not blocked by ASGVI-18 could correspond to an antigenically related protein. Moreover, it is also possible that the 20% of iPLA2 activity that is not eliminated by ASGVI-18, corresponds to another iPLA2 distinct from the Group VI enzyme. The possibility that the P388D1 cells contain more than one iPLA2 form has previously been considered (16Ackermann E.J. Kempner E.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9227-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, BEL, either alone (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or together with the iPLA2antisense (Fig. 4) fails to completely inhibit the response. Saturation of inhibition by BEL is reached at about 60–70% (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Altogether, these facts seem to suggest that the cell possesses other mechanisms for regulating AA esterification besides the one provided by the Group VI iPLA2. It should be remarked here that the current experiments were done in the absence of Ca2+. Therefore, if a second PLA2 distinct from the Group VI enzyme was involved in regulating AA esterification, it would have to be another Ca2+-independent isoform. As discussed elsewhere (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 6Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the contribution of the de novo biosynthetic pathway to AA incorporation into phospholipids is minimal in P388D1 macrophages. This contrasts with results obtained with peritoneal macrophages (21Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and neutrophils (22Chilton F.H. Murphy R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 1126-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), wherein the de novo pathway has been demonstrated to provide a minor but significant route for the generation of highly polyunsaturated phospholipid species such as 1,2-diarachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. However the phospholipids of peritoneal macrophages and neutrophils are already very enriched in AA (21Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Chilton F.H. Murphy R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 1126-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Such a circumstance likely explains why a significant portion of the free AA is shunted to the low-affinity biosynthetic route in these cells. In contrast, P388D1cells are very scarce in endogenous AA (23Asmis R. Dennis E.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 744: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Hence, most of the AA incorporation in these cells occurs through the high-affinity remodeling pathway (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 8527-8531Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 6Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, recent data have highlighted the fact that the sn-1 position of phospholipids is also extensively remodeled in macrophages (21Kuwae T. Schmid P.C. Schmid H.H.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which means that a phospholipase A1 could also eventually participate in regulating AA esterification via fatty acid remodeling. Such a possibility, as well as the possible involvement of the recently described CoA-dependent transacylase reaction (24Sugiura T. Kudo N. Ojima T. Mabuchi-Itoh K. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Blank M.L. Fitzgerald V. Smith Z.L. Snyder F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), is currently under investigation in our laboratory. In summary, in the present study we have utilized antisense RNA technology to obtain independent conclusive confirmation that the macrophage Group VI iPLA2 does play an important role in modulating phospholipid fatty acid turnover by providing the 2-lysophospholipid acceptors required for the reaction. In addition, our results demonstrate that the Group VI iPLA2 does not appear to play a significant role in the stimulation of AA release mediated via the PAF surface receptor."

Linkage analysis revealed two disease-determining genes on chromosome 9 and chromosome 16. TheTSC2 gene on chromosome 16 encodes a 1784-amino acid tumor suppressor protein, tuberin, that functions as a GTPase-activating protein for Rap1, a member of the superfamily of Ras-related proteins. By immunoblot analyses, we found TSC2 expression to be high in G0 as well as in early small G1 cells. Analyses after different cell synchronization procedures revealed thatTSC2 mRNA and protein expression do not fluctuate throughout the cell cycle. Using inducible expression systems we further demonstrated that TSC2 expression is not affected by overexpression of the mitogenic transcription factor E2F-1 or c-Myc. Nevertheless, antisense inhibition of tuberin expression in logarithmically growing cells markedly decreased the percentage of cells in G1. Furthermore, we found that cells exposed toTSC2 antisense oligonucleotides did not undergo G0 arrest after serum withdrawal. Antisense inhibition ofTSC2 expression also induced quiescent G0-arrested fibroblasts to reenter the cell cycle. Our data show for the first time that the absence of tuberin can both induce cells to pass through the G1/S transition of the eukaryotic cell cycle and prevent them from entering a quiescent state. These results have clear implications for the tumor suppressor function ofTSC2. We further found that reentry into the cell cycle upon loss of TSC2 is dependent on the activity of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), Cdk2 or Cdk4. Taken together with our finding that antisense inhibition ofTSC2 causes up-regulation of cyclin D1 expression, these results provide the first evidence for a connection between tuberin/Rap1 and the G1 CDK-dependent regulation of the transition from G0/G1 to S phase.

Sci. 1991; 615: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Linkage studies in families with TSC show that about 50% are associated with a mutant TSC2 gene, located on chromosome 16, while an as yet unidentified gene (TSC1), which maps to chromosome 9, is implicated in the remainder (4The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium Cell. 1993; 75: 1305-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 5Sampson J.R.

TheTSC2-encoded protein, designated tuberin, contains a region of homology to the GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) for the small molecular weight GTPase Rap1, which is a member of the superfamily of Ras-related proteins (4The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium Cell. 1993; 75: 1305-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that tuberin indeed stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rap1a in vitro, but not of Rap2, Ha-Ras, Rac, or Rho (14Wienecke R. König A. DeClue J. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and that tuberin co-localizes with Rap1 in the Golgi apparatus (15Wienecke R. Maize J.C. Shoarinejad F. Vass W.C. Reed J. Bonafico J.S. Resau J.H. de Gunzburg J. Yeung R.S. DeClue J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 913-923PubMed Google Scholar). Like other GTP-binding proteins, Rap1 is active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP; thus, by accelerating the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rap1, tuberin can inactivate it. However, the biological role of Rap1 has not yet been identified. The Eker rat strain has provided an animal model system for the analysis of TSC2. The Eker mutation is a germline insertion in the rat homologue of the human TSC2 gene, resulting in premature truncation of TSC2 (16Yeung R.S. Xiao G.-H. Jin F. Lee W.-C. Testa J.R. Knudson A.G.

Heterozygous carriers are characterized by the onset of renal tumors, sometimes associated with other neoplasia, and the susceptibility of these rats to carcinogens is increased (19Hino O.

Recently, direct evidence for the tumor suppressor function of TSC2was obtained by introduction of the TSC2 cDNA into cell lines derived from Eker rat tumors. Overexpression of TSC2inhibited the growth and suppressed the tumorigenicity of these lines (21Jin F. Wienecke R. Xiao G.-H. Maize J.C. DeClue J.E. Yeung R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the mammalian cell cycle, the transition from the G0/G1 phase to S phase, in which DNA replication occurs, has been shown to be regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). During early G1, cyclin D-Cdk4/Cdk6 complexes operate to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and thereby activate the transcription factor E2F. Among the genes activated via this mechanism are those for cyclin E and cyclin A, which when complexed with Cdk2 promote the G1/S transition by further phosphorylation of pRB. Finally, cyclin A-CDC2 and cyclin B-CDC2 complexes drive cells into mitosis (M phase) (23Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4309) Google Scholar, 24Sherr C.J.

Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of TSC2 in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. We found TSC2mRNA and protein to be expressed in a cell cycle-independent fashion and also to be expressed at high levels in quiescent G0-arrested cells. By analyzing logarithmically growing Rat1 fibroblasts as well as human neuroblasts, we found that antisense inhibition of TSC2 expression markedly decreased the percentage of cells in G1, indicating that the length of G1 was shortened relative to other phases of the cell cycle. Furthermore, cells exposed to TSC2 antisense oligonucleotides did not undergo G0 arrest after serum withdrawal. Consistent with the demonstrated tumor suppressor function of TSC2, antisense inhibition of TSC2 expression in G0-arrested cells was found to be sufficient to induce proliferation. We further demonstrate that this induction of the G0/S transition is dependent on the activity of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk2 and Cdk4, and that cyclin D1 expression is induced upon antisense inhibition of TSC2 expression. These findings identify tuberin as a potent cell cycle regulator and show that the G1 CDKs functionally link tuberin to passage through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Culture conditions have previously been described in detail (26Hengstschläger M. Knöfler M. Müllner E.W. Ogris E. Wintersberger E. Wawra E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13836-13842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were grown either in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium or in RPMI 1640 medium, both supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics (30 mg/liter penicillin, 50 mg/liter streptomycin sulfate). All cultures were kept at 37 °C and 7% CO2 and routinely screened for mycoplasma. Serum arrest was performed by cultivation of the cells for 3 days in 0.1% calf serum. Inhibition of the intracellular G1 CDKs was performed by adding 20 μmFlavopiridol (Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) into the medium described above. The following lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection: 3T6 permanent line of contact-inhibited murine fibroblasts (ATCC CCL96), Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells (ATCC HTB 18), MOLT-4 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (ATCC CRL1852), HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells (ATCC CCL2), SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC HB11), and IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC CCL127). Rat1MycER cells express a protein containing the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor fused to the 3′-end of human Myc (27Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Growth and Myc induction was performed as described by Pusch et al. (28Pusch O. Soucek T. Wawra E. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Bernaschek G. Hengstschläger M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Rat1E2F cells are stably transfected with the open reading frame of human E2F-1 downstream of a mutated metallothionein promoter, which can be induced in the presence of zinc (29Soucek T. Pusch O.

Human lymphocytes were isolated from the heparinized peripheral blood of a normal subject using the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient method and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and analyzed after reaching logarithmic growth (26Hengstschläger M. Knöfler M. Müllner E.W. Ogris E. Wintersberger E. Wawra E. J. Biol.

For cytofluorometric analyses, cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed by rapid submersion in 5 ml of ice-cold 85% ethanol. After at least 1 h fixation at −20 °C, cells were pelleted and stained in 1 ml of staining solution (0.25 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.05 mg/ml RNase, 0.1% Triton X-100 in citrate buffer (pH 7.8)). Stained cells were analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan. In addition, growth rates were determined by pulse labeling with radiolabeled thymidine. Labeled DNA was precipitated by trichloracetic acid, collected on glass fiber filters, and quantitated by scintillation counting. Separation of logarithmically growing cells into distinct cell cycle phases was accomplished by centrifugal elutriation in a Beckman J2–21 M centrifuge and a JE-6B rotor with a standard separation chamber. The rotor was kept at a speed of 2000 rpm, temperature was 20 °C, and medium flow was controlled with a Cole-Parmer Masterflex pump. The elutriation medium consisted of 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 2% calf serum in PBS. Consecutive fractions of 150–300 ml were collected at increasing flow rates. Cytofluorometric analysis of the cell cycle distribution of each fraction was performed as described above (for further technical details see Ref. 26Hengstschläger M. Knöfler M. Müllner E.W.

Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (31Hengstschläger M. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Pusch O. Wawra E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1635-1643PubMed Google Scholar). RNA, prepared using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), was denatured in 1 mdeionized glyoxal, 4.8% dimethyl sulfoxide and 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.8) for 1 h at 50 °C. RNA was resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), transferred to nylon in 20 × SSC, and immobilized by UV fixation. Filters were hybridized in 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS, 0.5m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and 1 mmEDTA for at least 10 h at 65 °C. After successive washing in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5% SDS, 40 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), and 1 mm EDTA and in 1% SDS, 40 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C, filters were exposed. Hybridization cDNA probes were specific for rat and human TSC2 and cyclin A, respectively, and a 1300-base pair fragment of the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (16Yeung R.S.

Filters were stripped between hybridizations by incubation in 0.1 × SCC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 95 °C. Protein extracts were prepared in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 mNaCl, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.02 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.02 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.003 μg/ml benzamidine chloride, 0.1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. After 20 min on ice, the extracts were centrifuged and supernatants were stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. A total of 200 μg of protein was run on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunodetection was performed using anti-human tuberin antibodies numbers 4993, 4994, 5051, 5052, and 5063 (for preparation of antisera and affinity purification of tuberin antibodies see Refs. 14Wienecke R.

Signals were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Corp.) (31Hengstschläger M. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Pusch O. Wawra E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1635-1643PubMed Google Scholar). The antisense oligonucleotides used were as follows: Gap3A, antisense oligonucleotide specific for the GAP3 region of the TSC2 gene (CGGTGCTTGTCCACGTCCTT); StartA, antisense oligonucleotide specific for the 5′ region of theTSC2 gene (TTGCTTGTTGGTTTGGCCAT); Gap3R (control oligonucleotide), oligonucleotide of the same length with the same proportion of the four base pairs but randomly organized (GCTTCGTTTGTCAGTGTTGT); StartS (control oligonucleotide), the corresponding sense oligonucleotide to StartA (ATGGCCAAACCAACAAGCAA). The oligonucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Vienna, Austria). We used phosphorothioate oligomers (PTOs) to ensure sufficient stability against intracellular DNases. All PTOs were repeatedly ethanol-precipitated and were dissolved in double distilled water and quantitated by absorbance at A 260. The cells were grown as described above, and the PTOs were added into freshly changed medium at different concentrations. Concentrations up to 40 μm had no toxic effects on the used cells. Concentrations lower than 5 μm did not lead to significant reduction of intracellular tuberin levels. We routinely used 15 μm oligonucleotides, which induced significant down-regulation of tuberin without any effects on the cell viability or morphology. For a detailed description of the antisense treatment protocol used as well as a description of the specificity, biological stability, intracellular availability, gene suppression potency, toxicity, and nonspecific effects of PTOs see Ref. 32Schlingensiepen K.-H.

TSC2 cDNA downstream of a constitutive expression promoter and CMV/CD20 were co-transfected into cell culture cells by the calcium phosphate method as described earlier (31Hengstschläger M. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Pusch O. Wawra E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1635-1643PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for the last 3 h of transient expression with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). CD20-positive cells were immunocytochemically detected by staining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD20 antibody (Becton Dickinson), and BrdUrd incorporation was visualized by incubation with a monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Sigma) and a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Serotec). We investigated the expression of TSC2 mRNA and protein in different rodent and human cell lines by Northern and Western blot analyses. Although we observed clear differences in the DNA distributions of the analyzed cells, we could not detect significant variations in TSC2expression (Table I). In the course of these investigations, we have used different anti-tuberin antibodies in immunoblot analyses (4993, 4994, 5051, 5052, and 5063; for preparation of antisera and affinity purification of tuberin antibodies, see Refs.14Wienecke R.

Sera 5051 and 5052 were raised against amino acids 1165–1393 of human tuberin, while sera 4993 and 5063 were raised against amino acids 1387–1784. With the exception of the antibody 4994, raised against the N-terminal amino acids 2–305 of human tuberin, we did not see any differences in specificity and sensitivity of tuberin detection in the analyzed cells using the different antisera. The fact that the antibody 4994 does not efficiently recognize tuberin in immunoblot analyses was previously reported (14Wienecke R. König A. DeClue J. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Only 3 of 16 analyzed cell types expressed lower TSC2levels. Two of them were leukemia cell lines (Table I). Interestingly, recently two other leukemia cell types of the myelocytic/monocytic lineage, HL-60 and U-937, were reported to express little or no tuberin (14Wienecke R. König A. DeClue J. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition, we found a Ewing sarcoma cell line to be tuberin-negative. Whether this finding describes any functional role ofTSC2 in the development of this type of neoplasia remains to be elucidated. The data presented in Table I allow two conclusions. First, there is no relation between cell cycle distribution andTSC2 expression, and second, altered TSC2expression is not a general phenomenon of transformation. The first conclusion is further supported by the observation that unstimulated peripheral lymphocytes and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes express equal amounts of tuberin (Table I).Table ITSC2 expression in different cells in relation to DNA distributionsCell typeG1SG2/MTSC2mRNATSC2 protein%%%Rodent cells 3T6, immortalized mouse fibroblasts62.421.116.5+NT Rat1, immortalized rat fibroblasts59.327.113.6++ Rat1a, immortalized rat fibroblasts61.225.413.4++ Rat1 MycER, c-Myc not activated58.719.222.1NT+ Rat1 MycER, c-Myc activated49.125.825.1NT+ Rat1 E2F, E2F-1 expression not induced55.320.224.5++ Rat1 E2F, E2F-1 expression induced47.231.221.6++Human cells Unstimulated lymphocytes96.71.12.2++ Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes60.321.418.3NT+ Y79, retinoblastoma cells44.936.119.0NT+ Acute promyelocytic leukemia cells44.341.214.5NT−/+ MOLT-4, acute lymphoblastic leukemia49.136.114.8−/+−/+ Ewing sarcoma cells52.435.312.3−− HeLa, cervix carcinoma46.333.520.2NT+ SKNSH, neuroblastoma cells68.117.314.6++ IMR-32, neuroblastoma cells54.227.718.1NT+DNA distributions were determined by flow-activated cell analyses.TSC2 mRNA expression was evaluated by Northern blot analyses and is presented relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression.

To explore whether the mitogenic transcription factors E2F-1 or c-Myc play any role in the regulation of TSC2 expression, we used two different inducible Rat1 cell systems. In these cells the transcription factors can be activated by adding tamoxifen or zinc to the medium, respectively (27Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M.

In these lines, activation induces the transcription of typical E2F-1- or c-Myc-dependent genes, such as cyclin A or cyclin E (29Soucek T. Pusch O. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Adams P.D.

To prove that TSC2 expression in cycling cells is indeed independent of the cell cycle phase, we separated logarithmically growing cells by centrifugal elutriation. The results obtained show that neither TSC2 mRNA nor protein expression fluctuate throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 1). As a control for the experimental procedure, we co-analyzed cyclin A mRNA expression, which is well known to be induced at the G1/S transition (Fig. 1; see Refs. 24Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar and 25Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These data were confirmed by analyses of elutriated HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells (data not shown). Experiments in which arrested cells were restimulated with serum further revealed that TSC2expression is high in quiescent, serum-arrested cells (Fig.2). The high expression in G0cells is in accordance with the role of tuberin as a tumor suppressor. As described above, the loss of functional TSC2 in specific differentiated quiescent cells induces proliferation, leading to the development of benign growths in many tissues and organs of tuberous sclerosis patients.Figure 2TSC2 expression during serum stimulation. Logarithmically growing Rat1 fibroblasts were serum-arrested in medium containing 0.1% serum for 3 days. At various times after serum restimulation, DNA distributions were analyzed on the flow cytometer (upper panels). At the indicated time points, RNA was prepared, blotted to nylon filters, and sequentially hybridized with probes specific for cyclin A and TSC2. Equal amounts of loaded RNA were confirmed by staining the Northern filter with methylene blue.

Monoclonal antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments. Immunoprecipitates obtained from primate and rodent brain tissues contain a low molecular weight D3 protein and one or two larger protein species whose molecular mass are integral multiples of the low molecular weight protein and thus appear to have resulted from dimerization and tetramerization of a D3 monomer. Whereas D3receptor multimers were found to be abundantly expressed in brain, the major D3 immunoreactivity expressed in stable D3-expressing rat GH3 cells was found to be a monomer. However, multimeric D3 receptor species with electrophoretic mobilities similar to those expressed in brain were also seen in D3-expressing GH3 cells when a truncated D3-like protein (named D3nf) was co-expressed in these cells. Furthermore, results from immunoprecipitation experiments with D3- and D3nf-specific antibodies show that the higher-order D3 proteins extracted from brain and D3/D3nf double transfectants also contain D3nf immunoreactivity, and immunocytochemical studies show that the expression of D3 and D3nfimmunoreactivities overlaps substantially in monkey and rat cortical neurons. Altogether, these data show oligomeric D3 receptor protein expression in vivo and they suggest that at least some of these oligomers are heteroligomeric protein complexes containing D3 and the truncated D3nfprotein. The expression and characteristics of the dopamine D3 receptor protein were studied in brain and in stably transfected GH3 cells. Monoclonal antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments. Immunoprecipitates obtained from primate and rodent brain tissues contain a low molecular weight D3 protein and one or two larger protein species whose molecular mass are integral multiples of the low molecular weight protein and thus appear to have resulted from dimerization and tetramerization of a D3 monomer. Whereas D3receptor multimers were found to be abundantly expressed in brain, the major D3 immunoreactivity expressed in stable D3-expressing rat GH3 cells was found to be a monomer. However, multimeric D3 receptor species with electrophoretic mobilities similar to those expressed in brain were also seen in D3-expressing GH3 cells when a truncated D3-like protein (named D3nf) was co-expressed in these cells. Furthermore, results from immunoprecipitation experiments with D3- and D3nf-specific antibodies show that the higher-order D3 proteins extracted from brain and D3/D3nf double transfectants also contain D3nf immunoreactivity, and immunocytochemical studies show that the expression of D3 and D3nfimmunoreactivities overlaps substantially in monkey and rat cortical neurons. Altogether, these data show oligomeric D3 receptor protein expression in vivo and they suggest that at least some of these oligomers are heteroligomeric protein complexes containing D3 and the truncated D3nfprotein. D3 receptors belong to the D2-class of dopamine receptors known to couple to inhibitory subsets of heterotrimeric G proteins. The members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors have a predicted membrane topology of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains connected by alternating extra- and intracellular loops. Although it is generally thought that functional G-protein-coupled receptors contain a single receptor molecule, several recent observations suggest that these receptors also exists as oligomers. For example, muscarinic M2 receptor proteins purified from porcine atria contained, in addition to the monomer, multiples of the monomeric receptor with electrophoretic mobilities suggesting trimeric and tetrameric homoligomers (1Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cooperative ligand binding profile of purified M2 receptors described by Wreggett and Wells (1Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) appears to fit best a model that assumes a tetrameric configuration of this receptor. Recently, Hebert et al. (2Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bovier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) showed that β2-adrenergic receptors form homodimers in transfected cells. These homodimers were resistant to SDS and reducing agents. Most interestingly, this dimerization was found to be essential for β2-receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, and agonist stimulation stabilized the dimeric receptor configuration, whereas inverse agonists favored the monomeric state (2Hebert T.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar).Previous immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses of a variety of different G-protein-coupled receptors (expressed in insect or mammalian cells) also suggested that these receptors are capable of forming homoligomers. For example, dopamine D2 receptor immunoprecipitates contained two D2-immunoreactive protein species, the larger (∼93 kDa) being twice the size of the smaller (∼44 kDa) (3Ng G.Y.K. O'Dowd B.F. Caron M. Dennis M. Brann M.R. George S.R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, dopamine D1 receptors were found to migrate at ∼50, 100, and 200 kDa (4Ng G.Y.K. Mouillac B. George S.R. Caron M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J.

Although these results in cell lines were often interpreted as nonspecific aggregation of incompletely folded intermediates, in each case the higher molecular weight species appeared to comprise multiples of a monomer.Earlier studies on chimeric receptors already suggested the possibility that functional G-protein-coupled receptors can be comprised of multiple receptor molecules. For example, Maggio et al. (10Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) made chimeric α2-adrenergic and M3 muscarinic receptors by replacing transmembrane domains VI and VII of one receptor with the corresponding domain of the other receptor. Although neither chimera was functional when expressed alone, functional receptors were formed when the two chimera were co-expressed. These results demonstrate that intermolecular interactions can occur between G-protein-coupled receptors and that the resultant oligomeric receptor complexes are functional.Whether G-protein-coupled receptors, in cells in which they are natively expressed, exist in monomeric or oligomeric configurations is still unresolved. However, the demonstration of functionaldifferences between dimers and monomers reported by Wreggett and Wells (1Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and Hebert et al. (2Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bovier M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) points to the importance of understanding the molecular composition of such receptors in vivo. The present study shows an oligomeric expression of the dopamine D3 receptor protein in brain which, at least in part, resulted from heteroligomerization of the D3protein and the truncated D3-like protein D3nf (see Refs. 11Schmauss C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29220-29226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSPolyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that were raised against peptide sequences specific for the human D3 receptor were used to characterize the properties and distribution of D3receptor species expressed in mammalian brain and in stably transfected rat GH3 cells.Characterization of the AntibodiesThe characterization of one of the D3 receptor antibodies used in this study has been reported previously (13Howe J.R. Skryabin B.V. Belcher S.M. Zerillo C.A. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14168-14174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This antipeptide antibody, which was raised against the amino terminus of the human D3 receptor (Cambio, Cambridge, UK), detected D3 immunoreactivity in immunoblot experiments using proteins extracted from rat GH3 cells that stably express the human dopamine D3 receptor under the transcriptional control of a tetracycline-responsive promotor. The expression of D3 receptor mRNA and protein in these stably transfected cells is suppressed by including tetracycline in the culture medium and reaches steady-state levels 24 h after induction (13Howe J.R. Skryabin B.V. Belcher S.M. Zerillo C.A. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14168-14174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two novel monoclonal antibodies (IgM/D3 and IgG/D3), which were raised against peptide sequences constituting amino acid residues 252–284 that are part of the putative third cytoplasmic loop of the human D3 protein, were then tested for their ability to detect the same approximately 50-kDa D3-immunoreactivity recognized by the polyclonal antipeptide antibody raised against the amino terminus of the D3 protein. As shown in Fig.1 A, all three antibodies recognize the same protein of approximately 50 kDa, which appears on immunoblots of proteins extracted 5–9 h after induction of D3 expression in stably transfected GH3 cells. This D3 immunoreactivity reaches steady-state levels 24 h after the induction of expression and is not detected in non-transfected GH3 cells. The expression of this D3immunoreactivity is abolished 3 days after the inhibition of D3 mRNA expression by the addition of tetracycline (2 μg/ml) to the culture medium (Fig. 1 A).In addition, we synthesized a T7 RNA polymerase transcript of the human cDNA encoding the D3 receptor (cloned into the plasmid vector pRc/CMV; Invitrogen) and translated this mRNA in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The resulting proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies IgM/D3 and IgG/D3 as well as the polyclonal anti-D3 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 1 B, all three antibodies recognized anin vitro translation product that also migrated at approximately 50 kDa. When D3 mRNA was omitted from thein vitro translation reaction, no D3immunoreactivity was detected on immunoblots, as shown in Fig.1 B for the polyclonal anti-D3 antiserum. It is noted in both experiments on transfected GH3 cells and onin vitro translation products that all three antibodies also recognize smaller protein species of about 37 and 30 kDa. These proteins are likely to be degradation products of the 50-kDa D3-immunoreactivity because they are not seen in non-transfected cells and they are also absent from in vitrotranslation reactions lacking D3 mRNA. Because these shorter protein species are also detected with the polyclonal antibody that recognizes amino-terminal D3 peptide sequences it is likely that these proteins represent D3 degradation products that lack carboxyl-terminal peptide sequences. The appearance of these putative degradation products is not due to insufficient supplementation of the SDS-containing solubilization buffer with protease inhibitors because they were detected in protein samples prepared in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin, and in samples that were additionally supplemented with pefabloc, pepstatin, and leupeptin (13Howe J.R.

Altogether, the results shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that all three antibodies (which were raised against non-overlapping peptide sequences of the human D3receptor) recognize the same D3 immunoreactivity.An additional polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes a unique carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence contained only within the truncated D3-like protein named D3nf (11Schmauss C. Haroutunian V. Davis K.L. Davidson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8942-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but not within the D3 protein, was used in some experiments. The characterization of this antibody has been reported previously (12Liu K. Bergson C. Levenson R. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29220-29226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).D3 Receptor Immunoreactivity Expressed in BrainThe monoclonal antibodies described above were used to characterize D3 immunoreactivity expressed in brain tissue. Because of the low levels of the D3 protein, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the monoclonal antibody (IgG/D3). The composition of the immunoprecipitate was analyzed on immunoblots using the monoclonal IgM/D3 antibody.We first analyzed the expression of D3 immunoreactivity expressed in human motor cortex. Fig.2 A shows the immunoprecipitates obtained with the IgG/D3 antibody. A protein of ∼50 kDa is clearly detected. However, an additional major D3 immunoreactivity of more than 180 kDa (∼200 kDa), and a smear of minor proteins migrating just below the largest protein, are also detected. The D3 immunoprecipitate of solubilized total human brain proteins (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) was then compared with the immunoprecipitate obtained from a membrane preparation of the same tissue (Fig. 2 A, lane 1; see “Experimental Procedures”). Also proteins solubilized from the membrane pellet contained the two major protein species indicating that both D3 protein species are integral membrane proteins. In lieu of the results shown in Fig. 1, the detection of the high molecular mass D3 immunoreactivity, which appears to be a multiple of the ∼50-kDa D3 protein, was unexpected. It should be noted, however, that even extensive post-translational modifications of the ∼50-kDa protein in vivo are unlikely to account for the mass of the additional large protein. For example, although dopamine receptors are thought to be extensivelyN-glycosylated, treatment of the D3immunoprecipitate with N-glycosidase F prior to blotting did not abolish the detection of the ∼200-kDa D3 protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). It did, however, abolish the smear of proteins seen directly below this protein species which revealed two sharp protein bands of slightly lower molecular mass. Furthermore, a doublet of proteins of ∼50 kDa is detected after treatment ofN-glycosidase F, indicating that removal ofN-linked sugars in a substantial portion of the D3 proteins results in only a small shift of their electrophoretic mobility.Figure 2D3-immunoreactivity expressed in human, monkey, and rat brain.

The immunoblots of these precipitates were probed with the monoclonal IgM antibody. Bound antigens are visualized as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In further experiments, we tested the ability of the IgG/D3 antibody to immunoprecipitate the D3 protein expressed in monkey and rat brain. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the antibody also immunoprecipitated the D3 protein expressed in these two species, and in both species the protein composition of the immunoprecipitate is very similar. In addition to a ∼45-kDa protein, two larger proteins are contained in the immunoprecipitate that migrate at approximately 85 and 180 kDa. D3-immunoreactive signals were not detected when solubilized proteins from spleen or muscle tissue (which do not express D3 receptors) were incubated with the monoclonal IgG/D3 antibody (Fig. 2 C).The size of the 45-kDa D3 immunoreactivity obtained from monkey and rat brain tissue corresponds to the calculated molecular mass of the D3 core protein. Similar to the composition of the D3 immunoprecipitate obtained from human brain tissue, the two larger protein species appear to be multiples of the 45-kDa protein. The results, therefore, suggest that the D3protein may be expressed as a monomer, a dimer, or a tetramer in rodent and primate brain. Interestingly, in all three species examined the tetrameric configuration of the D3 protein is the most abundant protein species present in the immunoprecipitate. In fact, only the tetrameric, but not the dimeric, D3 protein configuration was detected in human brain (Fig. 2 A). In all three species, these higher-order structures of the D3receptor were shown to be resistant to reducing agents (thus suggesting that monomers are not linked to each other via disulfide bonds) and were maintained after exposure to SDS.D3 Receptor Immunoreactivity Expressed in Stably Transfected rat GH3 CellsThe results shown in Fig. 2 motivated us to examine in more detail whether higher-order structures of the D3 protein can also be detected in a single type of cell in which the level of D3 receptor expression can be controlled. We therefore re-examined the GH3 cells that stably and inducibly express D3 mRNA and protein. Fig.3 A (middle panel) shows the results of immunoblot experiments from three independent GH3 cell clones in which the expression of the D3 protein was maximally induced. In each of these clones, however, the major D3 immunoreactivity (detected by the monoclonal IgG/D3 antibody) is that of the approximately 50-kDa immunoreactivity also seen in Fig. 1. Some higher-order structures of the D3protein are also expressed albeit at very low levels. For example, low expression of an ∼90-kDa D3 immunoreactivity is detected and the largest band, although barely visible, migrates at about 180 kDa. (These faint bands are best seen in Fig. 3 B, last two lanes.) Thus, in contrast to the results we obtained with proteins extracted from brain tissue, the major D3 protein species detected in these cells appears to be a monomer. It should be noted that D3 protein expression has been characterized in a larger number of independent clones during various levels of induction, steady-state expression, or inhibition of expression. In all these clones we have never observed significant levels of expression of higher-order structures of the D3 protein. Interestingly, however, high levels of D3 immunoreactivity with an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 180 kDa was detected on immunoblots of proteins from cells that co-express the D3receptor and a truncated D3-like protein (named D3nf) which differs from the D3 protein only in its carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence and therefore is unable to form transmembrane spanning domains VI and VII (11Schmauss C. Haroutunian V. Davis K.L. Davidson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8942-8946Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Liu K. Bergson C. Levenson R. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29220-29226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An immunoblot analysis of D3 protein expression in 5 randomly picked G-418- and hygromycin-resistant double-transfected GH3 cell clones (see “Experimental Procedures”) is shown in Fig. 3 A(right panel). Three of the 5 clones analyzed express, in addition to the 50-kDa D3 immunoreactivity also seen in single D3 transfectants, a major D3immunoreactivity migrating at approximately 180 kDa. Just as this result is different from the one obtained with single D3transfectants, it is also different from the results obtained with single D3nf transfectants in which the major D3nf immunoreactivity, recognized by a D3nf-specific polyclonal antiserum (12Liu K. Bergson C. Levenson R. Schmauss C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29220-29226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), migrates at approximately 45 kDa (Fig. 3 A, left panel).Figure 3Expression of D3 and D3nf immunoreactivities in stably transfected GH3 cells with active tetracycline-responsive promotors. A, immunoblots of proteins extracted from single D3nf and D3 transfectants, and from D3/D3nfdouble transfectants. All cells are in the fully induced state (i.e. steady-state protein expression). The blot on theleft, marked GH3/D3nf, was probed with the D3nf-specific antiserum (dilution 1:1000), the blots in themiddle, marked GH3/D3, and on theright, marked GH3/D3/D3nf, were probed with the D3-specific mAb (IgG, 1:100). Proteins were extracted from 3 (left and middle blots) or 5 (right blot) independent GH3 cell clones. Five μg of total cellular protein was loaded onto each lane. B, comparison of D3-immunoreactivities in D3/D3nfand D3/D2 double-transfectants, and in D3 single transfectants. These co-expressing cells were obtained after co-transfecting D3nf and D2, respectively, into the parent D3-expressing clone.Left blot, the first two lanes, markedD 3/D 3nf, contain proteins extracted from two independent clones with low (first lane) and high (second lane) levels of D3 and D3nf expression. The lanes markedD 3/D 2 andD 3 contain proteins extracted from cells that co-express D3 and D2 receptors and from cells that express only D3 receptors, respectively. Five μg of total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the blot was probed with the monoclonal IgG antibody. All cells are in the fully induced state. C, immunoprecipitation of proteins extracted from D3/D3nf double transfectants. Proteins extracted from the three double transfectants that express the 180-kDa D3 immunoreactivity were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal IgG antibody. The immunoprecipitate was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE. The blot was probed with the monoclonal IgM antibody (left). Bound antigens are visualized as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The expression of the 180-kDa D3 immunoreactivity does not appear to be the result of co-transfection per se, because it was not detected in D3-expressing GH3 cells that also express high mRNA levels of the (homologous) human D2 receptor (Fig.3 B, third lane). Furthermore, we observed the 180-kDa D3 immunoreactivity in a GH3 cell clone in which both D3 and D3nf are expressed at low levels (Fig.3 B, first lane) as well as in clones in which both proteins are expressed at very high levels (Fig. 3 B, second lane). However, in clones with high levels of D3, but very low levels of D3nf, the expression of the 180-kDa protein was not detected. This is, for example, the situation found for protein samples of the two G-418 and hygromycin-resistant GH3 clones loaded onto first and fifth lanes of Fig. 3 A(right panel). (Note that the gel shown in Fig.3 B is a 7% SDS-PAGE while the onces shown in Fig.3 A are 10 and 12% gels. This results in differences in the banding thickness of the 50-kDa protein.)In total, these results suggest that in GH3 cells the formation of the 180-kDa D3 immunoreactivity is specifically promoted by expression of the D3nf protein. The results also suggest that it is the molar ratio of the two proteins, and not their absolute level of expression, that determines the appearance of the higher-order D3 species; and the results do not therefore support the conclusion that the 180-kDa D3 immunoreactivity results from nonspecific protein aggregation due to overexpression of the transfected proteins (“molecular crowding”).In further experiments, proteins from the three double transfectants that express the 180-kDa D3 immunoreactivity were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal IgG/D3 antibody and the protein composition was analyzed on immunoblots probed with the monoclonal IgM/D3 antibody (Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig. 3 C, in each of the 3 clones, strong immunoreactive signals of approximately 180, 90, and 50 kDa were detected with monoclonal antibody IgM/D3. Thus, the pattern of D3 immunoreactivity contained in the immunoprecipitate of proteins from these D3/D3nf double transfectants is very similar to that seen in immunoprecipitates of proteins extracted from brain tissues (Fig. 2). It is noted, however, that the dimeric D3immunoreactivity is only detected in immunoprecipitation, but not immunoblotting, experiments on proteins of the GH3 double transfectants and that it is also not detected in immunoprecipitates of proteins extracted from human brain (Figs. 2 and 3). Although the reason for this discrepancy remains to be resolved, it is likely that the pellets of the immunoprecipitates contained mostly the 180-kDa protein complex which, during the preparation for SDS-PAGE analysis, could then be dissociated into its various protein constituents and that the detection of the dimeric D3 protein complex is therefore only possible when large amounts of the 180-kDa complex (i.e. those found in transfected cells, but not in brain tissue) are expressed.Protein Composition of the Higher-order D3Immunoreactivity in Brain and in D3/D3nf-expressing GH3 CellsOne possible explanation for the appearance of the ∼90- and 180-kDa protein species in co-transfected cells is that D3 and D3nf form heteroligomers. Both proteins have identical amino acid sequences that extend into the amino-terminal sequence of the putative third cytoplasmic domain, and thus include transmembrane spanning domains I through V. Although the D3nf protein is unlikely to have the additional transmembrane spanning domains VI to VII found in the D3 receptor protein, previous studies have shown molecular interactions between split G-protein-coupled receptor proteins (21Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) or chimeric G-protein-coupled receptors (10Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The following experiments therefore tested whether the ∼85/90- and 180-kDa D3 immunoreactivities seen in immunoprecipitates of proteins extracted from D3/D3nf-expressing GH3 cells and, most importantly, from brain tissue also contain D3nf immunoreactivity.The results shown in Fig. 4 were obtained with proteins extracted from rat prefrontal cortex (lane 1) and from GH3 D3/D3nf double transfectants (lane 2) that were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal IgG/D3 antibody. The immunoblot of these precipitates was probed with the D3nf-specific polyclonal antibody. Both the 180- and the ∼85/90-kDa protein species, but not the 50-kDa D3 monomer, gave D3nf-immunoreactive signals. A small fraction of the pellets of these immunoprecipitates (approximately 10%) was analyzed on immunoblots probed with the monoclonal IgM/D3 antibody. The results (not shown) are identical to the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 C, e.g. all three D3-immunoreactive protein species, including the ∼50-kDa monomer, were detected. In addition, proteins extracted from the rat brain were immunoprecipitated with the D3nf-specific polyclonal antiserum and the immunoblot of this precipitate was probed with the monoclonal IgM/D3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 (lane 3), both the higher-order D3 species, but not the 45-kDa D3nf immunoreactivity seen in single D3nf transfectants (see Fig. 3 A), are also recognized by the D3-specific antibody. (In general, however, we found the D3nf antiserum less"

FAK is activated and autophosphorylated by the ligation of integrins, although the substrate of FAK has not been revealed. We show here that p130Cas and Cas-L are FAK substrates. FAK directly phosphorylates Cas proteins primarily at the YDYVHL sequence that is conserved among all Cas proteins. Furthermore, the phosphorylated YDYVHL sequence is a binding site for Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, and the recruited Src family kinase phosphorylates the other tyrosine residues within Cas. The Cas-L YDYVHL sequence is phosphorylated upon integrin-ligand binding, and this integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is inhibited by the cotransfection of the FAK COOH-terminal domain that does not contain a kinase domain. These findings strongly suggest that FAK initiates integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas proteins; then, Src family tyrosine kinases, which are recruited to phosphorylated Cas and FAK, further phosphorylate Cas proteins.

Since integrin themselves are not a tyrosine kinase, a tyrosine kinase(s) that is functionally linked to integrins is essential for the integrin signaling pathway.One of the prime candidates for this tyrosine kinase is focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK (11Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

However, besides autophosphorylation, no other substrate of FAK has been revealed. A 68-kDa cytoskeletal protein, paxillin, is tyrosine phosphorylated upon integrin stimulation (16Burridge K.

Subsequently, a 105–110-kDa p130Cas-related protein (Cas-L or HEF1) was identified as a 105-kDa protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated upon the ligation of β1 integrins in T lymphocytes (28Minegishi M.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an 83-kDa Cas-related protein, Efs (or Sin), was reported as the binding proteins for the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of Fyn and Src (30Ishino M. Ohba T. Sasaki H. Sasaki T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2331-2338PubMed Google Scholar, 31Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All Cas proteins contain one SH3 domain in the NH2-terminal region, and they all contain multiple putative binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, including 8–15 binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain. All three Cas proteins also contain a YDYVHL sequence, which is a potential binding site for the Src SH2 domain (31Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D.

We and others reported that both p130Casand Cas-L were tyrosine phosphorylated upon the ligation of integrins and that tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas proteins bind to the SH2 domain-containing proteins Crk, Nck, and SHP-2 (28Minegishi M.

These findings suggest the role of Cas proteins in integrin-mediated signaling, especially in the recruitment of Crk and the other signaling molecules containing SH2 domains.In this study, we show that FAK phosphorylates the YDYVHL motif within Cas proteins and initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by pleural tyrosine kinases. We also demonstrate the putative involvement of FAK in integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas proteins.DISCUSSIONFocal adhesion kinase has been thought to play a key role in integrin-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, although no direct evidence for phosphorylation by FAK has been presented. Two FAK-binding proteins, paxillin and Cas, are the candidates for FAK substrate. We have observed that Cas-L is tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin stimulation in H9 cells (10Nojima Y. Rothstein D.M. Sugita K. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Minegishi M. Tachibana T. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas Cas-L is not tyrosine phosphorylated upon integrin stimulation in Hut78 cells, which are the parental cells for H9. 3K. Tachibana, T. Sato, Y. Ohashi, K. Kamiguchi, H. Fujita, and C. Morimoto, unpublished data. FAK is well expressed in H9 cells, whereas FAK is marginally expressed in Hut78 cells. From this finding, we hypothesized that FAK is essential for the integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L in H9 cells and that FAK may directly phosphorylate Cas-L. However, since Src family tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Src, can stably bind to autophosphorylated FAK (18Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 21Eide B.L. Turck C.W. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it is necessary to distinguish FAK kinase activity from FAK-associated Src family kinase activity.In this study, we have demonstrated that FAK directly phosphorylates p130Cas and Cas-L by using the FAK-Y397F mutant, which does not bind to the Src SH2 domain. Recently, Schlaepfer et al.reported supporting data demonstrating that immunoprecipitated FAK from Src −/− cells can phosphorylate p130Cas in vitro (38Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), although it is necessary to rule out the possible FAK-associated kinase, such as Fyn, in this kind of experiment. We determined that the major phosphorylation site by FAK is within the Cas YDYVHL sequence, and we further demonstrated that an Src family kinase, Fyn, binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated YDYVHL sequence. FAK has a very stringent substrate specificity, and the only established substrate of FAK is its own Tyr-397. We have demonstrated a second FAK substrate, Cas YDYVHL, which is also a binding site for the Fyn SH2 domain. These findings indicate the strong relevance between FAK substrate specificity and the binding specificity for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, we have shown tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas YXXP motifs by a tyrosine kinase recruited to phosphorylated Cas-YDYVHL and/or FAK-Y397. FAK also can phosphorylate the Cas YXXP motifs at least in vitro, although direct phosphorylation by FAK is weak compared with indirect phosphorylation by a kinase recruited to phosphorylated Cas and FAK in Cos cells.We have also demonstrated that the Cas-YDYVHL sequence is phosphorylated upon FN stimulation in 293T cells, in which FAK is activated and phosphorylated upon FN stimulation (data not shown). Moreover, this integrin-mediated phosphorylation of Cas-L is inhibited by the overexpression of FAK-CT, further suggesting the involvement of FAK in the integrin-mediated Cas phosphorylation. It was also reported that overexpression of the FAK COOH-terminal domain decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and tensin and decreases the anti-Tyr(P) staining of focal adhesions (39Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 40Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Taken together, our model for integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is as follows. First, integrin-mediated cell adhesion activates FAK. Activated FAK phosphorylates the Cas-YDYVHL and FAK-Y397. Then, an Src family kinase(s) is recruited to the phosphorylation sites, and it phosphorylates Cas YXXP motifs. Tyrosine-phosphorylated YXXP motifs are binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain. These results indicate that a cooperative Cas phosphorylation by FAK and Src family kinases is essential for integrin-mediated recruitment of Crk to Cas. Recent reports demonstrated that overexpression of Crk induces activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) via C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (41Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 42Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura M. Shibuya K. Matuoka T.

It was reported that Pyk2/Cakβ, a FAK-related tyrosine kinase (43Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoli P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that FAK may be involved in the activation of JNK/SAPK through tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas proteins and the recruitment of Crk and C3G.In contrast to our result, it was reported that FAK may not be involved in integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Casbased on the analysis of FAK −/− cells (46Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, we observed that a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, which binds to paxillin and Cas, is expressed in FAK −/− cells (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was induced upon integrin stimulation. We identified that this protein is different from FAK. However, it is highly conceivable that this 120-kDa protein is a FAK-related kinase, such as Pyk2/Cakβ (43Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoli P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 44Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), because Pyk2/Cakβ binds to paxillin and p130Cas. This 120-kDa protein may substitute for FAK in the integrin-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in FAK −/− cells. It was also reported that integrin-mediated p130Casphosphorylation is impaired in Src −/− cells (38Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 46Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Hamasaki K.

Three possible explanations are (i) c-Src recruitment to phosphorylated p130Cas and FAK may be essential for the detectable phosphorylation of p130Cas YXXP motifs. Therefore, it may be hard to detect p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation upon integrin stimulation in Src −/− cells. (ii) c-Src may be involved in FAK activation. Calalb et al. (48Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (49Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) showed that v-Src may positively regulate FAK kinase activity, suggesting that c-Src may be essential for FAK activation. (iii) c-Src may regulate ligand-binding activity of integrins, since v-Src phosphorylates the β1 integrin cytoplasmic region (50Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar).Although we have demonstrated that p130Cas and Cas-L are tyrosine phosphorylated in a similar manner, we observed several differences between these two proteins. The major structural difference between p130Cas and Cas-L is that p130Cascontains a proline-rich sequence upstream of the YDYVHL sequence, whereas Cas-L does not contain a proline-rich sequence. This sequence is a binding site for the Src SH3 domain (32Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)3 and is suggested to be involved in Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas (32Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas either upon integrin stimulation in 293T cells or by FAK coexpression in Cos cells is much weaker than that of Cas-L. These findings suggest that the Src SH3 domain-mediated interaction is not essential for the recruitment of Src family kinases to Cas proteins or for the Cas phosphorylation by Src family kinases upon integrin stimulation. Putative phosphorylation sites, such as the YDYVHL sequence and the YXXP motifs, are conserved between p130Cas and Cas-L, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas may be regulated by a slightly different mechanism from that of Cas-L. Integrin-ligand binding induces various biological and biochemical signals in addition to cell adhesion (1Ruoslahti E. J. Clin.

However, besides autophosphorylation, no other substrate of FAK has been revealed. A 68-kDa cytoskeletal protein, paxillin, is tyrosine phosphorylated upon integrin stimulation (16Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar) and binds to FAK (22Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J.

Crk-associated substrates (Cas) form a protein family of at least three distinct proteins. p130Cas is a 120–130-kDa protein that was first identified as a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in both v-Src- and v-Crk-transformed fibroblasts (25Matsuda M.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a 105–110-kDa p130Cas-related protein (Cas-L or HEF1) was identified as a 105-kDa protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated upon the ligation of β1 integrins in T lymphocytes (28Minegishi M.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an 83-kDa Cas-related protein, Efs (or Sin), was reported as the binding proteins for the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of Fyn and Src (30Ishino M. Ohba T. Sasaki H. Sasaki T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2331-2338PubMed Google Scholar, 31Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). All Cas proteins contain one SH3 domain in the NH2-terminal region, and they all contain multiple putative binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, including 8–15 binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain. All three Cas proteins also contain a YDYVHL sequence, which is a potential binding site for the Src SH2 domain (31Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D.

We and others reported that both p130Casand Cas-L were tyrosine phosphorylated upon the ligation of integrins and that tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas proteins bind to the SH2 domain-containing proteins Crk, Nck, and SHP-2 (28Minegishi M.

These findings suggest the role of Cas proteins in integrin-mediated signaling, especially in the recruitment of Crk and the other signaling molecules containing SH2 domains. In this study, we show that FAK phosphorylates the YDYVHL motif within Cas proteins and initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by pleural tyrosine kinases. We also demonstrate the putative involvement of FAK in integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas proteins. DISCUSSIONFocal adhesion kinase has been thought to play a key role in integrin-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, although no direct evidence for phosphorylation by FAK has been presented. Two FAK-binding proteins, paxillin and Cas, are the candidates for FAK substrate. We have observed that Cas-L is tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin stimulation in H9 cells (10Nojima Y. Rothstein D.M. Sugita K. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 28Minegishi M. Tachibana T. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas Cas-L is not tyrosine phosphorylated upon integrin stimulation in Hut78 cells, which are the parental cells for H9. 3K. Tachibana, T. Sato, Y. Ohashi, K. Kamiguchi, H. Fujita, and C. Morimoto, unpublished data. FAK is well expressed in H9 cells, whereas FAK is marginally expressed in Hut78 cells. From this finding, we hypothesized that FAK is essential for the integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L in H9 cells and that FAK may directly phosphorylate Cas-L. However, since Src family tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Src, can stably bind to autophosphorylated FAK (18Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 21Eide B.L. Turck C.W. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it is necessary to distinguish FAK kinase activity from FAK-associated Src family kinase activity.In this study, we have demonstrated that FAK directly phosphorylates p130Cas and Cas-L by using the FAK-Y397F mutant, which does not bind to the Src SH2 domain. Recently, Schlaepfer et al.reported supporting data demonstrating that immunoprecipitated FAK from Src −/− cells can phosphorylate p130Cas in vitro (38Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), although it is necessary to rule out the possible FAK-associated kinase, such as Fyn, in this kind of experiment. We determined that the major phosphorylation site by FAK is within the Cas YDYVHL sequence, and we further demonstrated that an Src family kinase, Fyn, binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated YDYVHL sequence. FAK has a very stringent substrate specificity, and the only established substrate of FAK is its own Tyr-397. We have demonstrated a second FAK substrate, Cas YDYVHL, which is also a binding site for the Fyn SH2 domain. These findings indicate the strong relevance between FAK substrate specificity and the binding specificity for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, we have shown tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas YXXP motifs by a tyrosine kinase recruited to phosphorylated Cas-YDYVHL and/or FAK-Y397. FAK also can phosphorylate the Cas YXXP motifs at least in vitro, although direct phosphorylation by FAK is weak compared with indirect phosphorylation by a kinase recruited to phosphorylated Cas and FAK in Cos cells.We have also demonstrated that the Cas-YDYVHL sequence is phosphorylated upon FN stimulation in 293T cells, in which FAK is activated and phosphorylated upon FN stimulation (data not shown). Moreover, this integrin-mediated phosphorylation of Cas-L is inhibited by the overexpression of FAK-CT, further suggesting the involvement of FAK in the integrin-mediated Cas phosphorylation. It was also reported that overexpression of the FAK COOH-terminal domain decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and tensin and decreases the anti-Tyr(P) staining of focal adhesions (39Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 40Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Taken together, our model for integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is as follows. First, integrin-mediated cell adhesion activates FAK. Activated FAK phosphorylates the Cas-YDYVHL and FAK-Y397. Then, an Src family kinase(s) is recruited to the phosphorylation sites, and it phosphorylates Cas YXXP motifs. Tyrosine-phosphorylated YXXP motifs are binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain. These results indicate that a cooperative Cas phosphorylation by FAK and Src family kinases is essential for integrin-mediated recruitment of Crk to Cas. Recent reports demonstrated that overexpression of Crk induces activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) via C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (41Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 42Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura M. Shibuya K. Matuoka T.

It was reported that Pyk2/Cakβ, a FAK-related tyrosine kinase (43Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoli P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that FAK may be involved in the activation of JNK/SAPK through tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas proteins and the recruitment of Crk and C3G.In contrast to our result, it was reported that FAK may not be involved in integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Casbased on the analysis of FAK −/− cells (46Vuori K.

However, we observed that a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, which binds to paxillin and Cas, is expressed in FAK −/− cells (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein was induced upon integrin stimulation. We identified that this protein is different from FAK. However, it is highly conceivable that this 120-kDa protein is a FAK-related kinase, such as Pyk2/Cakβ (43Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoli P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B.

This 120-kDa protein may substitute for FAK in the integrin-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in FAK −/− cells. It was also reported that integrin-mediated p130Casphosphorylation is impaired in Src −/− cells (38Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Three possible explanations are (i) c-Src recruitment to phosphorylated p130Cas and FAK may be essential for the detectable phosphorylation of p130Cas YXXP motifs. Therefore, it may be hard to detect p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation upon integrin stimulation in Src −/− cells. (ii) c-Src may be involved in FAK activation. Calalb et al. (48Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (49Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) showed that v-Src may positively regulate FAK kinase activity, suggesting that c-Src may be essential for FAK activation. (iii) c-Src may regulate ligand-binding activity of integrins, since v-Src phosphorylates the β1 integrin cytoplasmic region (50Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar).Although we have demonstrated that p130Cas and Cas-L are tyrosine phosphorylated in a similar manner, we observed several differences between these two proteins. The major structural difference between p130Cas and Cas-L is that p130Cascontains a proline-rich sequence upstream of the YDYVHL sequence, whereas Cas-L does not contain a proline-rich sequence. This sequence is a binding site for the Src SH3 domain (32Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)3 and is suggested to be involved in Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas (32Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas either upon integrin stimulation in 293T cells or by FAK coexpression in Cos cells is much weaker than that of Cas-L. These findings suggest that the Src SH3 domain-mediated interaction is not essential for the recruitment of Src family kinases to Cas proteins or for the Cas phosphorylation by Src family kinases upon integrin stimulation. Putative phosphorylation sites, such as the YDYVHL sequence and the YXXP motifs, are conserved between p130Cas and Cas-L, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas may be regulated by a slightly different mechanism from that of Cas-L. Focal adhesion kinase has been thought to play a key role in integrin-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, although no direct evidence for phosphorylation by FAK has been presented. Two FAK-binding proteins, paxillin and Cas, are the candidates for FAK substrate. We have observed that Cas-L is tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin stimulation in H9 cells (10Nojima Y.

The major structural difference between p130Cas and Cas-L is that p130Cascontains a proline-rich sequence upstream of the YDYVHL sequence, whereas Cas-L does not contain a proline-rich sequence. This sequence is a binding site for the Src SH3 domain (32Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)3 and is suggested to be involved in Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas (32Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas either upon integrin stimulation in 293T cells or by FAK coexpression in Cos cells is much weaker than that of Cas-L. These findings suggest that the Src SH3 domain-mediated interaction is not essential for the recruitment of Src family kinases to Cas proteins or for the Cas phosphorylation by Src family kinases upon integrin stimulation. Putative phosphorylation sites, such as the YDYVHL sequence and the YXXP motifs, are conserved between p130Cas and Cas-L, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas may be regulated by a slightly different mechanism from that of Cas-L.

https://openalex.org/W2057147093,"The regulation of phospholipase D cloned from rat brain (rPLD) was examined in vivo andin vitro. The enzyme was a shorter splice variant of human phospholipase D 1 (Hammond, S. M., Altshuller, Y. M., Sung, T.-C., Rudge, S. M., Rose, K., Engebrecht, J. A., Morris, A. J., and Frohman, M. A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 29640–29643). Its expression in COS-7 cells led to increased phospholipase D (PLD) activity that was further stimulated by constitutively active V14RhoA. V14RhoA had no effect on the endogenous PLD of the COS-7 cells, but constitutively active L71ARF3 increased its activity. In contrast, L71ARF3 did not activate rPLD expressed in the cells. Addition of phorbol ester markedly increased the endogenous PLD activity of COS-7 cells, and there was a further increase in the cells expressing rPLD.In membranes from COS-7 cells expressing rPLD, addition of myristoylated ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and RhoA in vitro stimulated PLD activity. The effect of ARF was greater than that of RhoA, although the concentrations for half-maximal stimulation (0.08–0.2 μm) were similar. Membranes isolated from cells expressing rPLD plus L71ARF3 and/or V14RhoA also showed higher PLD activity but no synergism between the two G proteins. Addition of phorbol ester and protein kinase C α (PKCα) also stimulated PLD activity in membranes from COS-7 cells expressing rPLD, but it had no effect on the activity in control (vector) membranes and did not enhance the effects of constitutively active ARF or Rho. The stimulation by PKCα did not require ATP and was not increased by addition of this nucleotide. No synergism between ARF and Rho and between these and PKCα on PLD activity was observed when these were added to membranes from cells expressing rPLD. Oleate inhibited the PLD activity of membranes from both control and rPLD-expressing cells.In summary, these results indicate that in vitro, rPLD is stimulated by ARF, RhoA, and PKCα and inhibited by oleate. However, in intact COS-7 cells, ARF activates endogenous PLD but not rPLD, whereas the reverse is true for RhoA. In addition, the effects of phorbol ester are much greater in the intact cells. It is concluded that the regulation of rPLD in intact COS-7 cells differs significantly from that seen in vitro; possible reasons for this are discussed.

Phospholipase D (PLD) 1The abbreviations used are: PLD, phospholipase D; hPLD1, human PLD 1; rPLD, rat PLD; PA, phosphatidic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PtdBut, phosphatidylbutanol; PC, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine.is believed to play a role in signal transduction in many cell types because it is a ubiquitous enzyme that is regulated by a great variety of hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors, cytokines, and other molecules involved in extracellular communication (Ref. 1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar and references therein). The product of PLD, phosphatidic acid (PA) has been proposed to function in mitogenesis in fibroblasts, stimulation of respiratory burst in neutrophils, regulation of secretion, and activation of specific protein kinases and other proteins. Diacylglycerol, which can be formed from PA by phosphatidic acid phosphatase, is a major regulator of protein kinase C (PKC). Lysophosphatidic acid, which can be produced from PA through hydrolysis by a specific phospholipase, A2, is now recognized as an important extracellular signal. Studies employing PKC inhibitors or down-regulation of the enzyme indicate the involvement of PKC in agonist regulation of PLD in many cell types (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The stimulation of PLD by PKC may occur by phosphorylation-dependent (2Lopez I. Burns D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19465-19472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or phosphorylation-independent (3Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

On the other hand, PKC-independent control of PLD by agonists has been observed in some studies (Ref. 1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar and references therein). Early studies indicated that the PLD activity of neutrophils or HL60 cells was enhanced by GTPγS in combination with a cytosolic protein, which was subsequently identified as ARF (7Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 8Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). ARF was originally discovered as a factor required for the ADP-ribosylation of Gsα by cholera toxin and was later shown to be involved in protein trafficking in the Golgi apparatus (9Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Stimulation of PLD activity by ARF has now been observed using recombinant PLD and partially purified preparations of the enzyme from various tissues (Ref. 1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar and references therein). ARF translocation to the membrane fraction has also been correlated with PLD activation after treatment of HL60 cells with phorbol ester or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (10Houle M.G. Kahn R.A. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22795-22800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported by Rümenapp et al. (11Rümenapp U. Geiszt M. Wahn F. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in HEK cells expressing muscarinic receptors and treated with carbachol. Extraction of Rho from membrane fractions by RhoGDI treatment reduces PLD activity in response to GTPγS, and the response can be recovered by the addition of Rho proteins (12Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J.

Rho proteins are involved in control of the actin cytoskeleton and mediate changes in response to extracellular signals, such as lysophosphatidic acid and growth factors (16Ridley A.J. Curr.

Rho also activates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (18Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), which synthesizes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a cofactor for PLD activation (7Brown H.A.

The in vivosignificance of these stimulatory and inhibitory proteins has not been assessed. There is much indirect evidence that PLD exists as several isozymes. This is based on differences in substrate specificity; in the regulation of the enzyme from different tissues and subcellular fractions by PKC, PIP2, fatty acids, Rho, and ARF; and in the effects of divalent cations, detergents, and pH (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 30Liscovitch M. Chalifa-Caspi V. Chem. Phys.

Recently, human PLD (hPLD1) was cloned from HeLa cells and characterized in vitro (32Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

To determine whether this enzyme is similar to that in other mammalian tissues, we cloned rPLD from a rat brain cDNA library and determined its regulation by ARF, RhoA, and PKCin vitro and in vivo. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), sodium oleate, and PA were purchased from Sigma. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanol, and phosphatidylbutanol (PtdBut) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Corp. GTPγS was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. [2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]Phosphatidylcholine and [9,10-3H]myristic acid were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. PKCα was purchased from Panvera Corp. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), RhoA, and recombinant myristoylated ARF3 (mARF) were prepared as described previously (31Provost J.J. Fudge J. Israelit S. Siddiqi A.R. Exton J.H.

Monoclonal antibody against RhoA from mouse was from Santa Cruz, and the cDNA for RhoA was generously provided by Dr. R. Cerione (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Anti-sARFII, polyclonal antibody from rabbit (which recognizes ARF1 and ARF3), and the cDNA for ARF3 were kind gifts of Dr. J. Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).

Morris (State University of New York, Stonybrook, NY), and polyclonal antibodies to the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal 12 residues of rPLD were prepared by Dr. D.-S. Min (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Vector Laboratories. Opti-MEM and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. COS-7 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. The ATP bioluminescence kit CLSII was from Boehringer Mannheim. Plaques (106) of a rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene) were screened with probe labeled with [32P]dCTP using a hPLD1 gene fragment (nucleotides 1476–2494) amplified from HL60 DNA using polymerase chain reaction primers corresponding to conserved sequences (WAHHEK and IIGSANIN) in hPLD1 (32Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Three clones that hybridized to the probe were selected and their 5′-terminal sequences were determined, but they were not full-length. Two full-length cDNA clones were obtained by rescreening the cDNA library with a probe made using the DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 299–1026 of hPLD1. Their sequences, determined by the dideoxy method, were found to be identical. Constitutively active mutant RhoA (V14RhoA) was made by site-directed mutagenesis (Promega) using the oligonucleotide TCCACAGGCTACATCACCAAC. Constitutively active mutant ARF3 (L71ARF3) was obtained from Dr. Hiroyuki Kanoh (Gifu University, Gifu, Japan). The full open reading frame of rPLD was cut by the restriction enzymes HindIII and ApaI. The cDNA were inserted into the pcDNA3 vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Plasmids were purified for transfection using Qiagen kits. PLD activity was assayed by measuring the formation of PtdBut, the product of transphosphatidylation in the presence of n-butanol. COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). The cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, each well of 6-well plates was seeded with 2 × 105 cells and then cultured overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator. For transfection, 2–3 μg of DNA (from rPLD, V14RhoA, L71ARF3, and vector alone or in combination) and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE were used. Twenty-four h later, the cells were labeled with 3 ml of Opti-MEM containing [3H]myristic acid (1 μCi/ml) and 0.5% fetal calf serum for 12–13 h. Unincorporated [3H]myristic acid was removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were incubated in 3 ml of Opti-MEM for 1 h. Butanol was then added to give a concentration of 40 mm, and the cells were incubated for 15 min. In the case of studies of the effect of PMA, 40 mm butanol and 100 nm PMA were used, and the cells were incubated for up to 60 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 6 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to each well. The phosphate-buffered saline was removed, and 1.5 ml of ice-cold methanol was added. [3H]PtdBut was quantitated as described previously (14Siddiqi A.R. Smith J.L. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8466-8473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.75 ml of water, and 1 h later, 0.75 ml of 0.2 n HCl and 1 ml of chloroform were added; the mixture was kept overnight at room temperature. An aliquot was taken to measure total radioactivity in the lipids, and PtdBut was separated by thin layer chromatography using Whatman LK6D silica gel plates and a solvent system (ethyl acetate:isooctane:acetic acid:water, 55:25:10:50). PtdBut and PA were located by visualizing authentic standards with iodine vapor, and PtdBut was scraped and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. COS-7 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), homogenized by 20 passes through a 27 gauge needle, and centrifuged at 500 × gfor 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to obtain membrane and cytosol fractions. These were mixed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking overnight with 5% fat free milk, the membranes were incubated with anti-RhoA monoclonal antibodies, anti-ARF polyclonal antibodies, or anti-PLD polyclonal antibodies. Visualization of bands was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Preblotted poly(A)+ RNA from various rat tissues (CLONTECH) was hybridized with a probe excised from rPLD in pBluescript SK by NotI in the multiple cloning site of the vector and Nsi1 in rPLD. It was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming and contained 1080 base pairs of the rPLD coding sequence, corresponding to amino acid residues 231–590. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 16 h in the presence of 40% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate. After hybridization, the membrane was washed at 50 °C in the presence of 0.1 × SSC buffer and 0.1% SDS. Visualization was by exposure to either a phosphor storage screen (Molecular Dynamics) or Kodak Biomax MS film. When hybridization was performed on RNA from cell lines, total RNA was extracted using Trizo (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by annealing with biotinylated oligo(dT) and selection with magnetic beads. The RNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). COS-7 cells transfected with either vector or rPLD as described earlier were washed twice with Buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μm leupeptin) and scraped into 2.7 ml of Buffer A per 6-well tissue culture plate. The cells were homogenized by 20 passes in a Dounce tissue grinder. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Crude membranes and cytosol were then isolated after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet (crude membranes) was resuspended and washed in Buffer A. PLD activity was measured by the formation of [3H]BtdBut from [3H-palmitoyl]PC in the presence of 1% butanol as described previously (31Provost J.J. Fudge J. Israelit S. Siddiqi A.R. Exton J.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylethanolamine/PIP2/[3H]PC (16:1.4:1) were used as substrate (7Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The concentration of ATP in COS-7 cell membranes was assayed by luciferase bioluminescence (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's directions. Rat brain PLD cDNA was obtained from a rat brain cDNA library as described under “Experimental Procedures” using a DNA fragment of the hPLD1 gene from HL60 cells. Using this approach, two full-length cDNA clones were obtained that had the translation initiation codon ATG, an in-frame stop codon, and a poly(A) tail. Both had identical sequences and were named rPLD. Analysis of the cDNA predicted an open reading frame encoding a 1036-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 119 kDa. The sequence showed 87% amino acid identity with hPLD1 (32Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) and had no recognizable motifs. The most striking difference from hPLD1 was that rPLD had a 38-amino acid deletion corresponding to residues 585–622 of hPLD1. To determine whether this region was species-specific or not, polymerase chain reaction was performed on the cDNA of HL60 cells using a primer spanning this area. Two kinds of polymerase chain reaction fragment were amplified, i.e. one with the insertion present and one with it absent (data not shown). In addition, two cDNAs selected from a human placenta cDNA library (Stratagene) did not have the insertion (data not shown). These results indicate that the insertion is not species-specific and is probably a splicing variant, in agreement with a recent report (33Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu G. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Northern hydribidization using mRNA from various rat tissues revealed the presence of a 5.3-kilobase transcript in all tissues examined (Fig.2). It was highest in lung, brain, and kidney and weakly present in testis (Fig. 2). Kidney contained an additional band of 3.8 kilobases. The transcript was not detected in COS-7 cells but was evident in C6 glioma cells, Rat-1 fibroblasts, and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (data not shown). There are many reports that PLD is regulated by the small GTP-binding proteins ARF and Rho (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To test the in vivoregulation of rPLD by these proteins, rPLD was expressed in COS-7 cells. A recombinant protein of approximately 120 kDa was detected in the membranes by an antibody raised to a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of hPLD1 (Fig. 3) but not by a antibody raised to a sequence (residues 525–541) in hPLD1 that differs from that in rPLD (data not shown). Lesser amounts of the enzyme were also detected in the cytosol. 2The amount of enzyme in the cytosol was variable. Compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 4 C. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 120 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown), which corresponds to the value of 119 kDa deduced from the sequence. The antibody cross-reacted with a 98-kDa protein that was endogenously present in the COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). Although this protein could represent an endogenous PLD, it did not cross-react with antibodies raised to PLD2 or to other sequences in hPLD1 or rPLD (data not shown). The basal (vector alone) PLD activity of the cells was low and was enhanced 2–3-fold by transfection with rPLD (Fig.4 A). To study the regulation of rPLD in vivo, COS-7 cells were transfected with constitutively active forms of ARF and RhoA (L71ARF3 or V14RhoA) with and without rPLD. Western blotting showed increased expression of both of these small G proteins in the cytosol of the COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). V14RhoA was also detected in the membranes, but L71ARF3 was barely detectable in this fraction (Fig. 3). Cells transfected with only L71ARF3 showed a 2-fold increase of PLD activity, indicating that the endogenous PLD was responsive to ARF. In contrast, cells transfected with V14RhoA showed no significant increase of basal PLD activity. However, cells transfected with rPLD plus V14RhoA or rPLD plus L71ARF showed increases over basal PLD activity of 8.5- and 4.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4 A). There were no significant differences in the incorporation of [3H]myristic acid into phospholipids in the variously transfected cells, indicating that [3H]PtdBut production was a valid means of assaying PLD activity (data not shown). When the cells were transfected with wild-type forms of ARF3 and RhoA with or without rPLD, the pattern of PLD activity (Fig. 4 B) was similar to that seen with the constitutively active forms of the small G proteins (Fig. 4 A). As discussed below, the stimulatory effects of the transfected wild-type G proteins can be attributed to factors present in the serum, because the stimulations were much less in serum-free medium (data not shown). When both ARF3 and RhoA were transfected together with rPLD, no synergistic interaction between the two G proteins was observed (Fig.4 B). In these experiments, rPLD expression in the co-transfections was similar to rPLD expression in the transfections with rPLD alone (Fig.4 C). 3The higher expression of membrane rPLD in the co-transfection with ARF3 (Fig. 4 C) was not routinely observed. Compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 8 B. The expression of the small G proteins was similar to that seen in Fig. 3except that ARF was not detectable in the membranes. The involvement of PKC i"

CVT-313 is a potent CDK2 inhibitor, which was identified from a purine analog library with an IC50 of 0.5 μm in vitro. Inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP (K i = 95 nm), and selective CVT-313 had no effect on other, nonrelated ATP-dependent serine/threonine kinases. When added to CDK1 or CDK4, a 8.5- and 430-fold higher concentration of CVT-313 was required for half-maximal inhibition of the enzyme activity. In cells exposed to CVT-313, hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product was inhibited, and progression through the cell cycle was arrested at the G1/S boundary. The growth of mouse, rat, and human cells in culture was also inhibited by CVT-313 with the IC50 for growth arrest ranging from 1.25 to 20 μm. To evaluate the effects of CVT-313 in vivo, we tested this agent in a rat carotid artery model of restenosis. A brief intraluminal exposure of CVT-313 to a denuded rat carotid artery resulted in more than 80% inhibition of neointima formation. These observations suggest that CVT-313 is a promising candidate for evaluation in other disease models related to aberrant cell proliferation.

These observations suggest that CVT-313 is a promising candidate for evaluation in other disease models related to aberrant cell proliferation. Cell cycle progression in mammalian cells is regulated by a family of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs), 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma gene product; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. that include CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, and CDK6 (1Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar). CDK2 is a serine/threonine kinase whose activity is essential for the G1 to S transition during cell division. A number of proteins have been shown to be substrates for CDK2 phosphorylation, and among them are the retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) and other related pocket proteins, members of the E2F transcription factor family, cyclin E, and members of the CDK inhibitory proteins. It is also postulated that CDK2 phosphorylates and regulates proteins involved in DNA replication (2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 3Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4977) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence suggest that CDK2 activity is essential for cell proliferation; microinjection of antibodies directed against CDK2 blocks the progression of human diploid fibroblasts into S phase (4Tsai L.H. Lees E. Faha B. Harlow E. Riabowol K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1593-1602PubMed Google Scholar,5Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar), and overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of CDK2 in human osteosarcoma cells has a similar effect (6van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The crucial role of CDK2 in controlling cell cycle progression suggests that CDK2 is an attractive target for treatment of aberrant cell proliferation. Smooth muscle cell proliferation is largely responsible for restenosis following angioplasty (7Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9990) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that CDK2 is activated very early after endothelial denudation in the rat carotid artery model of restenosis (8Wei G.L. Kransinski K. Kearney M. Isner J.M. Walsh K. André V. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); moreover, antisense oligonucleotides directed against CDK2 were shown to be effective in reducing neointima formation in this model (9Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Ellison K.E. Nakajima M. von der Leyen H. Zhang L. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1458-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Abe J. Zhou W.

Arguably, the restenosis model can be used as a “proof of principle” for developing CDK2 inhibitors as drug candidates for the treatment of diseases related to aberrant cell proliferation. Olomoucine is a purine analog of ATP and is a specific inhibitor of CDK1 and CDK2 (11Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strand M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J. Detivaud L. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Its potency, however, is relatively low. Using the crystal structure of CDK2 (12De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarick J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and computer-aided drug design, a combinatorial library strategy (13Norman T.C.

While the synthesis and structure activity relations of these compounds will be described elsewhere, 2S. R. Schow, R. T. Lum, D. Shiffman, R. Mackman, and M. W. Wick, manuscript in preparation. the present communication describes the biological effects of CVT-313, a representative compound from this purine-based library. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma and all tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., except where indicated. Baculovirus homogenization buffer was 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotonin. Activation buffer was 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. Lysis buffer was 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mmNaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotonin, and 1 mm iodoacetamide. Baculovirus constructs expressing human cyclin AΔ171, CDK2, cyclin H, and CDK7 were a kind gift from David Morgan (University of California, San Francisco). Recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in baculovirus homogenization buffer. CDK2-cyclin A complexes were activated by mixing with a 0.1 volume of CDK7/cyclin H extracts in activation buffer and incubating at 25 °C for 1 h. The CDK2-cyclin A complex was purified as described previously (15Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Human cyclin E was amplified from RNA made from MRC-5 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCATGAAGGAGGACGGCGGCGC-3′ and 5′-TGCTCTAGATCACGCCATTTCCGGCCCGC-3′. The cDNA was cloned into pFASTBAC HTb (Life Technologies, Inc.), generating a histidine tag at the amino-terminal end of cyclin E. Recombinant cyclin E was expressed in Sf9 cells, mixed with protein extracts of Sf9 cells expressing CDK2, and activated as described above. The CDK2-cyclin E complex was purified by nickel resin chromatography utilizing the histidine tag of cyclin E, as recommended by the vendor (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human CDK4 cDNA was amplified from RNA made from MRC-5 cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCTACCTCTCGATATGAGCC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCACTCCGGATTACCTTCATCC-3′. The cDNA was cloned into pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human cyclin D1 cDNA (a kind gift from Steven Reed, Scripps Institute) was cloned into a pFASTBAC HTb vector, generating a histidine tag at the amino-terminal end of cyclin D1. CDK4/cyclin D/CDK7/cyclin H were co-expressed in Sf9 cells, and the activated CDK4-cyclin D complex was isolated by nickel resin chromatography. Human CDK1/cyclin B was purchased from New England Biolabs. Rat brain protein kinase C was purchased from Pierce. Bovine protein kinase A was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Murine recombinant mitogen-activated protein kinase was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. CDK2/cyclin A, CDK2/cyclin E, and CDK1/cyclin B were incubated with 1 μg of histone H1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 1 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as indicated, in 10 mm MgCl2 with 50 μm ATP and 0.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were carried out for 25 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Samples were blotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper and washed three times with 150 mmphosphoric acid. Filters were blotted dry, mixed with scintillation fluid, and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry (Beckman LS 6500). All other in vitro kinase assays were performed by the same method, except that the protein kinase C assay contained 0.2 μg of phosphotidyl-l-serine as an activator of proein kinase C. CDK4/cyclin D1 assay used 1 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the substrate in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, with 10 μm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol). The protein kinase A assay used 50 μm Kemptide (Life Technologies, Inc.) as the substrate in 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 12.5 mm Tris (pH 7.5) with 100 μm ATP. The mitogen-activated protein kinase assay contained 10 μg of myelin basic protein (Life Technologies, Inc.) as the substrate in 18.75 mm MgCl2 with 125 μm ATP. All cell lines were purchased from ATCC and grown as recommended except for neonatal rat vascular smooth muscle cells that were a kind gift from Mark Majesky (Baylor College of Medicine). These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Proliferation assays were carried out using the nonradioactive CellTiter 96 kit (Promega) after 48-h exposure. For FACS analysis of DNA content, cells were trypsinized, fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A and 40 μg/ml propidium iodide for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were sent to Cytometry Associates (San Diego) for analysis. Proteins were extracted from cells from two 9.6-cm2 wells using 0.2 ml of lysis buffer. Equal volumes (40 μl) of cleared cell lysate were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with Rb antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were developed using the BM chemiluminescent system (Boehringer Mannheim). Pairs of male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) aged 2–3 months (400–500 g) were housed under a normal 12-h light/dark cycle in standard plastic “shoe box” cages with standard laboratory chow and water available ad libitum. Prior to surgery, the animals were anesthetized with 1.3 ml/kg ketamine/xylazine mixture (58% ketamine hydrochloride, 100 mg/ml; 42% xylazine hydrochloride, 20 mg/ml) injected intraperitoneally. After preparing the ventral cervical area for aseptic surgery, the bifurcation of the left common carotid artery was exposed, and a small vascular clamp was applied to the internal carotid artery. A deflated, saline-filled 2 F Fogarty catheter (Baxter) was inserted via an arteriotomy in the external carotid artery. The catheter was advanced proximally into the common carotid artery up to the aortic arch. To denude and injure the artery, the balloon was inflated with 20 μl of saline and then gently pulled back to the bifurcation. The procedure was repeated three times. Immediately after removing the balloon catheter, a delivery cannula (PE10 polyethylene tubing) was inserted, and 65 units of heparin sodium salt (Sigma, H-4898) in 1 ml of saline were injected. Following the heparin injection, a second vascular clamp was used to bisect the common carotid and allow for the infusion of drug or control solutions to one half of the injured artery. A loose silk ligature was used to mark the point where the clamp bisected the artery. This suture mark was later used to determine the treated and untreated sections of the artery when the animal was sacrificed. Before infusing control or drug solutions, the artery was backflushed with 1 ml of sterile saline. 100 μl of control or drug solution were flushed through the artery to wash out the saline and fill the lumen with the solution under study. A 3-0 Prolene ligature was placed around the external carotid to hold the cannula in place and create a closed system. Approximately 1 atm of steady pressure was applied to the delivery syringe over a 15-min incubation period. After the 15-min incubation period, the cannula and vascular clamp bisecting the common carotid artery were removed, to reestablish blood flow and flush residual solution out of the artery, before a 3-0 silk suture was applied to permanently ligate the external carotid artery. Finally, the vascular clamp was removed from the internal carotid artery, the neck wound was closed, and the animals were allowed to recover. Throughout the 14-day recovery period, a clinically relevant dose of aspirin (162.5 mg/L) was added to the animals' water to prevent thrombosis. Fourteen days after the balloon catheter injury to the carotid artery, the animals were anesthetized, as described above. Buffered formalin (10%) was perfused at physiological pressure through the aortic arch. The left carotid artery was removed (from the carotid bifurcation to the aortic arch) and bisected at the loose silk ligature that demarked the treated and untreated boundary. The treated and untreated sections were each cut into three equal sections and mounted in cryomolds. The arteries were sectioned in a cryotome into 10-μm slices. Samples were taken randomly at 100-μm intervals and mounted on slides for staining and analysis. Fifteen samples from both treated and untreated segments were used, for a total of 30 samples from each animal. The slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed with the 4× objective of a light microscope (Olympus) and a digitizing tablet (JS-2, Jandel Scientific). Sigmascan software (Jandel Scientific) was used to determine the neointimal area of the digitized image. CVT-313 (2{-bis-(hydroxyethyl)amino}-6-(4-methoxybenzyl-amino)-9-isopropyl-purine, Fig. 1), was prepared by the Medicinal Chemistry department at CV Therapeutics, and details of its synthesis will be described elsewhere.2 A large library of compounds were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit CDK2 activity. CVT-313 was identified as a potent inhibitor of CDK2/cyclin A (Fig.2, IC50 = 0.5 μm). It is equally potent at inhibiting CDK2/cyclin E, using either histone HI or recombinant Rb as a substrate. The phosphorylation of Rb by the CDK2-cyclin A complex was about 3-fold less sensitive to inhibition by CVT-313 (IC50 = 1.5 μm; data not shown). It is unclear whether this is because Rb is a natural substrate of CDK2/cyclin E but not of CDK2/cyclin A, or because we used a deletion derivative of cyclin A in our assay system. CVT-313 was tested for its effect on two related cyclin-dependent kinases. For inhibition of CDK1 activity, a 8.5-fold higher concentration was required (IC50 = 4.2 μm) and for inhibition of CDK4 activity, a 430-fold higher concentration was required (IC50 = 215 μm). To ascertain the specificity of inhibition of CVT-313, three other serine/threonine ATP dependent kinases were also tested. The concentration of CVT-313 required for half maximal inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase A was at least a 2500-fold higher than that required to inhibit CDK2, whereas protein kinase C was not inhibited at all at 1250 μm of CVT313 (data not shown). Thus, the inhibition of CDK2 activity by CVT-313 appears to be highly specific. The kinetics of inhibition of CDK2 by CVT-313 were examined. Results shown in Fig.3 indicate that the inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP and the K i was 95 nm.Figure 2CVT-313 selectively inhibits CDK2 activity. Enzyme activity assays were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Bars represent the standard error of each data point. The IC50 values were interpolated from these plots as follows: CDK2/cyclin A, open squares, 0.5 μm; CDK1/cyclin B, open diamonds, 4.2 μm; CDK4/cyclin D1, open circles, 215 μm; mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), filled diamonds, >1250 μm; protein kinase A (PKA), filled squares, >1250 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Lineweaver-Burke analysis of CVT-313 inhibition. CDK2/cyclin A activity was assayed using histone HI as substrate. ATP concentrations were 5, 10, 25, and 50 μm. CVT-313 concentrations were 0 (open circles), 0.1 (open triangles), and 0.2 μm (open squares). A double reciprocal plot was extrapolated from the average of triplicate data points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using normal and tumor human/murine cell lines, the effects of CVT-313 on cell proliferation was measured (Fig. 4 and Table I). The IC50 for growth inhibition ranged from 1.25 to 20 μm. To examine whether the growth inhibition by CVT-313 was cell cycle-specific, MRC-5 cells (human diploid lung fibroblasts) were exposed to CVT-313. Unlike nonsynchronized MRC-5 cells, a large number of MRC-5 cells that had been synchronized by serum deprivation for 72 h contained 2n DNA (Fig. 5, A versus B). After 18 h of serum stimulation, a relatively large proportion of the cells progressed into S phase, with their DNA content intermediate between 2 and 4 n. (Fig. 5 C). If CVT-313 (12.5 μm) was added to cells 18 h after serum stimulation, the DNA content of most of the cells was either 2 or 4 n with very few cells (less than 10%) entering S phase (Fig. 5, D versus C). If under similar culture conditions the concentration of CVT-313 was decreased to 6.25 μm, FACS analysis showed most cells with 2 n DNA, fewer cells with 4 n DNA, and very few cells in S phase. These data suggest that cells arrest at the G1/S and G2/M boundary at a higher concentration of CVT-313, but at the lower concentration of CVT-313, most of the cells are arrested at the G1/S boundary. These observations are consistent with the established role of CDK1 and CDK2 in controlling G2/M and G1/S transition, respectively, and with our findings that, at lower concentrations, CVT-313 inhibits only CDK2 activity, but a higher concentration of CVT-313 is needed to inhibit CDK1 activity. We were also interested in ascertaining whether CVT-313 could be used to synchronize cells at the G1/S boundary. Nonsynchronized MRC-5 cells were treated with CVT-313 (6.25 μm) for 36 h and then analyzed by FACS. Fig. 5 F shows that most of these cells had a 2 n DNA content, consistent with a G1/S arrest. After removal of CVT-313 from the growth medium (Fig. 5, G and H), cells reentered the cell cycle, suggesting that the inhibition of cell proliferation was reversible.Table IIC 50 values for CVT313 added to exponentially growing cells in tissue cultureCell lineDescriptionIC50μmA2058Human metastatic melanoma16Caco-2Human colon adenocarcinoma4.5Capan-1Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma10L1210Mouse lymphocytic leukemia6.25MCF-7Human breast adenocarcinoma20MRC-5Human normal lung fibroblasts5Neonatal RVSMC1-aRat vascular smooth muscle cells.Rat neonatal aortic smooth muscle cells1.25P-388D1Mouse lymphoid neoplasm4Panc1Human pancreatic carcinoma8Cell population was measured using CellTiter 96 system as described under “Materials and Methods.” IC50 were calculated from the linear portion of the inhibition curve.1-a Rat vascular smooth muscle cells.

One of the in vivo targets of CDK2 is Rb. We wanted to ascertain whether CVT-313 inhibited Rb hyperphosphorylation in MRC-5 cells that had been synchronized by serum starvation. Western blot analysis was used to determine the phosphorylation status of Rb after serum stimulation (Fig. 6). At 4, 8, and 13 h after stimulation with serum, a time-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Rb could be demonstrated. FACS analysis of cells that were processed in parallel indicated that these cells almost exclusively contained 2 n DNA (data not shown) which, consistent with published data, indicated Rb hyperphosphorylation prior to entry into S phase (16Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 18: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (4313) Google Scholar). If CVT-313 (6.25 μm) was added at 0, 4, or 8 h after serum stimulation, Rb hyperphosphorylation was inhibited. The effect on Rb hyperphosphorylation was less striking when CVT-313 was added 8 h after stimulation, presumably because some phosphorylation of Rb by CDK2 had already occurred. We have also detected some Rb hyperphosphorylation even when CVT-313 was added at the time of serum stimulation. These phosphorylation events could be the result of CDK4 activity, consistent with our finding that CVT-313 does not significantly inhibit CDK4 activity in vitro. To test the in vivo efficacy of CVT-313, we chose the injured rat carotid artery model of restenosis. In this model, luminal narrowing is due to neointima formation by smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation (7Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9990) Google Scholar). Analysis of drug efficacy in this animal model has two potential problems. First, since the response to endothelial denudation varies from animal to animal, control groups could fortuitously show a higher proliferative response compared with treated animals. We addressed this problem by treating only one half of the injured carotid, and used the other half as an internal untreated control. Another potential problem relates to the nonuniformity of the stenotic lesion along the carotid, that can generate erroneous data when only a few sections from each carotid are analyzed. We therefore, routinely analyzed 15 randomly selected tissue slices throughout each segment of the carotid. Using this methodology, we demonstrated that exposure of the denuded carotid artery to the hydrochloride salt of CVT-313 in saline solution (1.25 mg/kg) for 15 min under pressure, reduced neointima formation by 80% (Fig. 7). Moreover, in each individual animal treated with CVT-313 there is at least 70% inhibition of the neointimal area, demonstrating efficacy in every treated animal. Two lower doses of CVT-313 (0.75 and 0.25 mg/kg) were less efficacious, reducing mean neointimal area by about 30%, whereas the lowest dose tested (0.025 mg/kg) did not achieve any significant reduction in neointimal area. Representative sections from experimental rat carotid arteries 14 days after endothelial denudation (Fig.8) demonstrate the efficacy of CVT-313 in blocking restenosis in the rat carotid model. These “proof of principle” studies validate the use of CDK2 as an antiproliferative target and indicate that CVT-313 is an ideal candidate worthy of evaluation in other animal models of proliferative diseases.Figure 8Representative slices of treated, untreated, and normal rat carotid.

https://openalex.org/W2125606313,"γ-Carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins requires a functional vitamin K cycle to produce the active vitamin K cofactor for the γ-carboxylase which posttranslationally modifies precursors of these proteins to contain γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues. The warfarin-sensitive enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) of the cycle reduces vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to the active vitamin K hydroquinone cofactor. Because of the importance of warfarin as an anticoagulant in prophylactic medicine and as a poison in rodent pest control, numerous attempts have been made to understand the molecular mechanism underlying warfarin-sensitive vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reduction. In search for protein components that could be involved in this reaction we designed an in vitro γ-carboxylation test system where the warfarin-sensitive VKOR produces the cofactor for the γ-carboxylase. Dissection of this system by chromatographic techniques has identified a member(s) of the glutathione S-transferase gene family as one component of the VKOR enzyme complex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The affinity-purified glutathioneS-transferase(s) was sensitive to warfarin but lost its warfarin sensitivity and glutathione S-transferase activity upon association with lipids in the presence of Mn2+ or Ca2+. In the γ-carboxylation test system, loss of warfarin-sensitive glutathione S-transferase activity coincided with formation of the VKOR enzyme complex. It is proposed that formation of VKOR in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane resembles formation of the lipoxygenase enzyme complex where the glutathioneS-transferase-related FLAP protein binds cytosolic lipoxygenase to form a membrane enzyme complex. γ-Carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent proteins requires a functional vitamin K cycle to produce the active vitamin K cofactor for the γ-carboxylase which posttranslationally modifies precursors of these proteins to contain γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2Furie B. Furie C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The carboxylase converts a limited number of glutamic acid residues in the targeted proteins to γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues (1Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2Furie B. Furie C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The vitamin K-dependent proteins include the coagulation factors prothrombin, factors VII, IX, and X, and proteins S and C, which are produced by the liver (2Furie B. Furie C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), and several proteins synthesized in extrahepatic tissues, some of which have been identified. They are osteocalsin (3Hauschka P.V. Lian J.B. Cole D.E. Gundberg C.M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 990-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), matrix γ-carboxyglutamic acid protein (3Hauschka P.V. Lian J.B. Cole D.E. Gundberg C.M. Physiol.

Cell. 1995; 80: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). γ-Carboxylation of one Glu residue is coupled stoichiometrically to formation of 1 molecule of the vitamin K metabolite, vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide. The epoxide is reduced by liver enzyme(s) back to the hydroquinone cofactor form of the vitamin, vitamin K1H2, and this cyclic conversion establishes a redox cycle for vitamin K in liver, known as the vitamin K cycle. Two unrelated vitamin K-reducing enzymes have been identified as part of the cycle (6.Biochem. J. 241, 389–396Wallin, R., and Martin, L. F. Biochem. J., 241, 389–396.Google Scholar). The flavoprotein DT-diaphorase (EC1.6.99.2) reduces the quinone form of vitamin K1 but not the epoxide (7Wallin R. Gebhardt O. Prydz H. Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the warfarin-sensitive enzymevitamin K epoxidereductase (VKOR) reduces the epoxide as well as the quinone and thus is essential for operation of the cycle (8Wallin R. Martin L.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1879-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of warfarin as an anticoagulant in prophylactic medicine (9Suttie J.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1987; 214: 3-16PubMed Google Scholar) and as a poison in rodent pest control (10Jackson W.B. Ashton A.D. Delventhal K. Suttie J.W. Current Advances in Vitamin K Research. Elsevier, New York1988: 381-397Google Scholar), numerous attempts have been made to understand the molecular mechanism underlying warfarin-sensitive vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide reduction. These studies have demonstrated repeatedly that thiol groups are involved in the enzyme reaction (11Suttie J.W. Deluca H.F. Handbook of Lipid Research. Plenum Press, New York1978: 211-277Google Scholar) and in recognition of warfarin as an enzyme inhibitor (12Fasco M.J. Principe L.M. Walsh W.A. Friedman P.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5655-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Lee J.J. Fasco M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2246-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular components that constitute the enzyme have not been identified. In a search for protein components that would be involved in this reaction we designed an in vitro γ-carboxylation test system where the warfarin-sensitive enzyme produces the cofactor for the γ-carboxylase. Dissection of this system by chromatographic techniques and reconstitution of the system have identified a member(s) of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) super gene family as one component of the warfarin-sensitive-VKOR enzyme complex. Vitamin K may also be a substrate for members of this gene family. Normal male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were purchased from Zivic Miller Laboratories, Inc., Zelienopole, PA. γ-Carboxylase activity was measured as incorporation of14CO2 into the carboxylase substrate peptide Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu using chemically reduced vitamin K1H2 to trigger the reaction (14Wallin R. Martin L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9994-10001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced vitamin was prepared by dithionite reduction as described previously (15Sadowski J.A. Esmon C.T. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2770-2776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent vitamin K1 epoxide reduction by the vitamin K cycle, 10 μm warfarin was added to the test system. Warfarin-sensitive VKOR activity was measured as described elsewhere (8Wallin R. Martin L.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1879-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) by estimating the percent conversion of vitamin K12,3-epoxide to vitamin K1. The vitamin and the epoxide were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on a reversed phase C18 column in methanol and quantified against external standards. Vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide was prepared by H2O2 oxidation (16Tishler M. Fieser L.F. Wendler N.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1940; 62: 2866-2871Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and added to the test system in ethanol to give a final concentration of 8 μm. VKOR-supported γ-carboxylase activity was measured as described above for γ-carboxylase activity, except that warfarin was not added to the test system and the reaction was triggered with 8 μmvitamin K1 2,3-epoxide and 5 mm DTT. The reaction was carried out at 26 °C. These concentrations of epoxide and DTT were shown previously to be saturating for the enzyme reaction (6.Biochem. J. 241, 389–396Wallin, R., and Martin, L. F. Biochem. J., 241, 389–396.Google Scholar). All three assays were linear for 30 min at 26 °C. GST activity was measured as described by Andersson et al. (17Andersson C. Piemonte F. Mosialou E. Weinander R. Sun T.-H. Lundqvist G. Adang A.E.P. Morgenstern R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using CDNB (1 mm) as a substrate in the presence of 1 mm GSH. Warfarin-sensitive GST activity was determined after addition of 5 mm warfarin to the assay mixture. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) activity was measured as the rate of conversion of styrene 1′2′-epoxide to the corresponding diol (18.Methods Enzymol. 77, 344–351Guenthner, T. M., Bentley, P., and Oesch, F. Methods Enzymol., 77, 344–351.Google Scholar). Rat liver microsomes were prepared as described previously (6.Biochem. J. 241, 389–396Wallin, R., and Martin, L. F. Biochem. J., 241, 389–396.Google Scholar) and stored frozen at −85 °C. Prior to use, microsomes were resuspended in ice-cold 0.025 m imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.5% CHAPS (buffer A) and 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate with six strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer to give a protein concentration of 7 mg/ml. After resuspension, the microsomal homogenate was left on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was collected, and the remaining pellet surface washed with buffer A. The pellets remaining after extraction were resuspended in: 1) buffer A (control), 2) the buffer A extract, or 3) purified proteins from the extract dissolved in buffer A, respectively. In each set of experiments the final protein concentration of the pellet was identical in all samples. Before measuring vitamin K-dependent enzyme activities, 10 mmMnCl2 was added to each test sample. Warfarin was added at a concentration of 10 μm. The microsomal extract in buffer A was gel-filtrated on a Bio-Gel P-100 column equilibrated in the same buffer. The retained fraction (fraction B(P-100)) was loaded onto a cellulose DE52 anion exchanger (Whatman) equilibrated in buffer A. The unretained fraction (fraction A, see Fig.3) was collected and loaded onto an agarose-GSH affinity column equilibrated in buffer A. All chromatographic steps were carried out at 4 °C. Prepacked columns of silica beads covered with immobilized phosphatidylcholine (PC) (REGIS Technologies, Inc., Morton Grove, IL) were equilibrated in buffer A without detergent. GSTs purified by agarose-GSH affinity chromatography were first stirred for 1 h with SM2 beads (Bio-Rad) to remove excess detergent. The beads were removed by filtration, and the clear solution was loaded onto the IAM column. The unretained protein fraction was collected, and the column was washed with several bed volumes of buffer A without detergent before the fractions of retained GSTs were eluted from the column in 250 mm imidazole, 0.5 m KCl, 0.75% CHAPS, pH 7.85. Liposomes were prepared by sonication of asolectin as described previously (19Wallin R. Guenthner T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE in 10 and 15% gels was carried out according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue as described previously (21Wallin R. Culp E. Coleman D.B. Goodman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4095-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and immunocomplexes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies as described previously (14Wallin R. Martin L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9994-10001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Stanton C. Taylor R. Wallin R. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analysis was performed by the Protein Analysis Core Laboratory at The Bowman Gray School of Medicine. Protein sequence comparisons were carried out using the Genetics Computer Group Sequence Analysis Software Package Version 8.0. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against microsomal glutathione S-transferase (mGST) was kindly provided by Dr. Ralf Morgenstern, Division of Toxicology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against recombinant human α-GSTA1 was a gift from Dr. Alan Townsend, The Bowman Gray School of Medicine. Vitamin K1, GSH, agarose-GSH, and Sepharose-iminodiacetic acid were from Sigma. Asolectin from soybeans was from Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland. [3H]Styrene 1′2′-epoxide (specific activity, 314 × 109 cpm/mmol) was a gift from Dr. Thomas Guenthner, Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois, Chicago. To identify individual proteins that contribute to the activity of the multicomponent vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system (11Suttie J.W. Deluca H.F. Handbook of Lipid Research. Plenum Press, New York1978: 211-277Google Scholar), it was necessary to develop a reconstitution assay system. A prerequisite for such a system to work was the finding of experimental conditions where the γ-carboxylase and the VKOR components of the system were both active and could be separated and assembled again for reconstitution of the system. Consistent with earlier reported work on VKOR (23Hildebrandt E.F. Preusch P.C. Patterson J.L. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 480-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we found that a variety of experimental conditions which retained γ-carboxylase activity destroyed VKOR activity. Most of the commercially available detergents inactivates VKOR. However, when rat liver microsomes were resuspended in an isotonic buffer (buffer A) containing the zwitter ionic detergent CHAPS, γ-carboxylase and VKOR were both active. Furthermore, when increasing concentrations of MnCl2 was added to microsomes resuspended in buffer A, a 14-fold increase in VKOR supported γ-carboxylase activity was observed (Fig.1, triangles). MnCl2 addition also stimulated VKOR (squares), and γ-carboxylase (circles) activities 6- and 12-fold, respectively (see Fig. 1). Calcium was found to be equally effective as Mn2+ but Mg2+ was only half as effective (data not shown). Aggregation of negatively charged lipids with divalent cations will occur in isotonic buffers (24Verkleji A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 43-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and provided a mechanism for reconstitution of the γ-carboxylation system. The cation attracts negative phospholipids present in different detergent micelles resulting in a merger of these lipid-protein detergent micelles to form lipid aggregates (24Verkleji A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 43-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) where proteins are inserted as in a lipid bilayer (25Lenaz G. Fleisher S. Hatefi Y. MacLennan D.H. Tzagoloff A. The Molecular Biology of Membranes. Plenum Press, New York1977: 137-162Google Scholar). Based on the data shown in Fig. 1, 10 mmMnCl2 was used to trigger reconstitution of the γ-carboxylation system enzyme activities. In this system no nonenzymic reduction of vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide took place at pH 7.6, and there was no hydroxy-vitamin K1 formation (26Fasco M.J. Preusch P.C. Hildebrandt E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4372-4380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Optimal VKOR supported γ-carboxylase activity was also measured at this pH. Having established a reconstitution test system, the next objective was to use the system to identify essential components of the γ-carboxylation system. Separation of components belonging to the system was achieved by extracting microsomes with buffer A. Reassembly of the extract and the extracted microsomes could then be tested in the reconstitution system. Fig. 2 Ashows the effect of buffer A extraction on vitamin K-dependent enzyme activities remaining in the extracted microsomes when various concentrations of CHAPS were present in the buffer. γ-Carboxylase activity (circles) increased 11-fold by extracting microsomes with CHAPS above its critical micelle concentration of 0.5%. High concentrations of CHAPS (1.5%) resulted in loss of γ-carboxylase activity, suggesting that the γ-carboxylase was either inactivated or extracted by these detergent concentrations. On the other hand, detergent extraction resulted in a decrease in VKOR, and VKOR supported γ-carboxylase activities by 50 and 80%, respectively (1.0% CHAPS, see Fig. 2 A). This suggested that a significant portion of the VKOR enzyme pool in microsomes had been removed from the microsomal vesicles or inactivated by the detergent extraction. Therefore the distribution of VKOR and γ-carboxylase activities in the detergent extract and the remaining pellets at each detergent concentration was examined. As shown in Fig.2 B, 50% of VKOR in microsomes was brought into solution by detergent extraction. A kinetic analysis of VKOR in the extract and pellet showed that the enzymes had the same K m values (2.5 μm). Both enzymes were also equally sensitive to inhibition by warfarin and the thiol blockerN-ethylmaleimide, which suggests that the same VKOR enzyme is present in the extract and the remaining membrane fragments (pellet). In contrast, the γ-carboxylase was not solubilized by concentrations of CHAPS in buffer A ranging from 0 to 1.5% (Fig.2 C). As summarized in Table I, combining extracted microsomes with the soluble fraction in the presence of Mn2+ to induce lipid aggregation restored all vitamin K-dependent enzyme activities to control levels found in microsomes resuspended in buffer A.Table IReconstitution of γ-carboxylase activityFractionsγ-Carboxylase activityVKOR activityK1H2 supportedVKOR supporteddpm/ml × 10 −2nmol/mlResuspended microsomes1,013 ± 50982 ± 404.80 ± 0.20Extracted microsomes + buffer A9,112 ± 360372 ± 162.26 ± 0.09Extracted microsomes + detergent extract1,115 ± 44987 ± 374.75 ± 0.18Extracted microsomes + fraction A (P-100)9,240 ± 382385 ± 212.30 ± 0.12Extracted microsomes + fraction B (P-100)1,230 ± 521,005 ± 424.81 ± 0.19Microsomes extracted with buffer A were resuspended in the various fractions described in the table for reconstitution of γ-carboxylase activity in the presence of 10 mm MnCl2 (see “Experimental Procedures”).

K1H2− and VKOR-supported carboxylase activities represent γ-carboxylation triggered with chemically reduced vitamin K1H2 and the reduced vitamin produced by VKOR, respectively. The numbers are the average of triplicate incubations ± S.D. To understand the 11-fold increase in γ-carboxylase activity measured in detergent-extracted microsomes (Fig. 1), the possibility that inhibitory components of the γ-carboxylase were present in microsomes was investigated. To determine if these components were metals or other low molecular weight compounds present in microsomes, the buffer A extract was subjected to gel-filtration on a column of Bio-Gel P-100 in buffer A. The void volume fraction A(P-100) and the retained fraction B(P-100) were recombined, respectively, with the buffer A-extracted microsomes for determination of vitamin K-dependent enzyme activities. When the extracted microsomes were combined with fraction A(P-100), the γ-carboxylase activity was the same as extracted microsomes resuspended in buffer A (see Table I). Combination of extracted microsomes with fraction B(P-100) showed that the inhibitory components were present in the retained fraction (see Table I). When metals were removed from fraction B(P-100) by passing the fraction over a metal chelating column of Sepharose-iminodiacetic acid prior to combining it with extracted microsomes, a significant recovery of γ-carboxylase activity was observed (67%). Thus, endogenous metals accounted for some of the γ-carboxylase inhibitory component in microsomes. Surprisingly, the main protein containing fraction A(P-100) from the Bio-Gel P-100 column did not restore VKOR and VKOR supported γ-carboxylase activities (Table I), while the retained fraction B(P-100) did (Table I). The component(s) in fraction B(P-100) which stimulated VKOR and VKOR-supported γ-carboxylase activities was inactivated by boiling and proteinase K treatment, and could be concentrated on a YM-10 filter. These qualitative tests indicate that the active component(s) is a protein. To further purify the protein which reconstituted VKOR activity, fraction B(P-100) was applied to a cellulose DE52 anion exchanger equilibrated in buffer A. As shown in Fig.3, the protein was not retained by the ion exchanger. SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel of proteins in the unretained fraction from the column (fraction A, Fig. 3) is shown in lane A on the inset in Fig. 3. Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands with apparent molecular masses 74, 66, 32, and 29 kDa were seen. To further purify the protein of interest, we subjected each Coomassie-stained band to N-terminal protein sequencing to gain information about the proteins which could be helpful in deciding the next purification step. The most useful information which resulted from these analyses was the finding of a sequence (PGSDVLHYFQDREK) in the 32-kDa band which, in 14 overlaps, were 57.1% identical to the YC2 subunit of the α-class of GST enzymes (27Hayes J.D.

These enzymes are found normally in cytosol as dimeric proteins of variable subunit composition (27Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 446-800Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The indication of a GST enzyme in the void (fraction A) from the cellulose DE52 column determined the next purification step. The void fraction was applied to an agarose-GSH affinity column. To avoid thiol reactions between proteins and the GSH-affinity ligand, an affinity resin was used where GSH was attached to the matrix via its thiol group. The affinity column retained all enzymes expressing GST activity and the GSTs could be eluted with 100 mm GSH in buffer A (Fig. 4 A,triangles). The ability of the enzymes in the retained fraction to restore VKOR supported γ-carboxylase activity is also shown in Fig. 4 A (squares). As expected, the VKOR supported γ-carboxylase activity was inhibited by warfarin, but surprisingly, the GST activity in the retained fraction was also found to be inhibited by the drug (see the bar graph in Fig. 4 A). An I50 value of 0.7 mm warfarin was estimated for warfarin inhibition of the purified GST protein(s) in a test system where CDNB and GSH are present at 1 mm. As shown in Fig.4 B, the affinity-purified GST enzyme(s) in the retained fraction contained subunits with apparent molecular masses of 32 and 29 kDa. Since the 32- and 29-kDa proteins were purified from fraction B(P-100), which was the protein fraction retained by the Bio-Gel P-100 column, the unretained fraction A from the Bio-Gel P-100 column was also tested for GST activity. Actually more than 90% of the total GST activity was recovered in the void fraction A(P-100), but this activity was not inhibited by warfarin (data not shown). Thus, the Bio-Gel P-100 column had separated the warfarin-sensitive GST enzymes from the overall pool of the GSTs present in the buffer A extract of microsomes. Based on its ability to reconstitute VKOR-supported γ-carboxylase activity, we estimated that the GST enzyme(s) was purified 6,213-fold from the detergent extract (Table II). The greatest single purification step was the Bio-Gel P-100 column (2,091-fold). For unknown reasons the Bio-Gel resin retained the warfarin-sensitive GST enzyme(s) more than the majority of the other proteins present in the buffer A extract.Table IIPurification of VKOR reconstituting proteinFractionVolumeProteinVKOR-supported γ-carboxylase activityFold purificationmlμgunits/mgn-foldBuffer A extract1878,0000.231Fraction B (P-100)25524812,091Void fraction DE5228281,0004,378Agarose-GSH15101,4296,213Buffer A extracted microsomes (from 1 ml) were resuspended in 1 ml of the various fractions shown in the table for estimation of VKOR supported γ-carboxylase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab Buffer A extracted microsomes (from 1 ml) were resuspended in 1 ml of the various fractions shown in the table for estimation of VKOR supported γ-carboxylase activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). One unit of γ-carboxylase activity is defined as 1,000 dpm of radioactivity incorporated into the γ-carboxylase peptide substrate. The presence of a dimeric GST enzyme(s) in the buffer A extract of microsomes suggests that these GSTs may have resulted from cytosolic contamination of the microsomal preparations. This conclusion is supported by the data in Fig. 5, which shows that 70% of the GST activity in microsomes was found in the supernatant after resuspending the microsomes in buffer A without detergent (circle on the y axis at zero detergent concentration). In contrast, release of VKOR from the ER membrane required detergent (squares). The detergent concentrations used were also shown to release the two ER integral membrane proteins mGST and mEH, which are both anchored to the membrane by one transmembrane domain (28Friedberg T. Lollmann B. Becker R. Holler Oesch F. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 967-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Anderson C. Weinander R. Lundqvist G. DePierre J.W. Morgenstern R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1240: 298-304Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This shows that some of the VKOR protein components are firmly attached to the ER membrane. As shown in Fig.5 A, the VKOR activity profile (squares) in the detergent extracts follows the activity profile of mEH (triangles). This is of interest, because previous data, obtained from experiments with monospecific antibodies against mEH (19Wallin R. Guenthner T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), have shown that mEH participates in vitamin K12,3-epoxide reduction as a component of the VKOR enzyme complex (19Wallin R.

In all species, the open reading frame of the cDNA contains 10 TGA codons, each of which might encode a selenocysteine residue (6Hill K.E. Lloyd R.S. Yang J.-G. Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

The amino acid composition of SeP is almost identical to that suggested by the cDNA sequence, although only 7–8 of the 10 predicted selenocysteine residues were detected by amino acid analysis (10Read R. Bellew T. Yang J.-G. Hill K.E. Palmer I.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17899-17905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Association of the protein with cell membranes has been described (11Wilson D.S. Tappel A.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1993; 51: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In bovine brain, the expression of a selenoprotein P-like protein with 12 selenocysteine residues has been demonstrated recently at the mRNA and protein levels (12Saijoh K. Saito N. Lee M.J. Fujii M. Kobayashi T. Sumino K. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although SeP transcripts are found in nearly all tissues examined (13Burk R.F. Hill K.E. J.

Fleischmann R.D. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 3-174PubMed Google Scholar), the liver is the main source for circulating SeP in the plasma (13Burk R.F. Hill K.E. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the rat, about two-thirds of the plasma selenium are contained in SeP (13Burk R.F. Hill K.E. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); therefore, a role in selenium storage and distribution has been discussed (16Motsenbocker M.A. Tappel A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 709: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, former in vivo studies revealed a preferential synthesis of SeP compared with the cytosolic glutathione peroxidase under selenium-deficient conditions (17Hill K.E. Lyons P.R. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Some observations suggest a selenium storage function for cytosolic glutathione peroxidase rather than for SeP (17Hill K.E. Lyons P.R. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Gross M. Oertel M. Köhrle J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Sunde R.A. Burk R.F. Selenium in Biology and Human Health. Springer Verlag, New York1994: 45-47Crossref Google Scholar). Studies in the rat model revealed a protective effect of SeP against liver injury caused by diquat or paraquat. Therefore, SeP might serve as an antioxidant in the extracellular space (20Burk R.F. Lawrence R.A. Lane J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 1024-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 21Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Awad J.A. Morrow J.D. Kato T. Cockell K.A. Lyons P.R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar). To get more information about the biological function and regulation of SeP gene expression, we isolated a genomic clone from a human placenta library and cloned and sequenced a 1.8-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the human SeP gene. In transient transfection experiments of cultured hepatocarcinoma and colon carcinoma cells, the activity of this proximal promoter region and several deletion constructs was analyzed using chimeric luciferase reporters. We also identified the major start site of transcription at position −70 and an interferon γ (IFNγ)-responsive element at nucleotides −742 to −732. As secretion of liver proteins is affected by acute phase reaction (22Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 74-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), the effect of different cytokines on SeP promoter activity was investigated; IFNγ as well as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 1β (IL1β) decreased promoter activity in transfected HepG2 cells, suggesting a repression of SeP expression during acute phase reaction. A human placenta genomic library in the Lambda FixII-vector (Stratagene) was screened with a 1200-bp cDNA probe encoding the 5′ part of the rat 16C1 SeP clone (kindly provided by Dr. K. Hill, Nashville, TN) according to a protocol provided by the manufacturer. A total of 4 × 106 plaques were screened, yielding one positive clone. Lambda Fix phage DNA was isolated and digested with EcoRI, XbaI, andPstI (Fig. 1). One 3.8-kbEcoRI, four XbaI (3, 2.1, 1.7, and 1.4 kb), and two PstI fragments (5.5 and 4.2 kb) were subcloned into the pBluescript SKII+ vector (Stratagene). Partial sequencing of theXbaI clones revealed that the 3-kb and the 2.1-kb fragments contained sequences of the 5′ part of the selenoprotein P coding region. The EcoRI and the 5.5-kb PstI clone were mapped to the 5′-untranslated region by Southern blot with oligonucleotide ID4 (5′-ACAACCACTCCAACGGGCC-3′, comprising the base pairs −33 to −14 with respect to the ATG codon). Oligonucleotide primers for DNA sequencing reactions were purchased from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Sequencing reactions were performed with T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel or, for long range sequence reading, after separation on a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel directly blotted onto a nylon membrane by using the GATC 1500-System Long Run DNA Sequencer (MWG-Biotech, Munich, Germany) according to the supplier's protocol. The nucleotide sequences of both strands were determined. DNA sequence analysis was performed using DNASIS for Windows software. For sequence comparison, we used the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis software package. The sequence was scanned through the non-redundant data bases GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, and PDB. The 5′-end of the SeP mRNA was cloned after rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) as modified by Edwards et al. (23Edwards J.B.D.M. Delort J. Mallet J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) using the 5′-Amplifinder RACE kit from CLONTECH. Poly(A)+ RNA for 5′-RACE was prepared from HepG2 cells with the Dynabead mRNA direct kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). For cDNA preparation, 2 μg of HepG2 poly(A)+ RNA were incubated with primer ID3 (5′-CCTAGGAGCCAACTCTGAAT-3′), annealing at nucleotides 894 to 875 of the SeP open reading frame, and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for 30 min at 52 °C. After ligation of an “anchor” to the cDNA according to the manufacturer's protocol, PCR was carried out with the primer ID9 (5′-GGCCACATCTATCATATATGAGGA-3′), corresponding to nucleotides 423 to 399 of the open reading frame of the human SeP. Amplification products were polished with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, phosphorylated, and cloned into the SmaI restriction site of pBluescript SKII for nucleotide sequence determination. 15 ng of 32P-labeled primer ID10 (5′-ACAGGTATCAGCTGGCTTGAAGAAG-3′, corresponding to base pairs 184 to 160 of the SeP cDNA) were annealed to 2 μg of HepG2 poly(A)+ RNA for 10 min at 70 °C. The primer was extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) in a total volume of 20 μl containing 4 μl of 5-fold reaction buffer, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 0.5 units/ml RNasin (Promega) for 60 min at 42 °C. The products were subjected to ribonuclease I digestion (0.8 μg/ml, Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for 20 min at 37 °C, extracted with phenol/CHCl3, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in 4 μl of H2O. 2 μl of formamide containing stop buffer were added before separation on a 6% sequencing gel. The pGL2-basic vector, which contains a luciferase reporter gene for analysis of promoter activity of cloned fragments located immediately downstream of a polylinker, was obtained from Promega. The 1.8-kb promoter fragment of the 5.5-kb PstI subclone was amplified by PCR using the T7 promoter primer (annealing to the pBSSKII+ plasmid) and a modified ID4 primer with an additionalBglII restriction site (5′-TGCTGCAGATCTGACAACCACTCCAACGGGCC-3′). The PCR fragments were treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified from a 1% agarose gel using the Nucleotrap kit from Macherey & Nagel (Düren, Germany). Subsequently, the fragments were cleaved with KpnI andBglII and cloned into pGL2. Identity of isolated clones were confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing. One clone (pBK15), which contained the entire 1.8-kb promoter fragment and 50 bp of the pBluescript vector, was chosen for further studies. The reporter gene plasmids pGL2control and pCATcontrol (both obtained from Promega), used as controls, contain a luciferase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene downstream of a SV40 promoter. In the plasmid pGLh5′DIpr the promoter and enhancer regions of the human type I iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase (5′DI) are fused to the luciferase reporter gene (24Jakobs T. Schmutzler C. Meissner J. Köhrle J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Based on the nucleotide sequence of clone pBK15, several restriction enzyme sites were found suitable for the construction of a set of deletion clones. Fig. 2 shows the deletion constructs. pBK15 was partially digested for 1 h with StuI, purified from a 1% agarose gel as described above, and religated, resulting in the plasmid pStu3. For the construction of ΔStuI, pStu3 was recut with StuI and withSmaI. Deletion of a 517-bp fragment of BK15 resulted in the plasmid pΔNsi, which by restriction with SmaI andNsiI was modified to ΔNsi/Sma. By restriction of BK15 withSmaI and PvuII (ΔSma/Pvu), the 50-bp pBluescript fragment and 47 bp of the very 5′-end of the promoter sequence were eliminated (not shown). For the construction of Nsi/Stu, the Nsi fragment of pBK15 was cloned into the PstI site of pBluescript SKII. A fragment containing a 123-bp Nsi/Stu SeP promoter fragment and 20 bp of pBluescript was isolated byStuI/HindIII digestion. The fragment was cloned into the SmaI and HindIII sites of pGL2. To eliminate the retroviral LTR at the 5′-end of the cloned SeP promoter, the entire insert of BK15 was isolated bySmaI/BglII digestion. The insert was recut withBstEII for 2 h at 60 °C. After purification, the insert and the BglII/SmaI cut vector were ligated. Afterward, the BstEII site of the insert was filled in by Klenow fragment treatment, and the resulting construct (ΔBstE/Sma) was ligated again. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. HepG2 and Caco2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The human hepatocarcinoma line HepG2 (ATCC, HB 8065) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml l-glutamine; the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco2 (ATCC, HTB37) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.4 mm Hepes, 1 mg/mll-glutamine. All cells were cultured in 75-mm2plastic flasks and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For transfection, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected at 50–70% confluence. Plasmids for transfection were prepared and purified using a Midi prep kit purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) according to the supplier's protocol. For control of transfection efficiency, a plasmid containing the gene for bacterial β-galactosidase under the control of the constitutive SV40 promoter (pSV-β-galactosidase, Promega) was cotransfected in each experiment. Liposome-mediated transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the method of Felgneret al. (25Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4388) Google Scholar). 10 μl of LipofectAMINE and 1 μg of BK15 plasmid plus 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase were diluted in 100 μl of serum-free medium, respectively. The solutions were combined and incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature, 800 μl of serum-free medium were added, and the solution was then carefully dripped onto the cells, which had been washed twice with serum-free medium. Caco2 cells were incubated for 6 h before the transfection solution was removed and replaced by serum-containing medium. After an incubation period of 20 h, the cells were harvested. HepG2 cells were incubated for 20 h with the transfection solution. Then the transfection solution was exchanged for serum-free medium. Cells were incubated for 20 h with this medium alone or with medium containing TNFα (50 ng/ml), IL1β (60 ng/ml), interleukin 6 (IL-6, 100 units/ml), or IFNγ (100 ng/ml) (obtained from PBH, Hannover, Germany). Cells were harvested in 180 μl of 1 × reporter lysis buffer (Promega). 20 μl of the cell lysate were used for luciferase measurement, and 50 μl (Caco2) or 100 μl (HepG2) were applied for determination of β-galactosidase activity. Background luciferase expression from the vector was determined by transfection of the empty pGL2-basic plasmid. Analysis of luciferase activity was performed using the reporter gene assay provided by Promega in a microplate luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in a Uvicord III photometer (Pharmacia) according to a protocol provided by Promega. For control of transfection efficiency the obtained luciferase values were divided by the β-galactosidase activities. When appropriate, data were analyzed by analysis of variance. When the main effect was significant, theU test of Mann and Whitney was applied as a post hoc test to determine individual differences between means. The interaction of HepG2 nuclear proteins with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the nucleotides −745 to −726, comprising a putative interferon-γ activation (GAS) site of the consensus sequence TTCNNNGAA (26Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar) and flanking bases, was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. HepG2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in a culture medium with 10% FCS. At approximately 80% confluence, the culture medium was replaced by serum-free medium containing 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml IFNγ for 10 min, 25 ng/ml for 5 and 15 min, or 50 ng/ml for 20 to 60 min, respectively. Afterward, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a modified protocol of Grandison et al. (27Grandison L. Nolan G.P. Pfaff D.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 28Schreiber E. Mattias P. Mueller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Nuclear cell extracts (15 μg of protein) were incubated in a reaction buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), and approximately 50 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (15,000–20,000 cpm) in a volume of 15 μl for 30 min at ambient temperature. The oligonucleotides GASID1 (5′-GGTCTTCCAGGAAGTACGAC-3′) and its complementary GASID2 were annealed and end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). For competition experiments, a 10-, 50-, and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled GASID1/2 was added to the reaction mixture before the addition of reaction buffer. Additional competition experiments were carried out with a related oligonucleotide from the human aromatase promoter (29Zhao Y. Nichols J.E. Bulun S.E. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16449-16457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (5′-GGTGTTTCCTGTGAAAGTTC-3′) as described above. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. To map the transcription initiation site of SeP, the 5′-end of the mRNA from HepG2 cells was cloned using a modified RACE protocol. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2, which showed high SeP expression in Northern blot experiments (14Dreher I. Schmutzler C. Jakob F. Köhrle J. J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 1997; 11: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Specifically primed cDNA was prepared with an oligonucleotide annealing to nucleotides 894 to 875 of the open reading frame of the SeP mRNA. PCR amplification of the 5′-mRNA end was carried out with a nested oligonucleotide corresponding to the nucleotides 423 to 399 of the coding region. A single clear band of about 500 bp in length was demonstrated by gel electrophoretic analysis as shown in Fig.3 A. The band was eluted from the gel and subcloned into pBluescript vector (Fig. 3 B), and the nucleotide sequence of three clones was determined, which was the same for all clones. 459 bp were identical to the known SeP sequence. The remaining DNA stretch started with a G corresponding to position −70 with respect to the ATG translation start codon. The position of the transcription start site was also determined by primer extension analysis using primer ID10 (184 to 160) and HepG2 mRNA. To determine whether the length of the primer extension product (Fig.3 C, lane 1) fits to the transcriptional start site mapped by RACE, a sequencing reaction with the same primer and one of the RACE clones was run in parallel (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2–5). To achieve appropriate exposure times, the sequencing reaction was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP. As sequencing with this isotope results in poorer resolution, the autoradiogram was compared with a [35S]dATPαS-sequencing reaction. Apart from a strong band supporting the finding that transcription initiation occurs at G (−70), an additional faint band was visible, which corresponds to C (−60). Screening of a human genomic library with a rat SeP clone resulted in the isolation of a single clone containing about 18 kb of inserted DNA. Partial sequencing of two XbaI subclones showed nucleotide sequence identity with the 5′ part of the published human SeP cDNA sequence and at least two exon-intron boundaries, one between bp −13 and −14 upstream of the ATG codon and the other one between bp 534 and 535 of the coding region. Sequence information about known exon-intron boundaries is given in Fig. 1 and Fig.4. The exon-intron boundaries mapped to date agree with the GT-AG rule for splice sites. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 3.8-kb EcoRI subclone and a 5.5-kb PstI clone demonstrated that the clones contained 620 bp and 1800 bp, respectively, of the 5′-flanking region of the SeP gene. Location of the fragments with respect to the cloned 5′-end of SeP is shown in Fig. 1. Based on sequence inspection, putative binding sites for several transcription factors were found as indicated in Fig.4 A. A TATA box was present at position −101 to −95, and a CAAT box was present at position −196 to −193. GC boxes (SP1 sites) characteristic for the promoters of housekeeping genes were found between −338 and −320, and two putative AP1 binding sites were identified at −408 to −402 and at −290 to −284. At nucleotides −742 to −732, the sequence CTTCCAGGAAG was found, which corresponds to elements (GAS elements) known for DNA binding of IFNγ-responsive transcription factors of the signal transducer and activator of transcription family (25Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4388) Google Scholar). Comparison of the nucleic acid sequence with entries in non-redundant data bases revealed sequence identity in 620 bp of human SeP promoter sequence submitted by Yasui et al. (30Yasui Y. Hasada K. Yang J.G. Koiwai O. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). At bp −429 to −445, we found a stretch of 17 T nucleotides where Yasui had reported 16 Ts. A DNA stretch of the very 5′-end (bp −1808 to −1367) of the DNA fragment revealed sequence homology (84%) to an LTR of human endogenous viral DNA (31Emi M. Horii A. Tomita N. Nishide T. Ogawa M. Mori T. Matsubara K. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 62: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To assess basal promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of the SeP gene, the full-length fragment (BK15) was transfected into HepG2 and Caco2 cells. In both cell lines, the luciferase activity of the promoter construct was 100–1000 times higher than background activity, defined as luciferase activity of the promoterless pGL2 plasmid. To identify sequences within the 5′-flanking region of the SeP gene, important for maximal basal promoter activity, several deletion constructs (Fig. 2) were transfected into HepG2 and Caco2 cells. Luciferase activities of the deletion constructs, expressed as percent of the values of the full-length construct BK15, are shown in Fig.2 C. The Stu3 construct (Δ −1008 to −353) revealed no change in luciferase activity compared with the full-length construct in Caco2 and a slight, but not significant increase in HepG2 cells, whereas ΔStu (Δ −1800 to −353) reached only 45% in HepG2 and 84% in Caco2 cells, respectively. Elimination of the sequence between −747 and −230 (ΔNsi) resulted in luciferase activity of only 20% of BK15 in HepG2 cells and 52% in Caco2 cells, whereas removal of the complete 5′ region upstream of nucleotide −230 (ΔNsi/Sma) led to a slight but significant increase in promoter activity to 45% (HepG2,p < 0.001) and 75% (Caco2, p < 0.005) relative to control BK15 expression. By cloning a 123-bp Nsi/Stu fragment into the pGL2 plasmid (Nsi/Stu), 3% (HepG2) and 9% (Caco2) of the full-length construct's activity was achieved. However, compared with the promoterless pGL2, luciferase activity of Nsi/Stu was increased up to 40 times. In contrast, transfection of HepG2 cells with a 105-bp fragment derived from the human 5′DI promoter (24Jakobs T. Schmutzler C. Meissner J. Köhrle J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which constitutes the basal promoter of 5′DI, led only to an increase of luciferase activity by a factor of 3 to 4 (data not shown). This ensures that the Nsi/Stu region of the SeP promoter containing the SP1 and one AP1 site confers marked activation to the luciferase reporter construct. Elimination of the remaining stretch of pBluescript in BK15 by SmaI/PvuII digestion had no effect on promoter efficiency (data not shown). Removal of the retroviral LTR (ΔBstE/Sma) did not reduce SeP promoter activity. In contrast, a significant (p < 0.005) increase to 140% was obtained in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of IFNγ before nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with an oligonucleotide comprising the GAS element described in Fig.4 A. The oligonucleotide used for the electrophoretic mobility shifts also contains the flanking bases from the SeP promoter. In the IFNγ-treated probes, a specific band appeared whose intensity correlated with increasing IFNγ concentrations (Fig.5 A, lanes 2–4). Specificity was ensured as incubation with an excess of unlabeled probe led to the dose-dependent disappearance of the slower migrating band (lanes 7–9). In contrast, a nonspecific band present in every lane was not competed by excess of unlabeled probe. Additional competition experiments with a related oligonucleotide derived from the aromatase promoter (29Zhao Y. Nichols J.E. Bulun S.E. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16449-16457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) did not influence IFNγ-dependent protein binding to the GASID1/2 oligonucleotide (lanes 10–12). The time course of protein-DNA interaction is shown in lanes 5 and 6and Fig. 5 B. While after 5 min no retarded band appeared, it was fully present after 15 min of IFNγ treatment, persisting for at least 60 min. HepG2 cells were treated with cytokines for 20 h after transfection of the 1.8-kb SeP promoter construct, and luciferase activities were determined as shown in TableI. IL-6 had no significant effect on promoter activity, whereas IL1β, IFNγ, and TNFα revealed a significant repression of luciferase activity (46, 40, and 55% of control, respectively). Expression of β-galactosidase was also affected by cytokine treatment (Table I). Therefore, division of the luciferase activities by β-galactosidase values altered the relative leve"

When expressed under the control of the T7 promoter in Escherichia coli, several of the chimeric enzymes were inactive.

The purified mBE II-I BspHI exhibited higher activity than wild-type mBE I and mBE II when assayed by the phosphorylase a stimulation assay. mBE II-IBspHI had substrate specificity (preference for amylose rather than amylopectin) and catalytic capacity similar to mBE I, despite the fact that only the carboxyl terminus was from mBE I, suggesting that the carboxyl terminus may be involved in determining substrate specificity and catalytic capacity. In chain transfer experiments, mBE II-I BspHI transferred more short chains (with a degree of polymerization of around 6) in a fashion similar to mBE II. In contrast, mBE I-II HindIII transferred more long chains (with a degree of polymerization of around 11–12), similar to mBE I, suggesting that the amino terminus of mBEs may play a role in the size of oligosaccharide chain transferred. This study challenges the notion that the catalytic centers for branching enzymes are exclusively located in the central portion of the enzyme; it suggests instead that the amino and carboxyl termini may also be involved in determining substrate preference, catalytic capacity, and chain length transfer.

Homology in the primary structures between glycogen branching enzyme and amylolytic enzymes was first reported by Romeo et al.(16Romeo T. Kumar A. Preiss J. Gene. 1988; 70: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Baba et al. (8Baba T. Kimura K. Mizuno K. Etoh H. Ishida Y. Shida O. Arai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) established that BEs contain the four highly conserved regions in the central portion of the enzyme that are present in α-amylases, pullulanase, isoamylase, and cyclodextrin glucanotransferases. Neopullulanase catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as well as transglycosylation to form α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucosidic linkages (17Kuriki T. Okada S. Imanaka T. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18447-18452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of several replacements of the amino residues that constitute the active center of neopullulanase indicated that one active center of the enzyme participated in all four reactions described above (19Kuriki T. Takata H. Okada S. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6147-6152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that not only were the structures of BE, α-amylase, pullulanase/isoamylase, and cyclodextrin glucanotransferase similar but also that they shared common catalytic mechanisms (18Takata H.

It is currently considered that four of the β-strands (i.e. the four highly conserved regions in the central portion of the enzymes) make up the catalytic center (23Jespersen H.M. MacGregor E.A. Henrissat B. Sierks M. Svensson B. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Some of the amino acids found to be essential for catalytic activity of the α-amylase family enzymes and also present in the four conserved regions of the maize endosperm branching enzymes were mutated via site-directed mutagenesis in mBE II and were found to be important for branching enzyme activity (32Cao H. Preiss J. J. Prot. Chem. 1996; 15: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Kuriki T. Guan H. Sivak M. Preiss J. J. Prot. Chem. 1996; 15: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the conserved four active site regions found in the α-amylase family enzymes also play a role in branching enzyme catalysis. The amino acid sequence of mBE I and mBE II has an identity of 58% (Fig. 1). The identity is higher (67%) in the center portion of the enzymes, which contains several highly conserved regions (regions 1–4), as previously mentioned (8Baba T. Kimura K. Mizuno K. Etoh H. Ishida Y. Shida O. Arai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 15Guan H.P. Baba T. Preiss J. Cell. Mol.

When amino acid residues with similar functional side chains are taken into consideration, the two enzymes are 75% similar for the total amino acid sequence and 94% similar for the center portion. In contrast, the amino acid sequences and the numbers of amino acid residues are quite different for the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sides of the center portion (Figs. 1 and2).Figure 2Schematic diagram representing wild-type mBE I and mBE II, indicating amino and carboxyl termini and the four conserved regions (R1–R4) in the central portion and the chimeric enzymes constructed from maize endosperm BE I and II.

In this paper, we report on the construction and characterization of chimeric enzymes of mBE I and mBE II. LB medium (pH 7), consisting of 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl per liter, was used for culture of E. coli. 2 × YT broth (pH 7), consisting of 16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl per liter, was used for the preparation of phage DNA.

E. coli BL21(DE3) (hsdS gal(λc Its 857ind1Sam 7nin 5lac UV5-T7 gene1) (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used to express the gene for wild-type or chimeric BE under control of the T7 promoter (14Guan H.P.

Plasmids pET-23d-MBE I (Apr encoding the gene for mature mBE I) and pET-23d-mBE II (Aprencoding the gene for mature mBE II) were described previously (14Guan H.P. Baba T. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,15Guan H.P. Baba T. Preiss J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar). M13mp19 was used for the preparation of single-stranded DNA (34Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3416) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (Sculptor in vitromutagenesis system, Amersham Corp., Amersham, UK) was used for the creation of a new restriction site by the introduction of a silent mutations in the mBE I and II genes. Oligonucleotides were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer (Macro-molecular Facility, Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University, MI). The mutation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain-terminating method (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar); the sequence reaction was started from the M13 linker region with the universal primer or primed by internal annealing of a 17-mer synthetic oligonucleotide. To introduce a BspHI site into the mBE I gene by site-directed mutagenesis (silent mutation), the 1156-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment from pET-23d-mBE I was cloned into theEcoRI-HindIII sites of phage M13mp19 multiple-cloning sites. Single-stranded DNA was prepared from the phage and used as template for the site-directed mutagenesis reaction. Sequence analysis of the 1156-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment verified that the desired nucleotide had been changed and that no second-site mutations were present. After preparation of the replicative form of the phage DNA, the 1156-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment of pET-23d-mBE I was exchanged for the mutant fragment, resulting in the construction of pET-23d-mBE I (BspHI). The following additional steps were used to avoid methylation of adenine residues by DNA adenine methylase in the recognition sequence 5′-G*ATC-3′ (asterisk indicates methylated form) when the BspHI site was used for the construction of the chimeric gene. pET-23d-mBE I (BspHI) was constructed using E. coli TG-1 (rk− mk−) as a host. E. coli DH5 (rk− mk+) was transformed with pET-23d-mBE I (BspHI) for plasmid preparation from E. coli DH5. The plasmids obtained were then used for transformation of E. coli JM110 (damrk+ mk+). Because BspHI sites on the plasmid DNAs prepared from E. coli JM110 were not affected by DNA adenine methylase, pET-23d-mBE I (BspHI) prepared from E. coli JM110 was used for construction of the chimeric gene at the BspHI site. For the construction of the mBE II-I BspHI gene, the 687-base pair BspHI-carboxyl-terminal fragment of pET-23d-mBE II was exchanged for the 852-base pairBspHI-carboxyl-terminal fragment of pET-23d-mBE I (BspHI). Thus, pET-23d-mBE II-IBspHI, encoding the mBE II-I BspHI gene, was constructed (Fig. 2). The structure of the plasmid was confirmed by restriction endonuclease mapping. Several other chimeric enzymes, mBE I-II NcoI, mBE II-INcoI, mBE I-II HindIII, mBE II-IHindIII, mBE I-II BspHI, mBE I-II-I, and mBE II-I-II, were also constructed (Fig. 2). To construct these other chimeric enzymes, two silent mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to produce HindIII and NcoI endonuclease restriction sites in mBE I and II, respectively. The procedures used were similar to those described previously. E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying a recombinant plasmid encoding the gene for wild-type BE I, wild-type BE II, or chimeric BEs was grown overnight in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The preculture was then diluted 1:20 (v/v) in fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the cells grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 nm = 0.6). At this point, expression of the BE gene was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm), and were cultures transferred to 25 °C for 12 h. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), and the pellet was resuspended and lysed by sonication in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm EDTA and 5 mmdithiothreitol. The lysed suspension was then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant (cell extract) was used as crude enzyme for preliminary assay of BEs. Purification of wild-type BEs and the chimeric enzymes mBE II-IBspHI and mBE I-II HindIII was carried out according to Guan et al. (14Guan H.P. Baba T. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Guan H.P. Baba T. Preiss J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that mBE I-II HindIII was expressed in AC71 (glgB −), a glycogen BE-deficient strain ofE. coli (3Guan H.P. Kuriki T. Sivak M. Preiss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). BE activity was measured by three different assays as described by Guan and Preiss (36Guan H.P. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The phosphorylase a stimulation assay is based on the stimulation by BE of the synthesis of α-d-glucan from α-d-Glc-1-P catalyzed by rabbit phosphorylase a (37Hawker J.S. Ozbun J.L. Ozaki H. Greenberg E. Preiss J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 160: 530-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 200 μl, 100 mm citrate (pH 7), 10 mm AMP, 0.4 mg phosphorylase a, and 50 mmd-[14C]-Glc-1-P (50 dpm·nmol−1). The reaction was initiated by the addition of an appropriate amount of enzyme. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol of Glc incorporated into α-d-glucan per min at 30 °C. The branching linkage assay determines the number of branching linkages introduced by BE into the substrate, reduced amylose (38Takeda Y. Guan H.P. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 240: 253-263Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Substrates were prepared by the reduction of enzymatically synthesized amylose (AS-320, AS-110, and AS-70, Nakano Vinegar Co., Aichi, Japan; these amylose varieties had average degrees of polymerization of 1815, 722, and 438, respectively) as described by Takeda et al. (38Takeda Y. Guan H.P. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 240: 253-263Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 100 μl, 25 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.5) and an appropriate amount of substrate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an appropriate amount of enzyme. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol of branching linkages formed per min at 30 °C. The iodine stain assay is based on monitoring the decrease in absorbance of the glucan-iodine complex resulting from the branching of the substrate, amylose or amylopectin (potato type III and corn, respectively; Sigma) (4Boyer C.D. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 61: 321-334Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Guan H.P. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained, in a final volume of 200 μl, 50 mm citrate (pH 7) and 0.1 mg of substrate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of an appropriate amount of enzyme. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the decrease in absorbance of 1.0 per min at 30 °C. Protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay reagent (39Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed on 8% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Western blotting (immunoblotting) was carried out according to the method of Burnette (41Burnette W.W. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). The primary rabbit antibodies, anti-mBE I and anti-mBE II, were diluted 1:200 and 1:2000, respectively, in 25 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.2) containing 150 mmNaCl and 3% gelatin. The antigen-antibody complex was detected using anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (United States Biochemicals; diluted 1:10,000) with a chromogenic substrate (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH). Molecular weights were determined using Perfect Protein Western markers (Novagen) as standards (M r 15,000, 25,000, 35,000, 50,000, 75,000, 100,000 and 150,000). Reduced amylose (1 mg of AS-320; degree of polymerization, 1815) was incubated in 25 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.5 (200 μl) at 30 °C with BE (1.5 milliunits of mBE I, mBE II, mBE II-I BspHI, and mBE I-II HindIII by assay b). After 80, 160, and 320 min, the reaction was terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 2 min, and M acetate buffer (pH 3.5, 20 μl) and isoamylase (5 μl of 590 units·ml−1) were added after the solution had cooled to room temperature. After 1 h of incubation at 45 °C, the solution was heated in a boiling water bath for 2 min. High performance anion exchange chromatography was performed with a Dionex BioLC system as described previously (3Guan H.P. Kuriki T. Sivak M. Preiss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Plasmid or M13 replicative form DNA was prepared by either the rapid alkaline extraction method (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or QIAGEN Plasmid Maxi Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Treatment of DNA with restriction enzymes and ligation of DNA were done as recommended by the manufacturer. QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN Inc.) was used for recovery of DNA from agarose. Transformation of E. coli with plasmid DNA and M13 single-stranded template DNA preparation were done as described elsewhere (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Branching enzyme activity for wild-type mBE I and II and chimeric enzymes (TableI) and mBE I and II with silent mutations (BspHI and HindIII for mBE I and NcoI for mBE II) was determined in E. coli BL21(DE3) cell extracts. The silent mutations did not affect enzyme activity (results not shown). mBE II-I BspHI (17 units·mg−1 of protein) exhibited higher activity than wild-type mBE I (5.2 units·mg−1 of protein) and mBE II (11 units·mg−1 of protein) (Table I). The remaining chimeric enzymes were inactive, with the exception of mBE I-IIHindIII and mBE II-I HindIII, which had a very small amount of activity (0.7 and 0.6 units·mg−1protein, respectively) (Table I). To avoid destruction of the secondary structures of the chimeric enzymes, we chose all three endonuclease restriction sites (HindIII, NcoI, andBspHI) that were used for the construction of the chimeric enzyme genes, located on the highly homologous regions on the primary structures of mBE I and II (Fig. 1). Furthermore, those sites were not in the areas forming the probable secondary structures on the α-helix or β-strand. It is therefore likely that despite the sequence similarities of mBE I and II, with the exception of mBE II-IBspHI, the chimeric enzymes did not fold in a way that produced wholly functional three-dimensional arrangements.Table ISpecific activity of maize endosperm branching enzyme isoforms and chimeric enzymes in E. coli pET-23d-BL21(DE3) cell extractsBranching enzyme isoformBranching enzyme activityunits · mg −1 of proteinBL21(DE3) with pET-23d only0.32mBE I5.5mBE II11mBE I-II BspHI0mBE II-IBspHI17mBE I-II HindIII0.7mBE II-I HindIII0.6mBE I-II NcoI0mBE II-I NcoI0mBE I-II-I0mBE II-I-II0Enzyme activity was measured by the phosphorylase astimulation assay (assay a).

The presence of immunoreactive proteins with molecular weights the same as those calculated from the amino acid sequences indicated the expression of mBE I and II and chimeric enzymes. An immunoblot of purified mBE I, mBE II, and mBE II-I BspHI is shown in Fig.3. mBE II-I BspHI was purified to homogeneity, as indicated by a single band in SDS-PAGE, fromE. coli BL21(DE3) cell extract as described previously (Ref.15Guan H.P. Baba T. Preiss J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar; Table II). mBE I-IIHindIII, which had very low activity, was partially purified from E. coli AC71 (glgB − ) cell extract according to the method of Guan et al. (Ref. 15Guan H.P. Baba T. Preiss J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 981-988PubMed Google Scholar; Table III). Three bands of approximately equal intensity were observed when the sample was subject to SDS-PAGE (not shown). One of the protein bands had a molecular weight and immunoreactivity consistent with mBE I-II HindIII. Due to the low activity mBE I-II HindIII, a thorough characterization could not be carried out, although useful information was gained on chain length transfer.Table IIPurification of maize endosperm chimeric branching enzyme II-I BspHI expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)Purification stepVolumeProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldmlmgunitsunits · mg −1 protein%Homogenate17019903644018.3100Supernatant16114703601024.5990–40% (NH4)2SO4704073094076.085Amino-octyl agarose123.24000125011Mono Q H/R 5/50.480.58223938806Enzyme activity was measured by the phosphorylase astimulation assay (assay a).

Open table in a new tab Enzyme activity was measured by the phosphorylase astimulation assay (assay a). Enzyme activity was measured by the phosphorylase astimulation assay (assay a). The optimum temperature for catalysis by mBE II-I BspHI was 25 °C, intermediate between the optimum temperatures of mBE I (30 °C) and mBE II (20 °C). Although the change of the carboxyl terminus had some effect on the characteristics of the enzyme, there does not appear to be a specific relationship between the carboxyl terminus of mBEs and the optimum temperature for catalysis. The specific activity of mBE II-I BspHI measured using assay a, the phosphorylase a stimulation assay, was 3880 units·mg−1 of protein, which is 3–4 times higher than wild-type mBE I (1196 units·mg−1 of protein) and mBE II (1017 units·mg−1 of protein) (Ref. 36Guan H.P. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar; TableIV). The partially purified mBE I-IIHindIII extract had a specific activity of 3.3 units·mg−1 of protein, over 2 orders of magnitude lower than wild-type mBE. Using assay b, the branching linkage assay, the specific activity of mBE II-I BspHI with different reduced amyloses as substrates (AS-320, AS-110, and AS-70) at a concentration of 100 μm was 1.3, 0.89, and 0.48 units·mg−1 of protein, respectively (Table IV). This value is similar to that of mBE I, at 2.1, 1.3, and 0.32 units·mg−1 of protein, respectively, but approximately 1 order of magnitude higher than that obtained from mBE II (0.4, 0.2, and 0.028 units·mg−1 of protein, respectively; Table IV). These results confirm that mBE I has a higher rate in branching amylose than mBE II (36Guan H.P. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and indicate that mBE II-I BspHI has a substrate specificity similar to mBE I for amylose. The mBE I-IIHindIII chimeric enzyme preparation had insufficient activity for use in assay b. Using assay c, the iodine stain assay, mBE I and mBE II-I BspHI had higher activity with amylose (90 and 69 units·mg−1 of protein, respectively) than with amylopectin (2.3 units·mg−1 of protein), giving a high amylose to amylopectin activity ratio (Table IV). In contrast, mBE II was more active with amylopectin (97 units·mg−1 of protein) than with amylose (6.4 units·mg−1 of protein), giving a lower amylose to amylopectin activity ratio (Table IV). There was insufficient mBE I-II HindIII activity to use for assay c. The ratios of mBE I and mBE II activity with amylose as a substrate to that with amylopectin as a substrate are similar to those previously reported (36Guan H.P. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This result provides further evidence that mBE I and mBE II-I BspHI have similar substrate specificity for amylose, as well as for amylopectin. Because the carboxyl terminus of mBE II-IBspHI is from mBE I, it is possible that in addition to the four highly conserved regions in the central portion of mBEs, the carboxyl terminus may also be involved in substrate binding.Table IVSpecific activity of maize endosperm branching enzyme isoforms and mBE II-I BspHIBranching enzymemBE ImBE IImBE II-I BspHIAssay a (phosphorylase stimulation)119610403880Assay b (branching linkage) AS320 (100 μm)2.10.41.3 AS110 (100 μm)1.30.20.89 AS70 (100 μm)0.320.0280.48Assay c (iodine stain) Amylose (c1)906.469 Amylopectin (c2)2.3972.3 Ratio of activity (c1/c2)400.06630Activity is expressed as units · mg−1 of protein.

Using assay b with unbranched amylose (AS-320) as a substrate, theK m values obtained for mBE I, II, and II-IBspHI were quite similar, although theV max for mBE I and II-I BspHI (3.3 ± 0.4 and 2.7 ± 0.3 units·mg−1 of protein, respectively) were higher than the value obtained for mBE II (0.62 ± 0.02 units·mg−1 of protein; TableV). This indicates that the catalytic capacity of mBE II-I BspHI is similar to that of mBE I, suggesting that the carboxyl terminus of BEs may also play a role in determining the catalytic efficiency of the enzymes.Table VKinetic parameters for branching enzyme isoforms and mBE II-I BspHIK mV maxμmunits · mg −1 of proteinmBE I59 ± 103.3 ± 0.4mBE II59 ± 40.62 ± 0.02mBE II-I BspHI83 ± 162.7 ± 0.3Enzyme activity was assayed using the branching linkage assay (assay b) with reduced amylose, AS-320, as substrate.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme activity was assayed using the branching linkage assay (assay b) with reduced amylose, AS-320, as substrate.

Chain length distribution of debranched products was analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography following the incubation of mBE I, mBE II, mBE II-I BspHI, and mBE I-IIHindIII with AS-320 amylose for 80, 160, and 320 min as described previously. The distribution of side chains transferred by mBE I and mBE II varied markedly (38Takeda Y. Guan H.P. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 240: 253-263Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Initially (80 min), mBE I transferred chains with a broad distribution of lengths up to 46 glucose units (under the conditions employed), and at later times (160 and 320 min), mBE I began to transfer more shorter chains, with a high frequency of chains of 11–12 glucose units in length (Fig.4). In vitro, mBE I appears to preferentially transfer longer chains, but eventually makes short branch points (38Takeda Y. Guan H.P. Preiss J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 240: 253-263Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In contrast, mBE II initially transferred short chains, with a high frequency of chains consisting of 7 glucose units and few chains longer than 30 glucose units (Fig. 4). The transfer of chains of 36 glucose units or longer was not detected under the conditions employed. For mBE II the ratio of short to long chains transferred did not change markedly over the time monitored (Fig. 4). mBE II-I BspHI transferred chains in a fashion similar to mBE II, since very few chains over 30 glucose units were not detected, and there was no shift over time toward transferring shorter chains. Six glucose units was the most common length transferred, although the percentage of short chains was not as high as for mBE II (Fig. 4); more mid-sized (degree of polymerization, 10–15) chains were transferred. mBE I-II HindIII, which consists of the amino terminus of mBE I and the central portion and carboxyl terminus of mBE II, transferred chains in a similar manner to mBE I: few short chains were transferred initially, but with time, many more chains with a degree of polymerization of 11–12 were transferred (Fig. 4). Thus, the amino termini of mBEs appear to influence the length of the α-d-glucan chains transferred. The construction and characterization of a chimeric enzyme, mBE II-IBspHI, which consisted of the carboxyl terminus of mBE I and the amino terminus and central portion of mBE II (Fig. 2), which had substrate specificity and catalytic capacity similar to mBE I, indicates that the carboxyl terminus of mBEs may be involved to some extent in substrate binding and catalysis. mBE II-I BspHI transferred chains in a fashion similar to mBE II, suggesting that the central portion and/or amino terminus is involved in chain transfer. In the limited studies carried out with the low activity chimeric enzyme, mBE I-II HindIII, which consisted of the amino terminus of mBE I and the central portion and carboxyl terminus of mBE II (Fig. 2), chain transfer was similar to that of mBE I. Because the only portion of the mBE I-II HindIII from mBE I was the amino terminus, this would suggest that the amino terminus of mBEs is involved in chain transfer. This is also consistent with the chain transfer specificity of mBE II-I BspHI. These findings challenge previous reports that catalytic sites are conserved in the amylolytic family of enzymes (27Matsuura Y. Kusunoki M. Harada W. Kakudo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 28Buisson G. Duée E. Haser R. Payan F. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 43Strokopytov B. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. 1995; 34: 32234-32240Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and in BEs these sites are located in regions 1–4 in the central portion of the enzyme (22Kuriki T. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechonol. 1992; 4: 567-572Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because the putative catalytic centers for mBE isoforms are identical, the differing substrate specificity, catalytic capacity, and chain transfer of the isoforms may be due to either conformational changes in the central region caused by the carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal regions or that one or more amino acid residues essential for activity are present in the terminal region(s) of mBEs.

https://openalex.org/W2141954919,"Critical intracellular signals in normal and malignant cells are transmitted by the adaptor protein Grb2 by means of its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which binds to phosphotyrosyl (pTyr) residues generated by the activation of tyrosine kinases. To understand this important control point and to design inhibitors, previous investigations have focused on the molecular mechanisms by which the Grb2 SH2 domain selectively binds pTyr containing peptides. In the current study, we demonstrate that the Grb2 SH2 domain can also bind in a pTyr independent manner. Using phage display, an 11-amino acid cyclic peptide, G1, has been identified that binds to the Grb2 SH2 domain but not the src SH2 domain. Synthetic G1 peptide blocks Grb2 SH2 domain association (IC50 10–25 μm) with a 9-amino acid pTyr-containing peptide derived from the SHC protein (pTyr317). These data and amino acid substitution analysis indicate that G1 interacts in the phosphopeptide binding site. G1 peptide requires a YXN sequence similar to that found in natural pTyr-containing ligands, and phosphorylation of the tyrosine increases G1 inhibitory activity. G1 also requires an internal disulfide bond to maintain the active binding conformation. Since the G1 peptide does not contain pTyr, it defines a new type of SH2 domain binding motif that may advance the design of Grb2 antagonists.

A particularly important role for Grb2 in human cancer has been proposed for cells transformed by high levels oferbB2 (HER-2 or neu) expression (35Janes P.W. Daly R.J. de Fazio A. Sutherland R.L.

In these cells, the SH2 domain of the Grb2 protein is primarily associated with pTyr residues on p52SHC and on the p185erbB2 (34Sastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1107-1112PubMed Google Scholar, 35Janes P.W. Daly R.J. de Fazio A. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3601-3608PubMed Google Scholar, 36Daly R.J. Binder M.D. Sutherland R.L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2723-2727PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that Grb2 function is required for cell transformation by the neu andbcr-abl oncogenes (37Xie Y. Pendergast A.M.

A. 1995; 92: 10889-10893Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, communication by the epidermal growth factor receptor to the mitogen-activated protein kinase can be inhibited by interference at the Grb2 SH2 domain (39Rojas M. Yao S. Lin Y.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27456-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this study we identify a new small nonphosphorylated peptide motif that can selectively bind the Grb2 SH2 domain and block its function. The library was constructed to contain a variable 9-amino acid peptide flanked by cysteine residues inserted into the GeneIII protein of the phage fUSE5 (40Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar). The Grb2 protein used to isolate the G1 phage was generated as a GST fusion protein using recombinant expression vectors in Escherichia coli (34Sastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1107-1112PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate Grb2 binding phage, we used standard methodology (40Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar). Briefly, over 1010 phage particles of the library containing over 107 individual members were allowed to bind to the recombinant GST-Grb2 protein. The GST-Grb2 proteins and bound phage were collected on glutathione-Sepharose. Unbound phage were removed by washing. Bound phage were eluted and allowed to infect E. coli, and a mixture of phage were collected from the resulting tetracycline-resistant colonies. Phage capable of interacting with GST or glutathione-Sepharose were then allowed to bind to GST-loaded glutathione-Sepharose and discarded. Binding of phage to GST-Grb2 was repeated twice. Following the third GST-Grb2 binding step, 18 phage clones were isolated and subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The variable region of each phage showed an identical nucleotide sequence and predicted protein sequence. The G1 phage was shown to bind to immobilized GST-Grb2 in an ELISA assay. No binding was seen with immobilized GST or recombinant GST fusion proteins containing the Grb2 N-terminal SH3 or C-terminal SH3 domains (data not shown). The purified G1 phage was bound to polystyrene 96-well plates. Nonspecific interactions were inhibited by 5% bovine serum albumin containing 10 mmTris pH 7.5, with 0.15 m NaCl (TBS). Recombinant GST-Grb2, GST-Grb2(SH2), and GST-src(SH2) were prepared as described previously by glutathione affinity (34Sastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1107-1112PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins were allowed to bind to the immobilized G1 phage at the indicated concentrations for 2 h. After extensive washing with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in TBS the binding of SH2 domains was detected using anti-GST antibodies and goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Color reactions were developed using para-nitrophenyl phosphate. The methods used were designed to measure a solution IC50 for peptide inhibition of the Grb2 SH2 domain. The approach minimizes the “left shift” encountered in SPR experiments that is observed when binding equilibrium constants are determined from association and dissociation rates at the SPR surface. In this study the SPR serves simply as a detector of free Grb2 in solution. The IC50values are determined by mixing peptide with recombinant Grb2 or Grb2 SH2 domains and then measuring the amount of binding at equilibrium to the immobilized SHC phosphopeptide. The methods were essentially as described previously for the quantitative comparison of binding constants for the binding of other SH2 domains with phosphopeptides in solution (41Morelock M.M. Ingraham R.H. Betageri R. Jakes S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In our experiments the immobilized phase was generated using SHC phosphopeptide, biotin-DDPSpYVNVQ (Quality Control Biochemicals), >90% purity by C18 high pressure liquid chromatography and of the appropriate molecular weight (1453) by mass spectrometry. This peptide was attached to SA5 chips at 2 nm. Binding of GST-Grb2 was conducted at 200 nm in HBS buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% P-20 surfactant (Pharmacia Biosensor) at flow rate of 5 μl/min for 10 min. Total Ru change for GST-Grb2 or GST-Grb2SH2 binding to SHC phosphopeptide in the absence of inhibitors was 200–500 Ru. Peptides at the indicated concentrations were pre-mixed with the GST-Grb2 prior to introduction onto the SPR chip. The SHC phosphopeptide, DDPSpYVNVQ, was obtained from Quality Control Biochemicals. The G1 peptide was shown to be in the disulfide-linked form by mass spectrometry (molecular weight = 1321) and C18 chromatography. The G1 Cys-Ser peptide, an open chain analogue of G1, contains serines in place of cysteine residues, i.e. SELYENVGMYS. The SHC control peptide, DDPSYVNVQ was nonphosphorylated. Equilibrium binding Ru was determined at 20 s following the last GST-Grb2 flowing across the chip. Two experiments were conducted using separate sensor chips and peptide dilutions. Generation of G1TE used methods previously described for the generation of thioether cyclized peptides (42Robey F. Pennington M.W. Dunn B.M. Bromoacetylated Synthetic Peptides, Starting Materials for Cyclic Peptides, Peptomers and Peptide Conjugates. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, New Jersey1994Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptide ELYENVGMYC was synthesized by standard solid phase methods. Cleavage from the resin was preceded by chloroacetylation of the terminally deprotected Glu residue. After cleaving and deblocking, the peptide was cyclized by intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of the chloro group by cysteine thiol. Cell lysates were prepared from serum-treated erbB2 overexpressing breast (MDA-MB-453) cancer cells using 1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.2 mm NaVO4. Lysates were incubated with 3.1–400 μm of G1TE or 200 μm of SHC phosphopeptide or G1 Cys-Ser control peptide for 20 min. Grb2 and associated Grb2-binding proteins were immunoprecipitated from each lysate (5 mg) with anti-Grb2 antibodies and collected using protein A-Sepharose using methods previously described (34Sastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1107-1112PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8–16% gradient gels (Novagen). pTyr-containing proteins were detected by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The major pTyr-containing proteins in Grb2 immunoprecipitates are indicated by arrows. Previous experiments have shown that the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of this size in these cells is the p185erbB-2, which is overexpressed as a consequence of gene amplification (43Kraus M.H. Popescu N.C. Amsbaugh S.C. King C.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We screened a random peptide phage display library using a recombinant GST fusion protein of Grb2. Since the goal was to identify small molecular weight binding structures, the library was generated with a variable 9-amino acid region flanked by cysteine residues. These cysteines can undergo intramolecular disulfide bond formation, thereby resulting in cyclized peptides with limited conformational flexibility compared with linear peptides. Such phage display libraries have been used to isolate high affinity ligands for other proteins including integrins (44Healy J.M. Murayama O. Maeda T. Yoshino K. Sekiguchi K. Kikuchi M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3948-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 45Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and cell surface receptors (46Li M.W. Chen C.-H. Cwirla S. Whitehorn E. Tate E. Raab R. Bremer M. Dower B. Nat.

Science. 1996; 273: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The library used in this study contained over 107different sequences. Standard techniques were used to screen the phage library in three rounds of affinity selection (40Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3063) Google Scholar). We determined the nucleotide sequence of 18 independent phage isolates that bind to GST-Grb2 and all were identical (Fig. 1). No binding to the N-terminal or C-terminal SH3 domains or GST alone was found using an ELISA type assay (data not shown) suggesting that the phage interacted with the SH2 domain. No tyrosine phosphorylation was present on the G1 phage using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). A disulfide bond in G1 is required for efficient binding of Grb2 to the G1 phage as pretreatment of phage with DTT reduced binding (Fig. 2). DTT did not reduce binding of Grb2 to the SHC phosphopeptide. We examined the binding of GST-Src fusion proteins to the G1 phage using an ELISA assay. As shown in Fig.3, the GST-Grb2 protein binds well to the G1 phage immobilized on the plate, whereas the src-GST protein exhibits no apparent binding. This suggests that the affinity of the Src SH2 domain is at least 100-fold less than that of Grb2 SH2 domain for the G1 phage.Figure 2Effect of 10 mm DTT on the binding of Grb2 to immobilized G1 phage or to immobilized SHC phosphopeptide conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Plates coated with target were treated for 30 min with 10 mm DTT in PBS or PBS alone. GST-Grb2 (2 μm) was incubated for 2 h. Binding was detected by ELISA using anti-GST antibodies. DTT had no effect on presence of plate bound phage or conjugated SHC phosphopeptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3GST-Src proteins do not bind to the G1 phage using an ELISA type assay.

This G1 peptide was used as an inhibitor in surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) studies to monitor the Grb2 interaction with the SHC phosphopeptide (DDPSpYNVQ). In these experiments, the SHC phosphopeptide was attached to the solid surface and GST-Grb2 was allowed to bind. These methods have been previously used for analysis of Grb2 binding to SHC (48Pelicci G. Giordano S. Zhen Z. Salcini A.E. Lanfrancone L. Bardelli A. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Ponzetto C. Pelicci P.G. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1631-1638PubMed Google Scholar) as well as other SH2 domain interactions (41Morelock M.M. Ingraham R.H. Betageri R. Jakes S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 49Felder S. La Vin J. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31711-31719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IC50 values obtained are measures of the solution phase interaction of Grb2 SH2 domains with the inhibiting peptides. The SPR serves as a detector of free active SH2 domain. The method does not suffer from overestimation of affinity encountered in some methods where association and dissociation rates at the surface are used to calculateK D . As shown in Fig.4, A and B, when the G1 peptide and SHC phosphopeptide are premixed in solution with the GST-Grb2 SH2 domain, they inhibit interaction with the SHC phosphopeptide at the surface. Fig. 4 C suggests an IC50 of approximately 25 μm for the G1 peptide. Premixing of soluble SHC phosphopeptide with GST Grb2(SH2) provides a standard (IC50 approximately 2 μm). Fig. 5 shows a similar analysis in which peptides inhibit binding of recombinant protein containing the intact Grb2 fused to GST. An IC50 of approximately 10 μm is obtained for the G1 peptide. Similar results are observed for recombinant intact Grb2 obtained by cleaving with thrombin (data not shown). These experiments indicate that the G1 peptide sequence binds in nonphosphorylated form to the Grb2 SH2 domain in a manner that blocks binding to a relatively short SHC phosphopeptide ligand. This suggests that G1 binds in, or very close to, the phosphopeptide binding pocket. No affinity was measurable for a nonphosphorylated SHC peptide sequence or for a peptide in which the cysteine residues of G1 were replaced by serine (Fig. 5). This confirms results shown in Fig. 2 indicating that the disulfide bond of G1 is required for Grb2 interaction of the free peptide as well as the phage bound G1 peptide. The results demonstrate that the conformational constraint imparted by the disulfide bond in the G1 peptide is required for the affinity of the G1 peptide for the Grb2 SH2 domain.Figure 5The G1 peptide inhibits interaction of full-length GST-Grb2 with SHC phosphopeptide (○□) as does the homologous SHC phosphopeptide (•▪); a G1 peptide variant, G1 Cys-Ser (▴), that cannot form a disulfide does not inhibit. The control SHC peptide (circf]), SHCc, is identical to that standard and chip bound target except that SHCc does not contain pTyr.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The alignment of the G1 sequence, shown in Fig. 1, with Grb2 phosphopeptide ligands suggests the importance of tyrosyl and asparagine residues at positions 4 and 6, respectively. These residues have also previously been shown to be required for high affinity binding of pTyr-containing peptides to Grb2 SH2 domain (51Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). We tested the requirement of these amino acids in the G1 peptide sequence by synthesizing peptides with alanine substitutions at these positions. As shown in Fig. 6, replacement of the tyrosine or asparagine residues of G1 greatly diminish its ability to bind Grb2 and block association with SHC phosphopeptide. No inhibiting activity was seen at up to 500 μm. These results strongly suggest that G1 binds the ligand binding region of the Grb2 SH2 domain using some of the same amino acid contacts as pTyr-containing peptides. Alanine substitutions were also made at other positions in the G1 peptide. The ability of these peptides to interfere with Grb2 binding to the SHC phosphopeptide is shown in Fig.7, and a comparison of the effects of alanine substitution is shown in Fig. 8. Except for replacement of glycine 8, all substitutions reduced but did not eliminate the inhibitory activity of the peptide. The elimination of binding activity by alanine substitution of position 4 tyrosine and position 6 asparagine strongly suggest they are directly involved in binding the SH2 domain. The other substitutions may alter the conformation of the G1 peptide, or they may eliminate important side chain interactions that improve Grb2 SH2 domain binding.Figure 7Testing the effects of sequence alterations in the G1 peptide. Each position is substituted by alanine as indicated in the legend. For example G1.2E-A is the G1 peptide containing an alanine in position 2. The binding of peptide to the Grb2 SH2 domain was measured by surface plasmon resonance (Pharmacia Biacore). The percent inhibition was calculated by comparison of the Rueq in the presence of peptide with the Rueqwith no inhibiting peptide present.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Comparison of the activity of alanine substituted G1 peptides. The results shown in Figs. 7 and 8 are displayed for inhibition at 100 μm peptide. The inhibition by unsubstituted G1 peptide represents 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the G1 peptide binds directly in the phosphopeptide binding pocket, we synthesized a G1 peptide with a phosphotyrosyl residue at position 4. As shown in Fig.9, the resulting peptide inhibits Grb2 interaction more potently than G1 or the SHC phosphopeptide. These results indicate that G1 binds directly in the phosphopeptide binding pocket of the Grb2 SH2 domain. They also suggest that the constrained conformation or additional side chain contacts of G1 provide for additional affinity in comparison to the SHC phosphopeptide. To verify that the interaction between G1 and Grb2 is sufficient to inhibit the Grb2 SH2 domain association with intact phosphoproteins, we conducted experiments in cell extracts. We used the cell line MDA-MB-453 in which an overexpressed p185 erb B-2 (43Kraus M.H. Popescu N.C. Amsbaugh S.C. King C.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) generates abundant autophosphorylation (34Sastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1107-1112PubMed Google Scholar). Since we were concerned that the G1 peptide requires a disulfide bond and reduction might occur in the cell lysate conditions, we synthesized a similar molecule, G1TE, in which the disulfide structure has been replaced by a thioether bond. Binding of G1TE to GST-Grb2 and inhibition of SH2 function in vitrodemonstrate similar IC50 values compared with G1 (Fig.10). When added to cell lysates, the G1TE molecule is able to diminish the amount of p185 pTyr-containing protein that co-immunoprecipitate with Grb2. SHC phosphopeptide also showed similar ability. SH2 domains associate with phosphopeptides with high affinity but display very fast dissociation and association kinetics. Thus a “preformed” complex of Grb2 bound to p185 erb B-2 can be sensitive to peptides that prevent the reassociation component of the equilibrium. The relative effectiveness of G1TE in these assays is comparable to that seen in the SPR analysis with partial interference at 50 μm (Fig.10). No effect of peptides was seen on binding of Grb2 to SOS1, an SH3 domain mediated interaction (34Sastry L. Lin W. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R.

These results indicate that the association of Grb2 with p185 erb B-2 can be prevented by small nonphosphorylated peptides like G1TE. Our results are unexpected in that they show that small nonphosphorylated peptides can bind to SH2 domains with micromolar affinity. This raises several interesting possibilities for the study of SH2 domains. First, our findings suggest new approaches toward the design of SH2 domain antagonists. Based on previous indications of the requirement for pTyr residues within SH2 domain ligands, synthetic efforts have focused on creating nonhydrolyzable pTyr analogues. Compounds containing a difluoromethyl group in place of the phosphate ester oxygen of pTyr (F2PMP) are stable and bind well to the targeted SH2 domain (55Burke Jr., T.R. Smyth M.S. Otaka A. Nomizu M.

However, the activity of these and other similar compounds when applied to intact cells is limited (56Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, other nonphosphorus-containing pTyr mimetics, such asO-malonyl tyrosine (57Ye B. Akamatsu M.

Chem. 1995; 38: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), are highly charged at physiological pH, and would not be expected to exhibit potent effects on intact cells. Therefore, our identification of G1 addresses one of the primary limitations of current strategies for the development of antagonists of SH2 domains, namely, poor cell penetration due to the highly charged moieties. We do not consider the G1 or G1TE molecules to be cell permeable drugs in their current form, since peptides can have limitations in vivo. Alternatively, we see the G1 interaction with the Grb2 SH2 domain as a means to assess and potentially exploit the contribution of interactions not requiring a ligand phosphate group. To this end, design and synthesis of peptide mimetics of G1 are in progress. A second novel aspect of small nonphosphorylated peptide binding to SH2 domains is that it suggests that SH2 domains may have naturally occurring peptide ligands that are nonphosphorylated. Very little is known about whether such proteins exist. Some clues are present in previous studies that suggest that the specificity for phosphotyrosyl-containing proteins is not absolute. The SH2 domain offyn and blk can bind phosphorylated serine or threonine residues (58Malek S.N. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33009-33020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Raffel G.D. Parmar K. Rosenberg N. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5991-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) indicates that such interactions can exist as do phosphotyrosyl-independent interactions of the amyloid precursor protein with the phosphotyrosine binding domain of FE65 (61Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy I. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Since the original submission of this manuscript, a version of the SHC sequence containing a hydrophobic leader peptide and without pTyr has recently been reported to bind Grb2 in immunoprecipitation assays (62Rojas M. Yao S.-Y. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.-Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These and our results indicate that a phosphorylated amino acid is not absolutely required for interactions directly at the active site of the SH2 domain of Grb2. If nonphosphorylated cellular proteins exist that associate with the Grb2 SH2 domain, they could have important regulatory functions. The ability of the G1 peptide to bind to the Grb2 SH2 domain also highlights the importance of amino acid side chain interactions in the binding of SH2 domains to phosphoproteins. Previous studies have indicated the importance of positions +1 through +3 (51Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) in determining the specificity of the SH2 binding interactions. Our results suggest that these positions also contribute substantially to the affinity of the G1 interaction as well. Since all but one of the amino acids in G1 apparently contribute to the binding interaction it is likely that the G1 structure is finely tuned for multipoint interaction with the G1 SH2 domain. Determination of the three dimensional structure of the G1 peptide bound to the Grb2 SH2 will determine if the G1 peptide can assume a β-turn structure similar to that recently reported for the natural Grb2 phosphopeptide ligand (20Rahuel J. Gay B. Erdmann D. Strauss A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Furet P. Caravatti G. Fretz H. Schoepfer J. Gutter M.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 586-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).

Laminin-1 is composed of three unique polypeptide chains, α1, β1, and γ1, that form a large ∼800-kDa heterotrimer composed of three short arms and one long arm. All other known laminin isoforms adopt a similar α-β-γ trimeric composition but assemble using varying combinations of unique α, β, and γ isoforms. Laminins 2 and 4, previously referred to as merosin, both contain the α2-chain subunit (5Leivo I. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to the long arm functions, little is currently known about the α2-chain short arm and its potential role as a ligand for cell surface receptors.In this study, we have expressed laminin short arm α2-chain and α1-chain proteins to identify and characterize cell recognition functions specific for these amino-terminal domains. We report here that the α2-chain of laminin contains two distinct integrin binding sites within its amino-terminal domain, recognizing both the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins. These cell recognition sites are conserved in domain VI of the laminin α1-chain isoform, as reported previously in the case of α1β1 integrin recognition (22Hall D.E. Reichardt L.F. Crowley E.

Furthermore, we show that the α2-chain short arm contains heparin binding sites that may mediate interactions with cell surface proteoglycans or other charged glycosaminoglycans. These shared integrin recognition sites and heparin-binding activities may act alone or in concert with α-chain domain VI polymer-forming sites 3Cheng, Y.-S., Champliaud, M.-F., Burgesson, R. E., Marinkovich, M. P., and Yurchenco, P. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, in press.3Cheng, Y.-S., Champliaud, M.-F., Burgesson, R. E., Marinkovich, M. P., and Yurchenco, P. D. (1997) J. Biol.

In addition, a heparin binding activity was identified in this domain, suggesting that this domain also interacts with either cell surface or matrix-bound glycosaminoglycans. The α1β1 and α2β1 integrin binding sites are the first cell recognition activities to be assigned to this functionally rich region of skeletal muscle laminin isoforms 2 and 4. We have also shown that these recognition sites are found in domain VI of the laminin-1 α-chain. In addition, the short arm regions of laminin α1- and α2-chains mediate neurite outgrowth of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells independently of long arm receptor contributions.To assign these functions to domain VI, we compared the binding activities of α1- and α2-chain short arm proteins with a chimera in which domain VI was replaced by domain VI of β1. Domain VI of the β1-chain was chosen as an ideal control for cell adhesion studies, since a proteolytic fragment containing this domain was previously unable to support adhesion of the cell types used here (25Colognato-Pyke H.

Native morphology appeared to be maintained in all three short arm molecules, appearing as similar dumbbell-shaped molecules representing globular domains VI and IVb separated by a rod-like domain V.The ability of the α2-chain short arm to support heparin interactions was assessed using HPLC heparin affinity chromatography. We found that the short arm of the α2 subunit isoform bound heparin, although its relative affinity was less than that of its α1-chain counterpart. Both short arm proteins had a lower relative affinity than carboxyl-terminal G-domain fragment E3, which has been shown to mediate a heparin-sensitive interaction with dystroglycan, a molecule that provides a linkage between the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle (15Ervasti J.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14972-14980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arginine and lysine are two basic amino acids thought to be essential in mediating electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged sulfate and carboxylic acid groups of heparin (40Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domains VI of the laminin α1- and α2-chains have net positive charges of +9 and +2, respectively. It is interesting to note that domain VI of the dystrophicdy 2J mouse α2-chain contains an internal deletion that results in a net loss of basic residues, reducing the net charge to zero (19Sunada Y. Bernier S.M. Utani A. Yamada Y. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is possible that loss of these positively charged residues could disrupt a crucial interaction with cell surface molecules containing negatively charged groups such as heparan sulfate or polysialic acid.We evaluated cell recognition functions of these short arm proteins in comparison with those of intact EHS laminin-1 and a mixture of human placental laminins 2 and 4 (α2-chain-containing isoforms). Previous studies have identified several integrin binding sites within the carboxyl-terminal long arms of laminins 1, 2, and 4, including α3β1, α6β1, α7β1, and α6β4 (11Delwel G.O. Hogervorst F.

Studies using large proteolytic fragments of laminin-1 (E1′ and E1X) have shown that the α1β1 and α2β1 integrin recognition functions reside somewhere in the short arms (22Hall D.E. Reichardt L.F.

To define the repertoire of laminin isoform binding integrins in HT1080 cells, we evaluated adhesion of these cells to full-size EHS laminin-1 and placental laminin-2/4 in the presence of various integrin-blocking antibodies.We found that a combination of antibodies against the α2β1 and α6β1 integrins completely blocked adhesion of HT1080 cells on a substrate of laminin-1. These results demonstrate that the α2β1 and α6β1 integrins are required in order for HT1080 cells to mediate adhesion to laminin-1. However, since a combination of α3β1 and α6β1 integrin-blocking antibodies was more effective than α6β1 blocking antibodies alone, we suggest that laminin-1 may weakly associate with the α3β1 integrin as long as additional β1-class integrin sites are occupied. Despite these observations, the α3β1 integrin was clearly unable to support adhesion to laminin-1 in the absence of α2β1 and α6β1 interactions. In contrast, laminin isoforms 2 and 4 were found to utilize the α2β1, α6β1, and α3β1 integrins in mediating adhesion to HT1080 cells, with a combination of antibodies against these three integrins causing the most significant decrease in adhesion. These observations may address the discrepancy apparent in the finding that although the α3β1 integrin has been described as a receptor for laminin-1 (41Gehlsen K.R. Dickerson K. Argraves W.S. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19034-19038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), K562 cells transfected with the α3β1 integrin were unable to adhere to EHS laminin-1, whereas adhesion was detected on human placental laminins (12Delwel G.O. de Melker A.A. Hogervorst F. Jaspars L.H. Fles D.L.A. Kuikman I. Lindblom A. Paulsson M. Timpl R. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Also consistent with our observations are studies involving sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion, where the α3β1 integrin is utilized more efficiently on a laminin-2/4 substrate than on an EHS laminin substrate (45Tomaselli K.J. Doherty P. Emmett C.J. Damsky C.H. Walsh F.S. Reichardt L.F. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4880-4888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We next examined whether the α2β1 integrin interacted with the laminin α1- and α2-chain short arm proteins. We found both α1- and α2-chain proteins mediated adhesion to HT1080 cells, whereas our chimeric α-chain protein containing β1-chain domain VI did not. Furthermore, adhesion on both substrates was completely blocked in the presence of α2β1 integrin-specific antibodies. The α2β1 integrin was first described as a receptor for laminin in studies using human umbilical endothelial cells (46Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This integrin has since been shown to participate in epithelial tissue processes such as wound repair, inflammation, regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, and establishment of polarity (reviewed in Ref. 47Sheppard D. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Several studies examining the role of extracellular matrix proteins in these processesin vivo support an interaction between both laminin-1 and laminin-2 with the α2β1 integrin. The α2β1 integrin exhibits a highly restricted distribution during epithelial branching morphogenesis of the developing lung, appearing only at the branching tips (48Wu J.E. Santoro S.A. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and this distribution is spatially and temporally correlated with the expression of laminin-1 and collagen IV at sites of rapid matrix deposition. Branching morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells grown on a mixture of laminin-1 and collagen IV has also been shown to be dependent on expression of the α2β1 integrin (49Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Staatz W.D. Tsung Y.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7411-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Expression of the α2β1 integrin in developing and adult peripheral nerves and Schwann cells, tissues where α2-chain-containing laminins are the predominant laminin isoforms, has been observed in several studies (50Hsiao L.L. Peltonen J. Jaakkola S. Gralnick H. Uitto J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 51Andrew S.M. Edwards B.D. Chalmers R.J. O'Driscoll J.B. Br. J.

Invest. 1994; 70: 740-752PubMed Google Scholar).Earlier studies have shown that α1β1 integrin-mediated cell attachment occurs via the short arms of laminin-1 (22Hall D.E. Reichardt L.F. Crowley E.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), specifically through domain VI of the α1-chain (25Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J. Yamada Y. Carbonetto S. Cheng Y.-S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9398-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Data shown here demonstrate that the α2-chain short arm of laminin isoforms 2 and 4 also mediated cell adhesion through the α1β1 integrin, as well as supported neurite outgrowth. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells adhered and spread on dishes coated with laminin short arm α2-chain protein but were inhibited in the presence of antibodies specific for the α1 integrin subunit. Nerve growth factor-primed PC12 cells extended long, branching neurites when grown on α2-chain short arm protein, appearing similar to cells grown on full-size laminin-1, -2, or -4. Analysis of the developing avian embryo has shown that the α1β1 integrin is expressed in the central nervous system, sympathetic and spinal sensory ganglia, capillary endothelium, and skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle; although in the adult, expression becomes restricted to muscle and endothelium (53Duband J.-L. Belkin A.M. Syfrig J. Thiery J.P. Koteliansky V.E. Development. 1992; 116: 585-600PubMed Google Scholar, 54Glukhova M. Koteliansky V. Fondacci C. Marotte F. Rappaport L. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that the α1β1 integrin mediates neural crest cell migration on laminin-1 (55Duband J.-L. Thiery J.P. Development. 1988; 101: 461-478Google Scholar, 56Lallier T. Bronner-Fraser M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1335-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 57Lallier T. Deutzmann R. Perris R. Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and we suggest that the α1β1 integrin may mediate cell migration or adhesion during the development of tissues where laminin-2 and -4 isoforms play a prominent role, such as muscle or peripheral nerve (5Leivo I. Engvall E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 58Vuolteenaho R. Nissinen M. Sainio K. Byers M. Eddy R. Hirvonen H. Shows T.B. Sariola H. Engvall E. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Analysis of mice engineered to lack the α1 integrin subunit do not exhibit gross muscle or nerve defects, showing only subtle disturbances in cell adhesion and migration (59Gardner H. Kreidberg J. Koteliansky V. Jaenisch R. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); however, the α2β1 integrin has an overlapping pattern of expression and ligand binding, and its presence may prevent such defects from occurring. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding the α2 integrin subunit as well as the generation of mice lacking both α1 and α2 integrin subunits are needed to more definitively assess the in vivorole of these integrin-laminin short arm interactions.The dystrophic mouse dy 2J expresses a mutated laminin α2-chain in which domain VI is truncated (18Xu H. Xiao-Rong W. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 19Sunada Y. Bernier S.M. Utani A. Yamada Y. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The mutated α2-chain assembles with its β and γ subunit partners into laminin-2 or -4 heterotrimers, 4H. Colognato and P. D. Yurchenco, unpublished observations. is secreted by cells and appears to be localized to the extracellular matrix (18Xu H. Xiao-Rong W. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar,19Sunada Y. Bernier S.M. Utani A. Yamada Y. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The removal of domain VI from an otherwise functional laminin molecule nonetheless leads to progressive muscle degeneration characteristic of human congenital muscular dystrophies. At least four functions can now be assigned to this critical α2-chain domain: α1β1 and α2β1 integrin recognition, heparin binding, and polymer formation (described as being analogous to the laminin-1 assembly mechanism).3 We also note that heparin and integrin binding sites in laminin are all found at extreme ends of the molecule in domains VI and G, suggesting a functional basis for this spatial clustering. The transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan, along with the α5β1 integrin, has been proposed to function as a co-receptor for the matrix protein fibronectin (60Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The co-localization of binding sites in laminin suggests that a similar pairing of integrin binding and cell surface proteoglycan binding may be involved in laminin-mediated cell attachment and signaling. The phenotype seen in the dy 2J mouse indicates that one or more of these domain VI activities may be required to maintain normal muscle stability.Peripheral nerve function is also disrupted in thedy 2J dystrophic mouse, where dysmyelination results in large bundles of naked axons (61Madrid R.E. Jaros E. Cullen M.J. Bradley W.G. Nature. 1975; 257: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The spinal roots show fewer Schwann cells than normal at birth, and many of the cells that are present do not differentiate. However, these uncommitted cells are capable of differentiation when transplanted into a normal environment (62Perkins C.S. Bray G.M. Aguayo A.J. Dev. Brain Res. 1981; 1: 213-220Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It may be that an intact laminin α2-chain domain VI is needed either for proper Schwann cell migration during development or to provide a differentiation cue to uncommitted precursor cells. It remains unclear whether the α2-chain domain VI integrin binding sites described here are involved in this process; however, the identification of these sites represents a significant step forward in our understanding of laminin α2-chain function and its requirement in muscle and peripheral nerve development and stability. Members of the laminin family of glycoproteins are thought to be important for the development and stability of basement membranes, both through architecture-forming interactions with other laminins and matrix components and through recognition of cell signaling molecules such as integrins.

https://openalex.org/W2049865066,"This study examines the interactions of alphavbeta3 and alpha5beta1 in the regulation of cell migration. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that express alpha5beta1 endogenously were transfected with alphavbeta3 and beta3 mutants, and their attachment and migration to fibronectin (Fn) and vitronectin (Vn) were measured. An alphavbeta3 blocking antibody and the alphavbeta3 ligand cyclic G-Pen-GRGDSPC-A inhibited alpha5beta1-mediated migration toward Fn, but not attachment to Fn. This function was alphavbeta3-specific since alphavbeta5 transfection and alphavbeta5 blocking antibody did not produce this effect. Mutations introduced into the beta3 integrin subunit to dissect this phenomenon revealed the following. Disruption of the ligand binding domain by the Glanzmann thrombasthenia mutation beta3-D119Y constitutively abolished migration toward both Vn and Fn, and attachment to Vn but not to Fn. Insertion of the Glanzmann mutation beta3-S752P into the cytoplasmic domain or its truncation (beta3-Delta717) abolished binding to Vn but not to Fn. Inhibition of migration toward Fn was inhibited in these cells by alphavbeta3 blocking antibody. alphavbeta3-mediated inhibition was, however, abolished by truncation of the transmembrane domain (beta3-Delta693). These findings demonstrate alphavbeta3 regulation of alpha5beta1-mediated cell migration and suggest that the beta3 transmembrane domain is essential for this function."
https://openalex.org/W2080690412,"We show that the liver-specific expression of all four genes in the human apolipoprotein (apo) E/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster in transgenic mice is determined by the coordinate action of two distinct hepatic control regions (HCR). These enhancers are positioned 15 kilobases (kb) (HCR.1) and 26 kb (HCR.2) downstream of the apoE gene. To investigate the action of each HCR, transgenic mice were generated with a 70-kb human genomic fragment that contained the complete apoE gene cluster or with this fragment modified by the specific deletion of HCR.1, HCR.2, or both HCR domains. Hepatic expression of all four apolipoprotein genes was observed in transgenic mice in which either HCR.1 or HCR.2 was deleted, but no transgene expression was found in the liver in the absence of both HCR domains. The overall patterns of transgene expression suggested that HCR.2 was the dominant element for apoC-IV and apoC-II expression and that HCR.1 was dominant for the apoE/C-I expression. No liver-specific transcriptional activity was identified for the proximal promoter of any gene in the cluster; all liver-specific activity was associated with HCR.1 and HCR.2. Thus, the HCRs of the apoE gene cluster constitute unique regulatory domains for determining the requirements for apolipoprotein gene expression in the liver.

The apoE gene cluster encodes amphipathic lipid-binding proteins that have evolved distinct functions in lipid metabolism. ApoE mediates lipoprotein clearance from the plasma by acting as a ligand for the low density lipoprotein receptor (10Mahley R.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A role for apoE in neuron growth and homeostasis, as well as in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, has been suggested by recent studies (for review, see Ref. 14Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1485-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). ApoC-II, a specific cofactor for lipoprotein lipase, has an important role in the hydrolysis of lipoprotein triglycerides (15Breckenridge W.C. Little J.A. Steiner G. Chow A. Poapst M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1978; 298: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Although its precise function is uncertain, apoC-I may inhibit the apoE-mediated cellular uptake of lipoproteins (16Sehayek E. Eisenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18259-18267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Kowal R.C. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

The function of apoC-IV, the most recently described member of this protein family, remains unknown (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although apoC-IV is not detected in normal human plasma (18Allan C.M. Taylor J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1510-1518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is evidence that it may participate in lipid metabolism. The expression of human apoC-IV in transgenic mice resulted in hypertriglyceridemia (18Allan C.M. Taylor J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1510-1518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and normal rabbit plasma lipoproteins were recently found to contain a human apoC-IV homolog (19Zhang L.-H. Kotite L. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1776-1783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The primary site of synthesis of apoE, C-I, and C-II is the liver (4Lauer S.J.

Bry W.I. Boyles J.K. Wardell M.R. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Human apoC-IV mRNA is also expressed in the liver, although at considerably lower levels than the closely linked apoC-II gene (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because the hepatic expression of these apolipoprotein genes is fundamental to their proposed roles in lipid metabolism, we have investigated the regulatory elements required for their liver-specific expression. Transgenic mice expressing human genomic fragments of this cluster were used to identify and characterize a hepatic control region (HCR.1) that is required for liver-specific expression of the apoE and apoC-I genes (23Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HCR.1 is located 18.4 and 9.5 kb downstream of the 5′ ends of the apoE and apoC-I genes, respectively, between the apoC-I gene and apoC-I′ pseudogene (see Fig. 1). The full activity of HCR.1 appears to be provided by a 319-bp sequence (24Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although subfragments have significant activity (24Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1699-1707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HCR.1 contains at least seven distinct regulatory elements that are cooperatively involved in directing high level, liver-specific expression of the human apoE transgene (24Dang Q. Walker D. Taylor S. Allan C. Chin P. Fan J. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22577-22585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Dang Q. Taylor J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28667-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We recently identified in the apoE gene cluster a second HCR-like sequence (HCR.2) has an 85% nucleotide identity to the functional 319-bp HCR.1 sequence (27Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The HCR.2 sequence is located 11 kb downstream of HCR.1 and 6 kb upstream of the closely linked apoC-IV and apoC-II genes. HCR.2 probably arose during the ancestral duplication event that formed the apoC-I′ pseudogene. We demonstrated that HCR.2 has retained the necessary sequences for directing high level, liver-specific expression of the human apoE gene in transgenic mice (27Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that at least two hepatic enhancers are involved in the liver-specific expression of the human apoE gene. Here, we report further studies of the roles of HCR.1 and HCR.2 in the liver-specific expression of each gene in the apoE gene cluster. First, to extend our previous investigation of the apoE and apoC-I gene loci (23Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we determined if proximal flanking sequences in the apoC-IV and apoC-II gene loci could direct expression of these genes in the liver. We have identified all sequences within the apoE gene cluster which controlled liver-specific transcription of these genes. Second, we used RecA-assisted restriction endonuclease (RARE) cleavage to delete either or both of the HCR domains to determine their actions in the expression of each gene in the cluster. A cosmid clone (pCVC-II), shown previously to contain the complete human apoC-II gene, was a gift from Dr. Lawrence Chan (Baylor University, Houston, TX) (28Wei C.-F. Tsao Y.-K. Robberson D.L. Gotto Jr., A.M. Brown K. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15211-15221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After digestion with HindIII, a 13-kb fragment (CII.H3) containing the entire apoC-II gene with 7 and 3 kb of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, respectively, was isolated during electrophoresis in 0.75% agarose using NA45 membranes as recommended (Schleicher & Schuell). Purified CII.H3 DNA was ligated to a 774-bp genomic fragment containing HCR.1 (23Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HCR.1.CII.H3 construct was isolated by electrophoresis in 1.0% SeaPlaque GTG agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME). A gel slice containing the construct was digested with β-agarase (FMC), and the DNA was purified using a DNA clean-up kit (Promega, Madison, WI). A P1 plasmid clone (p1.198) containing the entire human apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster was identified by screening a human P1 genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis), and the 90-kb genomic insert was mapped as described (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A 70-kb KpnI genomic fragment (198.KK) containing all four apolipoprotein genes was derived from purified p1.198 DNA. DNA fragments were separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis using 1.0% SeaPlaque GTG agarose. Gel slices containing the 198.KK fragment were excised, and the DNA was concentrated by electrophoresis in 4% Nusieve agarose (FMC) as described (29Schedl A. Montoliu L. Kelsey G. Schütz G. Nature. 1993; 362: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Gel pieces were digested with β-agarase and dialyzed on a membrane (type VS, 0.025-μm pore size, Millipore) floating on 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA containing 30 μm spermine and 70 μm spermidine. Human genomic fragments were used directly for microinjection as described below. A second P1 plasmid clone (p1.199) was identified that contained the human apoC-II gene (Genome Systems). Southern blot analysis of purified p1.199 DNA, performed as described (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and PCR analysis (data not shown) were used to determine that the p1.199 human genomic insert contained the apoC-IV/C-II gene cluster and the complete HCR.2 sequence. The 5′-end of the p1.199 genomic insert was determined by nucleotide sequence analysis as described, using the T7 primer (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A 43-kb genomic MluI fragment of p1.199 was purified after pulsed field gel electrophoresis for microinjection as described above. RARE cleavage was performed as described (30Ferrin L.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 31Borén J. Lee I. Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. Innerarity T.L. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to delete specific regions of the p1.198 genomic insert. A 12-kb HindIII fragment containing the HCR.1 sequence was removed from p1.198 by RARE cleavage using oligonucleotides 5′-GTGAGGTAATGAAAATGAAGGCCCCAAGCTTGGCCAGACCTGGGTCCCCAGGCTGGAG and 5′-GGTCTTGTGGGGTAATGAAGGACACAAGCTTGGTGGGACCTGAGTCCCCAGGCTGGC. The p1.198 DNA with the 12-kb deletion (denoted 198−12H) and the deleted 12-kb HindIII fragment (12H) were both isolated after pulsed field gel electrophoresis (31Borén J. Lee I. Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. Innerarity T.L. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Purified 198−12H DNA was religated, cloned, and linearized for reinsertion of the modified 12H fragment as described below. The 198−12H DNA was linearized by RARE cleavage using the oligonucleotide 5′-GTGAGGTAATGAAAATGAAGGCCCCAAGCTTGGTGGGACCTGAGTCCCCAGGCTGGC (to protect the recombined HindIII site from methylation) and HindIII digestion. The 12H genomic fragment containing the HCR.1 sequence was subcloned into pBSSK and modified by restriction endonucleases to delete specific sequences. Digestion of 12H DNA with PlmI followed by religation removed a 2.2-kb fragment containing HCR.1. The modified 12H fragment was cloned, digested with HindIII, and isolated by electrophoresis in 1.0% SeaPlaque GTG agarose. DNA was purified from gel slices using β-agarase as described above, and the modified 12H fragment was reinserted into linearized 198−12H DNA (31Borén J. Lee I. Callow M.J. Rubin E.M. Innerarity T.L. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing reinserted 12H fragments were screened by BamHI andHindIII digestion and separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gel. P1 clones were selected that showed no rearrangements and contained the modified 12H insert in the correct orientation, as verified by PCR analysis. A modified p.198 clone that lacked the HCR.1 sequence was denoted p1.198−HCR.1. A genomic KpnI fragment of this P1 clone, 198−HCR.1.KK, was purified for microinjection after pulsed field gel electrophoresis. To delete the HCR.2 sequence, a 12-kb genomic EcoRI fragment containing HCR.2 was removed from p1.198 by RARE cleavage using oligonucleotides 5′-GACCCTGGAGGACTACACTCGGGAATTCATCAACCGCATCACACAGAGTGAACTTCCTGC and 5′-CAATCTGCTGATGATTGCTACAGAGGAATTCCAGGGGACATCTGTTGCGCACCTACTGTGC. The 12-kb EcoRI fragment (12E) and the p1.198 DNA with the 12-kb deletion (198−12E) were both isolated after pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The 198−12E DNA was religated, cloned, and linearized for reinsertion of a modified 12E fragment, as described below. Purified p1.198−12E DNA was linearized by RARE cleavage using the oligonucleotide 5′-GACCCTGGAGGACTACACTCGGGAATTCCAGGGGACATCTGTTGCGCACCTACTGTGC (to protect the recombined EcoRI site from methylation) andEcoRI digestion. The isolated 12E fragment was subcloned into a modified pBSSK vector that lacked a BamHI site in the polylinker. A 1.2-kb fragment containing the HCR.2 sequence was removed from 12E DNA by digestion with BamHI and BssHII. The modified 12E DNA was religated, cloned, digested withEcoRI, and purified for reinsertion into linearized 198−12E DNA. Plasmids containing the insert were screened by BamHI,EcoRI, and HindIII digestion and separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gel. A P1 clone containing the modified 12E insert with the deleted HCR.2 sequence was denoted p1.198−HCR.2. Plasmid DNA was digested with KpnI, and the genomic 198−HCR.2.KK fragment was purified for microinjection after pulsed field gel electrophoresis. This RARE cleavage procedure was repeated to delete the HCR.2 sequence from the P1 clone already lacking HCR.1 (p1.198−HCR.1) to obtain a P1 clone that lacked both the HCR.1 and HCR.2 sequences, referred to as p1.198−HCR.1&2. A genomicKpnI fragment, 198−HCR.1&2.KK, was prepared for microinjection after isolation by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Transgenic animals were generated as described (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), using the inbred FVB/N strain. Constructs CII.H3 and HCR.1.CII.H3 (2–3 ng/μl) were microinjected in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA. Constructs 198.KK, 198−HCR.1.KK, 198−HCR.2.KK, 198−HCR.1&2.KK, and 199.MM were microinjected at concentrations of 1–4 ng/μl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA containing 30 μm spermine and 70 μm spermidine. Transgenic founders and hemizygous offspring were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA. The presence of human apoE and apoC-II genes and HCR sequences was confirmed by PCR analysis. Copy numbers of the transgenes were determined by Southern dot-blot analysis and quantification with a Fujix Bas1000 Bio-imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Co. Ltd., Japan). Normal FVB/N mouse genomic DNA was supplemented with known amounts of a genomic fragment containing the human apoC-II gene and used as standard. A mouse actin probe (pTRI-actin, Ambion) was used to compare the relative amounts of mouse genomic DNA added to each well. To determine that no major rearrangements or deletions had occurred after the integration of human DNA into the mouse genome, tail DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and analyzed by Southern blotting with probes specific for human apoC-I, apoC-II, apoC-IV, or apoE as described (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Total RNA from tissues of F1 transgenic mice and from cultured HepG2 cells was isolated using guanidine thiocyanate (32MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Tissue RNA was obtained from at least two independent transgenic lines of each construct. Antisense RNA probes for human apoE and apoC-I mRNAs were transcribed as described (23Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as were probes for apoC-II and apoC-IV mRNAs using [α32-P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in the presence of T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego). RNase protection analysis was performed as described (33Gilman M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993: 4.7.1-4.7.8Google Scholar), using 5 μg of total cellular RNA/sample. Protected fragments were resolved by electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 murea and detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. A mouse actin mRNA probe (pTRI-actin, Ambion) was used in this assay to confirm that equivalent levels of RNA were present in each tissue sample. Relative levels of hepatic expression (per transgene copy number) of human apoC-II mRNA in different transgenic lines were quantified with a Fujix Bas1000 Bio-imaging Analyzer (Fuji), using HepG2 apoC-II mRNA expression levels as interassay standards and mouse actin mRNA levels to normalize sample loading. Recent studies showed that expression of the human apoE and apoC-I genes in the liver was not specified by their proximal promoter sequences; expression in the liver required a distal sequence, referred to as the hepatic control region or HCR.1 (23Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the downstream human apoC-IV and apoC-II genes also required distal elements for hepatic expression as do apoE and apoC-I, transgenic mice were generated using CII.H3, a 13-kb genomic fragment that contained the entire human apoC-II (28Wei C.-F. Tsao Y.-K. Robberson D.L. Gotto Jr., A.M. Brown K. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15211-15221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and apoC-IV genes (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Independent lines of CII.H3 transgenic mice were examined for human apoC-II and apoC-IV mRNA expression in the liver and five other tissues. Human apoC-IV and apoC-II mRNA were not detected by RNase protection analysis in the liver, although trace levels of human apoC-II expression were present in the brain and spleen (Fig. 1). To determine if the HCR.1 sequence could confer hepatic expression of the human apoC-IV/C-II genes in transgenic mice, a 774-bp fragment containing HCR.1 (23Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated to CII.H3. Transgenic mice generated with this construct expressed human apoC-II mRNA in the liver (Fig.1) and human apoC-IV mRNA in the livers with lower levels of human apoC-IV mRNA in four other tissues examined (Fig. 1). Thus, the HCR.1 sequence was able to direct hepatic expression of both the apoC-IV and apoC-II genes at relative levels that appeared to reflect their expression in vivo (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The extrahepatic expression of the apoC-IV/C-II genes suggests that the 774-bp HCR.1-containing fragment conferred low levels of transgene transcription in other tissues. Whether this extrahepatic expression involves specific regulation by elements within the functional 319-bp HCR domain or is the result of activation of other distinct elements within the construct has yet to be determined. In the human apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster, the HCR.2 domain is located just ∼6 kb upstream of the apoC-IV gene (27Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). HCR.2 directed high level, liver-specific expression of a human apoE gene construct in transgenic mice that was equivalent to the activity of HCR-1 (27Allan C.M. Walker D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26278-26281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the proximity of HCR.2 to the apoC-IV and apoC-II genes suggested that it might be more important for the hepatic expression of these genes. To investigate this possibility, a 43-kb genomic fragment generated by MluI digestion containing the human apoC-IV/C-II gene cluster and HCR.2 sequence, but not the HCR.1 sequence, was isolated from the 5′ end of the P1 clone p1.199. Southern blot analysis of p1.199 DNA showed that no major gene rearrangements or deletions were present in the human genomic insert; human apoC-II and HCR.2 probes identified genomic fragments of p1.199 that were equivalent to genomic fragments of the recently characterized p1.198 clone (3Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 2. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the 5′ end of the p1.199 genomic insert terminated at a Sau3AI site located 5.26 kb upstream of HCR.2 and within the third intron of the apoC-I′ pseudogene (data not shown). The 43-kb MluI fragment of p1.199 (199.MM) contained the human apoC-IV/C-II genes and extended ∼20 kb downstream of the apoC-II gene. Transgenic mice generated with the 199.MM genomic fragment were examined for expression of human apoC-II and apoC-IV mRNA in six different tissues. RNase protection analysis of independent lines showed that human apoC-II and apoC-IV mRNA were expressed in the liver (Fig. 1), demonstrating that the HCR.2 sequence can direct hepatic expression of both apolipoprotein genes. Recent work showed that apoC-IV mRNA was present in the livers of humans, mice, and rabbits but not in the intestine of humans (18Allan C.M. Taylor J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1510-1518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the intestine, kidney, spleen, brain, lung, heart, and testis of mice (34van Eck M.M. Hoffer M.J.V. Havekes L.M. Frants R.R. Hofker M.H. Genomics. 1994; 21: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), or the intestine, heart, kidney, brain, or skeletal muscle of rabbits (19Zhang L.-H. Kotite L. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1776-1783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, the apoC-IV construct 199.MM was expressed only in the liver. Other experiments showed that the human and rat apoC-II genes are expressed primarily in the liver and at low levels in enterocytes of the small intestine (35Myklebost O. Williamson B. Markham A.F.

We found that human apoC-II mRNA was detected at trace levels in the intestine of 199.MM transgenic mice but not in the other tissues examined. The lack of extrahepatic expression of human apoC-IV and apoC-II mRNAs in 199.MM animals also was consistent with the expression of both genes in transgenic mice prepared with the larger 198.KK fragment, as described below. By comparison, HCR.1.CII.H3 mice that contained only HCR.1 expressed the human apoC-IV transgene at higher than expected levels in nonhepatic tissues. Considered together, these observations suggest that the HCR.2 region may normally dominate the transcriptional regulation of the closely linked apoC-IV/C-II genes. The above findings raised the possibility that ligation of distal regulatory domains to the relatively small genomic fragments may result in artifactual expression of transgenes (i.e. the HCR.1.CH.H3 construct in Fig. 1). Therefore, a 70-kb genomicKpnI fragment of the p1.198 clone (198.KK) that included the entire apoE gene cluster (Fig. 2) was used to generate transgenic mice. Analysis of mouse genomic DNA by Southern blotting and PCR screening indicated that all four transgenes were present in 198.KK animals (Fig.2), and no rearrangements or deletions of the human"

To further characterize the major proteins present in a typical TM4SF protein complex, we raised monoclonal antibodies against proteins co-immunoprecipitated with CD81 from MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. Only two types of cell-surface proteins were recognized by our 35 selected antibodies. These included an integrin (α6β1) and three different TM4SF proteins (CD9, CD63, and NAG-2). The protein NAG-2 (novelantigen-2) is a previously unknown 30-kDa cell-surface protein. Using an expression cloning protocol, cDNA encoding NAG-2 was isolated. When aligned with other TM4SF proteins, the deduced amino acid sequence of NAG-2 showed most identity (34%) to CD53. Flow cytometry, Northern blotting, and immunohistochemistry showed that NAG-2 is widely present in multiple tissues and cell types but is absent from brain, lymphoid cells, and platelets. Within various tissues, strongest staining was seen on fibroblasts, endothelial cells, follicular dendritic cells, and mesothelial cells. In nonstringent detergent, NAG-2 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with other TM4SF members (CD9 and CD81) and integrins (α3β1and α6β1).

Our recent data have indicated that integrin-TM4SF protein complexes contain additional cell-surface components not yet identified. To characterize these proteins we utilized a systematic approach for generating and selecting mAbs against purified integrin-TM4SF complexes. A panel of mAbs was developed against integrin-TM4SF protein complexes that were purified using anti-CD81 mAb-coated beads. The CD81 protein was chosen for immunization because of its widespread distribution and because it is readily identified as a ∼22-kDa protein following cell-surface labeling. Notably, we found that all selected antibodies recognize either integrins or TM4SF proteins. Moreover, we have identified and characterized a novel TM4SF protein called NAG-2. Human B-cell lines, Raji, JY, and Ramos; T-cell lines, Jurkat and Molt-4; and a promyelocytic cell line, K562 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium.

Nature. 1978; 271: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-435 cells were surface-labeled with NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) or Na125I according to established protocols and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Brij 96 or 1% n-octyl glucoside, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble materials were pelleted at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the cell lysates were precleared by incubation with pansorbin (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected onto Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) that were pre-bound with mAb, followed by four washes with the immunoprecipitation buffer. For immunoprecipitation under stringent conditions, the Brij 96-immunoprecipitation buffer was supplemented with 0.2% SDS. Immune complexes were eluted from beads with Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by 8–12% SDS-PAGE.125I-Labeled proteins were detected using O-XAR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1–20 days at −70 °C. Biotin-labeled proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized with peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma) using Renaissance Chemiluminescent Reagents (NEN Life Science Products). Re-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described earlier (6Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein complexes were immunopurified using anti-NAG-2 mAb-conjugated Sepharose 4B from nonstringent (without 0.2% SDS) Brij 96 lysates of surface-biotinylated MDA-MB-435 cells. After five washes, the protein complexes were dissociated for 30 min at 4 °C with Brij 96 buffer containing 0.2% SDS. The eluates were subsequently reprecipitated with anti-TM4SF, anti-integrin mAbs, or control mAbs directly coupled to Sepharose 4B. Reciprocal re-immunoprecipitation experiments (in which NAG-2 was reprecipitated) were carried out similarly, except that MDA-MB-435 cells were labeled with125I. CD81-containing protein complexes were purified on mAb M38-coupled Sepharose 4B beads from Brij 96 cellular lysates prepared from MDA-MB-435 cells. After washes, immune complex-coupled Sepharose beads were used for immunization of a RBF/DnJ mouse. After three injections (each time with complexes derived from 1 to 2 × 109 cells), mouse serum was collected and tested by immunoprecipitation to verify antibody production. Four days after the fourth injection, hybridoma clones were produced as described previously (32Pasqualini R. Bodorova J. Ye S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 101-111PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were first analyzed by flow cytometry followed by immunoprecipitation using surface-biotinylated MDA-MB-435 cell lysates as described above. MDA-MB-435 cells (5 g) were lysed in 500 ml of buffer containing 1% n-octyl glucoside, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, and 60 μg/ml leupeptin. To remove background bead-binding material, the lysate was sequentially preincubated with protein A-Sepharose and Sepharose beads conjugated with irrelevant mouse mAbs. The precleared lysates were incubated with anti-NAG-2 mAb-conjugated Sepharose beads packed in a 2-ml column. After washing the column, the NAG-2 protein was eluted using 50 mm glycine, pH 3.0, and the fractions were immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the fraction containing the NAG-2 antigen was determined by silver staining. Larger quantities of this fraction were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The 30-kDa band corresponding to the NAG-2 protein was visualized by Ponceau S staining, excised from the membrane, and then amino-terminal sequencing was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 470A gas-phase sequenator equipped with a 120A phenylhydantoin amino acid analyzer (Harvard microsequencing facility, Cambridge, MA). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from MDA-MB-435 cells, and double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized using Copy Kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). To facilitate the subcloning procedure,BstXI adapters were placed on the 5′-end of cDNAs. After size fractionation by gel electrophoresis, cDNAs of 0.7–2.0 kb were excised and ligated into pCDM8 expression vectors (Invitrogen). Then MC1061/P3 bacterial cells were transformed with ligated cDNA library and plated to 54 plates at a density of 1,900 clones/plate. Amplified cDNAs (54 separate pools) were collected and purified using QIAwell Plasmid Purification System (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). For screening, CHO/P cells (6 × 104/well) were grown on 24-well culture plates and then transiently transfected with each pool of amplified cDNAs using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 18 h, transfected CHO/P cells were stained with anti-NAG-2 mAb, fixed with methanol, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Positive cells were visualized using ImmunoPure Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate Kit (Pierce) and light microscopy. Pools of cDNA yielding one or more NAG-2-positive CHO/P cells were further subfractionated three more times, until a single clone conferring NAG-2 staining was identified. Both strands of NAG-2 cDNA were sequenced by Sanger's sequencing method using dye-labeled dideoxy nucleotides as terminators. Samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystem 373A automated DNA sequencer (33Smith L.M. Sanders J.Z. Kaiser R.J. Hughes P. Dodd C. Connell C.R. Heiner C. Kent S.B. Hood L.E. Nature. 1986; 321: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Protein data base searches were carried out using BLASTP via the NCBI BLAST network service (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71457) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity plot analysis was performed by the Kyte and Doolittle method (35Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar) with a window of seven residues using the computer software DNA Strider. Multiple sequence alignments and similarity calculations were performed with the extended GCG sequence analysis software package (36Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of primary mouse mAbs for 45 min at 4 °C, washed twice, and then labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). NAG-2 cDNA insert was excised from pCDM8 vector with XbaI and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using RadPrime DNA Labeling System (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blot filters of multiple human tissues (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized with the labeled probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe was stripped off by boiling the filter in sterile H2O containing 0.5% SDS and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled human β-actin cDNA. Radioactive bands were detected by autoradiography. Fresh tissue was obtained from material submitted to the Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO. The tissue was embedded in OCT compound (Miles Laboratory, Elkart, IN), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane, and stored at −70 °C. Frozen sections (6 μm thick) were fixed briefly in acetone and held at −20 °C before staining with anti-NAG-2 mAb and detection with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector, Burlingame, CA), as described previously (37Zutter M.M. Blood. 1991; 77: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were counterstained with methyl green. To identify new membrane antigens that associate with TM4SF proteins, we have utilized a monoclonal antibody generation and selection strategy, similar to that described in the accompanying paper (38Berditchevski F. Chang S. Bodorova J. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29174-29180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Beads coated with anti-CD81 mAb were incubated with MDA-MB-435 cell lysate under non-stringent detergent conditions, and then the isolated bead-protein complexes were used to immunize mice. As shown (Fig. 1, lane c) the resulting mouse immune serum immunoprecipitated a protein co-migrating with CD81 (arrow), as well as several additional biotinylated proteins from MDA-MB-435 cells. Most of these proteins were not precipitated by preimmune serum (lane d). The biotinylated proteins directly immunoprecipitated by mouse sera (lane c) using stringent detergent conditions (1% Brij 96, 0.2% SDS) closely resemble those indirectly co-precipitated by an anti-CD81 mAb (lane a) under nonstringent (Brij 96) conditions. Notably, a control experiment (lane b) shows that anti-CD81 mAb precipitated mostly CD81 under stringent conditions. From these results we conclude that the mouse was adequately immunized to make antibodies directly recognizing CD81-associated cell-surface proteins. After four injections with CD81 complexes, 560 hybridomas were prepared, and supernatants were tested by flow cytometry to show that 35 hybridoma clones produced antibodies to cell-surface molecules on MDA-MB-435 cells. Secondary screening by non-stringent immunoprecipitation then was used to confirm whether these 35 mAbs indeed co-precipitated a protein resembling CD81. Immunoprecipitations from four representative antibodies are shown in Fig.2. Under nonstringent conditions, these four antibodies (lanes c, e, g, and i) as well as anti-CD81 (lane a) each precipitated a similar protein pattern that included a ∼22-kDa component co-migrating with CD81. In contrast, under stringent conditions mAb M38 yielded only CD81 (lane b), mAb 4D5 yielded a CD9-like protein (lane f), and mAb 8H6 recognized solely an α6integrin-like protein (lane j). The antigens directly recognized by mAb 1E5 (lane d) and 5C12 (lane h) were not obvious, possibly because these proteins are not very well labeled with biotin. A weak nonspecific 70-kDa band appeared in all lanes upon long exposure. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation data under stringent conditions indicated that none of the 35 selected mAbs recognized CD81 itself. Notably, mAb 1E5, along with 29 other mAb, selectively stained CD63-positive CHO transfectants, thus establishing conclusively that these 30 mAbs recognize CD63. Similarly, mAb 4D5 and another mAb selectively stained CD9-transfected HT1080 cells, and mAb 8H6 selectively stained α6-transfected K562 cells, thus confirming CD9 and α6 assignments from Fig. 2. Two other antibodies (5C12 and 2E12) failed to stain hamster or mouse transfectants expressing human α3, α6, or β1 integrin subunits or either of the TM4SF protein transfectants. Competitive antibody binding assays revealed that the two antibodies of unknown specificity seemed to recognize the same or overlapping antigenic epitopes on the surface of MDA-MB-435 cells (data not shown). This putative novel antigen was named NAG-2. Although not labeled with biotin (Fig. 2, lane h), the NAG-2 protein could be125I-labeled and immunoprecipitated under stringent conditions from MDA-MB-435 cells as a somewhat diffuse protein band of 28–35 kDa (Fig. 3). This band was not seen in CD81 (M38), integrin β1 (TS2/16), or negative control (mAb P3) immunoprecipitations. To characterize further NAG-2, ∼23 pmol of protein was purified from MDA-MB-435 cells using an anti-NAG-2 immunoaffinity column. Amino-terminal analysis of the purified material yielded a “RA-LQAVKY” sequence that was not present in the GenBank data base. A cDNA expression library was prepared from MDA-MB-435 cells and transiently transfected into CHO/P cells for screening, based on cell-surface staining with anti-NAG-2 mAb. One of 54 separate pools of clones yielded a few visibly stained CHO/P cells (out of 6 × 104 cells plated). After three more rounds of subfractionation, a single clone was isolated that was capable of conferring anti-NAG-2 staining upon transfection into CHO/P cells. The entire cDNA sequence of NAG-2 and its corresponding amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 4 A. It contains a 5′-untranslated sequence of 104 base pairs, a single extended open reading frame of 714 base pairs, followed by 540 base pairs of 3′-untranslated region containing a polyadenylation signal. The first ATG codon of the open reading frame is within a Kozak consensus translation initiation sequence (39Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The deduced 238 amino acids include the partial sequence obtained by amino-terminal analysis (underlined). The predicted protein molecular mass (26,177 Da) is slightly smaller than that observed in Fig. 3. PotentialN-glycosylation sites are located at residues 152 and 161. A hydrophobicity plot revealed four highly hydrophobic domains, each sufficiently long to span cellular membranes (Fig. 4 B). In addition, BLASTP searching revealed sequence similarity between the NAG-2 protein and TM4SF proteins, with CD53 (a TM4SF protein expressed on leukocytes) showing the most similarity (51% similarity, 34% identity). The NAG-2 protein sequence was aligned with known human TM4SF proteins (Fig. 4 C). For NAG-2 and other TM4SF proteins, conserved sequences are mostly within the putative transmembrane domains. In contrast, the extracellular domains are more divergent in terms of length, sequence, and degree of glycosylation. However, NAG-2 does contain four characteristic cysteine residues, within the large extracellular domain between transmembrane domains III and IV, that are highly conserved among nearly all TM4SF proteins. In addition, a search of the dbEST sequence data base revealed five overlapping expressed sequence tags, from which a complete putative murine NAG-2 sequence was constructed (Fig. 4 D). Notably, the level of identity (95%) between the murine and human protein sequences is unusually high. Other TM4SF proteins (e.g.CD53, CD82, CD37, and CD63) typically show 82–83% identity between human and mouse proteins. The TM4SF proteins CD53 and CD63 were previously shown to be associated with phosphatase activity (40Carmo A.M. Wright M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we carried out similar phosphatase assays, utilizing immune complexes from MDA 435 cells lysed in 1% Brij 96. Activity was determined by measuring the conversion ofp-nitrophenyl phosphate to the yellow-coloredp-nitrophenol product. As indicated (Fig.5, A and B), phosphatase activity was readily detected in association with CD63 immune complexes in two separate experiments. However, there was minimal phosphatase activity associated with NAG-2 immune complexes (obtained using two different antibodies). Likewise, the activity associated with CD9 or CD81 was not appreciably above the negative control activities seen with mAb P3 or anti-CD109 mAb. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that NAG-2 protein is expressed most strongly on a human melanoma cell line (LOX), a fibrosarcoma line (HT-1080), and the breast carcinoma line (MDA-MB-435) and shows variable levels on other human sarcoma and carcinoma cell lines derived from various tissues. Also, NAG-2 showed little or no expression on several hematopoietic cell lines and was absent from normal peripheral blood T-cells and platelets (Table I). Northern blot analysis showed that a 1.5-kb transcript of NAG-2 is present in all human tissues analyzed with the exception of brain (Fig.6). Expression is especially strong in spleen, colon, and pancreas. Heart and skeletal muscle have an additional 6.5-kb NAG-2 transcript.Table IExpression of NAG-2 protein in cultured human cellsCellsCellsB-cellsFibrosarcoma Raji− HT1080+++ JY− Ramos+Rhabdomyosarcoma RD+T-cellsBreast carcinomas Jurkat+ MDA-MB-435+++ Molt-4− MDA-MB-231− peripheral blood− MCF7−PromyelocyticLung carcinoma K562++ A549+Platelets−Colon carcinomasMelanoma MIP 101− LOX+++ CCL 221+ CCL 227++Neuroblastomas CCL 228+ IMR-32+ SK-N-SH++Vulval carcinoma A431+Cells were stained using anti-NAG-2 mAb and analyzed by FACScan.

Staining was scored as −, +, ++, or +++ if mean fluorescence intensity was <2-fold, 2–5 fold, 5–10-fold, or >10-fold higher than that of P3 control mAb. Frozen section immunohistochemistry was carried out to characterize further the distribution of NAG-2 protein. The NAG-2 protein was widely expressed in all tissues evaluated but was present in a restricted repertoire of cell types (Table II). High levels of NAG-2 were observed on vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts in all tissues. The spleen, composed of a meshwork of branching vascular cords and sinusoids, expressed the highest levels of NAG-2 (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, red pulp cords, thin walled vessels, lymphocytes of the lymphoid follicles, and periarterial lymphoid sheaths were entirely negative. Also, spleen showed greater NAG-2 expression in veins, sinusoids, and small arteries, compared with thick walled arteries (Fig.7 A).Table IIHistologic distribution of the NAG-2 proteinCell typeIntensityFibroblasts3+Endothelial cells3–4+Smooth mu"

CD11c/CD18 is primarily found on myeloid cells and its expression is regulated during myeloid differentiation by transcriptional mechanisms acting on the CD11c gene promoter. We now describe that CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) contribute to the basal, tissue-specific and developmentally regulated activity of the CD11c promoter. A C/EBP-binding site within the CD11c promoter (CEBP-80) is bound by CEBPα in undifferentiated U937 cells and by C/EBPα- and C/EBPβ-containing dimers in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiating cells, and its disruption decreased the CD11c promoter activity in a cell type-dependent manner. C/EBPα transactivated the CD11c promoter through the CEBP-80 element, and C/EBPα transactivation was also dependent on the Sp1–70- and Sp1–120 Sp1-binding sites. The −90/−50 fragment from the CD11c promoter, containing the adjacent CEBP-80, Sp1–70, and AP1–60 sites, differentially enhanced the activity of the minimal prolactin promoter in hematopoietic and epithelial cells.

Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 771-795Google Scholar). The C/EBP family includes, at least, six members (C/EBPα, β, γ, δ, ε, and CHOP-10/GADD153) which dimerize in a tissue-specific manner, and with highly homologous dimerization and DNA contact domains, and similar DNA binding activities. Members of the C/EBP family have been implicated in regulating the differentiation of distinct mammalian cells, including adipocytes, hepatocytes, and myelomonocytes (27McKnight S. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 771-795Google Scholar). In fact, C/EBPα, β, and δ expression within the hematopoietic system is restricted to myeloid cells. Based on these facts, and considering the preferential expression of the CD11c/CD18 integrin in differentiated myeloid cells, we have analyzed the role of C/EBP factors in the expression of the CD11c integrin gene in myeloid and other cell types. In the present report we describe the structural and functional characterization of a C/EBP-binding site (CEBP-80) within the CD11c promoter whose occupancy is regulated in a cell type- and differentiation-dependent manner and whose disruption preferentially affects the activity of the CD11c promoter in myeloid cells. The positive regulatory effect of C/EBPα on the activity of the CD11c promoter is dependent on adjacent cis-acting elements (Sp1–120, Sp1–70, AP-60). Our results demonstrate the contribution of the C/EBP transcription factors to the tissue-restricted and differentiation-regulated expression of the CD11c/CD18 integrin, reveal a functional interplay among C/EBP, Sp1, and AP-1 family members and identify a cell type-dependent enhancer-like element within the proximal regulatory region of the CD11c promoter. The human cell lines HeLa (epithelial carcinoma), JY (lymphoblastoid B), U937 (histiocytic lymphoma), HL-60 (myelomonocytic leukemia), THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia), and HepG2 (hepatoma), as well as the murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line, were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (complete medium), at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Induction of differentiation of U937 and HL-60 was carried out with PMA at 5 ng/ml for 48 h (HL-60) or 10 ng/ml for 24 h (U937) and at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml (16Bellón T. López-Rodrı́guez C.

U937, HL-60, HeLa, and JY cells were transfected by electroporation or using Lipofectin, as described previously (22López-Cabrera M. Nueda A. Vara A. Garcia-Aguilar J. Tugores A. Corbı́ A.L. J.

RAW 264.7 and HepG2 were transfected using dioleoyloxypropiltrimethylammonium methylsulfate following the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). PMA treatment was always carried out 16–20 h before luciferase determinations. The amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized by using carrier DNA. For comparative purposes between cell lines and reporter gene constructs, transfection efficiencies were normalized by cotransfection with the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMV-βgal. The activity of each reporter construct was expressed relative to the activity produced by the wild type reporter construct (pCD11C160-Luc) in each cell line (relative promoter activity). Transactivation experiments in SL2 cells were carried out with Lipofectin, as described previously (23López-Rodrı́guez C. Chen H. Tenen D.G. Corbı́ A.L. Eur. J.

Transactivation experiments in HeLa cells used 0.5 μg of the corresponding reporter plasmid and 5 μg of the distinct expression vectors for C/EBPα (MSV-EBPα), C/EBPβ (MSV-EBPβ), or C/EBPδ (MSV-EBPδ), which were kindly provided by Dr. S. McKnight (Tullarik Inc., South San Francisco, CA). To measure the transactivation activity of each plasmid, promoter activity induction was defined as the ratio of relative light units in cells transfected with expression vector to the relative light units produced by cells transfected with an equimolar amount of insertless vector (pEMBL19 including the MSV promoter), after background substraction and normalizing for cell number (25Rubio M.A. López-Rodrı́guez C.

López-Rodrı́guez and A. L. Corbı́, manuscript in preparation. Construction of the pCD11C160(−80mut)-Luc plasmid, harboring mutations at CEBP-80 which disrupt C/EBP-binding, was accomplished by a double polymerase chain reaction procedure on the CD11c promoter insert in pCD11C160-Luc, using oligonucleotides pXP2–160 (5′-CTTGGATCCAAGCCAAGTCATCTGATGAGAG-3′) (25Rubio M.A. López-Rodrı́guez C.

Nueda A. Aller P. Armesilla A.L. Vegam M.A. Corbı́ A.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 3715-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the downstream polymerase chain reaction fragment. Both polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested withBamHI/SpeI and SpeI/XhoI, respectively, and ligated intoBamHI/XhoI-digested pXP2. All mutations and constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To evaluate the influence of the fragment containing the CEBP-80, Sp1–70, and AP1–60 sites on an heterologous promoter, the doublestranded oligonucleotide CESpAP (5′-GATCGTCGACGATCAGTTGCGTACTCTGCCCGCCCCCTCTGACTCATGCTCTAGACTCGAGGCAT-3′) was synthesized, spanning nucleotides −90/−50 from the CD11c promoter and including a SalI site at the 5′-end and aXhoI site at the 3′-end. The CESpAP sequence was placed upstream of the rat minimal prolactin promoter/luciferase cDNA unit within the pRL-Luc plasmid, and both in the sense and antisense orientations. To produce dimers of the −90/−50 fragment arranged in a head-to-tail orientation, the CESpAP oligonucleotide was self-ligated and the resulting product subjected to digested with SalI and XhoI. The XhoI- and SalI-resistant dimers were isolated and purified by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently cloned into XhoI-digested pRL-Luc. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. EMSA was performed basically as described (26López-Rodrı́guez C. Kluin-Nelemans H.C. Corbı́ A.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3780-3787PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ng of the corresponding CD11c promoter-based probes were labeled using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (7 units) and 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP to an specific activity of approximately 108 cpm/μg. After incubation of 0.5 ng of probe with 2–5 μg of nuclear extract for 20 min at 4 °C, 12 μl of each reaction was separated by electrophoresis at 15 V/cm and 4 °C on 5% polyacrylamide gels. For inhibition assays, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides (100-fold molar excess) and polyclonal antisera were preincubated with the nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 30 min before the addition of the probe. Rabbit antisera against C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (anti-C/EBPα), and kindly provided by Dr. V. Poli (anti-C/EBPβ, Istituto de Ricerche di Biologia Molecolare, Rome, Italy), Dr. S. McKnight (anti-C/EBPα, anti-C/EBPβ, and anti-C/EBPδ, Tullarik Inc., South San Francisco, CA), and Dr. U. Schibler (anti-C/EBPβ, Université de Géneve, Switzerland). Nuclear extract preparation was done as described (23López-Rodrı́guez C. Chen H. Tenen D.G. Corbı́ A.L. Eur. J.

The CD11c promoter-based oligonucleotide Box D used for EMSA was (−94) 5′-CCTCGGATCAGTTGCGTACTCTGCC-3′ (−70), while those used for competition experiments included CEBP-CONS (consensus binding site for C/EBP proteins), CEBP-CONSmut, 2xMyb (containing two Myb-binding sites)(30), E4TF1 (including a GABP/E4TF1-binding site) (31Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and Box A, a CD11c-derived oligonucleotide including promoter sequences −19/−3 (5′-TCTGCCCACTTGCTTCC-3′) that contains the E-box sequence CACTTG. For determination of the nucleotides implicated in C/EBP binding, oligonucleotides including distinct mutations on the sequences surrounding CEBP-80 were used, and their relative positions and mutations are shown in Fig. 1 A. We have previously demonstrated that recombinant c-Myb binds the Myb-85 element within the CD11c promoter (25Rubio M.A. López-Rodrı́guez C. Nueda A. Aller P. Armesilla A.L. Vegam M.A. Corbı́ A.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 3715-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since Myb-85 (−86 CAGTTGC −80) overlaps an E-box sequence (−86CANNTG −81) and a sequence closely conforming to the consensus C/EBP-binding site (32Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) (−84 GTTGCGTA −77) (Fig.1 A), an oligonucleotide spanning from −94 to −70 (Box D) was subjected to EMSA to determine the pattern of protein binding to this region of the CD11c promoter. As shown in Fig. 1 B, myeloid U937 nuclear extracts produced specific retarded complexes on Box D (marked CEBP) whose formation was prevented by a 100-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide probe and whose intensity and mobility differed among cell types (Fig.2 and data not shown). To determine whether the formation of the retarded species was dependent on either E-box or Myb-binding site, inhibitory experiments were performed with consensus and mutated oligonucleotides (Fig.1 B). The specific complexes were not inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of a Myb-binding site (25Rubio M.A. López-Rodrı́guez C. Nueda A. Aller P. Armesilla A.L. Vegam M.A. Corbı́ A.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 3715-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hernández-Munain C. Krangel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by an oligonucleotide from the CD11c promoter containing a distinct E-box (CACTTG) or by an additional unrelated sequence containing a GABP(E4TF1)-binding site (31Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)(Fig. 1). On the other hand, an oligonucleotide containing a consensus C/EBP-binding site (CEBP-CONS) completely prevented the formation of the retarded species, while CEBP-CONSmut, where the consensus C/EBP site is disrupted, had no effect on complex formation (Fig. 1 B). In addition, while mutations at positions flanking the putative C/EBP-binding site abolished complex formation (Box Dmut2, Box Dmut 3), mutations that completely prevent c-Myb binding and eliminate the E-box sequence (Box Dmut1)(25) only partially affected CEBP complex formation (Fig. 1, A andB). By contrast, Box Dmut4 oligonucleotide did not inhibit complex formation (Fig. 1). Altogether, these results indicated that the sequence −83 TTGCGTA −77 (hereafter termed CEBP-80) overlaps the Myb-85 element but is bound by proteins with a DNA-binding specificity distinct from c-Myb. Instead, the CEBP-80 element is bound by factors which recognize high affinity C/EBP-binding sites and require an intact TTGCGTA sequence. The identity of the involved factors was unambiguously determined through the use of polyclonal antisera against members of the C/EBP protein family. As shown in Fig. 2, the specific interactions in U937 were either supershifted or completely prevented by polyclonal antisera against C/EBPα, while certain anti-CEBPβ antisera weakly affected complex formation and anti-C/EBPδ antiserum had no effect. Therefore, the CD11c promoter CEBP-80 element is specifically recognized by transcription factors of the C/EBP family which, in the case of undifferentiated U937 cells, are predominantly C/EBPα homodimers and with a minor proportion of C/EBPβ-containing dimers (Fig. 2). The pattern of C/EBP-80-bound proteins differed among cell types, even within the same cell lineage (Figs. 2 and 3, and data not shown). Nuclear extracts from activated B cells and hairy cell leukemia cells exhibited a single and faint retarded complex, while those seen in monocytes were more heterogeneous and with a higher mobility (Fig. 2). Within the myeloid lineage, the level of CEBP-80-bound complexes, the relative proportion of C/EBPβ and C/EBPα, and the changes in CEBP80-bound factors associated with myeloid differentiation also differed among the HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cell lines, with C/EBPδ-containing complexes only seen in THP-1 cells (Fig.3). Monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells greatly increased CEBP-80-bound species while PMA-mediated differentiation of U937 dramatically reduced the levels of CEBP-80-bound C/EBP factors (Fig. 2). Kinetic studies revealed the appearance of C/EBPβ- and C/EBPδ-containing dimers along U937 differentiation and indicated that CEBP-80-bound factors are undetectable 48 h after PMA addition in U937 cells (Fig.4). As a whole, the structural analysis revealed that C/EBPα-, C/EBPβ-, and C/EBPδ-containing dimers bind specifically to the CEBP-80 element in the CD11c gene promoter and in a cell type- and differentiation-dependent manner.Figure 4Pattern of C/EBP binding to CEBP-80 along PMA-triggered U937 monocytic differentiation. EMSA was performed on the Box D oligonucleotide using nuclear extracts from U937 cells either untreated (−) or treated with PMA for the indicated times, and either in the absence or presence of competitor oligonucleotides (Box D) or polyclonal antisera against C/EBPα, β, or δ (kindly provided by Dr. S. McKnight). The specific retarded species are denoted by CEBP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The differential occupancy of the CEBP-80 element suggested that it might contribute to the tissue specific activity of the CD11c promoter. The functional effect of mutations abolishing C/EBP binding to CEBP-80 were determined in transient transfection assays and indicated that CEBP-80 disruption greatly decreased the CD11c promoter activity in all the human myeloid cell lines tested (Fig. 5). The CD11c promoter activity dropped to 11% in HL-60 cells, 16% in U937 cells, and 20% in the more differentiated mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line (Fig. 5). Mutation of CEBP-80 had a lower effect in other cell types as the promoter activity decreased to 40% in the JY lymphoblastoid cell line, to 46% in the epithelial carcinoma HeLa cell line, and to 60% in HepG2 hepatoma cells (Fig. 5). Therefore, disruption of the CEBP-80 element caused a cell type-dependent decrease in the activity of the CD11c promoter, indicating that C/EBP binding to CEBP-80 might directly contribute to the tissue-restricted expression of the CD11c/CD18 integrin. The constitutive expression of C/EBPα in undifferentiated myeloid cells (33Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that C/EBPα might be responsible for most of the positive regulatory effect of CEBP-80 on the activity of the CD11c promoter and, consequently, transactivation experiments were performed in HeLa cells. Expression of C/EBPα significantly augmented the activity of the CD11c promoter (2-fold increase), an effect which was absolutely dependent on the integrity of the CEBP-80 element (Fig.6). On the other hand, transfection of expression plasmids for C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ under similar conditions had no effect on the activity of the CD11c promoter (Fig. 6), while the activity of the CD11a promoter increased upon transfection of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ (Fig. 6). Therefore, C/EBPα contributes to the activity of the CD11c promoter through recognition of the CEBP-80 element. C/EBP and Sp1 factors can recognize their respective binding sites within the CD11c promoter independently of one another (Ref. 23López-Rodrı́guez C. Chen H. Tenen D.G. Corbı́ A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3496-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and this paper): C/EBP factors bind the Box D oligonucleotide, which does not include any Sp1-binding site, and Sp1 interacts with Sp1–70 or Sp1–120 in the absence of any C/EBP-binding site (23López-Rodrı́guez C. Chen H. Tenen D.G. Corbı́ A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3496-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the Sp1 contribution to the tissue specific activity of the CD11c promoter (23López-Rodrı́guez C. Chen H. Tenen D.G. Corbı́ A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3496-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the cell type-dependent influence of CEBP-80 on the CD11c promoter activity, and the proximity of the Sp1–70, Sp1–120, and CEBP-80 elements prompted us to analyze whether C/EBP and Sp1 factors were functionally collaborating for the tissue-restricted expression of CD11c. The effect of CEBP-80 disruption on the Sp1 transcriptional activity was evaluated in transactivation experiments inDrosophila SL2 cells, which are devoid of Sp1, and revealed that mutation of CEBP-80 led to a consistent increase in the CD11c promoter transactivation by Sp1 (2–3-fold), indicating that occupancy of CEBP-80 influences the positive transcriptional activity of Sp1 on the CD11c promoter (data not shown). To determine whether integrity of Sp1-binding sites is required for the C/EBPα transcriptional activity on the CD11c promoter, the inverse set of experiments was"

It is associated with an abnormal CAG repeat expansion resulting in formation of a protein with an elongated polyglutamine stretch. However, neither the physiological roles of the DRPLA gene product nor molecular mechanisms of its pathogenesis have yet been elucidated. Here we report that the DRPLA protein is cleaved at a site near the N terminus during apoptosis induced by VP-16, staurosporine, or glucocorticoid. Moreover, thein vitro translated DRPLA protein is cleaved by recombinant caspase-3, a member of the cysteine protease family, which is thought to be a main executioner of apoptosis. Using mutant DRPLA proteins, the cleavage site was identified as 106DSLDG110. The cleavage, however, was not modulated by the length of the polyglutamine stretch. These findings suggest that the DRPLA protein is one of the physiological substrates of caspase-3, and its cleavage may result in structural and biochemical alterations associated with apoptosis.

Here we report that the DRPLA protein is cleaved at a site near the N terminus during apoptosis induced by VP-16, staurosporine, or glucocorticoid. Moreover, thein vitro translated DRPLA protein is cleaved by recombinant caspase-3, a member of the cysteine protease family, which is thought to be a main executioner of apoptosis. Using mutant DRPLA proteins, the cleavage site was identified as 106DSLDG110. The cleavage, however, was not modulated by the length of the polyglutamine stretch. These findings suggest that the DRPLA protein is one of the physiological substrates of caspase-3, and its cleavage may result in structural and biochemical alterations associated with apoptosis. Apoptosis is an indispensable phenomenon for normal development and maintenance of homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Although the signal transduction of apoptotic stimuli remains unclear, accumulating evidence indicates that various types of apoptotic signals ultimately converge on the activation of the same machinery. The components of this machinery are cysteine proteases belonging to a caspase family (1Martin S.J. Green D.R.

So far, about 10 members have been identified including interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE or caspase-1) (3Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar) and caspase-3 (CPP32/Yama/Apopain) (4Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M.

Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these enzymes is synthesized as a proenzyme, and then proteolytically activated. Like systems in blood clotting and complement activation, the protease cascade is known to exist where one protease activation can lead to processing of the same or other members of the caspase family. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; DRPLA, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. was identified for the first time as a substrate of the caspase family (5Tewari M.

Since the function of PARP is associated with genome maintenance and DNA repair, the cleavage of PARP may play an important role during apoptosis. However, it is unlikely that its cleavage is essential for apoptosis since PARP-deficient mice do not show any deregulation of apoptosis (7Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Therefore, there must be other substrates that are critical for apoptosis, or more likely, the coordinated degradation of several key proteins is necessary for the execution of apoptosis. At least 10 proteins are known to be cleaved during apoptosis, including nuclear lamins, actin, a 70-kDa protein component of the U1-ribonucleoprotein (U1–70 kDa), DNA-dependent protein kinase, and DNA fragmentation factor (8Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 9Mashima T. Naito M.

Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). To elucidate the final step of apoptosis, other candidates of the “death substrates” cleaved during apoptosis need to be identified. Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia, myoclonic epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and choreoathetotic movement. Pathological findings of the brain were represented as combined degeneration of dentatofugal and pallidofugal pathways. We and others previously found expansion of unstable CAG repeats of the DRPLA gene of the patients (13Nagafuchi S. Yanagisawa H. Sato K. Shirayama T. Ohsaki E. Bundo M. Takeda T. Tadokoro K. Kondo I. Murayama N. Tanaka Y. Kikushima H. Umino K. Kurosawa H. Furukawa T. Nihei K. Inoue T. Sano A. Komure O. Takahashi M. Yoshizawa T. Kanazawa I. Yamada M. Nat.

Miike T. Naito H. Ikuta F. Tsuji S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Although the physiological functions of the DRPLA gene product or the pathogenesis of DRPLA are still unclear, it is tempting to speculate that they are related to apoptosis for a number of reasons. First, neuronal death is reported to be apoptotic in other disorders such as Huntington disease or Machado-Joseph disease, which are also caused by expansion of CAG repeats (15Portera Cailliau C. Hedreen J.C. Price D.L. Koliatsos V.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3775-3787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ikeda H. Yamaguchi M. Sugai S. Aze Y. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Second, mice deficient for the Huntington disease gene show increased apoptosis and embryonic lethality (17Zeitlin S. Liu J.P. Chapman D.L. Papaioannou V.E. Efstratiadis A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Here we report that the DRPLA protein is proteolytically cleaved during apoptosis by caspase-3. Human teratocarcinoma cell line NT2 (Ntera2/D1, Stratagene) (18Andrews P.W. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) and human pre-B cell leukemia cell line 697 (19Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Blood. 1993; 81: 151-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Immunoblot assays were carried out as described previously (20Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1799-1805PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, resolved proteins (30 μg) in SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. Immunoblotting was performed using a 1:750 dilution of the primary anti-DRPLA antibody followed by a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as a second antibody, and the proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Corp.). A Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole were also used for some of the developments. Rabbit anti-DRPLA antisera were raised against GST-DRPLA fusion protein (see below). Prior to immunoblotting, the antisera were affinity-purified by using GST and protein A columns. To detect PARP, a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-PARP monoclonal antibody (Biomol) and a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins (DAKO) were used for the primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. To produce the GST-DRPLA fusion protein, a PstI-PstI fragment of DRPLA cDNA (nucleotides 2259–3158, residues 676–973) (21Nagafuchi S. Yanagisawa H. Ohsaki E. Shirayama T. Tadokoro K. Inoue T. Yamada M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was blunt-ended using T4 DNA polymerase and subcloned into the SmaI site of pGEX-3X (Pharmacia). pMY1240 and pMY1247, which contained full-length DRPLA cDNA with 14- and 71-repeat CAG, respectively, were subcloned into a pBluescript SK vector. 2K. Nakamura, manuscript in preparation. To make a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of the DRPLA protein, pMY1240 was digested using the Kilo-sequencing deletion kit (Takara Shuzo, Japan) after digestion with EcoRI and KpnI. To disrupt each of the two potential caspase-3 cleavage sites (106DSLD109 and120DPRD123), a polymerase chain reaction overlap extension technique was used (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The following amplification primers were used with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and pMY1240 as a template: 5′-GGAGTGAGGAGATCTCAGAGAGTG-3′ (BglII site underlined); 5′-GGGTTCAAAGCTAGCCTCTGGCTG-3′ (NheI site underlined); 5′-GATCTGAATAGCTTGGCCGGGCGG-3′ (mutations underlined); 5′-CCGCCCGGCCAAGCTATTCAGATC-3′ (mutations underlined); 5′-AGCAGCGCCCCTAGGGCTATCGAC-3′ (mutations underlined); 5′-GTCGATAGCCCTAGGGGCGCTGCT-3′ (mutations underlined). The final polymerase chain reaction products were gel-purified, digested with BglII and NheI, and subcloned into BglII and NheI sites of pMY1240 to produce the plasmids pNSLA and pAPRA (mutations underlined). Cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl). 30 μl of cell lysate were mixed with 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and 50 μl of 100 mm Ac-DEVD-MCA (Peptide Institute, Inc., Japan) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. A standard curve was prepared using solutions of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin at various concentrations in the reaction buffer. The fluorescence of the cleaved substrates was measured using a spectrofluorometer set at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. One unit corresponds to the activity that cleaves 1 nmol of Ac-DEVD-MCA at 37 °C in 2 h. The in vitro translated proteins were prepared using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega) and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine. Two μl of in vitrotranslation reaction mixture were incubated in cleavage buffer (50 mm PIPES/KOH (pH 6.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Chaps, 5 mm dithiothreitol) along with either apoptotic cell extracts (about 0.5 unit) or recombinant caspase-3 (20 μl final volume). Apoptotic cell extracts were prepared from 697 cells treated with 10−7m of dexamethasone for 24 h (23Miyashita T. Mami U. Inoue T. Reed J.C. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recombinant caspase-3 was kindly provided by M. Enari and S. Nagata (24Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) (Osaka University, Japan). For some of the reactions, we added various concentrations of Ac-YVAD-CHO or Ac-DEVD-CHO (Peptide Institute, Inc., Japan) which are specific inhibitors of caspase-1- or caspase-3-like proteases, respectively. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE after boiling at 95 °C for 5 min with Laemmli buffer. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Quantitative evaluation of DRPLA cleavage was performed using a BAS2000 Bio-Imaging analyzer (Fuji film). We first confirmed the specificity of the antibody used in this study that had been raised against GST-DRPLA fusion protein. As shown in Fig.1 A, the antibody reacted specifically with in vitro translated DRPLA proteins but not with an irrelevant protein, p53. As described previouly (25Yazawa I. Nukina N. Hashida H. Goto J. Yamada M. Kanazawa I. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the molecular masses of the DRPLA proteins containing 14 and 17 repeats of glutamine were 160 and 170 kDa, respectively, which were much larger than the predicted sizes based on their amino acid compositions (124 and 126 kDa, respectively). A nonspecific band was also detected at 135 kDa. We next assessed whether the DRPLA protein is cleaved during apoptosis. NT2 cells expressing a high level of the DRPLA protein were incubated with staurosporine, a broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, and VP-16 (etoposide), a topoisomerase II inhibitor, both of which induce apoptosis in a variety of cells (9Mashima T. Naito M. Fujita N. Noguchi K. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 26Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). 697 cells were treated with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid (23Miyashita T. Mami U. Inoue T. Reed J.C. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Treated cells were harvested at various intervals, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting. At zero time, the DRPLA protein was in the full-length 160-kDa form (Fig. 1, B, lanes 1 and 4, and D, lane 1). After certain hours of drug treatments, we observed a new band at 145 kDa (Fig. 1, B, lanes 2 and 6, andD, lane 4). The appearance of the cleaved PARP, a well known substrate of caspase-3, showed the same kinetics (Fig. 1,C and E), thus strongly suggesting that the DRPLA protein was cleaved during apoptosis. To address the question if the apoptotic lysate can really cleave the DRPLA protein, the in vitro translated DRPLA protein was incubated with apoptotic lysate obtained from 697 cells treated with dexamethasone. Kinetics of the caspase activity after treatment with dexamethasone was described previously (23Miyashita T. Mami U. Inoue T. Reed J.C. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, we observed an additional band of 145 kDa when incubated with apoptotic lysate but not with nonapoptotic 697 lysate (lanes 1 and 2). To determine if these cleavages are mediated by a member of the caspase family, the specific inhibitors of caspase-1- and caspase-3-like proteases, Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO, respectively, were added to the reaction mixtures. Cleavage of the in vitro translated DRPLA protein was almost completely inhibited with as little as 1 nm of Ac-DEVD-CHO, whereas the inhibition was negligible with the same concentration of Ac-YVAD-CHO (lanes 3 and 7) (IC50value of less than 1 nm for the former, and about 60 nm for the latter (Fig. 2 B)). These data indicate that the cleavage is mediated by a caspase-3-like protease but not by a caspase-1-like protease. To investigate the localization of the cleavage site, a series of C-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 3) as well as full-length cDNA were translated in vitro and incubated with apoptotic or nonapoptotic lysate. SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography revealed two bands from each sample incubated with the apoptotic lysate, one corresponding to an uncleaved protein and the other to a cleaved one (Fig. 4). The two bands in each lane showed the same difference in apparent molecular weights of the products. Therefore, we conclude that the cleavage site is located near the N terminus but not near the C terminus.Figure 4DRPLA protein is cleaved at a site near N terminus. In vitro translated proteins derived from a series of truncated DRPLA cDNAs depicted in Fig. 3 were incubated with either control (C) or apoptotic (A) 697 cell extracts and then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address the question if the responsible protease is caspase-3 itself or another protease(s) resembling caspase-3, we used recombinant caspase-3 prepared in Escherichia coli. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the pattern of cleavage observed with comparable units of recombinant caspase-3 was the same as that for the apoptotic lysate. These results show that the DRPLA protein is a novel substrate of at least caspase-3. To identify the exact cleavage site of the DRPLA protein, we searched for a DXXD motif, which is the consensus cleavage site for caspase-3 (27Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Three such motifs were found in the DRPLA protein, two of them were located near the N terminus (106DSLD109 and120DPRD123). Two plasmids, pNSLA and pAPRA, were generated to produce mutant DRPLA proteins in which either106DSLD109 or120DPRD123 was disrupted, respectively (Fig.3). The mutant DRPLA protein NSLA was not cleaved by caspase-3, while APRA showed the same cleavage pattern as the wild type protein (Fig.5 A, lanes 7 and 8). Therefore, we conclude that the cleavage site of the DRPLA protein is106DSLDG110. A faint cleaved product of NSLA may represent an alternative cleavage at120DPRD123 when106DSLD109 was disrupted (lane 8). Since patients with DRPLA are associated with expansion of unstable CAG repeats of the DRPLA gene, we next investigated whether the length of the polyglutamine tract affected the protein cleavage by caspase-3. Plasmids pMY1240 and pMY1247 which had 14 or 71 CAG repeats, respectively, were used for the analysis. In vitrotranslated proteins with different sizes of the polyglutamine tract were similarly cleaved by varying concentrations of recombinant caspase-3, indicating that the size of the CAG repeat does not modulate DRPLA cleavage by caspase-3 (Fig. 5, A andB). Activation of a group of cysteine proteases recently termed caspases is commonly observed during apoptosis triggered by a variety of stimuli (1Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 2Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). The importance of the caspase family for the execution of apoptosis is underscored by several findings. First, CED-3, a caspase homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans, is required for programmed cell death during development of the nematode (3Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Second, protease inhibitors specific for caspases have the ability to inhibit apoptosis (28Nicholson D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Third, mice deficient for a caspase such as caspase-1 or -3 show abnormal organ development or deregulations of apoptosis induced by some but not all kinds of signals (29Kuida K. Lippke J.A. Ku G. Harding M.W. Livingston D.J. Su M.S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 30Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). However, how the activation of these proteases can lead to the characteristic changes of apoptosis is totally unknown. Although more than 10 proteins are known to be cleaved during apoptosis, it has not yet been demonstrated that cleavage of any one of them is essential for apoptosis. Therefore, the identification of new substrates as well as novel caspases should provide an insight into the mechanism of apoptosis. In this report, we demonstrated that the DRPLA protein is cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis. It is cleaved in vivo with a very similar kinetics to PARP, one of the known substrates for caspase-3. To our knowledge, the DRPLA protein is the ninth substrate of caspase-3 demonstrated experimentally to date. The cleavage site was identified as 106DSLDG110, which is similar to the consensus sequence for the caspase-3 cleavage site, DP4 XXDP1 (27Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the DRPLA protein was cleaved at a physiological concentration of caspase-3. Excess amounts of caspase-3 could cleave proteins with less stringent requirements for the recognition sequence (data not shown). Obviously it is still possible that other members of the growing caspase family, either known or unknown, can also cleave this protein. Since the biological function of DRPLA is still unknown, it is elusive how important role the proteolysis of this protein plays during apoptosis. Moreover, the proposed roles for the cleavage of any substrates reported previously remain largely hypothetical. Interestingly, some substrates of caspases are nuclear repair proteins such as PARP, DNA-dependent protein kinase, or U1–70 kDa whose cleavage may result in the DNA degradation characteristic of apoptosis (7Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 10Tewari M. Beidler D.R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18738-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Casciola-Rosen L.A. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The cleavage of these proteins separates key functional domains of the molecule. In the light of these findings, it is intriguing that a bipartite nuclear localization signal (31Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) at the N terminus of the DRPLA protein (Fig. 3, 16RK KEAPGPREEL RSRGR32) is removed by proteolysis during apoptosis, possibly resulting in a loss of function. Although we previously detected the DRPLA gene product in the cytoplasm using immunohistochemistry (25Yazawa I. Nukina N. Hashida H. Goto J. Yamada M. Kanazawa I. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), it is still possible that a fraction of this protein in the nucleus may enter the cytoplasm after apoptotic cleavage. Alternatively, like DNA fragmentation factor (12Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar), it is also likely that the cleaved DRPLA protein can induce apoptosis. In this scenario, instead of the protective effect of the uncleaved protein, the cleaved fragments would be toxic to the cells or have a dominant negative effect. Some of the other known substrates for caspases such as nuclear lamins, actin, fodrin, the actin-associated protein, or Gas2, a component of the microfilament system (8Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 9Mashima T. Naito M. Fujita N.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5179-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) have important roles for maintaining cell structure. The DRPLA protein itself or its binding protein may be a member of such proteins. These various possibilities are currently under investigation. Recently it was shown that huntingtin, the Huntington disease gene product, is specifically cleaved by caspase-3 (34Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The mutation underlying Huntington disease is also expansion of CAG repeats. They also demonstrated that the rate of cleavage increases with the length of the polyglutamine tract, raising the possibility that such a cleavage is associated with the pathogenesis of Huntington disease. Unlike in Huntington disease, the cleavage rate of the DRPLA protein was not affected by the length of polyglutamine tract and the short N-terminal polypeptide resulting from the cleavage does not contain polyglutamine. Taken together, these results suggest that the cleavage of the DRPLA protein is not directly related to the pathogenesis of the disorder, but rather more likely associated with its physiological roles during apoptosis. Finally, caspase-3-deficient mice were reported recently. They showed specific defects in brain development such as protrusions of brain tissue or the indentation of the retinal neuroepithelium (30Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Thus, although the DRPLA protein is largely ubiquitously expressed in humans (21Nagafuchi S. Yanagisawa H. Ohsaki E. Shirayama T. Tadokoro K. Inoue T. Yamada M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), taking these results into consideration, it may also have a crucial role in brain development. We thank Drs. Masato Enari and Shigekazu Nagata for recombinant caspase-3. We acknowledge the technical assistance of Yuko Ohtsuka and Atsuko Asaka, and help in the manuscript preparation by Kayoko Saito."

Because tumor cells often are independent of this regulation, it is important to characterize the molecular pathways that control cellular proliferation after detachment of cells from their matrix. In this report, we investigated a possible role of p53 and one of its target genes, p21 waf1/cip1 , as components of anchorage-dependent cell growth control. We found that p53 protein is rapidly activated upon the disruption of cellular attachment. This led to p21 transcriptional activation via two p53-binding sites in its promoter. Elevated p21 protein levels blocked transcription and activity of the cell cycle-regulator cyclin A, and cells became arrested in G1 of the cell cycle. Under the same conditions, fibroblasts from p53 knock-out mice did not activate p21 and did not down-regulate cyclin A expression but rather induced another cell cycle inhibitor, p27. Thus, our results characterize a chain of events, starting from the activation of p53 and proceeding via p21 to cyclin A, that is activated in response to the loss of cellular adherence. This p53-regulated pathway may constitute one of a few redundant systems to ensure proper cell control in multicellular organisms.

This p53-regulated pathway may constitute one of a few redundant systems to ensure proper cell control in multicellular organisms. The proliferation of normal cells, with the exception of some hematopoietic cells, is strictly dependent on cell-matrix interactions. Nonadherent mesenchymal cells fail to proliferate despite the presence of growth factors, a characteristic called anchorage dependence. In contrast, many transformed cells have lost their anchorage dependence and grow independently of cell-matrix interactions. This anchorage-independent phenotype in cell culture has been found to closely correlate with the ability of cells to form tumors in animals (1Shin S.-I. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar).The proliferation of all cells, and their progression through the cell cycle, is regulated by the sequential activity of various cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). 1The abbreviations used are: cdks, cyclin-dependent kinases; CKIs, cdk inhibitors; HEMA, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; tk, thymidine kinase.1The abbreviations used are: cdks, cyclin-dependent kinases; CKIs, cdk inhibitors; HEMA, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; tk, thymidine kinase. The enzymatic activity of cdks is dependent on posttranslational modifications, as well as on physical interactions with one of the cyclin proteins that are the regulatory subunits of cdks (2Hunter T.

The expression of cyclins is stimulated in response to growth factor stimulation of resting (G0) cells and is required for cell cycle progression. In addition, there are two families of cdk inhibitors (CKIs) as follows: p21 waf1/cip1 , p27 kip1 , and p57 kip2 , which bind to and inactivate most cyclin-cdk complexes, and the INK4s, which only inhibit complexes containing cdk4 and cdk6 (4Harper J.W.

It is a transcription factor that binds to a specific DNA response element in the promoter of regulated genes, such as the muscle creatine kinase gene, the GADD45 gene, and theMDM-2 oncogene (8Bates S.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1557-1564PubMed Google Scholar).A link between cyclin expression and anchorage-dependent cell cycle progression has recently been established. In mouse and human fibroblasts, the serum-stimulated induction of cyclin A and cyclin D1 expression was dependent on cell adhesion (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 19Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 20Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In non-adherent cells, the expression of either mRNA and protein was blocked, and the cells were arrested in G1 of the cell cycle. However, the forced ectopic expression of either cyclin A or cyclin D1 cDNA resulted in anchorage-independent cell division, suggesting that both cyclins might be targets of the adhesion-dependent signals that control cell proliferation. At least part of this control might be exerted at the transcriptional level. Although one report suggested the involvement of the E2F-binding site in the cyclin A promoter (21Schulze A. Zerfass-Thome K. Berges J. Middendorp S. Jansen-Dürr P. Henglein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4632-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), another report indicated the presence of a novel CCAAT-binding protein that may mediate the adhesion-dependent transcriptional activation of cyclin A (22Krämer A. Carstens C.-P. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6579-6582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, another part of this control was exerted posttranscriptionally. It was shown that the kinase activity of cdk-cyclin E complexes was repressed after detachment of cells (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar,20Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).However, there appear to be cell type-specific differences in the control of anchorage-dependent growth, not only between normal and tumor cells but also between cell lines that are strictly anchorage-dependent. For example, in anchorage-dependent NIH3T3 cells there is no cyclin D synthesis after serum stimulation of G0-synchronized cells when the cells are detached (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Consequently, the retinoblastoma protein, a substrate of cdk4-cyclin D complexes, cannot become phosphorylated. Hence, retinoblastoma protein stays in its hypophosphorylated, active form and prevents cells from entering S phase. In contrast, in NRK cells, which are also anchorage-dependent, cyclin D synthesis is stimulated under the same conditions, and retinoblastoma protein becomes phosphorylated (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, the cells are still arrested in the cell cycle because they are unable to induce cyclin A expression to a level sufficient for proliferation. Together, these data also emphasize a certain redundancy in adhesion-dependent cell cycle control (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 19Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K.

Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).In our report, we sought to investigate molecular events that took place early after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions, and we analyzed their possible connection to later processes, such as the regulation of cyclin expression. In our studies, we found that p53 protein is rapidly activated upon the disruption of cellular attachment of logarithmically growing cells. This led to the transcriptional activation of the p21 gene via the two p53-binding sites in its promoter region. Elevated p21 protein levels blocked cyclin A transcription and activity and subsequently led to proliferation arrest in G1 of the cell cycle. In contrast, in cells lacking p53, p21 expression was not elevated, and cyclin A expression was not down-regulated; rather, in these cells another inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, p27, was induced after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions. Thus, our results characterize a cell type-specific chain of events that starts from the activation of p53, proceeds via p21, and targets cyclin A. This p53-regulated pathway may constitute one of several partially redundant systems to ensure proper cell control in multicellular organisms.RESULTSSeveral previous studies that analyzed the molecular mechanisms of anchorage dependence were performed by using G0-synchronized cells (18Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 19Guadagno T.M. Ohtsubo M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. Science. 1993; 262: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 20Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The studies showed that these cells, after detachment, were unable to induce expression of cyclin A and cyclin D1 in response to stimulation with serum growth factors and were not able to progress through the cell cycle. In our study presented here, we used cells that were growing logarithmically,i.e. that were distributed throughout the cell cycle at the onset of detachment. In contrast to G0-synchronized cells where the expression of cyclins is shut down and cdk activity is marginal, logarithmically growing cell cultures exhibit high levels of cyclin expression and cdk activity. Our goal was to determine how this highly active cell cycle machinery was controlled after the loss of cellular adherence.10T 1/2 murine fibroblasts were either cultured in plastic tissue culture dishes (adherent) or on top of agar or HEMA-coated dishes (non-adherent) in the continuous presence of serum growth factors. Under non-adherent conditions, the cells became growth-arrested and accumulated in G1 of the cell cycle (not shown). At the same time, the kinase activity associated with cyclin A-containing cdks was down-regulated rapidly (Fig.1).To determine the mechanisms of inhibition of cdk activity, we next analyzed the protein levels of various cdks and cyclins (Fig.2). Cyclin A protein was down-regulated and became undetectable at 36 h after the onset of detachment. Cyclin D1 was down-regulated as well but was still detectable after 48 h. There was also some decrease in cdc2 protein levels, and no decrease in cdk4 protein. Importantly, however, none of these proteins exhibited a decrease within the first 4 h (Fig. 2 B), which is the period when cyclin A-containing complexes lost most of their kinase activity. This finding indicated the effects of two regulatory mechanisms: the first one at the post-translational level which controls the enzymatic activity of the kinase (within the first few hours) and the second at the level of expression which controls the synthesis of the various kinase subunits (a later event).Figure 2Amounts of cell cycle-regulatory proteins in non-attached cells. Cells were detached and cultured on HEMA-coated plates to prevent adherence. At various time points, the cells were harvested, and the amount of the indicated proteins was determined by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. Shown are late (A) and early time points (B). cyc A, cyclin A; cyc D1, cyclin D1. For experimental details, see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because p21 waf1/cip1 and p27 kip1 are known posttranslational regulators of cdk activity, we analyzed their expression levels during the non-attached culture of cells (Fig.2 A). Whereas the amount of p27 protein did not increase during the course of the experiment, p21 protein levels increased 3-fold after detachment. Because this increase was already maximal at 4 h, we analyzed its kinetics of induction at earlier time points as well. We found that p21 expression was induced very early after detachment. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the increase in p21 protein could be detected already after 1 h and reached its maximum at 3–4 h. At these time points, there was no change in the levels of cyclin A, cyclin D1, cdc2, and cdk4 proteins (Fig. 2 B). Because cdks containing cyclin A are known targets for p21, our results suggest that the posttranslational inhibition of cdk activity after detachment of cells may be due to the increased levels of the cdk inhibitor p21.To test this directly, we investigated the amount of p21 protein in cyclin A-containing protein complexes. For this purpose, cyclin A was immunoprecipitated, and the collected complexes were analyzed for their p21 content by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3, the amount of p21 protein associated with these complexes was greatly increased after the loss of cellular adherence. This finding directly implicated p21 as a negative posttranslational regulator of cdk activity in response to cell-matrix disruption.Figure 3Amount of p21 protein in cyclin A-cdk complexes. Cells were detached and cultured on HEMA-coated plates for the indicated times. Total cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin A antibodies. The immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-agarose and separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

This experiment was repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine further whether elevated levels of p21 protein may also be involved in the observed down-regulation of cyclin A expression, we investigated the mechanisms of cyclin A down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the mRNA levels of cyclin A decline after cellular detachment and are undetectable at 24 h thereafter. This down-regulation appeared to start around 6 h, which is well after the induction of p21 protein (Fig. 2) and p21 mRNA (Fig. 4 B). This finding raised the possibility that elevated levels of p21 may result in decreased expression of cyclin A. To test this more directly, we co-transfected an expression vector containing p21 cDNA together with a luciferase reporter construct under the control of the cyclin A promoter. This co-transfection was performed in adherent cells to avoid the induction of the endogenous p21 gene (which occurs after detachment of cells). As shown in Fig. 5, elevated levels of p21 caused a decrease in cyclin A promoter activity, indicating that p21 protein is able to inhibit, directly or indirectly, transcription from the cyclin A promoter. Similarly, after detachment of cells,i.e. under conditions where the amount of endogenous p21 protein is increased, the activity of a transfected cyclin A promoter is reduced as well (not shown). As a control, we also transfected the promoter of a different gene, protein phosphatase type 2A. In this case, no down-regulation was observed neither during detachment (not shown) nor with co-transfected p21 cDNA (Fig. 5), indicating that the observed inhibitory effects on the cyclin A promoter were specific. Rather, there was a weak (1.6-fold) induction of the PP2A promoter. As PP2A has been characterized as a negative regulator of cell growth (34Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), this effect may warrant some further investigation in the future.Figure 4Northern blot analysis of detached cells. Cells were detached and cultured on HEMA-coated plates to prevent adherence. At the indicated time points, the cells were harvested, and the levels of cyclin A (cycA) (A) and p21 mRNA were determined by Northern blot analysis (B). As a control, the filters were also hybridized with a probe for β-actin mRNA (not shown for cyclin A filter). For experimental details, see “Experimental Procedures.” A, both bands are specific for cyclin A mRNA and are usually observed in murine cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Cyclin A promoter activity in the presence of transfected p21 cDNA. Cells were grown attached to cell culture dishes. They were transiently co-transfected with 4 μg of cyclin A-luciferase reporter construct (cyclin A) together with 2 μg of either an expression vector for p21 (+p21, black bars) or the same expression vector without the p21 cDNA insert (−p21,white bars). As a control, p21 cDNA was also co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the regulation of the promoter for serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A). 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined. Shown is the average of 3–5 independent experiments.

Because this control seemed to be exerted through elevated levels of p21, and because the tumor suppressor protein p53 had been shown to be a major regulator of p21 expression, we investigated whether the increased expression of p21 during detachment was controlled by p53.Two p53-binding sites have been identified in the p21 promoter and shown to bind p53 protein (11El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). One is located at −2225 and the other at −1330 with respect to the start of transcription of the gene. We used p21 promoter deletion mutants containing either both, only one, or none of the p53-binding sites, fused to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 6). After transfection of these constructs, the cells were split in half and cultured either under adherent or non-adherent conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, the p21 promoter containing both p53-binding sites (construct p21-wt) was induced nearly 5-fold after detachment of cells, as compared with adherent cells. When only one p53-binding site was present (construct p21-sm) this induction was reduced to 2-fold. The construct where both p53-binding sites had been deleted (p21-dm) was not induced at all.Figure 6Activation of the p21 promoter via p53-binding sites. Cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs. After transfection, the cells were scraped off the culture dish and divided in two. One-half was seeded back into a culture dish, and the other half was cultured on top of HEMA-coated plates. 24 h later all cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity. Shown is the ratio of luciferase activity between cells that were kept in suspension and cells that had re-attached to the tissue culture plate. Each bar represents the average of >3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the importance of the p53-binding sites further, we transferred the fragment of the p21 promoter, which contained the two binding sites, to a heterologous promoter, the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter. The tk promoter alone, fused to the luciferase gene (ptk), was not induced after detachment of cells. However, after insertion of the two p53-binding sites (p21-tk), this construct was induced nearly 5-fold (Fig. 6). In addition, a construct containing 13 repeats of a consensus p53-binding site (pG13) was induced 3-fold after cellular detachment. Thus, these results demonstrate that the p53-binding site is necessary and sufficient for the induction of p21 during non-adherent culture conditions.The activation of p53 was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Extracts from adherent or non-adherent cells were incubated with an oligonucleotide representing the distal p53-binding site of the p21 promoter. This sequence has been shown before to bind p53 protein (11El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig.7, there was four times more binding activity in cells that were detached, indicating elevated p53 activity. A mutated oligonucleotide with several point mutations did not compete for specific binding and did not exhibit any increased binding in detached cells. Together with the observed transcriptional activation via the p53-binding sites, these experiments demonstrate activation of p53 after detachment of cells.Figure 7DNA binding activity of p53 in attachedversus non-attached cells. Nuclear lysates from cells that were either grown attached (Att.) or non-attached for 2 h were prepared and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with an oligonucleotide representing the distal p53-binding site in the p21 promoter (wild type, wt). As a negative control, we also used a mutated version of this oligonucleotide (m) that was unable to bind p53 protein. In addition to nuclear extract, the individual reactions contained the following: lanes 1 and 3, 32P-labeled wild type oligonucleotide; lanes 2 and 4,32P-labeled mutant oligonucleotide; lane 5,32P-labeled wild type oligonucleotide plus 160-fold molar excess of non-radioactive mutant oligonucleotide; lane 6,32P-labeled wild type oligonucleotide plus 160-fold molar excess of non-radioactive wild type oligonucleotide.

This experiment was repeated with essentially the same result.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our data so far indicated that disruption of cell-matrix interactions activated a chain of events that involve p53, followed by the transcriptional activation of p21, which is followed by the transcriptional and posttranslational inhibition of cyclin A. We therefore investigated next whether or not these events would take place in cells that lack functional p53 protein. We used mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from p53 knock-out mice (p53−/−) and determined the levels of cyclin A and p21 protein after disruption of cell-matrix interactions. As shown in Fig.8, the amount of cyclin A protein is not reduced after cellular detachment, which is in contrast to the p53-positive mouse fibroblasts used in Fig. 2 A. Furthermore, the level of p21 protein was below detection limits in these MEF (p53−/−) cells (Fig. 8). As p21 needs to be present in fairly high amounts (approximately 2:1 molar ratio of p21 to cdk) to act as a cdk inhibitor (35Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 36Zhang H. Hannon G. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the extremely low amounts of p21 protein in the MEF (p53−/−) cells are sufficient to act as cdk inhibitor. Interestingly, the amount of another CKI, p27 kip1 , was strongly elevated at around 24 h after detachment of the MEF (p53−/−) cells, which is in contrast to the p53-positive mouse fibroblasts, where no change is observed (Fig. 2 A).Figure 8Amount of cell cycle-regulatory proteins in p53−/− cells after detachment.

https://openalex.org/W2082067420,"hGrb10α (previously named Grb-IR) is a Src-homology 2 domain-containing protein that binds with high affinity to the tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor. At least two isoforms of human Grb10, (hGrb10α and hGrb10β), which differ in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the N-terminal sequence, have previously been identified in insulin target tissues such as human skeletal muscle and fat cells. Here we report the cloning of the third isoform of the hGrb10 family (hGrb10γ) from human skeletal muscle and its localization to human chromosome 7. We have also determined the human chromosome localization of Grb7 to 17q21-q22 and Grb14 to chromosome 2. hGrb10γ contains an intact PH domain and an N-terminal sequence that is present in hGrb10α but absent in hGrb10β. RNase protection assays and Western blot analysis showed that hGrb10α and hGrb10γ are differentially expressed in insulin target cells including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipocyte cells. hGrb10γ is also expressed in HeLa cells and various breast cancer cell lines. The protein bound with high affinity to the insulin receptor in cells, and the interaction was dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. hGrb10γ also underwent insulin-stimulated membrane translocation and serine phosphorylation. hGrb10γ phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Taken together, our data suggest that hGrb10 isoforms are potential downstream signaling components of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and that the PH domain may play an important role in the involvement of these isoforms in signal transduction pathways initiated by insulin and other growth factors. hGrb10α (previously named Grb-IR) is a Src-homology 2 domain-containing protein that binds with high affinity to the tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor. At least two isoforms of human Grb10, (hGrb10α and hGrb10β), which differ in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the N-terminal sequence, have previously been identified in insulin target tissues such as human skeletal muscle and fat cells. Here we report the cloning of the third isoform of the hGrb10 family (hGrb10γ) from human skeletal muscle and its localization to human chromosome 7. We have also determined the human chromosome localization of Grb7 to 17q21-q22 and Grb14 to chromosome 2. hGrb10γ contains an intact PH domain and an N-terminal sequence that is present in hGrb10α but absent in hGrb10β. RNase protection assays and Western blot analysis showed that hGrb10α and hGrb10γ are differentially expressed in insulin target cells including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipocyte cells. hGrb10γ is also expressed in HeLa cells and various breast cancer cell lines. The protein bound with high affinity to the insulin receptor in cells, and the interaction was dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. hGrb10γ also underwent insulin-stimulated membrane translocation and serine phosphorylation. hGrb10γ phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 creates docking sites for multiple downstream signaling molecules with specific sequence motifs. One of these functional motifs found in signaling proteins is the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. The SH2 domain is a sequence of approximately 100 amino acids that binds with high affinity to phosphotyrosine-containing proteins (3Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Another functional domain is the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that has been suggested to play important roles in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (4Gibson T.J. Hyvonen M. Musacchio A. Saraste M. Birney E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 349-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 5Ingley E. Hemmings B.A. J. Cell.

Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Although numerous studies have shown that IRS-1 is critical in IR signal transduction, evidence does exist that other proteins may also be involved to transduce a signal from the IR to downstream targets (2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a search for signaling molecules involved in IR signaling, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to find proteins that interact directly with the cytoplasmic domain of the human IR (7Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We identified an SH2 domain-containing protein (hGrb10α, previously named Grb-IR) that binds with high affinity to the autophosphorylated IR. Sequence comparison of hGrb10α with several recently cloned proteins including mGrb7 (8Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), mGrb10 (9Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1610-1630Google Scholar), and hGrb14 (10Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggests that they belong to a special family. All of these proteins contain an SH2 domain at their C termini and a PH domain in the central regions. The SH2 domain of hGrb10 isoforms is 99, 79, and 59% identical to that of mGrb10, mGrb7, and hGrb14, respectively. The PH domains of these proteins are also highly homologous. Although the N termini of these proteins are less conserved, all of them contain a highly conserved proline-rich sequence (P(S/A)IPNPFPEL) (see Fig. 1 A), which has been shown to be the potential binding site for SH3 domain-containing proteins (11Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In reverse transcription-PCR experiments we also showed that there are at least two isoforms of hGrb10, one that contains and one that lacks an intact PH domain. Expression of hGrb10α, the isoform lacking an intact PH domain, inhibits insulin-stimulated substrate tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation in cells (7Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mechanism of inhibition has not been characterized. To further study the role of Grb10 proteins in signaling, we cloned and characterized the PH domain-containing isoform and named it hGrb10γ. We find that hGrb10 isoforms are differentially expressed in insulin target cells and various human breast cancer cell lines and are phosphorylated differently in response to insulin stimulation. In addition, we have shown that the insulin-stimulated hGrb10γ phosphorylation was blocked by wortmannin, a relative specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, and PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase. Our findings suggest that Grb10 isoforms are potential signaling components of pathways mediated by insulin and other growth factors and that the PH domain may play an important role in the function of the protein. The cDNA encoding hGrb10γ was identified by screening a human muscle cDNA library (Stratagene) using a radiolabeled 0.9-kb hGrb10α cDNA fragment (7Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as a probe. The nucleotide sequence of this clone was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase 2.0 sequencing kit (Amersham Corp.). Total RNAs from human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-435A were isolated using the Totally RNA kit from Ambion (Austin, TX), and the first strand cDNAs were synthesized using the Superscript kit from Life Technologies, Inc. First strand cDNA from HEK 293 cells was a gift of L. Ballou (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio). The forward PCR primer (P1) was: 5′-TTGAAGAAGGCAGAAGGAACCC-3′, which is in the 5′-untranslated region that is specific for hGrb10α and hGrb10γ. The reverse PCR primer (P2) was: 5′-CATTGCCACGAGGGAGTTCTCGGA-3′, which is located downstream of the cDNA sequence encoding for the PH domain and is common in all three hGrb10 isoforms (Fig. 1 B). These primers amplify fragments with predicted sizes of 1.17 and 1.3 kb for hGrb10α and hGrb10γ, respectively. To determine the expression of Grb10 isoforms in different human breast cancer cells and to assess the relative abundance of the isoform mRNAs, a bifunctional antisense [32P]riboprobe was synthesized in the presence of [32P]uridine triphosphate using a cDNA template consisting of a 40-nt fragment of hGrb10γ cDNA encoding the PH domain inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of the pBluescript II SK(+) vector and oriented antisense to the T3 RNA polymerase site. The probe protects a 260-nt sequence of hGrb10α and a 398-nt sequence of hGrb10β or hGrb10γ mRNA. RNase protection assays were carried out by hybridizing the probe with 20 μg of total RNA isolated from several breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, ZR-75, T47D, MDA-468, MDA-231, MDA-231VC (12Jiang S.Y. Jordan V.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 580-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), MDA-435A) and a prostate cancer cell line (DU145). For 36B4 loading control (13Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), a 145 PstI-PstI fragment was cloned into pGEM4Z, linearized with EcoRI, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. Single-stranded RNA was digested with RNase A, and samples were separated by 8 m urea 6% SDS-PAGE (14Yee D. Cullen K.J. Paik S. Perdue J.F. Hampton B. Scwartz A. Lippman M.E. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6691-6696PubMed Google Scholar). tRNA was run as a negative control. RNA from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with hGrb10α (CHO/IR/hGrb10α) and hGrb10γ (CHO/IR/hGrb10γ) was run as a positive control. The chromosome location of the hGrb10 gene was determined by PCR using hGrb10α-specific primers against the Stanford Human Genome Center G3 radiation hybrid panel (Research Genetics, Inc.). The PCR primers were: 5′-CAGCAGCAAATCGTCGTTTA-3′ and 5′-GAACACTGGAGTGAAGAAGCG-3′. The PCR results were analyzed using the RH server Version 2.0. 2Available at URLhttp://shgc-www.stanford.edu Additional data were obtained from BLAST searches of the sequence-tagged site (STS) data base. 3Available at URLhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. A multiple alignment of all members of the Grb10, Grb7, and Grb14 protein family was generated using Clustalw (15Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The alignment was used in a maximum parsimony analysis using Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP) (16Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony. Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1991Google Scholar). The statistical significance of the resulting trees was evaluated using bootstrap analysis within PAUP. CHO cells expressing both the human IR and hGrb10α have been described previously (7Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To establish cell lines expressing the IR and hGrb10γ, we subcloned hGrb10γ cDNA into the mammalian expression vector pBEX (17Bram R.J. Hung D.T. Martin P.K. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) in-frame with a sequence encoding a 9-amino acid hemagglutinin-tag (YPYDVPDYA) to generate the recombinant plasmid pBEX/hGrb10γ. Transfection of CHO/IR cells with plasmids pBEX/hGrb10γ and pBSpacΔp (18de la Luna S. Soria I. Pulido D. Ortin J. Jimenez A. Gene. 1988; 62: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was carried out using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (19Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines expressing hGrb10γ (CHO/IR/hGrb10γ) were selected with 8 μg/ml puromycin. Positives were identified by Western blotting using the antibody to the hemagglutinin tag or to hGrb10 (7Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and cloned by limiting dilution. The hepatoblastoma cell line Huh7 was from M. Adamo (20Yang H. Adamo M.L. Koval A.P. McGuinness M.C. Ben-Hur H. Yang Y. LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1380-1395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other cell lines used in this study were from ATCC. Anti-hGrb10 rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against the C-terminal region of Grb-IR/hGrb10α (amino acids 369–548) fused to the GST protein (GST/hGrb10c) as described previously (7Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The antibody was purified by passing through a GST-immobilized column to deplete antibodies to GST and then eluted from a GST/hGrb10c-immobilized column with a buffer containing 0.1n glycine, pH 2.8, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl and neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Insulin-treated or nontreated CHO/IR/hGrb10α and CHO/IR/hGrb10γ cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After incubation at 0 °C for 10 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min with PAP in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate). The reaction was terminated by adding SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer and boiling at 95 °C for 3 min. In vivolabeling was carried out as described previously with some modifications (21Liu F. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO/IR/hGrb10γ cells were grown in 10-cm diameter plates to 80–85% confluence. After incubation in 3 ml of phosphate-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 3 mm CaCl2, 5 mmKCl, 7 mm NaHCO3, 107 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were radiolabeled with 0.3 mCi of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate/plate for 4 h at 37 °C and then treated with or without insulin (10 nm) for an additional 15 min. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and lysed with 0.4 ml/plate lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 20 mm pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant fraction was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of anti-hGrb10 antibody or normal rabbit IgG bound to protein A-agarose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 6 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A (20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.6, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.02% NaN3) containing 1 m NaCl and twice with buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl. The radiolabeled hGrb10γ was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), and visualized by autoradiography. hGrb10γ bound on the Immobilon P membrane was cut out, and the protein was hydrolyzed under vacuum for 1 h at 110 °C in 1 ml of 6 m HCl (Pierce). The membrane was rehydrated by the addition of 1 drop of methanol, and the amino acids were eluted from the membrane with water. After lyophilization, the sample was resuspended in 10 μl of phosphoamino acid standard containing phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine. Approximately 150 cpm of each sample was spotted onto a TLC cellulose plate (EM Separation Technology). Two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis was carried out under the following conditions: first dimension, pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid/acetic acid/water 1:3.12:35.88), 1.5 kV for 20 min; second dimension, pH 3.5 buffer (acetic acid/pyridine/water 10:1:189), 1.3 kV for 16 min. The plate was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Cells in a 6-well plate (80–90% confluent) were incubated with serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Wortmannin (Sigma) or PD98059 (Calbiochem) were added to wells at a final concentration of 50 nm and 50 μm, respectively. After incubation for 1 h, the cells were stimulated with 10−8m insulin for 15 min. Cells were then washed with a buffer containing 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, lysed in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. CHO/IR/hGrb10γ cells were grown on glass slides to a 70% confluence and treated with or without 10−8m insulin for 15 min. After rinsing with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 5 min, rinsed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with acetone for 1 min. After blocking with 1% fetal bovine serum for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated with a polyclonal anti-hGrb10 antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature. The localization of hGrb10γ was examined using a fluorescent microscope. Coimmunoprecipitation of the IR and hGrb10 isoforms were performed as described previously (7Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. The immunoblots were blocked at room temperature with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 154 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1% (w/v) dry milk and then incubated with antibody against hGrb10. hGrb10 isoforms were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and a chromatogenous substrate reaction. We have previously shown by reverse transcription-PCR that there are at least two hGrb10 isoforms that differ in the PH domain region (7Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To clone the cDNA encoding for the isoform containing an intact PH domain, we screened a human muscle cDNA library using a 0.9-kb hGrb10α cDNA as a probe. The deduced amino acid sequence of clone 2, which had an insert of 1.7 kb, is shown in Fig.1 A. This cDNA sequence is identical to that encoding for hGrb10α, except for a 138-nt addition in the PH domain encoding for an additional 46 amino acids (Fig.1 B). A search of GenBankTM revealed several other hGrb10-like sequences that include a newly deposited cDNA sequence identified from human myeloblast (KIA0207; sequence accession number D86962) and an N-terminal 58-amino acid shorter form, Grb10/IR-SV1 or hGrb10β (11Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22O'Neill T.J. Rose D.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of hGrb10γ, hGrb10β, and KIA0207/hGrb10δ are exactly the same except for the N-termini (Fig. 1 C). By reverse transcription-PCR, we also confirmed the presence of hGrb10 isoforms in other human cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1 D, the isoform-specific primers amplified several DNA fragments from mRNAs isolated from the HEK 293 cells (lane 3) and two representative human breast cancer cell lines (lane 4 and5). Comparison of the sizes of the PCR products amplified from these cells with those amplified using either hGrb10α (Fig.1 D, lane 1) or hGrb10γ (Fig. 1 D,lane 2) as template suggests that mRNAs of both isoforms were present in these cell lines and that the major isoform in these cells is the one containing an intact PH domain. The detection of an additional PCR product with a molecular mass greater than that of hGrb10γ suggests that there may be another isoform in these cells, which is consistent with the observation by Frantz et al.(11Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), who found the presence of an additional PCR product in human skeletal muscle using hGrb10α-specific primers. PCR analysis of the Stanford Human Genome Center G3 radiation hybrid panel places the gene for hGrb10 on human chromosome 7 between markers D7S506 and D7S499 (Fig.2). BLAST searches of the STS data base using segments of the hGrb10 gene specific for the α, β, and γ isoforms identify three specific STS markers (SWSS3378, WI-14569, and WI-18551), which have also been mapped within this interval (23Dib C. Faure S. Fizames C. Samson D. Drouot N. Vignal A. Millasseau P. Marc S. Hazan J. Seboun E. Lathrop M. Gyapay G. Morissette J. Weissenbach J. Nature. 1996; 380: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). These STS markers were originally derived from the hGrb10α cDNA. There are several other uncharacterized cDNA transcripts that have been mapped in the region, and the nearest other gene is the IGFBP1 gene (24Ehrenborg E. Larsson C. Stern I. Janson M. Powell D.R. Luthman H. Genomics. 1992; 12: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The murine Grb10 gene has been mapped to chromosome 11 at position 8.0 cm (9Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1610-1630Google Scholar). This region of mouse chromosome 11 is syntenic with human p13-p11, based upon a survey of murine genes that have been mapped to chromosome 11. 4Mouse Genome Data Base, Mouse Genome Informatics, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine. World Wide Web (URL: http://www.informatics.jax.org/).BLAST searches of the STS data base using hGrb7 and hGrb14 have also identified STS markers that have been mapped to their respective chromosome localization. WI-9366 is 100% identical to hGrb7 and has been mapped to YAC 946 E 2, which has been localized to human chromosome 17q21-q22 near topoisomerase 2. Grb14 matches STS marker WI-11831, which has been mapped to human chromosome 2 at position 836.45 centirads using a radiation hybrid approach. 5T. Hudson, unpublished data. It has been shown that Grb7 and Grb14, the other two members of the Grb7/10/14 gene family, were overexpressed in certain breast cancer cells (9Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1610-1630Google Scholar, 10Daly R.J. Sanderson G.M. Janes P.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12502-12510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Grb10 was also expressed in these cells, several breast cancer cell lines were analyzed by RNase protection assays using a probe that spanned the PH splice domain of hGrb10γ (Fig.3 A). As a positive control, total mRNA from CHO cells stably transfected with hGrb10α (Fig.3 A, ΔPH) or hGrb10γ (Fig. 3 A, PH) were also analyzed. The majority of cells show a protected band specific for the PH+ isoform (expected size 398 nt) with no significantly detectable bands of the splice-variant hGrb10α (expected size, 260 nt) (Fig.3 A). Using an anti-hGrb10 polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal region of the protein, we also examined hGrb10 protein expression in several breast cancer cell lines. Unlike Grb7, which is expressed in only a limited number of breast cancer cell lines (25Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. Eustachio P.D. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), an anti-hGrb10 antibody-reactive protein was detected in all breast cell lines studied (Fig. 3 B). In ZR-75 and HS578T cells, multiple bands were detected by the antibody, probably due to a phosphorylation-induced gel mobility shift of the protein (see below). Comparison of the apparent molecular mass of this protein with hGrb10 isoforms expressed in the transfected CHO/IR cells suggests that they are the PH domain-containing isoform hGrb10γ. In HeLa cells, from which hGrb10α was originally identified, the antibody detected three major protein bands with a molecular mass of approximately 68, 62, and 50 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and2). The migration distances of the 68- and 62-kDa proteins in the HeLa cells suggests that these proteins are probably the hGrb10 isoforms with or without the deletion in the PH domain. To evaluate hGrb10 protein expression in insulin target cells, Western blot experiments were carried out on two human hepatocyte cell lines, 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells and human skeletal muscle cells. In human skeletal muscle cells, the antibody detected hGrb10α and a major 50-kDa protein band with unknown identity (Fig. 3 D,lanes 5–7). On the other hand, only hGrb10γ was detected in human hepatocyte cells (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and4). The 50-kDa anti-hGrb10 immunoreactive protein, which was detected in the HeLa cells (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and2), human liver cells (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 4), and human skeletal muscle cells (Fig.3 D, lanes 5–7) could either be the degradation product of hGrb10 proteins or another isoform of the product. Because its molecular mass is significantly smaller than that of hGrb10β (the calculated mass of which is approximately 61 kDa), it is unlikely that this protein band is the β isoform of hGrb10. Western blot of cell lysates of the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipose cells revealed several protein bands with molecular masses ranging from 48 to 65 kDa (Fig.3 C, lane 5). These proteins are probably the mouse homologues of the hGrb10 isoforms. To study the interaction between hGrb10γ and the IR in cells, we established cell lines expressing both the IR and hGrb10γ. Lysates from insulin-treated or nontreated CHO/IR, CHO/IR/hGrb10α, or CHO/IR/hGrb10γ cells were incubated with antibody to the β-subunit of the IR (29B4, a gift from R. A. Roth, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) immobilized to protein G-Sepharose beads. After separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the IR and its associated hGrb10 isoforms were detected with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (Fig. 4 A) or to hGrb10 (Fig. 4 B), respectively. A comparable amount of the autophosphorylated IR was precipitated by the anti-IR antibody from the parent CHO/IR cells and the hGrb10 transfected cells lines (Fig.4 A). Both hGrb10α and hGrb10γ could be coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-IR antibody in cells expressing these proteins (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4–6). The interaction between hGrb10 isoforms was dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor, and no hGrb10 isoforms were coimmunoprecipitated in the absence of insulin stimulation (Fig. 4, lanes 2–3). To further characterize the interaction between the IR and hGrb10γ, we studied the localization of the protein in the presence or absence of insulin treatment. In unstimulated CHO/IR/hGrb10γ cells, hGrb10γ was detected in both the cytosol and membrane (Fig.5 A). After insulin stimulation, the fraction of the protein on the membrane was significantly increased (Fig. 5 B). Insulin-stimulated translocation was also observed for hGrb10α, which lacks an intact PH domain (not shown). These results are consistent with the recent finding that Grb10 moves fr"

We report here the expression of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in the developing pancreas. Immunostaining of fetal and neonatal rat pancreata, in which endocrine cells are visible as cell clusters often associated with primitive ducts or ductular cells, revealed that most of the cluster-forming cells and primitive ducts or ductular cells express HB-EGF protein. In contrast, the exocrine pancreas lacked HB-EGF expression. Based on findings that the expression pattern was similar to that of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor PDX-1 (IDX-1/STF-1/IPF1) and that the regulatory region of the HB-EGF gene contained sequences similar to the PDX-1-binding A element, we examined whether PDX-1 could be a potential activator of HB-EGF gene expression. The results of reporter gene analyses suggested that the HB-EGF gene promoter is PDX-1-responsive and that the activity of the promoter in pancreatic beta cell-derived βTC1 cells depends on the PDX-1 binding site-like sequences. Gel-mobility shift analyses using an anti-PDX-1 antibody indicated that PDX-1 is a specific and dominant binding factor for an A element-like sequence in the HB-EGF gene. These observations suggest the possible involvement of HB-EGF in pancreas development.

These observations suggest the possible involvement of HB-EGF in pancreas development. While PDX-1 is essential for pancreas development, HB-EGF may function as a mediator of PDX-1 and thus be involved in the development of the endocrine pancreas. The pancreas is an organ composed of two distinct cell populations: exocrine cells, which secrete digestive enzymes, and endocrine cells, which secrete hormones. The pancreas arises from the endoderm as a dorsal bud and a ventral bud which fuse together to form a single organ (1Slack J.M.W. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various growth factors expressed in the developing pancreas and its surrounding mesenchyme-derived cells are considered to be involved in the development of the endocrine and exocrine cells. Among those growth factors which have been shown to be expressed in pancreatic islets, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; PDX-1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene-1; IDX-1, islet-duodenum homeobox gene-1; STF-1, somatostatin transcription factor-1; IPF1, insulin promoter factor 1; bp, base pair(s); TGF, transforming growth factor.1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; PDX-1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene-1; IDX-1, islet-duodenum homeobox gene-1; STF-1, somatostatin transcription factor-1; IPF1, insulin promoter factor 1; bp, base pair(s); TGF, transforming growth factor. family of growth factors such as EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), and betacellulin can bind to the EGF receptor produced by pancreatic islet cells and have been shown to exert various effects on islet cell differentiation and proliferation (2Miettinen P.J.

Development. 1994; 120: 3451-3462PubMed Google Scholar).Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family which was purified initially from the conditioned medium of macrophage-like U937 cells (4Higashiyama S.

Development. 1992; 114: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sanvito F. Herrera P.-L. Huarte J. Nichols A. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. Development. 1994; 120: 3451-3462PubMed Google Scholar), HB-EGF seems to play a role in tissue development; during myogenesis, for example, HB-EGF gene expression is activated by MyoD (14Chen X. Rabb G. Deutsch U. Zhang J. Ezzell R.M. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18285-18294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To clarify the molecular mechanism for pancreas development, we examined the expression of HB-EGF in fetal, neonatal, and adult pancreata. We found that HB-EGF is abundantly expressed in endocrine pancreas cells and primitive duct cells from which the endocrine cells are derived in fetal rats. We also found that the expression pattern in the developing pancreas was similar to that of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor PDX-1 (IDX-1/STF-1/IPF1). While the regulatory sequences of the HB-EGF gene contained sequences similar to the PDX-1 binding motif, we have shown that PDX-1 can bind to the 5′-flanking region of the HB-EGF gene and activates its promoter. Thus our present observations suggest that HB-EGF, which is expressed in the developing pancreas and may be regulated in part by PDX-1, is involved in pancreas development.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we identified the expression of HB-EGF in the developing pancreas. To date, various growth factors have been shown to be expressed in the pancreas and the surrounding mesenchyme-derived cells during development and also in adults. They include hepatocyte growth factor, expressed in mesenchyme-derived tissue, and EGF, TGF-α, betacellulin, nerve growth factor (NGF), and transforming growth factor-β1 expressed in the pancreas itself (2Miettinen P.J. Heikinheimo K. Development. 1992; 114: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sanvito F. Herrera P.-L. Huarte J. Nichols A. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The growth factors expressed in the developing pancreas may function independently or in cooperation with other growth factors. Among them, most of the EGF family growth factors share a common receptor of the ErbB receptor family, EGF receptor (ErbB1), which has been known to be expressed also in the endocrine and exocrine pancreas and is thought to exert autocrine or paracrine effects. EGF seems to promote ductal development in the fetus (3Sanvito F. Herrera P.-L. Huarte J. Nichols A. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. Development. 1994; 120: 3451-3462PubMed Google Scholar) and increases the cell proliferation rate of fetal pancreatic cells (24Otonkoski T. Beattie G.M. Rubin J.S. Lopez A.D. Baird A. Hayek A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Also, another member of the EGF family, betacellulin, which was originally isolated from the conditioned medium of beta cell-derived cells (26Shing Y. Christofori G. Hanahan D. Ono Y. Sasada R. Igarashi K. Folkman J. Science. 1993; 259: 1604-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), seems to function as an inducer of beta cell differentiation (27Mashima H. Ohnishi H. Wakabayashi K.

Hamaguchi K. Matsuoka T. Yamamoto K. Matsuzawa Y. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our present study has identified another EGF family growth factor expressed in the pancreas. During pancreas development, HB-EGF is expressed abundantly in ductal cells and immature endocrine cells, which were considered to be differentiated from ductal cells to form islets, but is not expressed in exocrine tissues.The expression pattern of HB-EGF during pancreas development is clearly in contrast to that of TGF-α, which can be detected in both endocrine and exocrine tissues (2Miettinen P.J. Heikinheimo K. Development. 1992; 114: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar), and also with NGF localized in nonendocrine cells surrounding the islets (25Kanaka-Gantenbein C. Dicou E. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the EGF receptor, a common receptor for HB-EGF and TGF-α, is expressed in both endocrine and exocrine tissues, the expression pattern of HB-EGF in the developing pancreas suggested that HB-EGF is likely to be exclusively involved in the development of the endocrine pancreas. It is difficult to clarify the in vivo physiological role of HB-EGF; however, evaluation of its effects using different tissue components of the developing pancreas, as previously done for EGF or other growth factors (3Sanvito F. Herrera P.-L. Huarte J. Nichols A. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. Development. 1994; 120: 3451-3462PubMed Google Scholar), may provide useful information. Also, mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the HB-EGF gene, when they become available, would be useful for clarifying the physiological significance of HB-EGF expression during pancreas development.Our present study has also shown that the expression of HB-EGF can be potentially regulated by the transcription factor PDX-1. It was originally isolated as IPF1 in mouse (16Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and as STF-1/IDX-1 in rat (29Leonard J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and has been shown to bind to the A elements of insulin gene and to activate its transcription (1Slack J.M.W. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 22Guz Y. Montminy M.R.

PDX-1 is selectively expressed in pancreatic islets and in the duodenum. At an early stage of embryonic development, PDX-1 is initially expressed in the gut region when the foregut endoderm becomes committed to common pancreatic precursor cells. During the development of the pancreas, PDX-1 expression is maintained in multipotential precursors that coexpress several hormones, and later it becomes restricted to beta cells. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the PDX-1 gene have been shown to lack a pancreas (1Slack J.M.W. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H. Nature. 1994; 371: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 34Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L.M. Wright C.V.E. Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations support the crucial role of PDX-1 in pancreas development.Although data are accumulating for the expression pattern of PDX-1 during development, it is largely unknown how PDX-1 drives pancreas development. Because PDX-1 is a DNA-binding transcription factor, its action should be exerted by transactivating genes through its binding to their regulatory sequences. To date, only four beta cell-specific genes, insulin, glucokinase, IAPP, and Glut2genes, all of which have the A element-like motifs in their regulatory region, are known as putative targets of the PDX-1 regulation (15Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Kaneto H. Fujitani Y. Kamada T. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Miyagawa J.

Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Serup P. Jensen J. Andersen F.G. Jorgensen M.C. Blume N. Holst J.J. Madsen O.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the simple induction of these four genes is unlikely to be enough to explain all of the in vivo effects of PDX-1. Recent data obtained with PDX-1-deficient mice showed that PDX-1 is essential for induction of the morphogenesis of pancreatic epithelium as well as the progression of differentiation of the endocrine cells (34Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L.M. Wright C.V.E. Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations cannot be rationally explained by the already known function of PDX-1 as a transcription factor of those four genes. Therefore, we are tempted to consider that PDX-1 may induce gene expression of one or more growth factors and that the growth factor(s) may, in turn, exert physiological effects on pancreas development. Thus, HB-EGF, which was shown to co-localize with PDX-1 during development and also revealed potential PDX-1 responsiveness in its promoter activity, may be a good candidate for such growth factors which would mediate PDX-1 effects.Since AT-rich regions are known to be binding sites for a wide range of homeoproteins, we assume it unlikely that PDX-1 is the only transcription factor involved in HB-EGF gene transcription in the pancreas. To date, various homeodomain-containing transcription factors as well as basic helix-loop-helix proteins, which are either beta cell-specific or ubiquitous, are known to be expressed in pancreatic islets. To fully understand the regulation of HB-EGF gene expression during pancreas development, the possible involvement of those factors in HB-EGF gene activation needs to be studied.In conclusion, HB-EGF is expressed in the developing pancreas and may be involved in the differentiation or growth of endocrine cells. Also, in our present study, PDX-1 was suggested as being a possible regulator of the HB-EGF gene expression in the pancreas. PDX-1-responsive induction of the growth factor gene expression, if it occurs in vivo, may at least partially explain the essential and extensive roles of PDX-1 in the morphogenesis of the pancreas, as suggested by phenotypes of PDX-1-deficient mice. The pancreas is an organ composed of two distinct cell populations: exocrine cells, which secrete digestive enzymes, and endocrine cells, which secrete hormones. The pancreas arises from the endoderm as a dorsal bud and a ventral bud which fuse together to form a single organ (1Slack J.M.W. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various growth factors expressed in the developing pancreas and its surrounding mesenchyme-derived cells are considered to be involved in the development of the endocrine and exocrine cells. Among those growth factors which have been shown to be expressed in pancreatic islets, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; PDX-1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene-1; IDX-1, islet-duodenum homeobox gene-1; STF-1, somatostatin transcription factor-1; IPF1, insulin promoter factor 1; bp, base pair(s); TGF, transforming growth factor.1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; PDX-1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene-1; IDX-1, islet-duodenum homeobox gene-1; STF-1, somatostatin transcription factor-1; IPF1, insulin promoter factor 1; bp, base pair(s); TGF, transforming growth factor. family of growth factors such as EGF, transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), and betacellulin can bind to the EGF receptor produced by pancreatic islet cells and have been shown to exert various effects on islet cell differentiation and proliferation (2Miettinen P.J.

To clarify the molecular mechanism for pancreas development, we examined the expression of HB-EGF in fetal, neonatal, and adult pancreata. We found that HB-EGF is abundantly expressed in endocrine pancreas cells and primitive duct cells from which the endocrine cells are derived in fetal rats. We also found that the expression pattern in the developing pancreas was similar to that of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor PDX-1 (IDX-1/STF-1/IPF1). While the regulatory sequences of the HB-EGF gene contained sequences similar to the PDX-1 binding motif, we have shown that PDX-1 can bind to the 5′-flanking region of the HB-EGF gene and activates its promoter.

The growth factors expressed in the developing pancreas may function independently or in cooperation with other growth factors. Among them, most of the EGF family growth factors share a common receptor of the ErbB receptor family, EGF receptor (ErbB1), which has been known to be expressed also in the endocrine and exocrine pancreas and is thought to exert autocrine or paracrine effects. EGF seems to promote ductal development in the fetus (3Sanvito F. Herrera P.-L. Huarte J. Nichols A. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D.

Also, another member of the EGF family, betacellulin, which was originally isolated from the conditioned medium of beta cell-derived cells (26Shing Y. Christofori G. Hanahan D. Ono Y. Sasada R. Igarashi K. Folkman J. Science. 1993; 259: 1604-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), seems to function as an inducer of beta cell differentiation (27Mashima H. Ohnishi H. Wakabayashi K.

Our present study has identified another EGF family growth factor expressed in the pancreas. During pancreas development, HB-EGF is expressed abundantly in ductal cells and immature endocrine cells, which were considered to be differentiated from ductal cells to form islets, but is not expressed in exocrine tissues.The expression pattern of HB-EGF during pancreas development is clearly in contrast to that of TGF-α, which can be detected in both endocrine and exocrine tissues (2Miettinen P.J. Heikinheimo K. Development. 1992; 114: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar), and also with NGF localized in nonendocrine cells surrounding the islets (25Kanaka-Gantenbein C. Dicou E. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3154-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the EGF receptor, a common receptor for HB-EGF and TGF-α, is expressed in both endocrine and exocrine tissues, the expression pattern of HB-EGF in the developing pancreas suggested that HB-EGF is likely to be exclusively involved in the development of the endocrine pancreas. It is difficult to clarify the in vivo physiological role of HB-EGF; however, evaluation of its effects using different tissue components of the developing pancreas, as previously done for EGF or other growth factors (3Sanvito F. Herrera P.-L. Huarte J. Nichols A. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. Development. 1994; 120: 3451-3462PubMed Google Scholar), may provide useful information. Also, mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the HB-EGF gene, when they become available, would be useful for clarifying the physiological significance of HB-EGF expression during pancreas development.Our present study has also shown that the expression of HB-EGF can be potentially regulated by the transcription factor PDX-1. It was originally isolated as IPF1 in mouse (16Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and as STF-1/IDX-1 in rat (29Leonard J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and has been shown to bind to the A elements of insulin gene and to activate its transcription (1Slack J.M.W.

PDX-1 is selectively expressed in pancreatic islets and in the duodenum. At an early stage of embryonic development, PDX-1 is initially expressed in the gut region when the foregut endoderm becomes committed to common pancreatic precursor cells. During the development of the pancreas, PDX-1 expression is maintained in multipotential precursors that coexpress several hormones, and later it becomes restricted to beta cells. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation in the PDX-1 gene have been shown to lack a pancreas (1Slack J.M.W. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jonsson J. Carlsson L.

Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations support the crucial role of PDX-1 in pancreas development.Although data are accumulating for the expression pattern of PDX-1 during development, it is largely unknown how PDX-1 drives pancreas development. Because PDX-1 is a DNA-binding transcription factor, its action should be exerted by transactivating genes through its binding to their regulatory sequences. To date, only four beta cell-specific genes, insulin, glucokinase, IAPP, and Glut2genes, all of which have the A element-like motifs in their regulatory region, are known as putative targets of the PDX-1 regulation (15Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Umayahara Y. Matsuoka T. Kaneto H. Fujitani Y. Kamada T. Kawamori R. Yamasaki Y. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1478-1488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Watada H. Kajimoto Y. Miyagawa J.

However, the simple induction of these four genes is unlikely to be enough to explain all of the in vivo effects of PDX-1. Recent data obtained with PDX-1-deficient mice showed that PDX-1 is essential for induction of the morphogenesis of pancreatic epithelium as well as the progression of differentiation of the endocrine cells (34Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L.M. Wright C.V.E. Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations cannot be rationally explained by the already known function of PDX-1 as a transcription factor of those four genes. Therefore, we are tempted to consider that PDX-1 may induce gene expression of one or more growth factors and that the growth factor(s) may, in turn, exert physiological effects on pancreas development. Thus, HB-EGF, which was shown to co-localize with PDX-1 during development and also revealed potential PDX-1 responsiveness in its promoter activity, may be a good candidate for such growth factors which would mediate PDX-1 effects.Since AT-rich regions are known to be binding sites for a wide range of homeoproteins, we assume it unlikely that PDX-1 is the only transcription factor involved in HB-EGF gene transcription in the pancreas. To date, various homeodomain-containing transcription factors as well as basic helix-loop-helix proteins, which are either beta cell-specific or ubiquitous, are known to be expressed in pancreatic islets. To fully understand the regulation of HB-EGF gene expression during pancreas development, the possible involvement of those factors in HB-EGF gene activation needs to be studied.In conclusion, HB-EGF is expressed in the developing pancreas and may be involved in the differentiation or growth of endocrine cells. Also, in our present study, PDX-1 was suggested as being a possible regulator of the HB-EGF gene expression in the pancreas. PDX-1-responsive induction of the growth factor gene expression, if it occurs in vivo, may at least partially explain the essential and extensive roles of PDX-1 in the morphogenesis of the pancreas, as suggested by phenotypes of PDX-1-deficient mice. In the present study, we identified the expression of HB-EGF in the developing pancreas. To date, various growth factors have been shown to be expressed in the pancreas and the surrounding mesenchyme-derived cells during development and also in adults.

https://openalex.org/W2092819259,"Human T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) is a nontransmembrane enzyme, the first of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family to be cloned. Alternative mRNA splicing results in variation in the sequence at the extreme C terminus of TCPTP and generates a 45-kDa form (TC45) that is targeted to the nucleus and a 48-kDa variant (TC48) associated with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. In this report, we assessed the role of the C-terminal, noncatalytic segment of TCPTP in regulating activity, concentrating primarily on the TC45 variant. We have demonstrated that limited tryptic proteolysis of TC45 releases first a 42-kDa fragment, then a 33-kDa catalytic domain. Using reduced carboxyamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme as substrate (RCML), the catalytic domain displays 20–100-fold more activity than the full-length enzyme. Analysis of the time course of limited trypsinolysis revealed that proteolytic activation occurred following cleavage of a protease-sensitive region (residues 353–387) located at the C terminus of TC45. The activity of truncation mutants illustrated that removal of 20 C-terminal residues was sufficient to activate the enzyme fully. The 33-kDa catalytic domain, but not the full-length enzyme, was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by addition of the noncatalytic C-terminal segment of TC45. A monoclonal antibody to TCPTP, CF4, which recognizes an epitope located between residues 350 and 363, was capable of fully activating TC45. These data indicate that the noncatalytic segment of TC45 contains an autoregulatory site that modulates activity via a reversible intramolecular interaction with the catalytic domain. These studies suggest that the C-terminal noncatalytic segment of TC45, and possibly TC48, may not only direct the enzyme to different subcellular locations but may also modulate activity in response to the binding of regulatory proteins and/or posttranslational modification.

The 48-kDa splice variant of human TCPTP (TC48) contains a 34-residue hydrophobic tail, which is replaced by a hydrophilic six-residue sequence in the 45-kDa form (TC45), as shown in Fig. 1 A. Alternative splicing provides a means to control the subcellular location of TCPTP since the TC48 variant is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas TC45 is found in the nucleus (10Kamatkar S.

The hydrophobic tail as well as residues 346–358 are required for targeting TC48 to the ER (11Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TC45 has two basic clusters (residues 350–358 and 377–381) that form a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) (11Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J.

The hydrophobic C-terminal tail of TC48 must override the bipartite NLS to permit targeting to the ER (11Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis converts TC48 to a 33-kDa fragment and results in a 30-fold increase in activity toward RCML and a 2-fold decrease with myelin basic protein (14Zander N.F. Lorenzen J.A. Cool D.E.

A 37-kDa truncated form of TC48 (residues 1–317) lacking most of the C-terminal noncatalytic segment had similar enzymatic properties with RCML and myelin basic protein (14Zander N.F. Lorenzen J.A.

The 37-kDa form of the enzyme dephosphorylated five different peptide substrates more efficiently than the full-length protein with 4–8-fold lower K m values and 1.3–2.7-fold greaterV max values (16Ruzzene M.

These findings suggest that the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of TCPTP has the ability to affect PTP activity. Certain protein kinases, protein Ser/Thr phosphatases, and two SH2-containing PTPs, SHP-1 and SHP-2, have low or no basal activity as a result of an intramolecular interaction between an autoinhibitory site and the catalytic domain (17Goldberg J.

A common feature shared by most autoinhibited enzymes is their ability to be activated by limited proteolysis, which destroys or releases their autoinhibitory domains. The response of TCPTP to limited proteolysis and to truncation suggests that its C-terminal domain might regulate activity via a similar intramolecular mechanism. Despite being one of the first PTPs identified, the function(s) of TCPTP is unknown. Identification of the regulatory mechanisms controlling the activity of TCPTPs will be required to fully understand its physiologic function. Toward this end, we have examined the role of the C-terminal domain in regulating the activity of TC45. Limited proteolysis and truncation mutagenesis were used to define the domain substructure of TC45 and to identify regions within the noncatalytic C-terminal segment that are involved in controlling activity. Additional analyses provided direct evidence that the C-terminal segment of TC45 can regulate activity through an intramolecular interaction with the catalytic domain. PCR was used to prepare a DNA fragment encoding the full-length TC45 splice variant using a TC48 cDNA (5Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5257-5261Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) as template. The following primers were used: forward, 5′-AGTCGGATCCATGCCCACCACCATCGAG; reverse C1, 5′-GACTGAATTCTTAGGTGTCTGTCAATCTTGGCCTTTTTCTTTTTCGTTCATT. The reverse primer complements codons encoding C-terminal residues 375–381 of TC48 and contains codons for the six residues (PRLTDT) that are unique to the TC45 splice variant followed by a stop codon. TheBamHI-EcoRI-digested PCR product was cloned into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) to produce pBS-TC45. An internal NdeI-EcoRI fragment that encodes residues 55–387 of TC45 was removed from pBS-TC45 and cloned into pET-21a (Novagen) to give pET-TC45a. Then, a PCR product encoding residues 1–54 and containing NdeI linkers at both ends was produced, cleaved, and cloned into the NdeI site of pET-TC45a. A plasmid containing an insert in the correct orientation was selected and designated pET-TC45. A series of C-terminal truncation mutants were prepared by replacing anNcoI-EcoRI fragment (encoding amino acid residues 208–387) from the pET-TC45 expression vector with a PCR-generated fragment containing stop codons at the desired positions. The point mutants of TC45 (R352A and R354A) were also created by replacing theNcoI-EcoRI fragment of pET-TC45 with a mutagenized fragment prepared using the PCR strategy of Michael (22Michael S.F. Biotechniques. 1994; 16: 410-412PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, a single PCR reaction is performed with Taqpolymerase and thermostable Taq ligase (New England Biolabs) to incorporate a phosphorylated mutagenic primer into the product. Two DNA fragments containing deletions of bases encoding either residues 350–358 or 353–371 were prepared by the PCR-ligation-PCR mutagenesis protocol described by Ali and Steinkasserer (23Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). For each mutant, two PCR products flanking the deletion site are amplified and then ligated to make the mutagenized fragment, which was used to replace theNcoI-EcoRI fragment from pET-TC45. The authenticity of all mutants was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. An overnight culture of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET-TC45 was grown from a single colony and used to inoculate 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm, induced with 50 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown overnight at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and suspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25 mm imidazole, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Bacteria were lysed by sonication on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 120 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on a DEAE-52 column (2.5 × 15 cm) equilibrated in buffer A containing 9 mm NaCl, washed with 250 ml of buffer A, and eluted with 200 ml of buffer A containing 40 mm NaCl. The eluate was loaded on a CM-Sepharose column (2.5 × 8 cm) equilibrated in buffer B (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and eluted with a 200-ml linear salt gradient of 40–400 mm NaCl in buffer B. Active fractions from CM-Sepharose were combined and precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate. The ammonium sulfate pellet was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 30% glycerol. Protein samples were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All TC45 mutants were overexpressed and purified as described above for native TC45. The yields of mutants were comparable, but the NaCl concentration at which some mutants eluted from CM-Sepharose differed from that of native TC45. The noncatalytic C-terminal segments of TC45 and PTP1B (24Brown-Shimer S. Johnson K.A. Lawrence J.B. Johnson C. Bruskin A. Green N.R. Hill D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5148-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli as thrombin-cleavable GST fusion proteins under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter using the pET-GST vector. 2Taylor, G., Liu, Y., Baskerville, C., and Charbonneau, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272,24054–24063.DNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 289–387 of TC45 and residues 231–300 of PTP1B were amplified with PCR primers containingBamHI and EcoRI linkers. Both PCR products were digested with BamHI-EcoRI and inserted into the corresponding site of pET-GST so that they were in frame with GST. The inserts in the resulting plasmids pET-GST-TC45-C and pET-GST-1B-C were sequenced to confirm their authenticity. These two plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and GST fusion proteins were expressed, affinity-purified on glutathione-agarose, and released by thrombin cleavage as described previously (25Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Thrombin-cleaved C-terminal peptides were dialyzed against 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, lyophilized, and dissolved in 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, at a final protein concentration of about 4 mm. RCML (Life Technologies, Inc.) and casein (Sigma) were phosphorylated using GST-Lyn kinase with 4 mm [γ-32P]ATP (400–800 cpm/pmol) as described (26Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein substrates were assayed at 30 °C for 10 min in reaction buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as described previously (26Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as substrate were performed as described (26Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm pNPP at 30 °C for 10 min. Limited tryptic cleavage was performed at 30 °C in 1.0 ml of buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 μg of TC45, and various weight ratios ofl-1-p-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) to TC45 as indicated. For SDS-PAGE analysis, reactions were terminated at varying times by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. A 100-μl aliquot of the reaction was mixed with 185 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. Precipitates were washed three times with acetone, dissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and electrophoresed on SDS gels containing 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide. For zero time points, samples were withdrawn prior to adding trypsin. To collect samples for both PTP assays and SDS-PAGE, a 99-μl aliquot of the reaction was withdrawn at each time point and added to a tube containing 1 μl of 100 mg/ml PMSF. A 50-μl aliquot of the PMSF-treated sample was transferred to another tube containing 10 μl of trypsin inhibitor (6 μg/μl) and diluted for measuring activity. The remainder of the PMSF-treated sample was precipitated by addition of 93 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and used for SDS-PAGE analysis. For protein sequence analysis, limited proteolytic fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described by Matsudaira (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Blue R250, protein or peptide bands on the membrane were excised and analyzed by automated gas phase sequencing. Prior to separation on SDS gels, some fragments were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column (Vydac, 2.1 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile at a flow rate of 150 μl/min. All automated gas phase sequence analyses were performed using either an Applied Biosystems model 470A sequencer equipped with a model 120A on-line PTH analyzer or an Applied Biosystems model 491 gas phase sequencer. Samples for mass spectrometric analysis were further purified and exchanged into compatible buffers by reverse-phase HPLC using either a C4 column (Vydac, 2.1 × 250 mm) for wild type and mutant TC45 or a C18 column (Vydac, 2.1 × 250 mm) for proteolytic fragments. Columns were eluted with a linear 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 150 μl/min. After concentrating to 5–10 pmol/μl under vacuum, samples were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry or MALDI-TOF. The TC48 and TC45 splice variants of human TCPTP were expressed in E. coli under control of the T7 promoter. Most of the TC48 variant was insoluble, whereas TC45 composed about 20–25% of the soluble protein. Therefore, the TC45 splice variant was used for these studies. TC45 was purified 4-fold using DEAE-cellulose and CM-Sepharose chromatography to yield about 60 mg of enzyme/liter of culture. The purified protein migrated as a single band on SDS gels (Fig.2) with an estimated purity of greater than 95% and a molecular weight of 45,000, which is in good agreement with the predicted value of 45,168. The N-terminal sequence of TC45 (PTTIEREFEELD) agreed with the predicted sequence in which an N-terminal Met had been cleaved by an E. coliaminopeptidase. The K m for RCML was 260 nm, and the V max varied from 0.2 to 0.8 μmol/min/mg in different preparations. Previous studies (14Zander N.F. Lorenzen J.A. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Daum G. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6964-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7280-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have shown that limited trypsinolysis of human TC48 produces an activated 33-kDa fragment, but the precise positions of the tryptic cleavage site(s) have not been determined. To analyze the role of the noncatalytic C-terminal domain in controlling the activity of TCPTP and to identify potential regulatory sequences, limited trypsinolysis was used to map tryptic cleavage sites and probe the domain organization of TC45. Digestion with a 1:20 ratio of trypsin (1:20 weight ratio of trypsin:TC45) for 30 min resulted in nearly quantitative conversion of the native enzyme to a protease-resistant fragment of 33-kDa (Fig.3 A). Use of less trypsin (1:50 weight ratio) showed that the appearance of the 33-kDa fragment was preceded by the formation of a transient 42-kDa intermediate (Fig.3 B). Under these conditions, multiple fragments with sizes between 42 and 45 kDa were observed at early time points (Fig.3 B). Three separate samples of fragments migrating at positions between full-length TC45 and the 42-kDa band were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. Each sample yielded a single sequence (data not shown) that was identical to the N terminus of the uncleaved protein, suggesting that most of these fragments are being converted to the 42-kDa intermediate by the removal of C-terminal residues. The presence of Coomassie-stained material at or near the dye front of SDS gels (Fig. 3) suggested that polypeptides of 14 kDa or less were formed during limited tryptic proteolysis. To isolate and identify these small fragments, aliquots of a digest (1:50 trypsin) were withdrawn at several times and separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column. Two partially resolved peaks eluting at 26% acetonitrile were analyzed on Tricine gels (Fig. 4) and shown to contain several major polypeptides with molecular mass values of 12, 10, and 7 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4), showed that full-length TC45 as well as the 42- and 33-kDa fragments were not resolved and were contained in a single peak eluting at 60% acetonitrile. HPLC analysis showed that, as the digest progressed, the larger 10- or 12-kDa peptides were being converted to the smaller 7-kDa fragments, which displayed a resistance to trypsin comparable to that of the 33-kDa fragment. To map their position within the TC45 sequence, proteolytic fragments were subjected to N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analyses. The 33- and 42-kDa fragments were derived from the N terminus of the protein since their sequences were identical to that of recombinant TC45 (Table I). The electrospray mass spectrum of the 33- and 42-kDa fragments each showed one major species with a mass that closely matched that predicted for residues 2–288 and 2–352, respectively (Table I).Table IMapping of the major limited proteolytic fragments of TC45 using N-terminal sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometryProteolytic fragmentN-terminal sequence1-aThe first six amino acids determined are shown.Residue no.Predicted mass1-bThe sequence of TC45 (5) was used to calculate the mass of each fragment encompassing the residues listed in the previous column.Observed masskDaDaDa42Pro-Thr-Thr-Ile-Glu-Arg-2–35240,731.140,722 ± 833Pro-Thr-Thr-Ile-Glu-Arg-2–28833,387.933,385 ± 871-cTwo major 7-kDa peptides were detected by mass spectrometry, but amino acid sequencing indicated the presence of a single sequence in this sample.Trp-Lys-Glu-Leu-Ser-Lys-289–3507076.87075.7 ± 0.5289–3527361.27360.1 ± 0.3The positions of major proteolytic fragments within the TC45 sequence were assigned using amino acid sequencing to place the N-terminal residue and the mass to deduce the C-terminal residue.

Amino terminal sequences were determined by gas phase sequencing of samples transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The mass of HPLC-purified fragments were determined using electrospray mass spectrometry. Samples from the HPLC fraction containing the low molecular mass fragments were separated on Tricine gels. The N-terminal sequence of the 12- and 7-kDa fragments obtained from this gel began with Trp-289, showing that they were both generated by cleavage after Arg-288. Despite the heterogeneity observed upon electrophoresis, samples taken directly from the HPLC fraction yielded a single sequence that also began with Trp-289, suggesting that all major peptides ranging in size from 7 to 12 kDa originated from cleavage after Arg-288 and differ only in their C termini. Although the signal for the two 7-kDa fragments dominated, analyses of this HPLC fraction using MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy detected several additional species of higher mass (data not shown), which account for the larger species observed in the gels. Two 7-kDa peptides with masses that match calculated values for residues 289–350 and 289–352 were detected by electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the HPLC fraction (Table I). These data indicate that the C-terminal, noncatalytic segment of TC45 contains two distinct regions (see Fig. 1 B). The C-terminal end (residues 353–387) is exposed and rapidly degraded by trypsin, whereas the remainder of the residues are contained within the 7-kDa fragment (residues 289–350/352) and are protected from tryptic proteolysis. A significant portion of TC45 appears to be cleaved first at sites within this C-terminal, trypsin-sensitive region to give the 42-kDa intermediate, which then undergoes cleavage at Arg-288 to release the active 33-kDa fragment (residues 2–288) containing the catalytic domain of TCPTP and the 7-kDa fragment. Alternatively, TC45 may be cleaved first at Arg-288 to yield 33 and 12-kDa fragments. The 12-kDa fragment is then further degraded at its C terminus to give the 7-kDa fragment. Both the 42-kDa and 12-kDa transient intermediates predicted by these two routes of cleavage were detected in our digests (Figs. 3 and 4). The specific activity of trypsinized TC45 toward RCML (20 μmol/min/mg) was nearly identical to that reported for proteolyzed TC48 (14Zander N.F. Lorenzen J.A. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Daum G. Krebs E.G.

https://openalex.org/W2021019784,"Mouse mast cell protease (mMCP) 1, mMCP-2, mMCP-4, and mMCP-5 are members of a family of related serine proteases whose genes reside within an ∼850 kilobase (kb) complex on chromosome 14 that does not readily undergo crossover events. While mapping the mMCP-1 gene, we isolated a novel gene that encodes a homologous serine protease designated mMCP-9. The mMCP-9 and mMCP-1 genes are only ∼7 kb apart on the chromosome and are oriented back to back. The proximity of the mMCP-1 and mMCP-9 genes now suggests that the low recombination frequency of the complex is due to the closeness of some of its genes. The mMCP-9 transcript and protein were observed in the jejunal submucosa of Trichinella spiralis-infected BALB/c mice. However, in normal BALB/c mice, mMCP-9 transcript and protein were found only in those mast cells that reside in the uterus. Thus, the expression of mMCP-9 differs from that of all other chymases. The observation that BALB/c mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells developed with interleukin (IL) 10 and c-kit ligand contain mMCP-9 transcript, whereas those developed with IL-3 do not, indicates that the expression of this particular chymase is regulated by the cytokine microenvironment. Comparative protein structure modeling revealed that mMCP-9 is the only known granule protease with three positively charged regions on its surface. This property may allow mMCP-9 to form multimeric complexes with serglycin proteoglycans and other negatively charged proteins inside the granule. Although mMCP-9 exhibits a >50% overall amino acid sequence identity with its homologous chymases, it has a unique substrate-binding cleft.

Relative to pancreatic chymotrypsin, these serine proteases have a conserved set of insertions and deletions in their amino acid sequences. The three-dimensional structure of rat mast cell protease II (rMCP-II), which was determined by x-ray crystallography (6Remington S.J. Woodbury R.G. Reynolds R.A. Matthews B.W. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8097-8105Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), shows that the changes result in subtle but important differences relative to the chymotrypsin structure. The deletion of a Cys residue, and therefore a disulfide bond, in the C-terminal portion of these proteases represents one of the amino acid sequence changes that causes a prominent loop to extend part way into the substrate-binding cleft (6Remington S.J. Woodbury R.G. Reynolds R.A. Matthews B.W. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8097-8105Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Šali A. Matsumoto R. McNeil H.P. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9023-9034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that this structural feature causes the chromosome 14 family of serine proteases to have substrate specificities that are more restricted than that of chymotrypsin, whose homologous gene resides on chromosome 8. Each of these serine proteases appears to have a unique set of amino acids in its substrate-binding cleft. It is conceivable that the mMCP genes evolved on chromosome 14 because of the need for multiple proteases with restricted but different substrate specificities. For example, granzyme B is so similar to pancreatic chymotrypsin in its overall amino acid sequence that it was originally predicted to be a chymase. However, granzyme B actually prefers an Asp residue at the P1 position of its substrates because the S1 site of this protease includes the Arg207 residue (8Murphy M.E. Moult J. Bleackley R.C. Gershenfeld H. Weissman I.L. James M.N. Proteins. 1988; 4: 190-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the consequence of restricted substrate specificity led to evolutionary pressure for a larger number of related genes in the mouse. mMCP-1, mMCP-2, mMCP-4, and mMCP-5 all have a conserved face on their surfaces away from the substrate-binding cleft that is positively charged (7Šali A. Matsumoto R. McNeil H.P. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9023-9034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the granule pH of 5.5 (9De Young M.B. Nemeth E.F. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is believed that this positively charged region enables these chromosome 14 chymases to interact electrostatically with negatively charged serglycin proteoglycans in the Golgi region, ensuring the targeting of only properly folded proteases to the secretory granule and the accurate proteolytic conversion of the zymogens after sequestration in the intracellular storage compartment. The tryptase mMCP-7 (10McNeil H.P. Reynolds D.S. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whose gene resides on chromosome 17 rather than chromosome 14, also possesses the conserved face, but its proteoglycan-binding domain includes several His residues in addition to the Lys and Arg residues (12Matsumoto R.

Gurley D.S. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3847-3853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whose gene also resides on chromosome 17, is an exception in that its putative proteoglycan-binding domain resides on a different part of the molecular surface (14Ghildyal N.

The electrostatic characteristics of these proteoglycan-binding domains are important for functional diversity among the mMCPs because they determine both the equilibrium concentration and the rate at which the various chymases and tryptases dissociate from the exocytosed granule core (14Ghildyal N. Friend D.S. Stevens R.L. Austen K.F. Huang C. Penrose J. Šali A. Gurish M.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mMCP-1, mMCP-2, mMCP-4, and mMCP-5 genes are each ∼3 kilobases (kb) in size and contain 5 exons (3Gurish M.F. Nadeau J.H. Johnson K.R. McNeil H.P. Grattan K.M. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

Pulse-field gel electrophoresis revealed that they are located on an ∼850-kb fragment of chromosome 14, but mapping studies failed to reveal a crossover point in the complex even when the linkage analysis was extended to the chromosome 14 family of granzyme genes (2Crosby J.L. Bleackley R.C. Nadeau J.H. Genomics. 1990; 6: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Gurish M.F. Nadeau J.H. Johnson K.R. McNeil H.P. Grattan K.M. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11372-11379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, either many of the protease genes are quite close in the complex or some structural constraint in this region of chromosome 14 hinders recombination events. Because knowledge concerning the order and orientation of the members of the chromosome 14 family of serine protease genes and the relative distances between them is needed for an understanding of their transcriptional regulation, we and others have begun to map the genomic complex in the mouse. We now describe a novel gene, mMCP-9, that resides only ∼7 kb away from the mMCP-1 gene on chromosome 14. The proximity of the two chymase genes offers an explanation for the low recombination frequency of the chromosome 14 complex of serine protease genes. We also show that the mMCP-9 gene, its transcript, and its translated product have several interesting features that account for the selective expression of this gene in specific populations of mast cells. A λ bacteriophage clone (JH-1) (see Fig. 1 A) was isolated by screening a BALB/c mouse genomic library under conditions of high stringency with a radiolabeled probe specific for the mMCP-1 gene (15Huang R. Blom T. Hellman L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mapping analysis with varied restriction enzymes revealed that clone JH-1 contained two homologous but distinct genes. Thus, with standard methodologies, the three EcoRI-derived fragments liberated from the insert were subcloned into Bluescript, and their nucleotide sequences were determined with dideoxy/cycle sequencing methodologies (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). One sequence corresponded to the mMCP-1 gene. Because the other was novel, it was designated the mMCP-9 gene. 2The novel gene was designated as the mMCP-9 gene because it is the ninth granule serine protease expressed by mouse mast cells. Although the N-terminal amino acid sequence of mMCP-3 has been determined (19Reynolds D.S. Stevens R.L. Lane W.S. Carr M.H. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3230-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the nucleotide sequence of its transcript and that of its gene have not. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the mMCP-8 transcript have been reported by Huang and co-workers in GenBankTM Data Bank (accession number X78545). The GenBank accession numbers for the mMCP-9 gene and cDNA are AF007119 andAF007120, respectively. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach confirmed that the EcoRI fragments were contiguous in the phage clone. For example, mMCP-9-specific sense (5′-GTACATCTTGCCTCCAAATTAC-3′) and antisense (5′-CAACACATCGCCCAGGCTT-3′) primers were used to amplify a 300-base pair (bp) fragment from the clone that spanned the EcoRI site between fragments JH-1B and JH-1C. Each of the 30 cycles of the PCR consisted of a 30-s denaturing step at 94 °C, a 45-s annealing step at 60 °C, and a 60-s extension step at 72 °C. Generally, each PCR contained 50 ng of phage DNA and 300 ng of primer in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. The amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% low melting point agarose gel, and the appropriate DNA fragments were excised, purified with GenecleanTM (BIO 101 Inc., Vista, CA), and sequenced. The orientation and spacing of the mMCP-1 and mMCP-9 genes in chromosomal DNA were confirmed with a long range PCR approach. Each 100-μl sample contained 200 ng of BALB/c mouse chromosomal DNA (CLONTECH), 300 ng of an oligonucleotide primer (5′-TTCACCCCAATCTCCCCAC-3′) that corresponded to a region in exon 5 of the mMCP-9 gene, and 300 ng of an oligonucleotide primer (5′-CCTGTCCCTTTGAGGATCTCA-3′) that corresponded to a region in exon 5 of the mMCP-1 gene. A long range PCR kit was used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Each of the 30 cycles of the PCR consisted of a 1-min denaturing step at 94 °C, a 10-min annealing step at 60 °C, and a 10-min extension step at 72 °C. The mMCP-9 transcript was sought in various tissues of normal BALB/c mice (The Jackson Lab., Bar Harbor, ME), BALB/c mice that had been infected with Trichinella spiralis(20Ghildyal N. McNeil H.P.

Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar) from liver, spleen, ear, intestine, and uterus of normal BALB/c mice and from liver and spleen of V3 mastocytosis mice. V3 mastocytosis mice were used 2–4 weeks after the adoptive transfer of ∼106v-abl-immortalized V3 mast cells into the tail vein of each 6-week-old BALB/c mouse (22Gurish M.F. Pear W.S. Stevens R.L.

RNA also was isolated from mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (mBMMC) that were developed for 3 weeks with recombinant mouse interleukin-3 (IL) (100 units/ml) alone (23Razin E. Ihle J.N. Seldin D.

Lastly, BALB/c mice were infected with ∼500 T. spiralis larvae (20Ghildyal N. McNeil H.P. Stechschulte S. Austen K.F. Silberstein D. Gurish M.F. Somerville L.L. Stevens R.L. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and then total RNA was isolated from the intestine on day 10 after infection. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the mMCP-9 gene, including its exon/intron organization, primers were designed for reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR that would enable the amplification and cloning of an ∼650-bp cDNA that encodes from residues 17 to 226 of mature mMCP-9. Reverse transcription was performed on 5 μg of total RNA with avian myeloblastoma virus RT (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The reaction was oligo(dT)-primed, and two cycles were performed at 42 °C, each for 1 h. PCR was then performed with sense (5′-TGGCCTATGTGAATACCTTCAGTAA-3′) and antisense (5′-GGCTTTTCACTACTCGCCCTT-3′) primers specific for mMCP-9 or sense (5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA-3′) and antisense (5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′) primers (CLONTECH) specific for mouse cytoplasmic β-actin (26Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Each of the 30 cycles of the PCR consisted of a 1-min denaturing step at 94 °C, a 2-min annealing step at 60 °C, and a 3-min extension step at 72 °C. Vent polymerase was used to reduce the number of PCR-induced point mutations in the nucleotide sequences of the generated DNA. The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and their sizes were determined by comparison with fragments obtained from a HindIII digest of λ DNA, aHaeIII digest of φX174 DNA, or a synthetic DNA ladder consisting of 15 blunt-ended fragments that increase in multiples of 100 bp from 100 to 1500 bp (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). In one instance, the RT-PCR product obtained from the intestine ofT. spiralis-infected mice was purified, inserted into a PCR cloning vector with a commercially available kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), and sequenced. In another instance, the RT-PCR product from uterus was purified by gel electrophoresis and directly sequenced. An immunohistochemical approach (27Boenisch T. Farmilo A.J. Stead R.H. Naish S.J. Immunochemical Staining Methods Handbook. DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA1989: 11Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the presence of mMCP-9 protein in different populations ofin vivo differentiated mast cells. The peptide Val-Glu-Leu-Lys-Ile-Val-Gly-Glu-Lys, which corresponds to residues 144 to 152 of mature mMCP-9, is not present in homologous mMCP-1, mMCP-2, mMCP-4, or mMCP-5. A model of the three-dimensional structure of homologous chymase mMCPs (7Šali A. Matsumoto R. McNeil H.P. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9023-9034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) predicted that this peptide would protrude from the surface of the folded enzyme. Thus, antibodies were raised in rabbits against the synthetic peptide by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with peptide coupled to bovine serum albumin detected reactivity at an ∼30,000-fold dilution. When SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis was used to test its specificity, the affinity-purified antibody at a 1000-fold dilution did not recognize insect cell-derived recombinant mMCP-1, mMCP-2, mMCP-4, or mMCP-5 (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry was carried out as described for anti-peptide antibodies to mMCP-1 (21Friend D.S. Ghildyal N. Austen K.F. Gurish M.F. Matsumoto R. Stevens R.L. J.

Sections of tissue were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 4 h at room temperature, dehydrated, embedded in JB4 glycolmethacrylate (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA), sectioned at 2 μm thickness, and picked up on glass slides. In each analysis, the chloroacetate esterase enzyme cytochemistry reaction (21Friend D.S. Ghildyal N. Austen K.F. Gurish M.F. Matsumoto R. Stevens R.L. J.

The rest of the slides were routinely incubated sequentially in 2 mmCaCl2 containing 0.125% trypsin, PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 4% normal goat serum, and 4% normal goat serum containing the appropriate affinity purified rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig). The samples were washed, incubated in buffer containing biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, washed twice in 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, incubated in Vectastain ABC-AP reagent (Vector Lab., Burlingame, CA), and then incubated in the alkaline phosphatase substrate solution. Control samples consisted of sections of tissue from mice treated with nonimmune IgG (Endogen, Boston, MA) or without primary antibody. Tissue sections were counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin in 20% ethylene glycol, and coverslips with Immu-Mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA) were applied. Although all proteases transcripts that have been cloned so far are expressed in the spleen (22Gurish M.F. Pear W.S. Stevens R.L. Scott M.L. Sokol K. Ghildyal N. Webster M.J. Hu X. Austen K.F.

Woodbury R.G. Reynolds R.A. Matthews B.W. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8097-8105Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) used as the template. The model of mMCP-9 passes all the stereochemistry checks implemented in the program PROCHECK-3 (32Laskowski R.L. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and also the energy profile test by the program ProsaII (33Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). The electrostatic potentials of mMCP-9 below and above pH 6.5 were calculated with the GRASP program (34Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar) with standard atomic charges from the CHARMM-22 force field (35Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M.K. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13766) Google Scholar). Each Lys and Arg residue was assigned a net positive charge, and each Glu and Asp residue was assigned a net negative charge. Each His residue was assigned a net positive charge below pH 6.5 and a net neutral charge above pH 6.5. When the JH-1 genomic clone was digested with EcoRI, three fragments were obtained whose sizes were approximately 1.4, 2.6, and 9 kb (Fig.1 A). Although the insert in the JH-1 phage clone was only ∼13 kb, nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed the presence of two complete serine protease genes. Fragment JH-1A contained exons 1–3 of the mMCP-1 gene, whereas fragment JH-1B contained its last two exons. Based on the conserved exon/intron organization of closely related mMCP genes, the mMCP-9 gene is 2.6 kb in size and contains five exons. Fragment JH-1C contained exons 1–3 of the mMCP-9 gene, whereas fragment JH-1B contained the last two exons of the gene. PCR analysis of the EcoRI junctions indicated that the three fragments are contiguous in the isolated phage clone. Moreover, the same sized ∼7-kb fragment was isolated from chromosomal and plasmid DNA when a long range PCR approach was used to amplify the nucleotide sequence that spans the two genes (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the mMCP-1 and mMCP-9 genes are orientated back-to-back with only ∼7 kb of 3′ flanking DNA separating them. The nucleotide sequence of the mMCP-9 gene and its exon/intron organization are shown in Fig.2. With primers located in exons 2 and 5 of the mMCP-9 gene, an RT-PCR product of the correct size was obtained from total RNA isolated from the intestines of BALB/c mice that had been infected with T. spiralis for 10 days (Fig.3). The nucleotide sequence of the nearly full-length cDNA corresponded precisely with the putative exons in the gene. The mMCP-9 gene and mRNA, therefore, encode a serine protease whose putative mature form consists of 226 amino acids. In its zymogen form, mMCP-9 has a putative 18-residue signal peptide and a Glu-Glu pro-peptide. In its mature form, mMCP-9 exhibits a >50% overall amino acid sequence identity with the other mMCPs at the complex. mMCP-9 possesses the catalytic triad of His45, Asp89, and Ser182, as well as the N terminus of Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly characteristic of serine proteases. Mature mMCP-9 has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, residing at residues 82 and 100. A comparative model of mMCP-9 based on the rMCP-II crystallographic structure revealed that most residues in the S1 sites of mMCP-9, rMCP-II, and pancreatic chymotrypsin are similar in terms of size, polarity, and charge (Fig. 4). Thus, it is likely that mMCP-9 is a chymase, preferring a hydrophobic residue at the P1 position of its substrates. Relative to chymotrypsin, mMCP-9 possesses the same set of insertions and deletions in its amino acid sequence that have been identified in rMCP-II, mMCP-1, mMCP-2, mMCP-4, and mMCP-5. For example, mMCP-9 has the prominent 3-residue insertion in loop A, which extends into the substrate-binding cleft and probably narrows the substrate specificity at the S3′ site. Despite its overall similarity to rMCP-II and the other mouse mast cell chymases, mMCP-9 has a number of unique or nearly unique residues that form its substrate-binding cleft. For example, residue 198 in the substrate-binding cleft is a Ser in mMCP-9 but is a Tyr in most other chymases. There is almost no conservation of the charged residues in the substrate-binding clefts of mMCP-9 and the other mouse mast cell chymases. In particular, mMCP-9 has the most positively charged S3′ site, suggesting a preference for a negatively charged residue at position P3′ in its substrates. mMCP-9 is the most positively charged mMCP so far cloned. Because mature mMCP-9 possesses 11 Arg, 20 Lys, 7 His, 8 Glu, and 5 Asp residues, it has overall net charges of +25 and +18 at pH values below and above 6.5, respectively. When properly folded, mMCP-9 is predicted to have three almost contiguous regions of positive electrostatic potential that cover approximately one-half of the total molecular surface (Fig. 5). These regions are located away from the substrate-binding cleft. Region 1 includes Lys86, Lys118, Lys147, Lys152, Lys155, Arg158, His159, Lys161, Lys173, Arg200, Lys204, and Arg211. Region 2 inclu"

Transgenic mice expressing a BH1 mutant Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 mI-3), which fails to heterodimerize with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax, were generated. Bcl-2 mI-3 protected immature CD4+8+ thymocytes from spontaneous, glucocorticoid and anti-CD3-induced apoptosis and altered T cell maturation, resulting in increased percentages of CD3hi and CD4−8+ thymocytes. In contrast, apoptosis of peripheral T-cells was unaffected by transgene expression. This correlated with their high Bax expression level and insensitivity to the caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, a functional hallmark of Bax-like activity. Thus, within the T-cell lineage Bcl-2 can inhibit apoptosis independent of its association with Bax or its homologs; yet, above a threshold level of their physiologic proapoptotic activity, the capacity of Bcl-2 to heterodimerize with Bax or its homologs appears essential for it to counter cell death.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an evolutionarily conserved physiological process that ensures the elimination of unwanted or damaged cells from multicellular organisms (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6645) Google Scholar, 2Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Although apoptosis can be initiated by diverse physiological and experimental stimuli, ultrastructurally apoptotic cells are characterized by plasma membrane reorganization and blebbing, cell shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation, suggesting the convergence of these signals on a common final effector pathway (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6645) Google Scholar, 3Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Insight into the molecular nature of this effector mechanism has been initially derived from genetic studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the nematode, two autosomal recessive death effector genes, ced-3 andced-4, are required for the death of all 131 cells destined to die during worm development (2Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar, 4Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S.

Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Ced-3 is related to a family of mammalian cysteine proteases (caspases) (5Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar, 7Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), which are activated uniformly in mammalian apoptosis and required for certain aspects of cell death through the cleavage of a number of substrate proteins (for review, see Refs. 3Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar and 8Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ced-9 is a functional and structural homolog of Bcl-2 (9Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), the prototype member of the Bcl-2 protein family in vertebrates, which is able to inhibit the effect of many, but not all, apoptotic stimuli (for review, see Ref. 10Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in mammalian cells, Ced-9 and the Bcl-2 functional homolog, Bcl-xL (11Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2891) Google Scholar), can interact with (12Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K.

Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), while recruiting it from the cytosol to intracellular membranes (13Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 275: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, Ced-4 can simultaneously interact with, and presumably activate, Ced-3 or its mammalian counterparts, interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE; caspase 1) and Flice (caspase 8), biochemically linking Ced-9 and the Bcl-2 family to Ced-3 and the mammalian caspases (12Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that apoptosis is precipitated by the proteolytic cleavage of one or several critical substrates, and Bcl-2 may function by blocking the activation of caspases by inactivating Apaf-1, the recently identified mammalian homolog of Ced-4 (15Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, however, the control of apoptosis appears more complex than seen in C. elegans. For instance, mammals contain several genes encoding caspases and Bcl-2 homologs, whereas only a single essential copy of each type of gene has been identified to date in the nematode (2Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar, 6Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Also, Bcl-2 can prevent the mitochondrial release of an apoptogenic protease (AIF) (16Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), as well as of cytochrome c (17Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar), which, together with Apaf-1 can lead to caspase 3 activation (15Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

More importantly, in vertebrates two functional classes of Bcl-2-related proteins exist which share highly conserved Bcl-2 homology 1 (BH1), 1The abbreviations used are: BH1, BH2, BH3, Bcl-2 homology 1, 2, and 3 domains, respectively; wt, wild type; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; FCS, fetal calf serum; IL, interleukin; TCR, T-cell receptor.1The abbreviations used are: BH1, BH2, BH3, Bcl-2 homology 1, 2, and 3 domains, respectively; wt, wild type; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; FCS, fetal calf serum; IL, interleukin; TCR, T-cell receptor. 2 (BH2), and 3 (BH3) domains: antiapoptotic members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, A1, Bcl-w, Bfl-1, Brag-1), which inhibit cell death, and proapoptotic members (Bax, Bak, Bad, Bik, Bid, and Hrk), which accelerate apoptosis and counter the death-repressive function of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL upon receiving a death signal (for review, see Ref.20Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). Several in vivo studies confirm (21Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) that in vertebrates the balance between death-promoting and death-repressing members of the Bcl-2 family contributes a critical checkpoint that determines the susceptibility of a cell to an apoptotic stimulus (for review, see Ref. 10Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) by which Bax and its homologs exert their death-promoting function at physiological expression levels is not clear. Inducible overexpression of Bax in yeast or in mammalian cells can trigger cell death in the absence of additional apoptotic stimuli (25Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations within the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL which abrogate their function also cause loss of heterodimerization with Bax in mammalian cells (30Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 31Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These data suggest that at high expression levels proapoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins possess the capacity to be directly cytotoxic and that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL may have to form a protein complex with them to counter cell death. However, selected BH1 and BH2 mutants of Bcl-xL can exert their death-repressing activity even in the absence of heterodimerization with Bax (33Cheng E.H. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; : 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Bax can also directly compete with Ced-4 for association with Bcl-xL, together implying that at physiological expression levels Bax-like proteins may merely act as inert competitive inhibitors of Bcl-2 and its functional homologs (12Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To assess the antiapoptotic mechanism of Bcl-2 in relation to its capacity to dimerize with Bax and its homologs in a physiological context, transgenic mice expressing a BH1 mutant of Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 mI-3) (30Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) in the T-cell lineage were generated. The varied sensitivity of thymocytes and peripheral T-cells to caspase inhibition (see below) suggested the suitability of this lineage to test this question. Bcl-2 mI-3 (G145A) does not form heterodimers with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (30Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), yet it protected immature CD4+8+ thymocytes from spontaneous, glucocorticoid and anti-CD3-induced apoptosis. Despite this, transgene expression provided no protection against apoptosis of peripheral T-cells that displayed a high level of Bax expression and insensitivity to caspase inhibition. Thus, within the T-cell lineage Bcl-2 can inhibit cell death independent of association with Bax or its homologs; yet Bcl-2 must heterodimerize with Bax or its homologs above a threshold level of their physiologic cytotoxic activity to counter apoptosis. The construct was generated by insertion of a 0.75-kilobase fragment, containing the coding region of humanbcl-2 mI-3 cDNA (30Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) into thelck-hGH vector (35Chaffin K.E. Beals C.R. Wilkie T.M. Forbush K.A. Simon M.I. Perlmutter R.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The bcl-2 mI-3cDNA was inserted by blunt end ligation into the BamHI cloning site 3′ to the lckpr . The correct orientation was selected, and Sfil was used to prepare the 6.3-kilobase lckpr -bcl-2 mI-3 used for microinjection (see Fig. 2 A). Transgenic mice were produced by DNX Transgenics on a C57BL6/SJL background. All animals were bred and maintained in a pathogen-free environment at DNX Transgenics and were transferred to the Northwestern University Experimental Animal Facility 2–12 weeks before analysis. Thelckpr-bcl-2 wt (wild type) transgenic mice were provided by Dr. Stanley J. Korsmeyer (Washington University, St. Louis). Flow cytometry reagents were as follows: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-murine CD8 and anti-murine CD3, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-murine CD4, and anti-murine B220 (Pharmingen, San Diego); 6C8, human Bcl-2-specific hamster mAb (36Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3496) Google Scholar), and the anti-murine CD3e mAb (145-2C11, Pharmingen) were used. 651, a murine Bax-specific rabbit pAb (34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Stanley J. Korsmeyer (Washington University). The 6C8 mAb was biotinylated as described previously (37Veis D.J. Sentman C.L. Bach E.A. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2546-2554PubMed Google Scholar). For Western immunostaining, the primary antibody dilutions were: 6C8 (1:100), biotinylated 6C8 (1:500), 651 (1:500). The primary antibodies were detected with species-specific biotinylated secondary antibodies (Pierce). For flow cytometry, cells were washed twice in staining buffer, 1% fraction 5 bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Each sample of 106 cells was stained in 100 μl of buffer. Primary incubation was with staining buffer alone (negative control) or with 1 μg of PE- or FITC-conjugated specific antibody for 30 min at 4 °C followed by washing with staining buffer. After additional washes in staining buffer, the samples were resuspended in 100 μl of staining buffer and analyzed on a FACscan analyzer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Murine lymphoid organs were placed in sterile ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium, and cells were prepared as described previously (38Sentman C.L. Shutter J.R. Hockenbery D. Kanagawa O. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Splenic T-cells were purified by negative selection with affinity chromatography, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cellect Mouse T-cell kit, Biotex Laboratories). T-cells were always 90–95% pure as judged by CD3, B220 double staining and were > 95% viable. Jurkat cells (clone E6-1, ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml). The interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine cell line FL5.12, a lymphoid progenitor clone, was maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 25 IU/ml recombinant murine IL-3 (Genzyme). For induction of cell death FL5.12 cells were IL-3 deprived, as described (39Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar), and Jurkat cells were treated with 100 ng/ml anti-human Fas mAb (Upstate Biotechnology) in the absence or presence of 100 μmz-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2F (zVAD-fmk) (Enzyme Systems Products). For induction of spontaneous apoptosis, thymocytes, splenic T-cells, and lymph node cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FCS in the absence or presence of 100 μm zVAD-fmk. At each time point cells were collected and stained with FITC-conjugated annexin-V/propidium iodide, according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Flow cytometry was performed (FACscan), and cell populations negative for both annexin-V and propidium iodide were scored as viable. 0.5 mg of water-soluble dexamethasone (Sigma) or 50 μg of affinity-purified anti-CD3 mAb (145-2C11, Pharmingen) or vehicle (RPMI 1640) control was injected intraperitoneally into 6–8-week-old transgenic and control littermates. Thymi were removed 48 h after treatment, and cell suspensions were made by teasing in ice-cold RPMI 1640 and were stained for surface CD4,CD8 and CD3,B220 within 2 h. Before metabolic labeling thymocytes were washed once in prewarmed, serum-free, methionine-free Dulbecco's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were resuspended at 3–5 × 106 cells/ml in methionine-free Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS. Metabolic labeling was performed with 40 μCi/ml [35S]methionine, [35S]cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN) for 9–12 h before. All steps of the immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled or unlabeled cells with the 6C8 mAb were performed, as described previously (39Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). Gels containing immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were fixed with 10% glacial acetic acid and 30% methanol overnight and enhanced by impregnating with a commercial fluorography enhancing solution (Enhance, NEN Life Science Products) before autoradiography. Gels containing immunoprecipitated unlabeled proteins were electrotransferred overnight at 4 °C on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Single cell suspensions were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100 with 2 mg of aprotinin ml−1 for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 27,000 × g, the amount of protein in the supernatants was quantitated (DC Protein Assay kit, Bio-Rad). For determining Bcl-2 and Bax expression levels, equal amounts of protein were electrotransferred overnight at 4 °C on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunostaining for Bcl-2 was performed, as described previously (39Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar), and was developed with diazobenzidine (Bio-Rad) enhanced with nickel chloride (0.03%). Immunostaining for Bax was performed, as described previously (34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) by utilizing the 651 pAb and was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham). Immunostaining for coimmunoprecipitated Bax was performed by utilizing the 651 pAb, and for Bcl-2 by utilizing biotinylated 6C8 mAb, as described previously (34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 37Veis D.J. Sentman C.L. Bach E.A. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2546-2554PubMed Google Scholar), and was developed with ECL. Recently, Bcl-2 was shown to be able to block apoptosis at least in part by inhibiting the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (17Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.

Moreover, the Bcl-2 homolog, Bcl-xL, can interact with Ced-4 and block Ced-3- or Ced-4-induced apoptosis (12Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Induction of cell death by all of these mechanisms can be inhibited by zVAD-fmk, an irreversible pseudosubstrate caspase inhibitor (12Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M.

Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4356) Google Scholar). zVAD-fmk was also shown to block Fas-induced caspase activation and cell death (40Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bax-induced cell death was only partially effected by zVAD-fmk, as blocking IL-1β-converting enzyme-like protease activity prevented the cleavage of selected nuclear and cytosolic substrates, but cytoplasmic vacuolation and plasma membrane changes still occurred (28Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). To examine the role of Bax, or Bax-like activity, on thymocyte and splenic T-cell apoptosis, the effect of zVAD-fmk on their spontaneous cell death was examined. As initial controls, Fas-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells and IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis of FL5.12 cells in the presence or absence of 100 μm zVAD-fmk were tested. As described previously (28Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas antibody died rapidly, a process that was completely prevented by simultaneous treatment with zVAD-fmk (Fig. 1 A). The cleavage of PARP, a well characterized marker of caspase cascade activation (41Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar), was also prevented in the presence of zVAD-fmk in anti-Fas antibody-treated Jurkat cells (data not shown). In contrast, zVAD-fmk proved ineffective against cell death induced by IL-3 deprivation of FL5.12 cells (Fig. 1 C), a cell line that possesses high amount of endogenous Bax (39Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5764) Google Scholar). These data are in agreement with previous experiments in which IL-2 deprivation-induced death in murine CTLL-2 cells was not blocked by two different caspase inhibitors (42Vasilakos J.P. Ghayur T. Carroll R.T. Giegel D.A. Saunders J.M. Quintal L. Keane K.M. Shivers B.D. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3433-3442PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of caspase inhibition on the spontaneous apoptosis of thymocytes and splenic T-cells, suspensions of these cells from nontransgenic littermates were placed in vitro in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of 100 μm zVAD-fmk. The spontaneous apoptosis of thymocytes was reduced by zVAD-fmk (Fig. 1 B), similar to that described previously (43Sarin A. Wu M. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2245-2250Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 44Clayton L.K. Ghendler Y. Mizoguchi E. Patch R.J. Ocain T.D. Orth K. Bhan A.K. Dixit V.M. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2282-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Spontaneous apoptosis of splenic T-cells, however, was essentially unaffected by the addition of an identical concentration of zVAD-fmk (Fig. 1 D). To ensure that zVAD-fmk was equally functional in both cell types, thymocytes and splenic T-cells were also treated with anti-Fas antibody. Of note, murine thymocytes and splenic T-cells are known to present Fas receptor on the cell surface (45Li T. Ramirez K. Palacios R. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 107-114PubMed Google Scholar, 46Tucek-Szabo C.L. Andjelic S. Lacy E. Elkon K.B. Nikolic-Zugic J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 192-200PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Fas antibody treatment accelerated the rate of spontaneous cell death in both cell types, and simultaneous treatment with 100 μm zVAD-fmk inhibited this Fas-induced acceleration of cell death in both thymocytes and splenic T-cells (Fig.1, B and D). Thus, although zVAD-fmk proved functional in both cell types, it did not alter the rate of spontaneous apoptosis in splenic T-cells, an observation identical to that seen with Bax-induced cytotoxicity (28Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). As thymocyte and splenic T-cell apoptosis differed in their sensitivity to caspase inhibition, this lineage appeared suitable to study the importance of the heterodimerization capacity of Bcl-2 for its antiapoptotic function. Therefore, we developed a transgenic mouse model to assess the effects of a BH1 domain substitution mutant of Bcl-2 (mI-3, G145A) (30Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) upon T-cell development and T-cell death. This well characterized Bcl-2 mutant fails to counter apoptosis in FL5.12 cells following IL-3 withdrawal and does not heterodimerize with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax (30Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar), or Bid (34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). A transgenic construct was generated by inserting a human bcl-2 mI-3 cDNA downstream of the lckpr (35Chaffin K.E. Beals C.R. Wilkie T.M. Forbush K.A. Simon M.I. Perlmutter R.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). The 3′-untranslated portion of this construct provided introns, exons, and the poly(A) addition site from the human growth hormone gene hGH. Seven founder animals bearing the lckpr-bcl-2 mI-3 construct were identified. Five lines were established, and each line was examined for human Bcl-2 mI-3 expression in the thymus (Fig. 2 B, top panel) and spleen (Fig.2 B, bottom panel) by Western immunoblot analysis utilizing the human Bcl-2-specific mAb, 6C8 (36Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3496) Google Scholar). The tissue specificity of the lckpr-bcl-2 mI-3 transgene was examined by Western blot analysis, which failed to show transgene expression in non-lymphoid tissues, including the brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung (data not shown). The thymus of transgenic animals contained a distinct cortex and medulla and was normal in size. The distribution of splenic red and white pulp was similar in transgenic and control littermate mice (data not shown). The two lines, 67 and 72, with the highest levels of human Bcl-2 mI-3 expression in thymocytes (Fig. 2 B, top panel) and splenocytes (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel) were characterized further and compared with the previously establishedlckpr-bcl-2 wt transgenic model (38Sentma"

In this study a putative adhesin B in <i>Hemophilus influenzae</i>, the product of gene HI0119, has been identified as a periplasmic zinc-binding protein (PZP1). A <i>pzp1</i>-deficient mutant has been constructed which is defective for growth under aerobic conditions and grows poorly under anaerobic conditions. The growth defect is specifically rescued by supplementing the growth medium with high concentrations of zinc. Subcellular fractionation was used to localize PZP1 to the periplasmic region in a nontypeable <i>H. influenzae</i> strain and in a transfected recombinant <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain (TApzp1). Recombinant PZP1, purified from a periplasmic extract of <i>E. coli</i> strain TApzp1, contained ∼two zinc atoms/protein molecule as determined by neutron activation analysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The zinc atoms could be removed by incubation with EDTA, and, by further addition of zinc, a total of five zinc atoms/PZP1 could be bound. Direct binding of <sup>65</sup>Zn to the recombinant protein by Western blot was demonstrated. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that PZP1 plays a key role in zinc uptake by <i>H. influenzae</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2042845673,"Protease nexin 1 (PN1) is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) that acts as a suicide substrate for thrombin (Th) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). PN1 forms 1:1 stoichiometric complexes with these proteases, which are then rapidly bound, internalized, and degraded. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is the receptor responsible for the internalization of protease-PN1 complexes. However, we found that the LRP is not significantly involved in the initial cell surface binding of thrombin-PN1, leading us to investigate what cellular component was responsible for this initial interaction. Since Th-PN1 complexes retain a high-affinity for heparin after complex formation, unlike several of the other SERPINs, we tested the possibility that cell surface heparins were involved in initial complex binding. Soluble heparin was found to be a potent inhibitor of the binding of Th-PN1 to the cell surface and greatly facilitated the dissociation of Th-PN1 complexes pre-bound in the absence of soluble heparin. To ascertain the role of cell surface heparins, further studies were done using complexes of thrombin and PN1(K7E), a variant of PN1 in which the heparin binding site was rendered non-functional. When added at equal initial concentrations of complexes, Th-PN1(K7E) was catabolized 5- to 10-fold less efficiently than Th-PN1, a direct result of the greatly diminished initial binding of the Th-PN1(K7E) complexes. These data demonstrate the sizable contribution of cell surface heparins to Thrombin-PN1 complex binding and support a model in which these heparins act to concentrate the complexes at the cell surface facilitating their subsequent LRP-dependent endocytosis.

Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is an important physiological regulator of thrombin in tissues, and like its plasma counter part, antithrombin III, it is activated by heparin (1Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baker J.B. Low D.A. Simmer R.L. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1980; 21: 37-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Like other members of the SERPIN family, PN1 is proteolytically attacked by its target protease but arrests proteolytic cleavage resulting in the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with that protease (1Scott R.W. Bergman B.L. Bajpai A. Hersh R.T. Rodriguez H. Jones B.N. Barreda C. Watts S. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7029-7034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baker J.B. Low D.A. Simmer R.L. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1980; 21: 37-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Only PN1 that is in complex with a protease is internalized and degraded by cells at a significant rate (3Howard E. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is presumably due to the formation or unmasking of a receptor binding site in PN1 when in complex with a protease, which is absent in the free SERPIN. One candidate site within the PN1 sequence for this function has recently been identified (4Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, this ensures that SERPINs will remain extracellular until they have become part of an inhibitory complex. Once they have formed an inhibitory complex with a protease, the rapid removal of protease-SERPIN complexes is important for two reasons. First, since there is evidence to suggest that protease-SERPIN complexes may not be covalently linked (5Shieh B.H. Potempa J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13420-13423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the uninternalized complexes represent a potential source of active protease formed when the complexes dissociate. Second, in the case of one SERPIN, α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT), the internalization of protease-α1-AT complexes generates an intracellular signal that leads to an up-regulation of α1-AT synthesis and secretion (6Perlmutter D.H. Travis J. Punsai P.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1774-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The expression of another SERPIN, tissue-type plasminogen activator, is down-regulated when it forms complexes with the protease, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, that are internalized (7Hardy M.M. Feder J. Wolfe R.A. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6812-6817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The molecule responsible for the endocytosis of complexed PN1 (either with thrombin (Th) or urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)) has been identified as the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (8Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the LRP is required for the internalization of both types of complexes, it does not act as the primary receptor responsible for the concentration of complexes to the cell surface. In the case of uPA-PN1 complexes, the urinary plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) acts as the primary receptor. The uPA-PN1 complexes and the uPAR are then co-endocytosed by an LRP-dependent mechanism (9Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, the uPAR does not act as the primary receptor for PN1 in complex with its other target protease, thrombin (Th-PN1 complexes). This was demonstrated by showing that Th-PN1 complexes did not compete for the binding of uPA-PN1 complexes to the uPAR (8Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the case of protease-PN1 complexes, the protease moiety of the inhibitory complex can determine the initial binding interaction at the cell surface. Several recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of the LRP in the endocytosis of Th-PN1 complexes (8Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mikhailenko I. Krylov D. Argraves K.M. Roberts D.D. Liau G. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6784-6791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), including the recent identification of a site in PN1 that binds to the LRP (4Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The present studies were prompted by our observation that the binding of Th-PN1 complexes to the cell surface is not competed for significantly by the receptor associated protein (RAP), which inhibits the binding of all known ligands to the LRP, and that Th-PN1 complexes do not bind to the uPAR (8Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it has been previously demonstrated that the binding of Th-PN1 complexes is inhibited by soluble heparin (3Howard E. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that heparin sulfate may be involved in the cell surface binding of Th-PN1 complexes prior to LRP-mediated internalization. In the present studies, we demonstrate that soluble heparin is a very potent competitor for the binding of Th-PN1 complexes to the surface of human foreskin fibroblasts (HF) and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF). In addition, a recombinant form of PN1, in which the heparin binding site has been rendered non-functional, is internalized and degraded at 10–20% of the efficiency of recombinant native PN1 by MEF. In a paired mouse embryo cell strain that is LRP-deficient (PEA-13 cells), catabolism of the heparin binding deficient form of PN1 is barely detectable. Taken together, these data support a model in which the Th-PN1 complexes are first concentrated to the cell surface by heparins and subsequently internalized by the LRP. Tissue culture dishes and plasticware were purchased from Corning, Inc., and medium was purchased from Irvine Scientific. BaculoGold baculovirus and High Five insect cells were purchased from PharMingen. Oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT Technologies, and Taq polymerase was from Invitrogen. 1,3,4,6-Tetrachloro-3α-3α-diphenylglycouril (Iodogen) was from Pierce. 125I-Na was obtained from Amersham Corp. electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad, X-OMAT AR x-ray film was from Kodak, and Immobilon-P membrane was from Millipore. All other common reagents were from Sigma. Stocks of primary cultures of human foreskin fibroblasts were grown as described (11Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cell cultures were serum starved for 24–72 h in binding media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2) prior to use in experiments. Normal MEF and PEA-13 cells (MEF deficient in the LRP) were a generous gift from Dr. Joachim Herz (12Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were grown in the same medium and subcultured as described for human fibroblasts (11Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RAP protein was expressed as a fusion protein (RAP-GST) consisting of an amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase sequence followed by the rat RAP sequence. The fusion protein was affinity purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column as described (13Orlando R.A. Kerjaschki D. Kurihara H. Biemesderfer D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6698-6702Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Overlapping PCR was used to generate a variant form of PN1 in which the seven lysine residues in the heparin binding site were changed to glutamic acid as described previously (14Stone S.R. Brown-Leudi M.L. Rovelli G. Guidolin A. McGlynn E. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These included lysine residues 71, 74, 75, 78, 83, 84, and 86. All of the changes were verified by sequence analysis (data not shown). The variant form of PN1 was co-transfected into Sf9 insect cells with BaculoGold baculovirus, and the recombinant virus was recovered by plaque purification as described previously (15Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were used to infect Sf9 insect cells for protein production as described previously (15Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both PN1 and PN1(K7E) were purified using Cibacron blue-Sepharose as described previously (14Stone S.R. Brown-Leudi M.L. Rovelli G. Guidolin A. McGlynn E. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thrombin was radioiodinated using Iodogen as described previously (16Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activities ranged from 15,000 to 22,000 cpm/ng. Fluoresceinated heparin (F-heparin) was radioiodinated using Iodogen as described previously (17Smith J.W. Knauer J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11964-11972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activities ranged from 40,000 to 70,000 cpm/ng. Purification of PN1 from large scale human fibroblast cultures, and the formation and purification of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes and 125I-Th-PN1(K7E) complexes was performed as described (3Howard E. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recombinant PN1(K7E) expressed by a baculovirus expression vector was purified from medium harvested from insect cells as described previously (15Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20935-20941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After purification, PN1 and PN1(K7E) were active site titrated with thrombin using a chromogenic substrate assay as described previously (11Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cell cultures in 24-well dishes were rinsed in bicarbonate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2. One ml of this binding medium, containing 125I-Th-PN1 complexes at the indicated concentrations, was added to each well and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times, 100 μl of the media from individual wells were added to microfuge tubes containing 1.0 ml of 12% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After a 1-h incubation on ice, precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were counted in a γ counter. Background degradation determined from complexes incubated in medium in the absence of cells was subtracted at each timepoint. Fibroblast cell cultures were incubated with binding media containing 125I-Th-PN1 complexes and competing ligands as described above. At the end of the incubations, unbound complexes were removed by aspiration. The cells were washed 4 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 10% SDS, and the cell lysates were counted in a γ counter. Nonspecific binding, approximately 30% of total binding, was determined by incubating 3 wells at each temperature with a 400-fold excess of unlabeled complexes. Two μg of PN1 and PN1(K7E) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide mini-gels in preparative wells. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (16Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following blocking in Tris-saline containing 3% BSA (pH 7.4), 0.5-cm strips were cut and transferred to individual wells. The wells were incubated with 125I-F-heparin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 ng/ml in blocking buffer for 3 h at room temperature. At the end of the incubation unbound ligand was removed, and the wells were rinsed 4 times with PBS, dried, and exposed to a Bio-Rad GS-250 molecular imager screen for 1 h. The digitized image was scanned and quantified using a standard curve to convert pixel density units to moles of heparin, based on the known specific activity of the 125I-F-heparin. Nonspecific binding, approximately 24% of total binding, was determined by incubating 3 wells with a 400-fold excess of unlabeled F-heparin. The catabolism of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes is a multi-step process that starts with cell surface binding and ends with lysosomal degradation (18Knauer D.J. Thompson J.A. Cunningham D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 117: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The role of the LRP in125I-Th-PN1 complex binding, internalization, and degradation was tested by incubating human fibroblasts (HF) with125I-Th-PN1 complexes in the presence and absence of RAP-GST, a protein that inhibits the binding of all known ligands to the LRP (19Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first experiment, degradation of125I-Th-PN1 complexes was quantitated at 37 °C. In previous studies, we have shown that the release of125I-tyrosine into the cell culture medium is a quantitative measurement of lysosome-mediated 125I-Th-PN1 complex degradation by HF (18Knauer D.J.

The HF were incubated with 10 ng/ml125I-Th-PN1 complexes alone or in the presence of 10 to 800 nm RAP-GST fusion protein. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the TCA-soluble 125I-tyrosine, representing degraded 125I-Th-PN1 complexes, was quantitated by γ counting (Fig. 1 A). Degradation products were predominantly mono-iodo-tyrosine as judged by thin layer chromatography (data not shown). Relative to control cultures that received no RAP-GST, there was a RAP-GST dose-dependent decrease in the generation of125I-tyrosine, with a maximum 85% inhibition occurring at the 800 nm dose of RAP-GST. A near maximum level of inhibition of 125I-Th-PN1 complex catabolism was observed at the relatively low 150 nm concentration of RAP-GST. Since the initial event in complex catabolism is binding to a high affinity cell surface receptor on HF cells (3Howard E. Knauer D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we also evaluated the effect of RAP-GST on the total amount of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes that were cell-associated (cell surface-bound plus internalized) at 37 °C (Fig. 1 B) and on the amount of complexes that were cell surface-bound at 4 °C (Fig. 1 C). HF cells were incubated with 125I-Th-PN1 complexes for 3 h, in the presence or absence of RAP-GST over the same concentration range used in panel A. The cells were washed to remove unbound complexes and assayed for total cell-associated complexes at 37 °C, or cell surface-bound 125I-Th-PN1 complexes at 4 °C, respectively. Surprisingly, at 37 °C, RAP-GST caused only a slight reduction in total cell-associated complexes at the highest concentration of 800 nm (Fig. 1 B), although degradation of the 125I-Th-PN1 complexes was inhibited by 85% at this concentration of RAP-GST (Fig.1 A). At 4 °C RAP-GST did not inhibit complex binding at all, and in fact, slightly increased it. These data demonstrate that nearly all of the binding of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes to the cell surface is to a component other than the LRP. This is in good agreement with our recently published observation that the LRP is required only for the internalization of Th-PN1 complexes and that there is a specific binding site in PN1 that mediates this process (4Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unlike other heparin-activated SERPINs, the affinity of PN1 for heparin is the same whether the PN1 is free or is in complex with a protease. This was demonstrated by showing that Th-PN1 complexes and free PN1 bound to heparin-Sepharose both eluted at 0.6 m NaCl (20Evans D.L. McGrogan M. Scott R.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22307-22312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the binding of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes to the cell surface was found to be LRP-independent, we next tested the possibility that heparin played a significant role in the initial cell surface binding of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes to HF and normal MEF. These initial experiments were performed using soluble heparin. In the absence of endocytosis at 4 °C, soluble heparin was a potent inhibitor of complex binding to the surface of both cell types (Fig.2). This inhibition due to heparin was in marked contrast to the results of the parallel experiment performed using the LRP antagonis t, RAP-GST (Fig. 1 C). Although RAP-GST inhibits the binding of all ligands, so far identified, to the LRP, it did not affect the cell surface binding of Th-PN1 complexes, whereas soluble heparin competed very effectively for the cell surface binding of Th-PN1 complexes. The effect of soluble heparin on the dissociation over time of cell surface-bound 125I-Th-PN1 complexes was also examined (Fig.3). 125I-Th-PN1 complexes were bound to HF and MEF cells at 4 °C for 3 h. At the end of the incubation, the cultures were placed on ice and washed four times with PBS to remove unbound ligand. One ml of binding medium was added to the dishes in the presence or absence of 50 nm heparin, and the loss of the 125I-Th-PN1 complexes from the cells was measured over time. In the absence of soluble heparin, the dissociation rate of 125I-Th-PN1 complexes was very slow (Fig. 3). Less than 10% of the complexes dissociated during the 10-min time course without soluble heparin. In sharp contrast, dissociation was very rapid in the presence of 50 nm soluble heparin. Over 80% of the cell surface bound complexes dissociated within 5 min. The slow dissociation from the cell surface in the absence of soluble heparin is very characteristic of ligands bound to cell surface heparins. This is believed to be due to “avidity” because of the high number of binding sites present per heparin chain. The ability of soluble heparin to facilitate dissociation is further evidence that125I-Th-PN1 complexes are bound to cell surface heparins at 4 °C. These data suggest that the complexes may indeed bind to cell surface heparins prior to internalization by the LRP. These data do not, however, rule out the possibility that soluble heparin may bind to the complexes and mask a binding site necessary for binding to another component. Nor do they rule out the possibility that the soluble heparin may bind to a component on the cell surface and mask a site to which the complexes would ordinarily bind. These possibilities were further analyzed below using a genetic variant of PN1 that formed complexes with thrombin but was unable to bind heparin. We generated a variant form of PN1 in which seven of the basic amino acid residues in the heparin binding region were changed to glutamic acid, PN1(K7E). This form of PN1 has been previously generated using a baculovirus expression system (14Stone S.R. Brown-Leudi M.L. Rovelli G. Guidolin A. McGlynn E. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It displayed a second order rate constant for thrombin inhibition in the absence of heparin identical to native PN1, yet was not activated by heparin (14Stone S.R. Brown-Leudi M.L. Rovelli G. Guidolin A. McGlynn E. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, previously no direct studies on the heparin binding properties of this variant were done. In the present studies, PN1(K7E) was also expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified on Cibacron blue-Sepharose as described previously (14Stone S.R. Brown-Leudi M.L. Rovelli G. Guidolin A. McGlynn E. Monard D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The inability of PN1(K7E) to bind heparin is shown in Fig.4 A. Two μg of PN1 and PN1(K7E) were electrophoresed in a preparative mini-gel and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (17Smith J.W. Knauer J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11964-11972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strips were cut and blocked in Tris-saline BSA and incubated with the indicated concentrations of 125I-F-heparin. Following washing, the strips were exposed to a Bio-Rad GS-250 molecular imager screen, and the radioactivity in the bands corresponding to PN1 were quantified. The data clearly show a dose-dependent increase in the binding of heparin to native PN1, and a complete absence of binding of heparin to the PN1(K7E) mutant. Although these are the expected data, based on the inability of the PN1(K7E) to be activated by heparin, it was important to establish the degree of loss of heparin binding in the present studies. To evaluate the subsequent studies performed with the PN1(K7E) variant, we needed to show that the complexes formed between native PN1 and thrombin, and the PN1(K7E) variant and thrombin, had similar properties. Five hundred ng of 125I-Th were incubated with amounts of active site-titrated PN1 and PN1(K7E) required to achieve complete inhibition of the thrombin. After a 40-min incubation at 37 °C, the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Shown in Fig. 4 B is a digitized imaged obtained on a GS-250 molecular imager after a 30-min exposure to the screen. In each lane where complexes were formed, only a trace of free125I-thrombin was visible, and the amount of labeled complexes formed using the different forms of PN1 were nearly identical. When the gels were stained for protein, greater than 90% of the PN1 or PN1(K7E) was found to be in the complexes, ruling out a significant role for any uncomplexed PN1 in later experiments. The slightly smaller masses of the complexes formed with the recombinant native PN1 and PN1(K7E) variant are due to the differential mass of the SERPIN moiety of the complex. This is characteristic of SERPINs produced in insect cells using baculovirus expression systems (11Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 684-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kridel S.J. Chan W.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

It is most likely due to carbohydrate compositional differences at consensus glycosylation sites and does not affect protein function in the case of PN1 (4Knauer M.F. Hawley S.B. Knauer D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12261-12264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or the closely related SERPIN, ATIII (11Howard E.W. Knauer D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3995-4001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the PN1(K7E) variant, which was capable of forming complexes with thrombin but unable to bind to heparin, we went on to analyze the role of cell surface bound heparins in the binding of PN1-Th complexes. To evaluate the role of the heparin binding site of PN1 in the catabolism of Th-PN1 complexes, 125I-thrombin was used to make complexes with both native PN1 and the PN1(K7E) variant. The complexes were purified by gel filtration in binding medium and adjusted to equal concentrations (data not shown). Both types of complexes were incubated with normal MEF and MEF-deficient in the LRP (PEA-13 cells), over a 6-h time course at 37 °C. At the indicated times, degradation was measured by the appearance of TCA-soluble radioactivity (Fig.5). Throughout the time course, there was a consistent 5-fold difference in the rate of degradation of125I-Th-PN1 complexes compared with the degradation of125I-Th-PN1(K7E) complexes by MEF cells. The much slower rate of degradation of 125I-Th-PN1(K7E) complexes strongly suggests an important role for the heparin binding site of PN1 in Th-PN1 complex catabolism. In addition, the degradation rate of both125I-Th-PN1 and 125I-Th-PN1(K7E) was greatly reduced in PEA-13 cells that are LRP deficient, demonstrating the important role of the LRP in complex catabolism. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that cell surface heparins and the LRP act synergistically to facilitate the uptake and degradation of Th-PN1 complexes. To rule out the possibility that both Th-PN1 and Th-PN1(K7E) complexes are taken up at the same rate, but are differentially compartmentalized, total cell-associated ligand was measured over a 6-h incubation p"

The PEA3/Ets-binding site (PEA3/EBS) is a common enhancer element in eukaryotic genes and is also found near the transcriptional start sites of many TATA-less promoters. We demonstrate that two PEA3/EBSs driving expression of the luciferase reporter gene, function as a minimal transcriptional initiator element. Maximal levels of transcription was achieved when two PEA3/EBSs, in either orientation, were located on the same face of the DNA helix, and the sites could be separated by up to three helical turns. In vitro transcription start sites directed by PEA3/EBS elements were clustered on either side of the upstream PEA3/EBS and were abolished by immunodepletion of GA-binding protein (GABP) from FM3A cell nuclear extracts. In vivo, co-transfection of GABPα and GABPβ expression vectors enhanced reporter gene expression driven from PEA3/EBS initiator elements. Like other initiator elements, the PEA3/EBS elements were activated synergistically by upstream Sp1-binding sites.

TFIID binds to the TATA motif during formation of the preinitiation complex, followed by binding of additional general transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, etc.) and RNPII. This preinitiation complex is capable of initiating transcription at a basal level in the absence of transcriptional activator proteins bound to distal sites from the TATA box. In the presence of such activators, high levels of transcription initiation are induced through mechanisms which include, stabilization or facilitation of binding of one or more of the general transcription factors to the promoter, modification of chromatin structure to increase access of the general transcription factors and RNPII to the promoter, and direct activation of one or more activities (including phosphorylation) required for the activation of RNPII (7Zawel L.

These “TATA-less” promoters typically initiate transcription from one or several closely spaced sites and also direct high levels of transcription in the presence of transcriptional activators such as Sp1 (1Colgan J.

The GA-binding protein (GABP), which was originally identified as a transcription activator important in the regulation of herpes simplex virus immediate early gene expression, has been shown to activate transcription from the PEA3/EBS-containing initiator elements from theCOXIV and COXVb genes, implying that GABP functions as both a transcriptional activator and initiator factor (25Carter R.S. Bhat N.K. Basu A. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Virbasius J.V. Virbasius C.A. Scarpulla R.C.

GABP, also known as nuclear respiratory factor 2, is composed of two distinct subunits, GABPα and GABPβ. GABPα is an Ets-related protein containing the 85-amino acid DNA-binding domain (Ets domain). GABPβ contains four ankyrin repeats at its NH2 terminus, which mediate dimerization with GABPα, and a COOH-terminal leucine zipper which mediates GABPβ homodimerization as well as GABPα2β2tetramer formation (12Thompson C.C.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structures of PEA3/EBS Inr elements vary with respect to the orientation and spacing of the PEA3/EBS motifs. For example, the initiator elements from the COXIV and COXVb genes contain two PEA3/EBS motifs spaced two and three helical turns apart, respectively, their orientations are different, and they direct transcriptional initiation at different positions relative to the PEA3/EBS motifs. In addition, each initiator element contains a different complement of associated transcription factor-binding sites, including Sp1 and YY1, located upstream and between the two PEA3/EBS sites. To better characterize the role of the PEA3/EBS motifs in initiator activity, we constructed synthetic initiator elements which contained PEA3/EBS motifs only, upstream of the firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter gene (49de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar), and measured their expression in mouse 3T3 cells. We demonstrate that two PEA3/EBS motifs function as a bidirectional initiator element, and that maximal activity is dependent on two PEA3/EBSs positioned on the same face of the DNA helix. PEA3/EBS motifs were cloned at the unique XhoI site in the multiple cloning sequence upstream of the promoter-less and enhancer-less firefly luciferase reporter gene in pGL2-Basic (Promega) (Fig.2 A). Synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 394 or 380B DNA synthesizer. Names of synthetic PEA3/EBS elements indicate the number of PEA3/EBSs, the orientation of the site relative to the orientation of the PEA3 motif in the polyomavirus late promoter (37Martin M.E.

Virol. 1991; 65: 5391-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the length of the spacer between PEA3/EBSs. Thus, the designation, PEA3–3N8, indicates three PEA3/EBS motifs in the normal (CTTCCT) orientation, separated by 8 bp. The sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study are as follows: PEA3–1N, TCGAGACTTCCTGC; PEA3–1R, TCGAGCAGGAAGTC; PEA3–2N0, TCGAGACTTCCTCTTCCTGC; PEA3–2R0, TCGAGCAGGAAGAGGAAGTC; PEA3–2N6, TCGACTTCCTGCTCGACTTCCTGC; PEA3–2R6, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCGAGCAGGAAG; PEA3–2N8, TCGAGACTTCCTGCTCGAGACTTCCTGC; PEA3–2R8, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTC; PEA3–2N10, TCGAGACTTCCTGCGAGCTCGACTTCCTGC; PEA3–2R10, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCGAGCTCGCAGGAAGTC; PEA3–2N16, TCGAGACTTCCTGCCTCGACGAGCTCGACTTCCTGC; PEA3–2R16, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCGAGCTCGTCGAGGCAGGAAGTC; PEA3–2N22, TCGAGACTTCCTGCTCGAGACTTGGTGCTCGAGACTTCCTGC; PEA3–2R22, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAC CAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTC; PEA3–2N26, TCGAGACTTCCTGCTCGAGACTTCGATGGTGCTCGAGACTTCCTGC; PEA3–2R26, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCACCATCGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTC; PEA3–3N8, TCGAGACTTCCTGCTCGAGACTTCCTGCTCGAGACTTCCTGC; PEA3–3R8, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTC. Constructs were generated by annealing the appropriate complementary oligonucleotides (e.g. PEA3–1N and PEA3–1R) and cloning the resulting double-stranded fragments in both orientations, into the indicated site of pGL2-Basic (Fig. 2 A). Constructs containing higher multiples of PEA3/EBSs were generated by cloning multiple copies of the above oligonucleotides, in tandem. The resulting sequences are as follows: PEA3–4R8, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTC; PEA3–5R8, TCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTCTCGAGCAGGAAGTC. The mutant PEA3/EBS (Mt2N7), Oct2, and Ad-Inr oligonucleotides were also cloned into the unique XhoI site in pBL2-Basic. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are as follows: Mt2N7, TCGAACTTCTTGCTCGAACTTCTTGC; Oct2, TCGAGAATGCAAATGCTCGAGAATGCAAATGC; AdInr, TCGAGCGTCCTCACTCTCTTCCGC. The AdTATA oligonucleotide (CGCGTGCTATAAAAGGA) was cloned into the unique MluI site in the poly-linker in the pGL2-Basic vector (Fig. 2 A). The synthetic SV40 21-base pair repeat oligonucleotides (SV21-N and -R) were the kind gift of Dr. William R. Folk (50Lednicky J. Folk W.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6379-6390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SV21-N and SV21-R oligonucleotides were annealed and end-filled by Klenow, and inserted into the unique SmaI site upstream of the PEA3/EBS elements to generate the SV21 series of constructs (e.g. SV21-PEA3–2N26). Spacing between the SV21 sequence and the PEA3–2N26 was altered by insertion of a synthetic 20-bp PstI linker (5′-CTAATCTGCAGATTAGGTAC-3′) into theKpnI site of SV21-PEA3–2N26. NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/90-mm diameter plates in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 44 h the cells were given fresh medium and transfected 4 h later (36Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar,37Martin M.E. Piette J. Yaniv M. Tang W.-J. Folk W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5839-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The test DNAs (20 μg) and internal control DNA (pSV-β-galactosidase expression vector, Promega) (10 μg) were co-precipitated with calcium phosphate and added to the plates (12.5-ml medium final volume). After 4 h, the cultures were treated with 15% glycerol for 1 min followed by addition of fresh medium. Cultures were harvested 42 h post-transfection by scraping and the cells pelleted by centrifugation (800 × g for 5 min). Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing at −70 °C and 37 °C, respectively. Cell debris was pelleted and the supernatants were collected and immediately analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All constructs were tested in at least three independent transfections, the mean and standard deviations determined for each construct, and the data expressed as the fold activation relative to luciferase activity expressed from the promoter-less and enhancer-less pGL2-Basic vector. All luciferase measurements were normalized for transfection efficiency to β-galactosidase expressed from the plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase. To determine the effect of expression of exogenous GABPα and GABPβ on the activity of PEA3/EBS elements in 3T3 cells, GABPα and GABPβ cDNAs (kindly provided by Catherine C. Thompson, Carnegie Institute of Washington) were cloned into the XbaI andEcoRI sites, respectively, of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNAI(Amp). For exogenous GABPα and GABPβ expression, 0.5 μg of the pcDNAI(Amp)-GABPα and -GABPβ constructs was co-transfected with the indicated PEA3/EBS initiator constructs and luciferase expression analyzed as described above. To determine luciferase activity in cell extracts, 10 μl of the cell lysate were added to 90 μl of assay buffer (0.25 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8) in a 12 × 75-mm cuvette (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The cuvette was placed in a Turner model TD-20e luminometer and the reaction was initiated by the injection of 100 μl of 1.0 mm luciferin. Luminescence was measured and the raw data converted to relative luciferase activity. β-Galactosidase assays were performed by adding 30 μl of the cell extract to 270 μl of assay buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.665 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 500 μl of 1.0 mNa2CO3 and the absorbance was measured at 420 nm. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Dignam et al. (51Dignam J.D.

Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard.

The sequence of the PEA3m probe is 5′-TCGAGCACCTTGAGGAAGTCTCGA-3′ and the sequence of the dPEA3-0 probe is 5′-TCGAGCAGGAAGAGGAAGTCTCGA-3′. EMSA probes were prepared as described previously (51Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), and 0.25 ng of each probe (approximately 50,000 cpm) was used in each EMSA reaction. Recombinant GABP (rGABP) proteins were prepared as described previously (52Martin M.E. Chinenov Y. Yu M. Schmidt T.K. Yang X.-Y. J. Biol.

Transcription reactions (50 μl) contained 27.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mmpotassium glutamate, 3.75 mm MgCl2, 0.03 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 3% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mmeach of four ribonucleoside triphosphates, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μg of DNA template, and 10 μl of FM3A cell nuclear extract (50–70 μg of total protein). The transcription reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of stop buffer containing 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 0.25 mg/ml carrier yeast RNA. 5 μl of 2.5 mg/ml proteinase K was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature. 300 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5, was added and the solution was extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v) and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v). The resulting aqueous phase was combined with 0.1 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled primer (0.1 pmol/μl) and the nucleic acids were precipitated with 1 ml of ethanol. Following centrifugation, the resulting pellet was washed with 75% ethanol (v/v), dried, and dissolved in 10 μl of 2 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.25m KCl. This solution was heated at 75 °C for 2 min, incubated at 58 °C for 30 min, and allowed to cool down to room temperature. 40 μl of extension buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.25 mm MnCl2, 125 μg/ml actinomycin D, 12.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing, 0.33 mmeach of four deoxyribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates and 0.5 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), were added followed by incubation at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 300 μl of ethanol, the nucleic acids were ethanol precipitated, washed with 75% (v/v) ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 3 μl of formamide loading buffer. The nucleic acids were denatured by addition of 1.5 μl of 0.1m NaOH, the solution was boiled for 3 min and loaded onto a 6% denaturing (8 m urea) polyacrylamide gel. Close inspection of initiator sequences containing PEA3/EBSs reveals no obvious pattern of position, orientation, or spacing between the sites (Fig. 1). To characterize the effects of orientation and spacing between PEA3/EBSs on initiator activity, synthetic initiators containing one or more PEA3/EBSs were cloned upstream of the promoter-less and enhancer-less firefly luciferase gene in pGL2-BASIC (Fig.2 A). Constructs with two PEA3/EBS motifs (arbitrarily separated by 8 bp), in either orientation, expressed significantly higher levels of luciferase activity than those with a single PEA3 motif. Constructs with three or more PEA3/EBS motifs were even more active, expressing luciferase activity more than 150-fold over background levels (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, constructs with two mutant PEA3/EBS motifs (Mt2N7), two octamer sites (Oct2), and the adenovirus major late promoter TATA (AdTATA) or Inr (AdInr) elements, failed to activate transcription significantly above background levels. To determine whether the helical spacing between PEA3/EBSs affects initiator activity, constructs with two PEA3/EBSs spaced from 0.5 to 3.0 helical turns (Fig. 3 A), in both orientations, were tested for initiator activity (Fig.3 B). Maximal luciferase activities were observed in constructs with PEA3/EBSs spaced at 1.1, 2.0, and 3.0 helical turns and were independent of orientation, whereas constructs with two PEA3/EBSs spaced at 0.6, 1.5, and 2.6 helical turns were consistently less active (Fig. 3 B). We may conclude from these results that two PEA3/EBS motifs, in either orientation, are sufficient to function as a transcriptional initiator element, and that maximal transcriptional activity requires two PEA3/EBSs positioned on the same face of the DNA helix. Unlike the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase family of Inrs, naturally occurring PEA3/EBS containing initiator elements display no obvious pattern of transcription start site selection. The levels of luciferase transcripts expressed from the basal PEA3/EBS constructs in transfected 3T3 cells was insufficient for mapping of the transcription start sites. 2M. Yu and M. E.

The African trypanosomes are a group of unicellular eukaryotes responsible for sleeping sickness in man and related diseases in animals. The life cycle of these parasites, which alternates between the mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector, is characterized by the stage-specific expression of two major surface glycoproteins, namely the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; ISG, invariant surface glycoprotein; PMSF, phenylmethylesulfonyl flouride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay; Tes, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; ISG, invariant surface glycoprotein; PMSF, phenylmethylesulfonyl flouride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay; Tes, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). and procyclin during the bloodstream and insect mid-gut stages, respectively. These two proteins cover the entire surface of the trypanosome and are by far the most abundant of the surface proteins during these stages of the life cycle. Although there is a considerable body of data in the literature concerning the structure, function, and differential expression of VSG and procyclin (1Borst P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 701-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 2Pays E. Steinert M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1988; 22: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Roditi I. Pearson T.W.

Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 53-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) has attention focused on other surface proteins located either beneath the surface coats of VSG/procyclin or within the the flagellar pocket, a specialized invagination of the plasma membrane, which is involved in the pathways for endo- and exocytosis in these cells. There are several reasons why interest in these proteins is increasing. First, some of these proteins must be involved in a range of cellular housekeeping processes, such as the uptake of high molecular weight ligands and the transport of solutes and ions. Second, given their functional role, such proteins are unlikely to undergo antigenic variation in the same manner and extent as the VSG and, consequently, may represent suitable targets for the development of vaccines or chemotherapy. Third, even if the development of effective vaccines against these invariant surface antigens proves to be either impossible or impractical, the fact remains that the plasma membrane of these cells represents an important biological interface between host and parasite and as such is likely to occupy a pivotal position in multiple signaling pathways, such as those involved in interactions between the mammalian host and arthropod vector, switching between different life cycle stages and probably intercellular communication with other trypanosomes. Arguably, these topics are among the most exigent areas of research in molecular parasitology at present, and an important step toward improving our understanding of these processes must be the identification and characterization of the plasma membrane proteins that mediate them. In this respect it is significant that, to date apart from the VSG and procyclin, only three other surface proteins have been fully characterized at a molecular and functional level in Trypanosoma brucei: the heterodimeric transferrin receptor (5Salmon D.

J. 1977; 180: 11-24Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Schell D. Stierhof Y.D. Overath P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), there is no data available concerning the molecular nature of the proteins responsible. Conversely, the genes for several putative plasma membrane proteins, termed ESAGs for expression site-associated genes, have been identified in T. brucei, which appear to code for amphiphatic polypeptides that contain typical membrane signal sequences and consensus sites forN-glycosylation, but the function and cellular location of the proteins encoded by these genes has yet to be established (16Alexandre S. Guyaux S. Murphy N.B. Coquelet H. Pays A. Steinert M. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2367-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, more direct approaches involving surface labeling of whole cells using biotinylation or iodination have identified a number of bloodstream stage-specific, invariant surface glycoproteins or ISGs that were uniformly distributed over the entire surface of the trypanosome (17Jackson D.G. Voorheis H.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1032-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Ziegelbauer K. Overath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10791-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genes for two of these ISGs have been cloned and code for proteins with N-terminal leader sequences, hydrophilic extracellular domains, single transmembrane spanning regions as well as sites for N-glycosylation, and were present as multiple copies (20Ziegelbauer K. Multhaup G. Overath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10797-10803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ziegelbauer K. Rudenko G. Kieft R. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, no homology with other proteins was observed, and the function of these ISGs also remains unknown. Here we describe the isolation, purification, and molecular characterization of a novel surface protein in T. brucei. Uniquely, this bloodstream, stage-specific protein contains a large internal domain consisting entirely of 72 copies of a previously undescribed amino acid motif. Unlike the genes for other plasma membrane proteins described so far, the gene for this protein is present as a single copy. All radiochemicals and nitrocellulose filters were obtained from Amersham International plc, Amersham Buckshire, United Kingdom. Protein A-Sepharose CL 4B and concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Sigma. N-Glycopepidase F was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Promega and Amersham, respectively. Other reagents were of the highest purity available. Cloned variants ofT. brucei (MITats 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, ILTat 1.21, and AnTat 1.1) were grown in laboratory rats and purified as described previously (14Voorheis H.P. Gale J.S. Owen M.J. Edwards W. Biochem. J. 1977; 180: 11-24Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Procyclic forms of T. brucei were produced by transformation of MITat 1.1 in SDM-79 and maintained in the same medium as described in a previous report (22Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). All surface labeling experiments of whole cells were performed using lactoperoxidase/glucose oxidase or IODO-GEN and carrier-free Na125I (500 μCi/108 cells) as described previously (19Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 0–5 °C unless otherwise stated. A sample of surface radioiodinated cells (5 × 108 cells) was mixed with a suspension of freshly harvested trypanosomes (∼5 × 1010 cells) to provide a marker for ISG purification. The mixed suspension was washed twice in Tes buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5), NaCl (150 mm), and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer (10 ml) containing leupeptin (30 μg/ml), PMSF (0.2 mm), E-64 (20 μm), TLCK (50 μm), and EDTA (1 mm). The cells were lysed by the addition of 100 ml of distilled deionized water (containing protease inhibitors) with gentle mixing. After an incubation of 10 min at 37 °C, 5 ml of NaCl (3 m) was added, and the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was washed twice in Tes buffer containing protease inhibitors and was resuspended in the same buffer containing MgCl2 (5 mm) and DNase I (100 units/1 × 1010 cells) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After DNase treatment this total membrane fraction was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min) and the pellet was washed twice and resuspended in 100 ml of Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing NaCl (150 mm), leupeptin (30 μg/ml), PMSF (0.2 mm), E-64 (20 μm), TLCK (50 μm), and EDTA (1 mm). Detergent extraction of the membranes was performed by the addition of an equal volume of the same buffer containing Triton X-100 (2%, w/v) followed by an incubation on ice for 1 h prior to centrifugation (50,000 ×g, 2 h). The supernatant was applied (0.5 ml/min) to a column (2-ml bed volume) of concanavalin A-Sepharose previously equilibrated with Tris/NaCl buffer containing Triton X-100 (1%, w/v). The column was washed with Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 6.5) containing Triton X-100 (0.1%, w/v), and bound glycoproteins were eluted with 0.5 m α-methylmannoside in the same buffer. This eluate was applied (0.2 ml/min) to a DEAE-52 column (5-ml bed volume) equilibrated with Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 6.5) containing Triton X-100 (0.1%, w/v). The column was washed with the equilibration buffer (six column volumes), and a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.5 m), in the same buffer, was applied to the column (10 column volumes). Fractions (1 ml) were collected throughout, and their content of radioactivity was measured. Those fractions corresponding to the peaks of radioactivity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (19Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands corresponding to ISG100, which were eluted from the column by the salt gradient, were excised, reequilibrated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE. The resulting ISG100 bands, which were detected by autoradiography, were excised, rehydrated with water, and subsequently used to immunize rabbits. Polyclonal anti-ISG100antibodies were raised in rabbits and the IgG fraction was prepared exactly as described previously (19Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blots were performed as described previously (19Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent lysates were prepared by the method of Anderson and Blobel (23Anderson D.J. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed by mixing samples (100 μl) of detergent lysates, corresponding to 107 cells, with the antisera (determined by titration but routinely 20 μl) followed by an incubation of 30 min at 4 °C. The antibody-treated lysates were then mixed with a slurry (1:1, v/v) of protein A-Sepharose CL 4B in phosphate buffer in a ratio of five volumes of slurry for each volume of antibody added. The mixture was agitated at 4 °C for at least 2 h before centrifuging, and washing the resin and elution of the immune complexes was as described elsewhere (19Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypanosomes (4 × 107 cells/ml) were fixed in paraformaldehyde (2%, w/v) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 20 min. The fixed cells were washed in PBS containing BSA (5%, w/v) and glycine (1 mg/ml). The cells were resuspended in PBS/BSA (2 × 107 cells/ml), and 20 μl were spread gently and uniformly onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and air dried. After blocking nonspecific protein binding sites with PBS/BSA the cells were treated overnight with the antibodies diluted 1/150 in PBS/BSA containing Tween 20 (0.1%, w/v). The slides were washed with PBS/BSA prior to treatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit globulin (1/500 in PBS/BSA) for 1 h at room temperature and washed again before mounting in 50% glycerol (w/v) in PBS containing 1,4-diaza-bicyclo(2,2,2)octane (25 mg/ml). The cells were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan immunofluoresence microscope with an oil immersion ×100 Plan-Neofluar objective. High resolution immunofluorescence experiments were performed using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with a digital in situ imaging system. Pleomorphic bloodstream forms of T. brucei were fixed for 15 min at room temperature in paraformaldehyde (4%, w/v) and glutaraldehyde (0.1%, w/v) diluted in cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.2). After dehydration in methanol with progressive lowering of the temperature, they were embedded in Lowicryl, which was polymerized under UV light at −20 °C. Ultrathin sections recovered on carbon-formvar nickel grids were floated on PBS containing BSA (1%) and goat serum (10%) for 1 h and then overnight, at 4 °C, on PBS/BSA containing anti-ISG100 antisera (1/100). After three washes in PBS/BSA containing Tween 20 (0.05%, w/v), the grids were floated for 1 h on PBS/BSA containing EM goat F(ab)2 anti-rabbit IgG (Biocell) or protein A (Sigma), both conjugated to 10-nm gold particles (both diluted 1/100). The grids were washed three times in PBS/BSA containing Tween 20, rinsed in distilled water, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before being viewed in an AEI 6B electron microscope at 60 kV. A cDNA library was constructed in λgt11 using poly(A) mRNA isolated from bloodstream forms of T. brucei (AnTat 1.1) as described by Gubler and Hoffman (24Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar) using the Amersham cDNA synthesis and cloning kits. A SalI T. brucei(AnTat 1.3) genomic library was constructed in EMBL 12 according to standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The λgt11 library was screened according to the supplier's instructions with a few modifications. Non-fat milk powder (5%, w/v) in Tris-buffered saline, containing Nonidet P-40 (0.05%, w/v) and a bacterial lysate, was used to block nonspecific binding to the nitrocellulose filters and to dilute the antibodies (1/1000 of the IgG fraction). The bacterial lysate was prepared by diluting 1 ml of an overnight culture of the host strain (Y1090) in 50 ml of LB and incubating at 37 °C with shaking for 2–3 h. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in distilled deionized water (3 ml), lysed by sonication, and denatured by incubating the lysate at 100 °C for 4 min. The lysate was diluted 1/100 prior to use. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used, at a dilution of 1/7500, in accordance with the supplier's instructions (Promega). Positive plaques were purified by repeated screening, and the insert cDNAs were subcloned into pUC vectors. Inserts of positive clones were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase version 2.0 kit. Sequence analysis was performed using the GCG/Wisconsin software (26Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). A partial cDNA obtained from the λgt11 library was used to screen an EMBL 12 genomic library, using 32P-labeled probes according to standard methods (27Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar) and resulted in the isolation of aSalI genomic fragment (10 kb) containing the ISG100 gene. Subsequently, an NlaIII fragment (5.2 kb) that contained the complete coding region of the ISG100 gene was isolated from this SalI genomic fragment and subcloned into the SphI site of pUC18. Sequencing of the entire NlaIII fragment on both strands represented a major effort and was accomplished by a combination of primer walking where possible and the generation of a series of nested exonuclease III deletions using the Erase-a-Base® system obtained from Promega. This process involved the isolation of clones containing theNlaIII fragment in both orientations in the SphI site of the pUC18 vector. Plasmid DNA prepared from these clones was digested with SacI and XbaI to generate Exo III-resistant 3′ and -susceptible 5′ overhangs, respectively. A nested set of deletions in the target DNA was then prepared by digestion for various times with Exo III according to the supplier's instructions. Since the reiterative region of the gene (∼3.7 kb) lacked unique restriction sites, several hundred clones were screened, and in each case the plasmid DNA was linearized by appropriate restriction enzyme digestion and subjected to careful size fractionation on agarose gels to obtain a set of deletion clones that differed by about 200 bp and spanned the entire repeat region. All of these clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using the 3′-flanking vector sequence as a primer (reverse primer). It should be stressed that, throughout, great care and attention was paid to the sequencing and alignment of these clones. The latter process was aided to some extent by small variations in sequence of the 51-bp repeat. The procedures employed for the isolation of DNA and RNA as well as Southern and Northern blot hybridizations are described elsewhere (28Pays E. Delronche M. Lheureux M. Vervoot T. Bloch J. Gannon F. Steinert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 5965-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the consensus sequence of the amino acids predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the 51-bp repeat region of the gene for ISG100 was synthesized. The amino acid sequence was N- to C-terminal, GIAASSLLSSFASSSAV. A stock solution of peptide (5 mg/ml) was prepared in trifluoroacetic acid and immediately diluted in coating buffer (NaHCO3, 35 mm; Na2CO3, 15 mm; pH 9.6) to give a range of peptide concentrations (0.05 to 20 μg/ml). Samples (100 μl) of these peptide solutions were used to coat the wells of a microtiter plate (Nunc) that had been previously precoated with poly-l-lysine to enhance adsorption of the peptides as described previously (29Hobbs R.N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 117: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The wells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with blocking buffer, Tris-buffered saline containing BSA 2% (TBS/BSA), for 30 min at 37 °C. The wells were washed with with TBS, and 100 μl of anti-ISG100 polyclonal antibodies, appropriately diluted in TBS/BSA, were added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with TBS/BSA, alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG (100 μl, diluted 1/7500 in TBS/BSA) was added to each well, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then each well wash washed several times with TBS. Finally, 100 μl of alkaline phosphatase assay buffer containing 4-nitophenylphosphate (2 mg/ml) were added to each well. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and the absorption at 405 nm of each well was measured using an automatic plate reader. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Isolated trypanosomes (5 × 1010 cells) were washed twice in isotonic sucrose (sucrose, 250 mm; EDTA, 1.5 mm; KCl, 1 mm; Hepes, 5 mm, pH 7.5). The paste of cells was transferred to a chilled mortar, and the cells were disrupted by grinding with glass Ballotini beads (Sigma acid washed, 75–200 μm). Grinding was continued until about 75% disruption was achieved as judged by phase contrast microscopy. The homogenate was resuspended (∼10 ml) in isotonic sucrose containing leupeptin (40 μg/ml), PMSF (0.2 mm), E-64 (10 μm), TLCK (50 μm). The glass beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 800 rpm (77 × g) for 1 min and washed twice with the same buffer. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 4 min, the supernatant was removed, and the loose pellet was washed once. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 65,000 × gfor 60 min. The high speed pellet was resuspended in no more than 3 ml of isotonic sucrose buffer and carefully layered onto the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient, which consisted of various sucrose solutions, prepared in Hepes (5 mm, pH 7.5), (KCl, 1 mm), EDTA (1.5 mm), calculated to give the following final densities: 1.094 g/ml (8 ml), 1.113 g/ml (10 ml), 1.187 g/ml (8 ml), and 1.252 g/ml (6 ml). These densities were based on the median equilibrium densities of the flagellar pocket membrane (1.11 g/ml), microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum membrane (1.175 g/ml), and the plasma membrane (1.22 g/ml) (31McLaughlin J. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2656-2663PubMed Google Scholar). The gradient was centrifuged at 58,000 × g for 90 min using an AH629 rotor. After centrifugation, the material banding at each of the density interfaces, which corresponded to the flagellar pocket membrane, microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and pellicular plasma membrane fractions, respectively, as the interface density increased, was removed, diluted to 35 ml with isotonic sucrose buffer, and centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets were resuspended in 0.5–1.0 ml of isotonic sucrose buffer. The material corresponding to the flagellar pocket fraction, i.e. the material which banded at the 1.094–1.113 g/ml density interface, was layered onto a continuous sucrose gradient (20 to 45%, 30 ml) over a 54% sucrose cushion (3 ml), both prepared in the Hepes buffer. This gradient was centrifuged at 58,000 × g for 3 h using the AH629 rotor. After centrifugation the gradient was fractionated and screened for the presence of the heterodimeric transferrin receptor, a marker for the flagellar pocket (5Salmon D. Geuskens M. Hanocq F. Hanocq-Quertier J. Nolan D. Rubin L. Pays E. Cell. 1994; 78: 75-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), by Western blots and ELISAs using anti-ESAG7 antibodies. In general the flagellar pocket membranes were visible as a distinct white band about 60% down the gradient. These membranes were washed with isotonic sucrose buffer, resuspended in the same buffer (∼1 mg/ml), and stored at −80 °C. The flagellar pocket, microsomal/endoplasmic reticulum, and pellicular plasma membrane fractions prepared using this protocol, respectively, represented 0.58 ± 0.25%, 0.48 ± 0.22%, and 4.1 ± 0.9% of the total cellular protein present in the initial homogenate after removal of the glass beads (mean ± S.E. of four preparations). In a previous report we identified two invariant surface proteins in bloodstream forms of T. brucei using surface radioiodination, but noted that other less abundant surface proteins were also labeled (19Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final steps in the purification of one of these proteins termed ISG100, for invariant surface glycoprotein with M r ∼ 100,000, are presented in Fig. 1. 125I-Labeled surface glycoproteins that were specifically eluted from a concanavalin A-Sepharose column were fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-52. Approximately 60% of the applied radiolabeled proteins did not adhere to the resin, while the remainder of the labeled proteins were eluted by the application of a linear salt gradient (Fig.1 A). The majority of retained proteins eluted at relatively low concentrations of salt (<150 mm), and SDS-PAGE analysis of these fractions demonstrated that the 125I label was primarily associated with three distinct bands (Fig.1 B). Two of these proteins migrated with an apparentM r comparable to that reported previously for ISG70 and ISG64 (19Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Voorheis H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8085-8095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a"
https://openalex.org/W2319013797,"Mitotic cells typically lack well-formed focal adhesions. As an approach to explore the dynamic process regulating the focal adhesion assembly, we examined states of focal adhesion proteins during mitosis of the cell cycle. We found that the amount of paxillin was significantly reduced during mitosis of the cell cycle, whereas other focal adhesion proteins including talin, vinculin and Focal Adhesion Kinase did not. Proteolytic degradation appeared to be involved in the mitotic reduction, but transcriptional and/or translational controls of the mRNA were not essential for this downregulation. Moreover, concurrent with the decreased protein level, phosphorylation status of paxillin altered during mitosis; mitotic paxillin was phosphorylated primarily on serine and dephosphorylated on tyrosine while interphase one was phosphorylated both on serine and tyrosine. We found that mitotic phosphorylation created an electrophoretically slow-migrating population of paxillin which was barely detected in interphase cells. This mitotic specific modification occurred with both alpha and beta isoforms of paxillin. We also examined the fate of paxillin protein by changing its protein amount. We found that majority of paxillin overexpressed was subjected to the specific modification but not to the downregulation in the mitotic arrested cells. On the other hand, paxillin exogenously expressed at a moderate level was subjected to both the mitotic modification and downregulation. Collectively, we concluded that paxillin's specific serine phosphorylation together with the proteolytic downregulation of a limited fraction of paxillin is taken place during the mitosis of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2062215694,"Western blots, enzyme assays, protein glycosylation studies, and immunohistochemical staining were used to characterize cathepsin B expression at successive stages of colorectal tumor progression. In normal colon mucosa and premalignant adenomas, cathepsin B expression was predominantly due to mature two-chain protein detected on Western blots as the nonglycosylated 27-kDa form, with overexpression of this protein occurring in only 4 of 18 adenomas. Overexpression increased significantly in Dukes A and B carcinomas (26 of 37 cases), with cathepsin B protein generally detectable in carcinomas as a combination of both 27-kDa nonglycosylated and 28-kDa glycosylated mature two-chain forms. Glycosylated cathepsin B protein in carcinoma extracts was sensitive to PNGase F but resistant to Endo H, indicating a pattern consistent with complex rather than high mannose type glycosylation. When sorted by advancing tumor stage, peak expression of cathepsin B protein occurred in carcinomas involved in local invasion compared with adenomas or metastatic cancers. At all stages, cathepsin B activity correlated significantly with the levels of heavy chain mature cathepsin B protein (r = 0.6682,p < 0.0001) irrespective of glycosylation. Immunohistochemical staining of cathepsin B protein revealed fine diffuse cytoplasmic staining in both adenomas and carcinomas compared with coarse granular cytoplasmic staining (typical of lysosomes) seen in matched normal mucosa. Our results demonstrate several sequential, apparently independent changes in cathepsin B expression during colorectal tumor progression including early changes in subcellular localization, up-regulation of cathepsin B protein and activity in invasive cancers, and altered protein glycosylation detected in malignant tumors at all stages.

Furthermore, tumor cathepsin B has also been shown to retain greater proteolytic activity at or above neutral pH (1Sheahan K. Shuja S. Murnane M.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3809-3814PubMed Google Scholar, 12Buck M.R. Karustis D.G. Day N.A. Honn K.V. Sloane B.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) than the normal enzyme. Previous studies of cathepsin B expression using a primary tumor model of colorectal cancer progression found cathepsin B enzyme activity to be frequently and significantly elevated in the early invasive stages of tumor growth (1Sheahan K. Shuja S. Murnane M.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3809-3814PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shuja S. Sheahan K. Murnane M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Murnane M.J. Shuja S. Del Re E. Cai J. Iacobuzio-Donahue C. Klepeis V. In Vivo. 1997; 11: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). This finding was confirmed by Northern analyses of cathepsin B mRNA in colorectal tumors that also demonstrated greater increases in earlier than later stage carcinomas (3Murnane M.J. Sheahan K. Ozdemirli M. Shuja S. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1137-1142PubMed Google Scholar). Early elevation in cathepsin B expression, followed by an inverse correlation with cancer progression, suggested that cathepsin B activity might be particularly important in cancers associated with invasion of the colonic wall. These findings have been supported by the work of Leto et al. (13Leto G. Tumminello F.M. Russo A. Pizzolanti G. Bazan V. Gebbia N. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 509-515PubMed Google Scholar), who also observed significantly elevated cathepsin B enzyme activity in Dukes A stage colorectal carcinomas but not in Dukes D stage carcinomas. However, Campo et al. (14Campo E. Munoz J. Miquel R. Palacin A. Cardesa A. Sloane B.F. Emmert-Buck M.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 301-309PubMed Google Scholar) made a different observation using immunohistochemical techniques, reporting a higher percentage of cells staining positively for cathepsin B protein in later compared with earlier stages of colorectal cancer. As the method of detecting cathepsin B expression by activity assay is quite different from protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry, it was possible that these different observations might have resulted from different assay techniques. For example, alterations in the expression of endogenous inhibitors of cathepsin B might affect enzyme activity detected in colorectal tumors such that a decrease in inhibitors would result in increased activity or vice versa. However, a change in inhibitor levels should not affect the amount of cathepsin B protein detected by immunohistochemical techniques. Decreases in plasma membrane-associated cysteine proteinase inhibitors have been detected in murine melanomas, resulting in increased effective activity of cathepsin B at the plasma membrane (15Rozhin J. Gomez A.P. Ziegler G.H. Nelson K.K. Chang Y.S. Fong D. India J.M. Honn K.V. Sloane B.F. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6278-6284PubMed Google Scholar). However, no decrease in total endogenous cysteine proteinase inhibitor levels had been found in human colorectal carcinomas compared with normal mucosa, although the relative amounts of individual inhibitors have not been analyzed (1Sheahan K. Shuja S. Murnane M.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3809-3814PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, increased expression of high molecular weight, inactive forms of cathepsin B protein in late stage tumors might explain an increase detected by immunohistochemistry, whereas an activity assay would not include enzymatically inactive forms. Since previous studies of cathepsin B expression in colorectal tumors have not fully addressed the above questions, we have utilized Western blot analyses of 80 matched pairs of normal colorectal mucosa and adenoma (premalignant polyps) or carcinoma extracts to determine the relationship between expression of cathepsin B protein and enzyme activity in identical extracts. Expression levels of the different forms of cathepsin B protein detected on Western blots were quantitated by laser densitometry to determine whether any particular protein form(s) increased or decreased as cathepsin B activity levels changed. These assays made it possible to determine the extent to which latent 47-kDa cathepsin B, active 31-kDa single chain cathepsin B, or active 27-kDa/4-kDa two-chain cathepsin B contributed to the elevation of cathepsin B enzyme activity in human colorectal adenomas, in early stage carcinomas and in later stage carcinomas including those cases associated with metastatic spread. To determine whether altered glycosylation also occurred in conjunction with quantitative changes in protein and activity levels, a combination of Western blotting and deglycosylation assays was used to characterize cathepsin B glycosylation patterns in normal colorectal mucosa, adenomas, and carcinomas.

E-64 and purified cathepsins B, D, H, and L from normal human liver were from Calbiochem. Anti-human cathepsin B and D antibodies were purchased from BioGenex (San Ramon, CA) or Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). For these studies, 18 adenomas and 62 carcinomas together with matched normal mucosa were collected from 67 patients. All fresh tissue samples were collected from colectomy specimens at the Mallory Institute of Pathology or were obtained through the National Disease Research Institute (NDRI) and the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN). In two cases, two primary carcinomas from the same individual and, in two other cases, two adenomas from the same individual were obtained together with matched normal mucosa. In 13 cases, both an adenoma and a carcinoma were collected together with matched normal mucosa. Colorectal mucosa was used as control tissue, since it contains the epithelium from which carcinomas arise. Samples of normal mucosa were obtained at least 10 cm from the tumors. The mucosa was separated from the muscle layer, serosa and surrounding fat. Tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C. Information on size, dysplasia, and histopathology of individual adenomas and staging of individual carcinomas was obtained from pathology reports. Individual adenomas were classified as described by Vogelstein et al. (16Vogelstein B. Fearon E.R. Hamilton S.R. Kern S.E. Preisinger A.C. Leppert M. Nakumura Y. White R. Smits A.M.M. Bos J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (5929) Google Scholar). Early stage adenomas were defined as adenomas that were 1.0 cm in size or less. Intermediate stage adenomas were greater than 1.0 cm in size and did not contain high grade dysplasia. Late stage adenomas were greater than 1.0 cm in size and contained areas with high grade dysplasia. The staging of carcinomas was done in accordance with the Dukes classification system (17Dukes C.E. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1932; 35: 323-332Crossref Google Scholar) as modified by Turnbull (18Turnbull Jr., R.B. Kyle K. Watson F.R. Spratt J. Ann. Surg. 1967; 166: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Dukes A cancers are confined to the bowel wall, Dukes B cancers have spread through the wall without involving lymph nodes, Dukes C cancers are associated with regional lymph node metastasis, and Dukes D cancers show distant metastasis and/or local invasion of adjacent organs. To minimize test variation, each pair of normal mucosa and matched adenoma or carcinoma were extracted and assayed at the same time. Tissue samples (60–80 mg) were homogenized in 500 μl of distilled, deionized water, frozen and thawed three times, and centrifuged for 50 min at 4 °C at 17,210 ×g in a Sorvall 5B centrifuge. For extractions in E-64, tissue samples were homogenized in 500 μl of distilled, deionized water containing 10 μm E-64. Supernatants were removed and utilized for the following assays. To determine cathepsin B enzyme activity, the cathepsin B-specific substrate, Z-Ala-Arg-Arg-MNA was used. Cathepsin B enzyme activity was determined by a modification of the methods of MacGregor et al. (19MacGregor R.R. Hamilton J.W. Shofstall R.E. Cohn D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4423-4427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Barrett et al. (20Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Cathepsin B. Cathepsin H. Cathepsin L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were incubated in 0.1 mMES-EDTA buffer, pH 6.2, containing 1 mm Z-Ala-Arg-Arg-MNA as substrate and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C. The assay was started by the addition of 20 μl of tissue extract (60–180 μg of protein) to the substrate/buffer mixture. At 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1 n HCl in 2% Triton X-100. Fast Blue B (O-dianisidine tetrazotized) was added, and the color was developed for 10 min before reading at A520 in a Gilford spectrophotometer. For each tissue sample, two extractions were done, and each extract was assayed in duplicate. Specific activities of cathepsin B were expressed as nmol of substrate hydrolyzed min−1 mg−1 protein. Protein content of the tissue extracts was determined by the method of Lowry (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Samples of carcinoma used for glycosylation analysis were chosen based solely on the volume of extract available for study; otherwise, the selection was completely random. The one case of normal mucosa analyzed was specifically chosen, however, since it was the only case of normal mucosa analyzed that expressed a large amount of the 28-kDa protein form. For removal of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides by PNGase F (22Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer T.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar), 50 μg each (4–8 μl) of control and treated sample were boiled in the presence of 0.1% SDS, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 2 min. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 0.25 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.6, containing 1.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 250 milliunits of PNGase F. For removal of mannose oligosaccharides by Endo H (23Chu F.K. Maley F. Tarentino A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), concentrated samples were boiled for 2 min with a 1.2% (w/w) excess of SDS and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol before incubating 3 h at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 milliunits of Endo H. All reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8). Control samples were treated identically except for substitution of an equal volume of double distilled H2O in place of PNGase F or Endo H enzyme prior to incubation. Human α-1 acid glycoprotein and ovalbumin were used as positive controls for deglycosylation by PNGase F and Endo H, respectively (22Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer T.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 23Chu F.K. Maley F. Tarentino A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 200 μg of matched normal and tumor extracts, as well as 20 μl of premixed Rainbow marker (Amersham Corp.) were prepared in 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and boiled at 100 °C for 2 min before electrophoresing on 16% polyacrylamide gels for 18 h at 70 V. Samples treated by PNGase F or Endo H were prepared in the same manner, followed by electrophoresing on 16% minipolyacrylamide gels 6 h at 80 V (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the top portions of the separating gels containing proteins to be immunoblotted were transferred overnight (for large gels) or 12 h (for minigels) to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) in a Bio-Rad Tank Transblot apparatus at 100 mA using transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, 1% SDS. The remaining bottom portions of the gels, corresponding to protein sizes of approximately 15 kDa and smaller, were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal loading of matched pairs. For protein identification, the membrane was first blocked in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris, 125 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk (Carnation) before incubating overnight with primary antibody in the dilution suitable for the antibody (a 1:125 dilution of BioGenex polyclonal sheep anti-human cathepsin B antibody, a 1:100 dilution of Oncogene Science monoclonal mouse anti-human cathepsin B antibody, or a 1:1000 dilution of Oncogene Science polyclonal rabbit anti-human cathepsin D antibody). Blots were then washed 2 times in 5% milk TBST before incubation for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma, Oncogene Science) diluted in 5% milk TBST. Blots were next washed overnight in 5% milk TBST followed by four 10-min washes in TBST without milk. Proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescent system (NEN Life Science Products). Scanning laser densitometry of autoradiographs was done using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI. To quantitate the relative abundance of cathepsin B heavy chain protein in samples blotted, the 27- and 28-kDa protein bands as detected on autoradiographs were scanned by laser densitometry, and resulting adenoma/normal (A/N) or carcinoma/normal (C/N) ratios calculated for each of the 80 matched pairs were analyzed by Western blot. The calculated A/N or C/N ratio was then adjusted based on the Coomassie Blue-stained loading control for each matched pair to obtain a final adjusted A/N or C/N ratio. Archival paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas were obtained from the Mallory Institute of Pathology. Tissue sections (5 μm) were sliced using a microtome, mounted on polylysine-coated clean glass slides, dewaxed in xylene, and hydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol, after which slides were blocked 5 min with a 1:25 dilution of casein. Next, slides were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of Oncogene Science monoclonal mouse anti-human cathepsin B antibody diluted in 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C with biotinylated secondary antibody (BioGenex) and then a 5-min incubation at 37 °C with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin label (BioGenex). Slides were washed three times with 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.4, after each incubation. Color was developed using 0.006 g of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) dissolved in 10 ml of 0.05 mTris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. Hematoxylin was used to counterstain the slides. Each set of sections stained included a positive control colorectal carcinoma as well as a negative control in which the primary antibody was replaced by 0.05m Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Positive or negative expression and subcellular localization of cathepsin B protein in tissue sections stained was evaluated by two independent observers. Intensity was scored on a scale of 0–4, with 0 equal to negative expression and 4 equal to strongly positive expression. Summary data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. For comparing data on A/N or C/N pairs for changes in cathepsin B expression, the Wilcoxon rank sum test for the difference between two means was used to establish statistical significance. When comparing differences between distributions, the χ2 test was used, with additional confirmation using the Fisher exact test for distributions with frequencies less than five. To compare data on A/N or C/N ratios for cathepsin B enzyme activity with A/N or C/N ratios for mature protein expression, a scatter plot diagram was drawn, and a Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated. Probability values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. The major form of cathepsin B detected in normal colon mucosa was the mature two-chain form, observed by Western blot in independent samples of normal colon mucosa from patients with 18 matched colorectal adenomas and/or 62 matched carcinomas and in five autopsy samples from patients without colorectal cancer. The 4-kDa light chain portion of mature two-chain cathepsin B was dissociated from the heavy chain prior to electrophoresis and migrated off the gel under the conditions required to visualize the higher molecular weight protein forms. The heavy chain was detected as a doublet of nonglycosylated (27-kDa) and glycosylated (28-kDa) cathepsin B protein. The strongest cathepsin B protein band detected in normal colon mucosa was the 27-kDa nonglycosylated heavy chain of the two-chain form. However, small amounts of the 28-kDa glycosylated heavy chain were present in some cases (Fig. 1 A). The uncleaved 31-kDa single chain form and the 47-kDa proform of cathepsin B protein were not detected in all cases, but when present they were usually seen in lesser amounts than the 27-kDa mature cathepsin B. The Oncogene Science and BioGenex antibodies were able to detect all protein forms of cathepsin B. However, the BioGenex antibody was found to be more sensitive at detecting the 47-kDa protein form in colorectal extracts, while abilities to detect the 27/28-kDa and 31-kDa protein forms were approximately equal, as shown in Figs. 1 A and 4.Figure 4Cathepsin B protein expression in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas representing the stages of colorectal tumor progression. Protein patterns in 12 sets of matched normal (NCT), adenoma (Ad), and primary carcinoma (CA) tissue extracts plus one metastatic lesion (TM) are shown, as detected by autoradiography of Western blots. Soluble protein extracts (200 μg/slot) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (16%), transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and probed with anti-human cathepsin B antibody. Overexpression of cathepsin B protein was seen to occur in adenomas and all stages of colorectal carcinoma. However, the greatest amounts of overexpression occurred more frequently in earlier stage carcinomas compared with adenomas and later stage carcinomas. To determine A/N and C/N ratios for cathepsin B mature heavy chain protein in matched sample pairs, both samples were always run on the same gel and compared on the same autoradiograph scanned by laser densitometry in the region of the 27- and 28-kDa bands. Intensity of protein bands on different autoradiographs does not reflect absolute amounts of protein present in different samples, since optimal autoradiograph development for detection of the protein bands varied with the range of cathepsin B protein present in a given matched pair. Cases 100, 48, and 26 were blotted with BioGenex antibody, while the remaining samples where blotted with Oncogene Science antibody. *, this patient had two primary tumors at the time of surgery, one Dukes A and one Dukes B stage tumor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test for the possible autoactivation of the 47- or 31-kDa forms of cathepsin B to the 27-kDa/4-kDa two-chain form (25Mach L. Schwihla H. Stuwe K. Rowan A.D. Mort J.S. Glossl J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) during the tissue extraction process, a sample of normal colorectal mucosa was extracted in the presence of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64, which abolished cathepsin B enzyme activity. Cathepsin B enzyme activity in the normal extraction was 42.40 nmol/mg/min; cathepsin B enzyme activity after extraction in 10 μm E-64 was 0.17 nmol/mg/min. However, as seen in Fig. 1 A (lanes 7and 8), no increase was observed in the higher molecular weight forms of cathepsin B protein following extraction in the presence of E-64, indicating that the cathepsin B protein forms expressed in our tissue samples were not the result of autoactivation during the extraction process. To test the specificity of the BioGenex and Oncogene Science antibodies in detecting cathepsin B, a Western blot was done using these cathepsin B antibodies against four lysosomal cathepsins purified from normal human liver. (Fig. 1, B and C). Both antibodies detected only cathepsin B protein and not cathepsin D, H, or L. Cathepsin B protein overexpression (C/N ≥ 1.4) was detected in 38 of 62 (61%) carcinomas analyzed on Western blots. Of these 38 cases with overexpression, 32 (84%) showed a major increase in expression of the glycosylated 28-kDa form (Fig.2 B, case 7, and Fig. 4, cases 64, 31-1, 104,65, and 110), while the remaining six carcinomas (16%) predominantly overexpressed the 27-kDa nonglycosylated heavy chain form (Fig. 4, cases 55 and 31-2). In 24 of a total of 62 carcinomas analyzed that did not contain a quantitative increase in the total amount of cathepsin B mature protein, a change was often observed in the ratio of cathepsin B protein forms. For 17 of these 24 carcinomas in which total mature protein levels were the same or decreased compared with normal, a shift in the ratio of 27-kDa to 28-kDa cathepsin B heavy chain forms had occurred due to increased amounts of glycosylated 28-kDa heavy chain cathepsin B in the cancer samples (Fig. 2 C, case 29, and Fig. 4, case 46). Thus, 49 of 62 colorectal carcinomas (79%) demonstrated increased expression of the glycosylated 28-kDa heavy chain of mature two-chain cathepsin B protein in tumor samples compared with matched normal mucosa from the same patient. In one case, (Fig. 4, case 26), increased expression of the glycosylated 28-kDa heavy chain was not detected in a Dukes D primary carcinoma compared with matched normal mucosa, but increased expression of the glycosylated form was seen in the corresponding metastatic lesion from this patient. A shift to greater expression of the glycosylated 28-kDa form of cathepsin B in cancers compared with normal was detected with the same approximate frequency at all stages of colorectal carcinoma (64% Dukes A cancers, 81% Dukes B cancers, 82% Dukes C cancers, and 63% of Dukes D cancers). Of the 62 cases analyzed, only 12 carcinomas (19%) contained increased expression of the 31-kDa single chain form, and each of these 12 cases also showed increased expression of the 27/28-kDa heavy chains of the mature two-chain protein (see Fig. 4). In these 12 cases, the relative increase in the 31-kDa single chain form was generally much less than the increase in the 27/28-kDa heavy chain forms. In addition, 9 of these 12 cases were among those with the largest increases in mature two-chain protein expression and were Dukes stage A and B cases (n = 3 and n = 6, respectively). Thus, increases in the single chain form of cathepsin B were primarily detected in tumors with very high total cathepsin B protein levels. With respect to the 47-kDa proform, 10 of 62 cases (16%) contained increased expression of the proform in the carcinoma. Of these 10 cases, 9 were cases that also contained increased expression of the mature 27/28-kDa forms, and 2 of these 9 cases also contained increased expression of the 31-kDa single chain form of cathepsin B. These cases with increased expression of the proform in cancer were distributed among Dukes stages A, B, and C (n = 2,n = 4, and n = 4, respectively).

TEM-1 β-lactamase is a prevalent β-lactamase found in Gram-negative bacteria and is capable of hydrolyzing both penicillins and cephalosporins, except for the extended-spectrum cephalosporins. To identify the sequence determinants in the active site for a given antibiotic substrate, random libraries were constructed that each contain all possible amino acid combinations for the designated region of TEM-1 β-lactamase. To establish the determinants of substrate specificity for cephalosporinsversus those for penicillins, these active site libraries have been screened for mutants with high levels of activity for the second generation cephalosporin cephaloridine. Based on the sequence results, substitutions of W165S, A237T, and E240C were identified as cephalosporin-specific. Kinetic analysis of these mutants was done to determine whether each is capable of distinguishing between the two classes of antibiotics. Both the A237T and E240C substitutions, alone or in combination, exhibited increased cephalosporinase activity and decreased penicillinase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme. A sequence comparison between functional mutants selected for cephaloridine hydrolytic activity and functional mutants previously selected for ampicillin hydrolytic activity suggests that TEM-1 β-lactamase has greater restrictions in maintaining cephalosporinase activity versus maintaining penicillinase activity. β-lactamase is a bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins.

The production of β-lactamases, which catalyze β-lactam hydrolysis, is the predominant mechanism of bacterial resistance to these antibiotics (1Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). β-lactamases are grouped into 4 classes (A, B, C, and D) based on primary sequence homology (2Ambler R.P. Philos.

TEM-1 β-lactamase is a plasmid encoded, class A enzyme that can efficiently cleave the penicillins and some cephalosporins (5Wiedemann B. Kliebe C. Kresken M. J. Antimicrob.

The substitutions are thought to provide more favorable interactions between the enzyme and the bulkier side chains of the extended-spectrum cephalosporins, thus increasing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (6Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).Because of the importance of mutation-meditated changes in TEM-1 β-lactamase substrate specificity during the development of antibiotic resistance, it is of interest to determine how mutations can alter the substrate profile of the enzyme toward various β-lactam antibiotics. Previously, saturation mutagenesis was used to study the amino acid residues critical for the function of TEM-1 β-lactamase with ampicillin as a substrate (8Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This was accomplished by randomizing three contiguous codons to create random libraries containing all possible amino acid substitutions for a given three residue window. The entire coding sequence of TEM-1 β-lactamase has been randomized in a set of eighty-eight libraries (8Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Functional random mutants which conferred resistance to ampicillin were selected from each of the libraries and sequenced to identify the critical residues (8Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It was found that 43 out of the 263 amino acid residues of TEM-1 β-lactamase are essential for function of the enzyme with ampicillin as a substrate. Conversely, 220 residues of the enzyme could be substituted to varying degrees and still maintain ampicillinase activity. This data set can now be used to identify residue positions that are important determinants of β-lactamase substrate specificity by comparing the sequence requirements for efficient ampicillin hydrolysis with those for other β-lactam antibiotics.In this report, eleven random libraries, including the residues that constitute the active site of TEM-1 β-lactamase, have been used to select functional mutants with cephaloridine as a substrate. Cephaloridine is a second generation cephalosporin and is a good substrate for β-lactamase withk cat/K m values in the 106m−1 s−1 range (9Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22538-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of the functional random mutants indicates that many of the residue positions that are tolerant of amino acid substitutions in selections with ampicillin do not tolerate substitutions and retain high-level function in the cephaloridine selections. This suggests that the sequence requirements for cephaloridine hydrolysis by TEM-1 β-lactamase are more stringent than those for ampicillin hydrolysis.In addition, the sequence data suggests that amino acid substitutions of serine for tryptophan at position 165, threonine for alanine at position 237, and cysteine for glutamic acid at position 240 create enzymes that are more specific for cephaloridine hydrolysis. The role of each substitution was determined by introducing the substitutions individually and in combination. In particular, the A237T and E240C substitutions alone or in combination exhibit increased cephalosporinase activity and decreased penicillinase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme.DISCUSSIONTo better understand mutation-mediated changes in the substrate profile of β-lactamase, saturation mutagenesis, in the form of random libraries that include all possible amino acid substitutions in the TEM-1 β-lactamase active site, was used to select functional mutants with greater than or equal to wild-type levels of hydrolysis for the second-generation cephalosporin cephaloridine. The cephaloridine selection data set (Fig. 1) was then used to compare and contrast the sequence preferences of functional mutants selected for cephaloridine hydrolysis with those previously selected for ampicillin hydrolysis ((8) and unpublished results). These two antibiotics are representatives of the cephalosporin and penicillin classes of β-lactam antibiotics, respectively. Therefore, differences seen in the sequence comparison will reflect not only critical interactions required by the different antibiotic side groups, but also those interactions required by the different ring structures of penicillins and cephalosporins.16 out of 30 residues examined in this study display similar sequence requirements for both cephaloridine and ampicillin hydrolysis (Fig. 3). The similarity indicates that the interactions required of these residues are identical for both classes of β-lactams, irrespective of the differences in structure for each antibiotic class. The remaining 14 residues exhibit little sequence variation among the functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection despite the fact that many different amino acid types were observed at the same residue positions in functional mutants from the ampicillin selection (Fig. 3). For example, no substitutions were found at residue Gly-236 among the mutants selected for cephaloridine resistance. It is thought that any substitution at residue Gly-236, which is invariant in the class A β-lactamase family, would introduce steric conflicts with Ser-70 (20Matagne A. Frere J.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), yet the TEM-1 enzyme is able to tolerate a glycine to alanine substitution and retain wild-type levels of ampicillin hydrolysis. Another example of the difference in sequence variation involves residues 69 and 238. In class A β-lactamases, excluding extended-spectrum β-lactamases, an inverse correlation exists between the sizes of the side chains of residue 69 and residue 238. For instance, while the E. coli TEM-1 β-lactamase has the large methionine at position 69 and small glycine at position 238, theStreptomyces cacaoi ULg β-lactamase has the small glycine at position 69 and the large valine at position 238 (24Huletsky A. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because both residues are involved in positioning of the B3 β-strand and formation of the oxyanion pocket, a substitution at one residue without a compensating substitution at the other residue could introduce steric conflicts that would alter the β-lactam binding configuration. Both residues are absolutely conserved in the functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection, yet several amino acid types are observed at each residue among the functional mutants from the ampicillin selection. Thus, the decreased number of substitutions seen in the functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection suggests a greater restriction on the enzyme in maintaining cephalosporinase activityversus penicillinase activity. Because these conserved residues are involved both in substrate binding and proper positioning of catalytic residues, their conservation only with respect to cephaloridine hydrolysis may reflect different interactions required by the dihydrothiazine ring of cephalosporins than by the thiazolidine ring of penicillins.Mutational studies have demonstrated that substitutions at residues Ser-130 and Ser-235 result in a significant decrease in cephalosporinase activity, and yet do not greatly alter penicillinase activity (25Imtiaz U. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2438-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Juteau J.-M. Billings E. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each study proposed that the loss of a hydrogen bond to the substrate carboxylate from the serine side chain was detrimental only for cephalosporin hydrolysis. The conclusion from these studies was that the hydrogen bond network in the active site is developed to such an extent for penicillinase activity that the enzyme can afford the mutational loss of one or two hydrogen bonds and retain function. For example, it was proposed that the S130G mutation was compensated for in penicillin hydrolysis by a hydrogen bond to the substrate carboxylate from Arg-244 that is shorter (stronger) for penicillins than for cephalosporins (26Juteau J.-M. Billings E. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, because the TEM enzyme has more interactions with penicillins than with cephalosporins, the loss of any specific interaction due to a residue substitution is critical to cephalosporin hydrolysis and therefore is not tolerated. The limited amount of substitutions seen in functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection is in agreement with this hypothesis. Thus, it appears that β-lactamase has evolved penicillinase activity to such a high level that conservation of residues in the active site is more important for maintaining cephalosporinase activity.Although the TEM-1 enzyme does not tolerate amino acid substitutions at several residue positions with cephaloridine as substrate as compared with ampicillin, there are specific substitutions that decrease ampicillin hydrolysis and that increase or do not affect cephaloridine hydrolysis. Based on the sequence results, it was found that individual substitutions of serine for tryptophan at position 165, threonine for alanine at 237, and cysteine for glutamic acid at 240 were cephaloridine specific. To better understand the role of each identified substitution in altering specificity, the contributions of each single substitution as well as the A237T:E240C and W165S:A237T:E240C mutants were determined with ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cefotaxime as substrates. Characterization of these enzymes for the cephalosporins indicate that the A237T and E240C single and combinatorial mutants either maintain or improve the K m and/ork cat values for the cephalosporins resulting ink cat/K m values equal to or greater than wild-type (Table I). As expected, thek cat/K m values of these mutants are decreased for the penicillins. The W165S mutant showed no distinction in its effect on catalytic activity and lowered thek cat/K m values for all substrates.A comparison of the binding of penicillins and cephalosporins in the DD-peptidase binding site (27Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Zhao H. Frere J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), showed that hydrogen bonding to the carboxylate of the respective 5- or 6-member ring of each class of substrate was stronger for the cephalosporins due to a closer proximity of threonine residues at position 299 and 301 (residues Ser-235 and Ala-237 on the B3 β-strand of TEM-1 β-lactamase). Previous studies with TEM-1 have shown the ability of the A237T substitution to enhance the cephalosporinase activity of TEM-1 β-lactamase by introducing another hydrogen-bonding group in the active site to anchor the carboxylate group of the dihydrothiazine ring of a cephalosporin (28Healy W.J. Labgold M.R. Richards J.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,29Kuzin A.P. Liu H. Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In fact, the A237T substitution was first isolated in1976 by Hall and Knowles in a selection screen for TEM mutants with increased cephalosporin C hydrolytic activity (30Hall A. Knowles J.R. Nature. 1976; 264: 803-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).While the E240C substitution is neutral for cephalosporin hydrolysis, it is clearly detrimental for penicillin hydrolysis (Table I). Crystallographic studies of the Streptomyces sp. R61 DD-peptidase bound to cephalothin or cefotaxime showed that the thiophene side group of cephalothin, which is the same in cephaloridine, is exposed to solvent and not restrained by the enzyme and that the aminothiazole ring of the branched side group of cefotaxime is exposed while its methoxy group is buried in the binding site (29Kuzin A.P. Liu H. Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Residue 240 of TEM-1 β-lactamase is on the turn between the B3 and B4 β-strands with its side chain facing out into the solvent (22Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.-M. Samama J.-P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The fact that both the side chains of the substrate and residue 240 face outward into solvent makes it difficult to understand how the E240C enzyme is establishing any specific interaction that results in greater discrimination between cephalosporins and penicillins.In summary, a sequence comparison between functional mutants selected for ampicillin hydrolysis (8Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) 1C. Cantu, III, W. Huang, and T. Palzkill, unpublished data. and cephaloridine hydrolysis indicates that amino acid substitutions at many positions in the active site of TEM-1 β-lactamase are detrimental for cephaloridine hydrolysis but not for ampicillin hydrolysis. The limited tolerance to amino acid substitutions in the active site suggests that β-lactamase has greater restrictions in maintaining cephalosporinase activity than in maintaining penicillinase activity. In addition, screening of the active site for functional mutants with substitutions that provide wild-type or greater levels of hydrolysis for cephaloridine revealed that the A237T and E240C substitutions, alone or in combination, exhibit increased cephalosporinase activity and decreased penicillinase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme. β-lactam antibiotics, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins, are among the most commonly used antimicrobial agents. The production of β-lactamases, which catalyze β-lactam hydrolysis, is the predominant mechanism of bacterial resistance to these antibiotics (1Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). β-lactamases are grouped into 4 classes (A, B, C, and D) based on primary sequence homology (2Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 3Joris B. Ghuysen J.-M. Dive G. Renard A. Dideberg O. Charlier P. Frere J.-M. Kelly J.A. Boyington J.C. Moews P.C. Knox J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Classes A, C, and D are serine hydrolases (3Joris B. Ghuysen J.-M. Dive G. Renard A. Dideberg O. Charlier P. Frere J.-M. Kelly J.A. Boyington J.C. Moews P.C. Knox J.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) while class B consists of zinc metalloenzymes (4Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frere J.-M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). TEM-1 β-lactamase is a plasmid encoded, class A enzyme that can efficiently cleave the penicillins and some cephalosporins (5Wiedemann B. Kliebe C. Kresken M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1989; 24: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The third generation or extended-spectrum cephalosporins, such as ceftazidime and cefotaxime, however, are poor substrates for the TEM-1 enzyme (6Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Changes in the substrate specificity of TEM-1 β-lactamase due to amino acid substitutions in the enzyme have been observed among resistant clinical isolates in response to selective pressure applied by extended-spectrum antibiotics (6Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The most common amino acid substitutions occur at residues 104, 164, and 237–240, both as individual and as combinatorial substitutions (numbering of amino acids according to Ambler et al. (7Ambler R.P. Coulson F.W. Frere J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar)). The substitutions are thought to provide more favorable interactions between the enzyme and the bulkier side chains of the extended-spectrum cephalosporins, thus increasing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (6Knox J.R.

The similarity indicates that the interactions required of these residues are identical for both classes of β-lactams, irrespective of the differences in structure for each antibiotic class. The remaining 14 residues exhibit little sequence variation among the functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection despite the fact that many different amino acid types were observed at the same residue positions in functional mutants from the ampicillin selection (Fig. 3).

Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because both residues are involved in positioning of the B3 β-strand and formation of the oxyanion pocket, a substitution at one residue without a compensating substitution at the other residue could introduce steric conflicts that would alter the β-lactam binding configuration.

Therefore, differences seen in the sequence comparison will reflect not only critical interactions required by the different antibiotic side groups, but also those interactions required by the different ring structures of penicillins and cephalosporins. 16 out of 30 residues examined in this study display similar sequence requirements for both cephaloridine and ampicillin hydrolysis (Fig. 3). The similarity indicates that the interactions required of these residues are identical for both classes of β-lactams, irrespective of the differences in structure for each antibiotic class. The remaining 14 residues exhibit little sequence variation among the functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection despite the fact that many different amino acid types were observed at the same residue positions in functional mutants from the ampicillin selection (Fig. 3). For example, no substitutions were found at residue Gly-236 among the mutants selected for cephaloridine resistance. It is thought that any substitution at residue Gly-236, which is invariant in the class A β-lactamase family, would introduce steric conflicts with Ser-70 (20Matagne A. Frere J.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), yet the TEM-1 enzyme is able to tolerate a glycine to alanine substitution and retain wild-type levels of ampicillin hydrolysis. Another example of the difference in sequence variation involves residues 69 and 238. In class A β-lactamases, excluding extended-spectrum β-lactamases, an inverse correlation exists between the sizes of the side chains of residue 69 and residue 238. For instance, while the E. coli TEM-1 β-lactamase has the large methionine at position 69 and small glycine at position 238, theStreptomyces cacaoi ULg β-lactamase has the small glycine at position 69 and the large valine at position 238 (24Huletsky A. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because both residues are involved in positioning of the B3 β-strand and formation of the oxyanion pocket, a substitution at one residue without a compensating substitution at the other residue could introduce steric conflicts that would alter the β-lactam binding configuration. Both residues are absolutely conserved in the functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection, yet several amino acid types are observed at each residue among the functional mutants from the ampicillin selection. Thus, the decreased number of substitutions seen in the functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection suggests a greater restriction on the enzyme in maintaining cephalosporinase activityversus penicillinase activity. Because these conserved residues are involved both in substrate binding and proper positioning of catalytic residues, their conservation only with respect to cephaloridine hydrolysis may reflect different interactions required by the dihydrothiazine ring of cephalosporins than by the thiazolidine ring of penicillins. Mutational studies have demonstrated that substitutions at residues Ser-130 and Ser-235 result in a significant decrease in cephalosporinase activity, and yet do not greatly alter penicillinase activity (25Imtiaz U. Manavathu E.K. Lerner S.A. Mobashery S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2438-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Juteau J.-M. Billings E. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each study proposed that the loss of a hydrogen bond to the substrate carboxylate from the serine side chain was detrimental only for cephalosporin hydrolysis. The conclusion from these studies was that the hydrogen bond network in the active site is developed to such an extent for penicillinase activity that the enzyme can afford the mutational loss of one or two hydrogen bonds and retain function. For example, it was proposed that the S130G mutation was compensated for in penicillin hydrolysis by a hydrogen bond to the substrate carboxylate from Arg-244 that is shorter (stronger) for penicillins than for cephalosporins (26Juteau J.-M. Billings E. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, because the TEM enzyme has more interactions with penicillins than with cephalosporins, the loss of any specific interaction due to a residue substitution is critical to cephalosporin hydrolysis and therefore is not tolerated. The limited amount of substitutions seen in functional mutants from the cephaloridine selection is in agreement with this hypothesis. Thus, it appears that β-lactamase has evolved penicillinase activity to such a high level that conservation of residues in the active site is more important for maintaining cephalosporinase activity. Although the TEM-1 enzyme does not tolerate amino acid substitutions at several residue positions with cephaloridine as substrate as compared with ampicillin, there are specific substitutions that decrease ampicillin hydrolysis and that increase or do not affect cephaloridine hydrolysis. Based on the sequence results, it was found that individual substitutions of serine for tryptophan at position 165, threonine for alanine at 237, and cysteine for glutamic acid at 240 were cephaloridine specific. To better understand the role of each identified substitution in altering specificity, the contributions of each single substitution as well as the A237T:E240C and W165S:A237T:E240C mutants were determined with ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cefotaxime as substrates. Characterization of these enzymes for the cephalosporins indicate that the A237T and E240C single and combinatorial mutants either maintain or improve the K m and/ork cat values for the cephalosporins resulting ink cat/K m values equal to or greater than wild-type (Table I). As expected, thek cat/K m values of these mutants are decreased for the penicillins. The W165S mutant showed no distinction in its effect on catalytic activity and lowered thek cat/K m values for all substrates. A comparison of the binding of penicillins and cephalosporins in the DD-peptidase binding site (27Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Zhao H. Frere J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), showed that hydrogen bonding to the carboxylate of the respective 5- or 6-member ring of each class of substrate was stronger for the cephalosporins due to a closer proximity of threonine residues at position 299 and 301 (residues Ser-235 and Ala-237 on the B3 β-strand of TEM-1 β-lactamase). Previous studies with TEM-1 have shown the ability of the A237T substitution to enhance the cephalosporinase activity of TEM-1 β-lactamase by introducing another hydrogen-bonding group in the active site to anchor the carboxylate group of the dihydrothiazine ring of a cephalosporin (28Healy W.J. Labgold M.R. Richards J.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,29Kuzin A.P. Liu H. Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In fact, the A237T substitution was first isolated in1976 by Hall and Knowles in a selection screen for TEM mutants with increased cephalosporin C hydrolytic activity (30Hall A. Knowles J.R. Nature. 1976; 264: 803-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). While the E240C substitution is neutral for cephalosporin hydrolysis, it is clearly detrimental for penicillin hydrolysis (Table I). Crystallographic studies of the Streptomyces sp. R61 DD-peptidase bound to cephalothin or cefotaxime showed that the thiophene side group of cephalothin, which is the same in cephaloridine, is exposed to solvent and not restrained by the enzyme and that the aminothiazole ring of the branched side group of cefotaxime is exposed while its methoxy group is buried in the binding site (29Kuzin A.P. Liu H. Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Residue 240 of TEM-1 β-lactamase is on the turn between the B3 and B4 β-strands with its side chain facing out into the solvent (22Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.-M. Samama J.-P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The fact that both the side chains of the substrate and residue 240 face outward into solvent makes it difficult to understand how the E240C enzyme is establishing any specific interaction that results in greater discrimination between cephalosporins and penicillins. In summary, a sequence comparison between functional mutants selected for ampicillin hydrolysis (8Huang W. Petrosino J. Hirsch M. Shenkin P.S. Palzkill T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 688-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) 1C. Cantu, III, W. Huang, and T. Palzkill, unpublished data. and cephaloridine hydrolysis indicates that amino acid substitutions at many positions in the active site of TEM-1 β-lactamase are detrimental for cephaloridine hydrolysis but not for ampicillin hydrolysis. The limited tolerance to amino acid substitutions in the active site suggests that β-lactamase has greater restrictions in maintaining cephalosporinase activity than in maintaining penicillinase activity. In addition, screening of the active site for functional mutants with substitutions that provide wild-type or greater levels of hydrolysis for cephaloridine revealed that the A237T and E240C substitutions, alone or in combination, exhibit increased cephalosporinase activity and decreased penicillinase activity relative to the wild-type enzyme.

Chem. Immunol. 1992; 51: 65-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IL-3 receptor is a heterodimer and in murine cells is composed of a 70-kDa α-chain and a 130-kDa β-chain, known as Aic2A (2Itoh N.

Both these subunits belong to the hemopoietin receptor superfamily and lack any intrinsic catalytic activity (5Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev.

However, IL-3 activates a number of signaling pathways known to be controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. These include the p21 ras /mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (6Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Characterization of the inter-relationships of these pathways is key to understanding how the molecular signaling events induced by IL-3 relate to its functions. The class 1 PI3K are heterodimers composed of a p85 (regulatory) and a p110 (catalytic) subunit (reviewed by Kapeller and Cantley (15Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar)). Activation of these enzymes occurs after ligation of a broad range of receptors and leads to phosphorylation of the inositol ring at the D3 position, resulting in the transient in vivo production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which are thought to act as novel second messengers (reviewed in Ref. 15Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The downstream targets of these lipid products include various isoforms of protein kinase C and Akt/protein kinase B (16Toker A. Meyer M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Aneja R. Aneja S. Parra A. Burns D.J.

PI3K may be activated in a number of different ways, one of the best characterized being the binding of the SH2 domains of p85 to proteins with phosphorylated tyrosines in YXXM motifs (21Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.-J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). This leads to a conformational change, resulting in activation of the p110 catalytic subunit (22Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hirano M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that PI3K may be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit itself (23Hayashi H. Kamohara S. Nishioka Y. Kanai F. Miyake N. Fukui Y. Shibasaki F.

SHP2 is itself tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to cell stimulation by a number of different growth factors, including PDGF, EGF, Steelfactor, erythropoietin, IL-3, and GM-CSF, which also lead to its activation (14Welham M.J.

In addition to its catalytic activity, it has been suggested that SHP2 may perform an additional function as an adaptor molecule. Tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP2 has been shown to interact with the small adaptor protein Grb2, via the Grb2 SH2 domain (14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this role, SHP2 acts as a positive mediator of signal transduction, as it serves to recruit the Grb2-Sos complex to the activated PDGF receptor, facilitating activation of the p21 ras /mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (38Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 39Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H.

SHP2 has also been suggested to act as an adaptor in promoting the association of the insulin receptor with IRS-1 (40Kharitonenkov A. Schnekenburger J. Chen Z. Knyazev P. Ali S. Zwick E. White M.

We have shown previously that PI3K and SHP2 can be co-immunoprecipitated after activation of cells with IL-3 (14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have characterized the association of SHP2 with the β-chain of the human IL-3 receptor (41Bone H. Dechert U. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We report here that the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that co-precipitates with both PI3K (p85) and SHP2 in murine cells is a protein of 100 kDa. The same p100 protein, or a portion of it, appears to interact directly with both SHP2 and PI3K and can be dephosphorylated by SHP2. We show that p100 is not JAK2, STAT5, Vav, or c-Cbl and that, although p100 is mainly cytosolic, it can be detected at the membrane in association with PI3K and SHP2 after IL-3 stimulation. Therefore, we propose that p100 is a novel adaptor protein that serves to link PI3K and SHP2 in IL-3 signaling. All cells were cultured in humidified incubators at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (v/v) in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland, United Kingdom (UK)), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK), 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Ba/F3, an IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line (42Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), were cultured with the addition of 5% (v/v) conditioned medium from WEHI 3B cells as a source of murine IL-3, to the above media. FDMAC11/4.6 (FD-6) cells are clones of FD-5 that have been described previously (43Welham M.J. Duronio V. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5865-5873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were cultured in 5% (v/v) conditioned medium from x63omIL-4 cells, as a source of murine IL-4. Stimulation of cells with IL-3 was carried out as described previously (44Welham M.J. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2772-2783PubMed Google Scholar, 45Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, unless otherwise stated, cells were stimulated for 10 min with 10 μg/ml synthetic IL-3 (kindly provided by Dr. I. Clark-Lewis, Biomedical Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada), shown previously to induce maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of the major IL-3 substrates (44Welham M.J. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2772-2783PubMed Google Scholar). Cell pellets were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) at 1–2 × 107 cells/ml. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (44Welham M.J. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2772-2783PubMed Google Scholar, 45Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: 4 μl of polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against the SH3/bcr region of the p85 subunit of PI3K (a gift from Dr. Peter Shepherd, University College London, London, UK), and 1 μg of polyclonal rabbit antipeptide antibodies against SHP2, c-Cbl, Vav, or STAT5 (sc-280, sc-168, sc-132, and sc-835; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitations were performed on extracts from control or IL-3-treated cells as described previously (44Welham M.J. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2772-2783PubMed Google Scholar, 45Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were released by boiling the immune complexes in 1% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. 80% of the reaction was removed and the SDS was diluted to 0.1% using IP buffer. Secondary precipitations were performed using various GST fusion proteins, as described previously (14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining 20% of the primary immunoprecipitation was reboiled with an appropriate volume of 5 × SDS sample buffer (5% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, plus trace of bromphenol blue) so that primary and secondary precipitations could be compared by immunoblotting. The GST fusion proteins containing full-length Grb2 (FLGrb2-GST), the SH2 domain of Grb2 (Grb2SH2-GST), and the bovine p85α N-terminal SH2 (NSH2-GST) or C-terminal SH2 (CSH2-GST) have been described previously (45Welham M.J.

The construct for SHP2SH2-GST was a kind gift from Dr. U. Dechert (Biotechnology Research and Information Network GmbH, Darmstaeter, Germany) and the construct for the double SH3 domain mutant of Grb2 (Grb2N+CSH3*-GST) was a kind gift from Dr. D. Cantrell (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). Using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques, a full-length cDNA for bovine p85α was generated and cloned in frame into pGEX2T (pGEX2T-FLp85). The p85 SH3 domain, encoding amino acids 1–80, was derived from pGEX2T-FLp85 byBamHI-BglII digestion and cloned in frame into pGEX2T using standard techniques (pGEX2T-p85SH3). GST fusion proteins were purified over glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). 10 μg of each fusion protein was used in precipitation analyses, as described previously (14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (44Welham M.J. Schrader J.W. J.

Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations: anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 at 0.1 μg/ml (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); polyclonal anti-SHP2, anti-STAT5, and anti-c-Cbl antibodies at 0.2 μg/ml; polyclonal anti-p85 (SH3/bcr) antibody at a dilution of 1:4000; and monoclonal anti-p85α antibody (tissue culture supernatant, a gift from Dr. M. Waterfield, Ludwig Institute and University College London, London, UK) at 1:50. For “Far Western” blotting, primary incubations were performed with either NSH2-GST or FLp85-GST at 200 ng/ml for 2 h and then incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of a monoclonal anti-GST antibody (Sigma). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used at a concentration of 0.05 μg/ml (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunoblots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) and Kodak X-AR 5 film. Blots were stripped as described previously (45Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHP2 immunoprecipitations were prepared from extracts of the equivalent of 2 × 107cells/sample, which had been lysed in IP buffer containing or lacking phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were washed three times in the appropriate IP buffer and once in phosphatase buffer (25 mmPIPES, pH 6.25, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), containing or lacking phosphatase inhibitors, before resuspension in the appropriate phosphatase buffer and incubation at 20 °C for 50 min, with occasional agitation. Reactions were terminated by pelleting the precipitates and boiling in SDS sample buffer. Control or IL-3-treated Ba/F3 or FD-6 cells were washed briefly and then resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). The cells were left on ice for 10 min to swell. Homogenization was carried out by 50 strokes of a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer on ice. Nuclei and intact cells were removed by centrifugation for 20 s at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge at full speed. The supernatant was then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The resulting supernatant (S100) was designated the cytosol and the pellet (P100) the crude membrane. Nonidet P-40 was added to the cytosol to 1% prior to its use for immunoprecipitations. The pellet was rinsed briefly in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and then solubilized in a volume of buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 equivalent to the volume of the cytosol. Remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge at full speed. We have reported previously that both PI3K and SHP2 are activated in response to IL-3 (12Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recently we have shown that SHP2 associates with the β-chain of the IL-3 receptor (41Bone H. Dechert U. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). No such association has been observed for PI3K; thus, the mechanism used by IL-3 to locate PI3K to the membrane, and so to its lipid substrates, remains undefined but is of obvious importance. In light of the fact that we have previously reported co-immunoprecipitation of p85 and SHP2 from extracts of IL-3-treated cells (14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that PI3K is coupled to the IL-3 receptor via SHP2-IL-3 receptor β-chain interactions. Therefore, we were interested to further investigate the interaction between PI3K and SHP2 in an attempt to identify any potential adaptor proteins involved in linking them after IL-3 treatment. To investigate the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins interacting with SHP2 and p85 in response to IL-3, murine Ba/F3 cells were treated with IL-3 or left untreated as a control. Immunoprecipitates were prepared using either anti-p85 or anti-SHP2 antibodies, and immunoblotting was performed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. The major co-precipitating species in the IL-3-treated samples in both p85 and SHP2 immunoprecipitates was a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 100 kDa (p100; see Fig.1 A). Additional proteins of 60 and 70 kDa were also observed in p85 precipitates. As we have described previously, the p70 protein was SHP2 (14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 60-kDa protein was variably observed in unstimulated samples. Additional proteins of 70 and 135 kDa were observed in the SHP2 immunoprecipitates from IL-3-treated samples. SHP2 corresponds to the 70-kDa protein, and the 135-kDa protein is the β-chain of the IL-3 receptor (41Bone H. Dechert U. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that a 100-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein is the major protein that co-precipitates with p85 PI3K and SHP2 after IL-3 treatment of Ba/F3 cells. Similar results were obtained when FD-6 cells were subjected to the same analyses (data not shown). It is interesting to note that we do not observe co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p145SHIP with SHP2 from lysates of IL-3-treated Ba/F3 or FD-6 cells. This is in agreement with our previous work (14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that of other groups using similar cells (48Carlberg K. Rohrschneider L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15943-15950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 49Gu H. Griffin J.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16421-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it is in contrast to a recent report by Liu et al. (50Liu L. Damen J.E. Ware M.D. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10998-11001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), who describe co-precipitation of p145SHIP and SHP2 after IL-3 stimulation of murine B6SUtA1 cells, the reasons for these differences are not clear. The interaction between p100 and p85 was investigated further to establish whether binding was direct and, if so, which region of p85 was involved. Ba/F3 were treated with IL-3 or left untreated as a control, and precipitations were performed using GST fusion proteins of full-length p85 (FLp85-GST), the N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 (NSH2-GST), the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85 (CSH2-GST), or the p85 SH3 domain (p85SH3-GST), the results are shown in Fig. 1 B. A 100-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein was precipitated from extracts of IL-3-treated cells with FLp85-GST, NSH2-GST and CSH2-GST, but not with p85SH3-GST. These results suggest that the interaction between p100 and p85 PI3K is mediated by the p85 SH2 domains. A small amount of SHP2 was also precipitated by these fusion proteins, as we have described previously (14Welham M.J. Dechert U. Leslie K.B. Jirik F. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23764-23768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the relative stoichiometry suggests that the interaction is unlikely to be direct, there being far more p100 present. Similar results were observed in FD-6 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, the p85SH3-GST fusion protein precipitated a 64-kDa protein from IL-3-treated cell extracts, the identity of which is unknown, but may be related to the p60 protein observed in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates (see Fig. 1 A). The identity of the 145-kDa protein precipitated by the p85 SH2-domain GST fusions is not known. One candidate is the recently described SH2-containing inositol phosphatase p145SHIP. To investigate the possibility that p145 could be SHIP, the immunoblot in Fig. 1 B was reprobed with anti-p145SHIPantibodies. These antibodies detected SHIP in the pre-immunoprecipitation samples, but they did not cross-re"

We have recently identified the Sterile 20 (Ste20)-like oxidant stress response kinase-1, SOK-1, which is a member of the Ste20 kinase family. We report that SOK-1 is markedly activated as early as 20 min after chemical anoxia induced by exposure of Madin-Darby canine kidney or LLC-PK1 renal tubular epithelial cells to 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and any one of three inhibitors of the electron transport chain, cyanide (CN), rotenone, or antimycin A. Since oxidant stress activates SOK-1, we postulated that reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced by the electron transport chain during chemical anoxia, might be responsible for SOK-1 activation. The time course of CN/2-DG-induced SOK-1 activation and of production of ROS, measured in cells loaded with dichlorofluorescein, were compatible with a role for ROS in SOK-1 activation. Furthermore, preincubation of LLC-PK1 cells with three unrelated scavengers of ROS, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, pyruvate, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid, reduced both cellular oxidant stress and activation of SOK-1 by CN/2-DG. An increase in cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+] i ) was necessary but not sufficient for CN/2-DG-induced activation of SOK-1. Preincubation of cells with BAPTA-AM prevented activation of SOK-1. Incubation of cells with thapsigargin or the calcium ionophore, A23187, had no effect on SOK-1 activity, but preincubation of cells with either of these agents markedly enhanced CN/2-DG-induced activation of SOK-1 (20-foldversus 7-fold). In summary, chemical anoxia activates SOK-1 via an oxidant stress-dependent mechanism that is both critically dependent upon and markedly amplified by an increase in [Ca2+] i . This requirement for dual inputs of oxidant stress and an increase in [Ca2+] i may prevent inappropriate activation of the kinase by milder degrees of oxidant stress, which are insufficient to generate an increase in [Ca2+] i . The activation of SOK-1 may be one of the cell's earliest responses to inducers of necrotic cell death.

Ischemia, caused by the interruption of blood flow to a tissue, is the cause of myocardial infarction and stroke, and is a major cause of acute renal failure. Ischemia is characterized by three major components: ATP depletion, acidosis, and metabolite accumulation (1Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. New Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). If blood flow is restored in whole or in part, a fourth component, production of reactive oxygen species, is introduced (2Ambrosio G. Zweier J.L. Duilio C. Kuppusamy P. Santoro G. Elia P.P. Tritto I. Cirillo P. Condorelli M. Chiariello M. Flaherty J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18532-18541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the kidney, the cells most adversely affected by ischemia are the tubular epithelial cells. Those cells that survive the ischemic insult may undergo dedifferentiation and, after a variable period of time, re-enter the cell cycle to replace cells which suffered necrotic or apoptotic cell death (1Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. New Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways modulating these responses to ischemic injury are poorly understood.In tubular epithelial cells in culture, chemical anoxia, induced by inhibition of the electron transport chain combined with inhibition of glycolysis, recapitulates two key features of ischemia: ATP depletion and, if chemical anoxia occurs in a normoxic environment, oxidant stress due to enhanced mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (3Dawson T.L.

Chemical anoxia, if prolonged, induces necrotic cell death, characterized by what appears to be intact chromatin, by mitochondrial swelling with loss of crista structure, and loss of plasma membrane integrity (6Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Waguri S. Uchiyama Y. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y.

We have found that the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs, or c-Jun N-terminal kinases), while not activated by periods of renal ischemia in vivo or chemical anoxia in vitro, are markedly activated after as little as 5 min of reperfusion of ischemic kidney or 5 min of re-exposure of anoxic cells to glucose. The SAPKs are the predominant c-Jun transactivation domain kinases and the predominant ATF-2 transactivation domain and DNA binding domain kinases in the post-ischemic kidney (7Pombo C.P.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). SOK-1 appears to be an environmental stress response kinase since it is not activated by ligand-receptor interactions but is activated by oxidant stress (9Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Herein we report that chemical anoxia markedly activates SOK-1 during the early and potentially reversible stages of necrotic cell death, and describe the mechanisms responsible for activation.RESULTSTo define putative physiological roles of SOK-1 in the response of the cell to environmental stress, we determined whether SOK-1 was activated by the extreme cellular stress of chemical anoxia. SOK-1 was activated in MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells after exposure to CN (5 mm) and 2-DG (5 mm) in glucose-free medium for as little as 20 min, and activation peaked at 40 min (7-fold; Fig.1 A). Thereafter, SOK-1 activity declined and at 60 min of chemical anoxia, activity was similar to that of control (1.3-fold).We also examined the effect of allowing ATP stores to recover on the activity of SOK-1. Within 20 min of re-exposing cells, which had been treated previously with CN/2-DG, to glucose (5 mm), SOK-1 activity was identical to control (Fig.1 B).To confirm that the CN/2-DG-induced activation of SOK-1 was due to effects on the electron transport chain, we employed two other inhibitors that are chemically unrelated to CN. Both rotenone (an inhibitor of site I respiration) and antimycin A (an inhibitor of site III respiration) in combination with 2-DG activated SOK-1, albeit not as potently as CN/2-DG (Fig. 2).Figure 2Activation of SOK-1 by inhibitors of the electron transport chain. LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to CN plus 2-DG, rotenone (0.5 μg/ml) plus 2-DG, or antimycin A (AA, 0.5 μm) plus 2-DG for 40 min before immune complex kinase assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ATP depletion is likely to be important for CN/2-DG-induced activation of SOK-1 since inclusion of 10 mm glucose in the media during the incubation of the cells with CN/2-DG completely abrogated SOK-1 activation (Table I). To determine whether SOK-1 activation was due to ATP depletion, we exposed LLC-PK1 cells to either CN/2-DG or the uncoupling agent, FCCP, plus 2-DG, and determined SOK-1 kinase activity. Although FCCP/2-DG reduced cellular content of ATP to levels comparable to that induced by CN/2-DG (<5% of control), SOK-1 was not activated by FCCP/2-DG (1.0 ± 0.2-fold versus control) but was by CN/2-DG (5.6 ± 0.4-fold versus control). These data indicate that ATP depletion is not sufficient for activation of SOK-1 by chemical anoxia, and suggest that mechanisms in addition to ATP depletion were critical.Table IGlucose abrogates activation of SOK-1 by CN/2-DGControlCN/2-DG(−) Glucose1.06.0 ± 0.4(+) Glucose1.0 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.2Data are -fold activation compared to the (−) Glucose control. LLC-PK1 cells were incubated in KH buffer without (−) or with (+) 10 mm glucose for 15 min prior to addition of vehicle (Control), or 5 mm CN plus 5 mm 2-DG (CN/2-DG) for 40 min. SOK-1 kinase assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With this protocol, ATP levels remain greater than 50% of control. Open table in a new tab Our previous studies indicated that SOK-1 is activated by oxidant stress (9Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored whether ongoing production of reactive oxygen species by the electron transport chain during the period of chemical anoxia might be the mechanism by which SOK-1 was activated. We incubated LLC-PK1 cells, which had been loaded with 7.5 μm DCFH-DA, with CN/2-DG and followed production of ROS for 45 min. In contrast to vehicle treatment (Fig.3 A), beginning at approximately 20 min after CN/2-DG, there was a discernible rise in DCF fluorescence compatible with production of ROS (Fig. 3 B). Fluorescence continued to increase compared with control throughout the remainder of the experiment. Thus, CN/2-DG induced the production of ROS in LLC-PK1 cells, and the time course of ROS production paralleled the time course of SOK-1 activation.Figure 3Effect of CN/2-DG and antioxidant treatments on cellular oxidant stress. Subconfluent LLC-PK1 cells on glass coverslips were loaded with DCFH-DA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After a 2-min recording of base-line fluorescence intensity, cells were exposed to vehicle (A) or CN/2-DG (B). Intensity of DCF fluorescence (excitation 505 and 450 nm; emission > 515 nm) was determined over 45 min. The curve shown is the ratio of fluorescence intensity at excitation 505 nm over intensity at excitation 450 nm. Other LLC-PK1 cells were pretreated with PDTC (100 μm, 120 min) (C) or sodium pyruvate (50 mm, 30 min) (D) before CN/2-DG. In C and D, the abrupt rise in the ratio at approximately 42 min is due to the addition of H2O2 (3 mm). This was done to confirm that the cells could respond to oxidant stress with an increase in the 505/450 ratio.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next determined whether several chemically unrelated agents that react with and thus inactivate ROS inhibited SOK-1 activation by chemical anoxia. We incubated cells with PDTC (100 μm) for 120 min before exposure to CN/2-DG. PDTC is a dithiocarbamate, which functions as an antioxidant by delivering thiol groups directly to the cell (17Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeurle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). PDTC abolished the CN-induced activation of SOK-1 and inhibited the CN/2-DG-induced activation by 70% (Fig.4). An unrelated agent, sodium pyruvate, like other α-ketoacids, reduces H2O2 to H2O while undergoing nonenzymatic decarboxylation at the 1-carbon position (18Nath K.A. Salahudeen A.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F306-F314PubMed Google Scholar, 19Salahudeen A.K. Clark E.C. Nath K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1886-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Pyruvate markedly inhibited SOK-1 activation by CN/2-DG (Fig. 4).Figure 4Antioxidants inhibit the activation of SOK-1 by chemical anoxia. LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to vehicle (CONTROL), CN, CN plus 2-DG (CN, 2-DG), or CN plus 2-DG after pretreatment with PDTC (100 μm, 120 min), or sodium pyruvate (50 mm, 30 min). Also shown is SOK-1 activity after exposure of cells to PDTC or pyruvate alone.

Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), the iron chelator deferoxamine (5 mm) (21Zager R.A. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1989; 257: H1640-H1646PubMed Google Scholar), also inhibited activation of SOK-1 (60%, 55%, and 30% inhibition, respectively) (data not shown).LLC-PK1 cells were also incubated in media containing catalase (300 units/ml), or heat-inactivated catalase (55 ° for 5 min) for 3 h before CN/2-DG (13Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrnas V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2299) Google Scholar, 23Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Channing J.D. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M.

Catalase inhibited activation by 35%, but the heat-inactivated enzyme was ineffective (Table II). These data, taken together, strongly suggest that production of ROS is necessary for the activation of SOK-1 in response to chemical anoxia.Table IIInhibition of CN/2-DG-induced activation of SOK-1 by NDGA and catalaseActivation of SOK-1Inhibition of SOK-1 activation-fold%Control1.0CN/2-DG9.7NDGA; CN/2-DG3.960Catalase; CN/2-DG6.335HI-Catalase; CN/2-DG9.80Cells were exposed to NDGA (20 μm) for 20 min, or catalase (300 units/ml) or heat-inactivated catalase (HI-Catalase) for 3 h prior to CN/2-DG for 40 min and SOK-1 kinase assay. -Fold activation is expressed relative to vehicle-treated cells (Control), and inhibition by the scavenger pretreatments is expressed relative to CN/2-DG-induced activation in the absence of scavengers. Open table in a new tab Oxidant stress and chemical anoxia produce an increase in cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+] i ) in part by releasing Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) storage pools, by increasing Ca2+ influx, and by inhibiting cell membrane Ca2+-ATPase (24Sapirstein A.

Therefore, we examined the role of [Ca2+] i in the activation of SOK-1 by chemical anoxia. When [Ca2+] i was buffered by incubation of cells with BAPTA-AM (75 μm) for 60 min before the addition of CN/2-DG for 40 min, activation of SOK-1 was completely inhibited (Fig. 5 A,top). Incubation of cells with BAPTA-AM alone had no effect on SOK-1 activity. Preincubation of cells with EGTA (2 mm) for 10 min also markedly inhibited activation of SOK-1 by CN/2-DG (Fig.5 A, bottom). This suggests extracellular Ca2+ is important for SOK-1 activation. However, the prolonged (50 min) exposure to extracellular EGTA likely also resulted in some depletion of intracellular stores (29Force T. Hyman G. Hajjar R. Sellmayer A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4295-4302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Force T. Bonventre J.V. Flannery M.R. Gorn A.H. Yamin M. Goldring S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F1110-F1115PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, compromise of membrane integrity by chemical anoxia may have allowed extracellular EGTA to buffer [Ca2+] i and thus to function similarly to BAPTA.Figure 5Role of [Ca2+]i in the activation of SOK-1 by chemical anoxia. A, buffering [Ca2+] i prevents activation of SOK-1 by chemical anoxia. LLC-PK1 cells were exposed to vehicle only (CONTROL), or CN and 2-DG after pretreatment with BAPTA-AM (75 μm, 60 min; BAPTA/CN, 2-DG;top), EGTA (2 mm, 10 min; EGTA/CN, 2-DG; bottom), or vehicle (CN, 2-DG). SOK-1 immune complex kinase assays were performed as above. Preincubation with BAPTA-AM or EGTA inhibited chemical anoxia-induced SOK-1 activation by greater than 90%. B, Ca2+mobilizing agents enhance activation of SOK-1 by chemical anoxia if [Ca2+] i is not buffered. Top, autoradiogram of a representative SOK-1 immune complex kinase assay. LLC-PK1 cells were incubated with vehicle only (−), BAPTA-AM (50 μm, 60 min; BAPTA +), thapsigargin (1 μm, 40 min; TG +), A23187 (2 μm, 10 min; A23187 +), or CN/2-DG (+) after pretreatment with BAPTA, TG, A23187, or A23187 plus EGTA (2 mm). Bottom, quantitation of three separate experiments with Ca2+ mobilizing agents. LLC-PK1 cells were incubated, as above, with vehicle only (CONTROL), CN and 2-DG, thapsigargin, A23187, or CN/2-DG after pretreatment with thapsigargin, A23187, or A23187 plus EGTA. Either of the Ca2+ mobilizing agents markedly enhanced the SOK-1 activation observed with CN plus 2-DG (from 7-fold to approximately 20-fold), unless the increase in [Ca2+] i after A23187 was buffered by simultaneous addition of EGTA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although it is not clear whether intracellular stores, extracellular Ca2+, or both are necessary for the increase in [Ca2+] i , the data clearly suggested that the increase in [Ca2+] i was required for the activation of SOK-1 by chemical anoxia. Therefore, we determined whether the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187 (2 μm), or thapsigargin (1 μm), which releases ER Ca2+stores by selectively inhibiting the ER Ca2+-ATPase, activated SOK-1. Although neither compound alone activated SOK-1, preincubation of cells with either agent markedly enhanced SOK-1 activation by chemical anoxia (Fig. 5 B, top andbottom). If, however, EGTA (2 mm) was included in the preincubation with A23187, thus buffering any increase in [Ca2+] i , activation of SOK-1 by CN/2-DG was completely prevented. These data suggest that an increase in [Ca2+] i markedly amplifies the activation of SOK-1 by chemical anoxia. The increase in [Ca2+] i is necessary but not sufficient for activation of SOK-1. Furthermore, it is the increase in [Ca2+] i and not depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools that is the critical signal for SOK-1 activation, since A23187, which releases intracellular Ca2+ stores, was ineffective when [Ca2+] i was buffered.DISCUSSIONThe Ste20 Family of Protein KinasesEpistasis analyses suggest that Ste20 is upstream of a MAP kinase in a cascade consisting of a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) (Ste11), a MAPKK (Ste7), and two MAP kinases (Kss1 and Fus3) in the pheromone response pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (31Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 32Elion E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 5: 322-327Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33Levin D. Errede B.

This pathway is activated by binding of mating factors to their cognate serpentine receptors, which are linked to heterotrimeric G proteins. Ste20 can also be activated by binding to the small G protein, Cdc42. The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are human homologs of Ste20 and are activated by binding to GTP-loaded Rac and Cdc42Hs via a conserved sequence motif in the N-terminal regulatory domain of the kinases (35Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 36Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Like Ste20, the PAKs are activated by ligands, including thrombin and the chemoattractant, f-Met-Leu-Phe, which bind to receptors linked to heterotrimeric G proteins (38Knaus U. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Downstream targets of the PAKs include the MAP kinases, p38, and the SAPKs (39Zhang S. Han J.

They do, however, share a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with Ste20 and a Ste20-like kinase, Sps1 (42Friesen H. Lunz R. Doyle S. Segall J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2162-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating they too have been conserved throughout evolution. Three members of this group have been demonstrated to activate MAP kinase cascades, suggesting they are equivalent in this respect to the Ste20 proteins and PAKs. Specifically, germinal center kinase, hematopoietic progenitor kinase (HPK1), and Nck-interacting kinase activate the SAPKs via a Rac/Cdc42-independent mechanism (11Hu M.C.T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 43Pombo C. Kehrl J. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L. Woodgett J. Force T. Kyriakis J.

Physiologic activators of this family of Ste20-like kinases are not well described. TNFα activates germinal center kinase (43Pombo C. Kehrl J. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L. Woodgett J. Force T. Kyriakis J. Nature. 1995; 377: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but no other physiologically relevant activators of this group are known and, thus, their role in the cell remains unclear. In yeast, most of the known MAP kinase cascades are not activated by ligand-receptor interactions, but by environmental stresses such as osmolar stress, heat, and nutritional starvation (31Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). We have recently reported the cloning and characterization of a Ste20-like kinase from the germinal center kinase group (9Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This kinase, SOK-1, does not appear to be activated by ligand-receptor interactions, but is activated by oxidant stress and thus appears to be more similar in function to the environmental stress response kinases (9Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).To better define the role that this kinase may play in the response to pathophysiologic processes, we examined whether it was activated by chemical anoxia. We found that SOK-1 was markedly stimulated by chemical anoxia. In distinct contrast to th"

Sugiyama H. Ogawa H. Nakagawa M. Yamagami T. Miwa H. Kita K. Hiraoka A. Masaoka T. Nasu K. Kyo T. Dohy H. Nakauchi H. Ishidate T. Akiyama T. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1994; 84: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).WT1 is strongly expressed in the peripheral blood of many patients with acute leukemia and in the blast-crisis (BC) phase of chronic leukemias but is absent in the chronic phase of chronic leukemias (13Miwa H. Beran M. Saunders G.F. Leukemia. 1992; 6: 405-409PubMed Google Scholar). The average levels of WT1 expression were more than 20 times higher for CD19+/CD20−pro-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia than for CD19+/CD20+ pre-B-intermediate B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, indicating that WT1 expression is associated with immature B phenotypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (11Inoue K. Sugiyama H. Ogawa H. Nakagawa M. Yamagami T. Miwa H. Kita K. Hiraoka A. Masaoka T. Nasu K. Kyo T. Dohy H. Nakauchi H. Ishidate T. Akiyama T. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1994; 84: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), WT1expression levels are clearly associated with the clinical phase, and the levels increase as the clinical phase progresses. This indicates that in CML, WT1 gene expression is also associated with immature leukemic cells. Thus, WT1 may be a new prognostic factor and a new marker for the detection of minimal residual disease in acute leukemia (11Inoue K. Sugiyama H. Ogawa H. Nakagawa M. Yamagami T. Miwa H. Kita K. Hiraoka A. Masaoka T. Nasu K. Kyo T. Dohy H. Nakauchi H. Ishidate T. Akiyama T. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1994; 84: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that theWT1 gene is down-regulated during terminal differentiation of both K562 cells (a human erythroleukemia cell line derived from a patient with BC-CML) and HL60 cells (a human myelocytic leukemia cell line) (14Phelan S.A. Lindberg C. Call K.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 667-686PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sekiya M. Adachi M. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A. Blood. 1994; 83: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that WT1 gene expression is associated with the immature cells from which leukemic cells originate. To understand the regulation of WT1 in hematopoiesis and leukemia, we examined the elements involved in the transcriptional control of the WT1 gene (16Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified three transcription start sites and an essential promoter region of theWT1 gene. The WT1 promoter is a member of the GC-rich, TATA-less, CCAAT-less class of polymerase II promoters (16Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the WT1 promoter is similar to other GC-rich tumor suppressor gene promoters, the WT1 expression pattern is tissue restricted, unlike RB and p53 patterns. However, theWT1 GC-rich promoter functions in all cell lines tested, independent of WT1 expression. This finding suggests that the tissue-specific expression of WT1 is modulated by additional regulatory elements. We previously identified a transcriptional enhancer at the 3′ end of the gene, more than 50 kb downstream of the promoter (16Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 3′-enhancer increases the basal transcription rate of the WT1 promoter in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 but not in the non-hematopoietic cell lines tested. The hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 binds and transactivates the 3′-enhancer (17Wu Y. Fraizer G.C. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5944-5949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a hematopoietic-specific enhancer in the third intron of the WT1 gene. While both GATA-1 and c-Myb could transactivate this intronic enhancer, the previously identified 3′-enhancer lacks c-Myb binding motifs (17Wu Y. Fraizer G.C. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5944-5949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consequently, the two WT1 enhancers functioned differently in hematopoietic cells of various lineages. The intronic enhancer was very active in myelocytic leukemia HL60 cells but only weakly active in erythroleukemia HEL cells. Conversely, the 3′-enhancer is very active in HEL cells but only weakly active in HL60 cells. K562 cells, a human cell line with erythroleukemia characteristics, and derived from a patient with BC-CML (CCL243; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD); HEL cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line (T1B180, ATCC); HL60 cells, a human myelocytic leukemia cell line (CCL240, ATCC); and CEM cells, a human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCL119, ATCC), were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa, a human cervical carcinoma cell line (CCL2, ATCC) and 293 cells, derived from adenovirus 5-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (CRL1573,ATCC) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. II-14 cells (18Hewitt S.M. Fraizer G.C. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17908-17912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a rat mesothelioma cell line, were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/F-12 supplemented with insulin, transferrin, selenium, and hydrocortisone. Saos-2 cells, a human osteosarcoma cell line (HTB85, ATCC), were grown in McCoy's 5a medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The cosmid cB5-2 containing WT1 5′-flanking sequence and the first three introns (16Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI, and the 6.4-, 3.4-, 2.4-, 1.0-, and 1.5-kilobase (kb) fragments were separately inserted into the WT1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct, pCB.7PH (16Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate plasmids pCB.7e6.4, pCB.7e3.4, pCB.7e2.4, pCB.7e1.0, and pCB.7e1.5, respectively (Fig.1 A). The cosmid cB5-2 was also cleaved withBglII, and the resulting 3.0-kb BglII enhancer fragment was cloned into pCB.7PH to generate plasmid pCB.7e3.0 (Fig.1 A). To verify the promoter independence of the 1.5-kb enhancer fragment, the 1.5-kb BamHI fragment from pCB.7e1.5 was also subcloned into pCAT®-Promoter (Promega Corp.), which contains the simian virus (SV40) promoter, to generate pCATp1.5 (Fig. 1 B). To localize the enhancer region within the 1.5-kb fragment, pCATp1.5 was cut with SphI to release a 678-bpSphI fragment, and the remaining plasmid, containing the 833-base pair (bp) SphI/BamHI fragment was religated to generate pCATp833. The 678-bp SphI fragment was gel purified and then subcloned into pCAT®-Promoter to generate pCATp678. Further deletion within the 833-bpSphI/BamHI fragment was performed by partial digestion with HindIII. A 575-bp HindIII fragment was released from pCATp833 to produce a 258-bpHindIII/BamHI fragment that remained in the religated pCAT®-Promoter construct pCATp258. The pCATp258 construct which contains the 258-bp enhancer fragment, was sequenced (Fig. 2).Figure 2Sequence of the 258-bp intronic enhancer ofWT1. Potential transcription factor-binding sites areunderlined. GATA-binding sites are located at bp 108 (A), 207 (B), and 254 (C), and a c-Myb binding site is located 10 bp 3′ of the GATA-A site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 258-bp HindIII/BamHI enhancer fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 258-bp intronic enhancer fragment was PCR amplified using the pCATp258 plasmid as template with the 5′-primer WT1e258A (5′-ATGGATCCAAGCTTTTCCCCGCTCCGTGC-3′), which contains an introducedBamHI site, and the 3′-vector primer CPB (5′-GCATTCTAGTTGTGGTTTGTC-3′); digested with BamHI; and subcloned into pCB.7PH in both orientations to create pCB.7e258+ and pCB.7e258− (Fig. 3). The 258-bp minimal enhancer fragment was also cloned into the BamHI sites of the WT1 104-bp minimal promoter construct pCB.1 (16Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pCB.7e3′ (containing the full-length WT1 promoter and 3′-enhancer) (17Wu Y. Fraizer G.C. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5944-5949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to generate pCB.1e258 and pCB.7e3′eint, respectively. For deletion analysis of the 258-bp enhancer (Fig. 3), the most 5′ 127-bp fragment was generated by PCR amplification using the 258-bp enhancer fragment as template with primers WT1e258A and WT1e258B (5′-GCGGATCCGTTACTAGGCAACCCTATCGC-3′). The most 3′ 154-bp fragment was generated by PCR with the primers WT1e258C (5′-CCGGATCCTGCGATAGGGTTG-3′) and CPB. Both the 127- and 154-bp enhancer fragments were digested with BamHI and subcloned into pCB.7PH separately to generate pCB.7e127 and pCB.7e154, respectively. The 129-bp middle portion of the 258-bp enhancer fragment was generated by PCR with the 258-bp enhancer fragment as template with primers WT1e260D (5′-CTGCGGATCCCTTCAACTTGGGTG-3′) andWT1e260E (5′-CTCGCGGATCCCAGGCCTGCGCTGCTG-3′). The most 3′ 62-bp fragment was generated by PCR with pCB.7e154 as a template with primers WT1:5′E62 (5′-GAGCGCGGATCCTGCGGCCCGGGATTG-3′) andWT1:3′E62 (5′-GACGCGGATCCCCGAGCACCAG-3′). Both the 129- and 62-bp PCR fragments were cut with BamHI and subcloned in pCB.7PH to generate pCB.7e129 and pCB.7e62, respectively. To assess the importance of the GATA sites, the most 5′-GATA motif (GATA-A) (Fig. 2) in the intronic enhancer CAT reporter construct was mutagenized. pCB.7mGATA-Ae258, was generated by two-step PCR amplification using pCATe258 as the template with two pairs of primers: the 5′-WT1e258A primer and the 3′-GATA mutant primer (5′-AGGCAACCCTAAGGCAGACGCGGGCGGCCG-3′) (mutant bases are underlined); and the 5′-GATA mutant primer (5′-CGGCCGCCGCGTCTGCCTTAGGTTGCCT-3′) and 3′-vector primer CPB. The two PCR products generated by the two pairs of primers overlapped, and both contained the mutant GATA-A motif (mGATA-A). We annealed the products and extended them by mutually primed synthesis. This product was then PCR amplified with primersWT1e258A and CPB to generate the full-length intronic enhancer containing mGATA-A, which we then cut with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of pCB.7PH, to create pCB.7mGATA-Ae258. The sequence of each PCR clone was confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). K562 cells were transfected by electroporation using a modification of the protocol of Chu et al. (19Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) adapted for leukemia cells (20Oka T. Rairkar A. Chen J.H. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2077-2083PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106) were electroporated with the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 230 V and 960 microfarads in 200 μl of serum-free medium containing 2.5–5.0 μg of plasmid DNA and seeded into T-25 flasks. As an internal control for transfection efficiency, K562 cells were also cotransfected with 2.5 μg of the expression vector pSV2β-Gal (Promega, Corp., Madison, WI). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity in K562 cells was determined by standard methods (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 309-326Google Scholar). After thin-layer chromatography, the acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was quantitated by measuring the radioactivity with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Aliquots of protein with equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase activity were assayed for CAT activity (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The relative activities from at least three different experiments were averaged. The enhancer constructs were tested for CAT activity in K562 cells as described above. For HL60 cells, 3 × 107 cells were electroporated with 15 μg of DNA at 250 V. For HEL cells, 2 × 107 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of DNA at 230 V. For CEM cells, 2 × 107 cells were electroporated with 15 μg of DNA at 230 V. For HeLa, II-14, and Saos-2 cells, 5–8 × 106 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of DNA at 250 V. For 293 cells 5–8 × 106 cells were electroporated with 25 μg of DNA at 200 V. HeLa and Saos-2 cells were cotransfected as described above, except that increasing amounts of the mouse GATA-1 cDNA expression construct (23Tsai S.-F. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1990; 339: 446-454Crossref Scopus (667) Google Scholar) were added to each transfection of 5.0 μg of CAT reporter DNA. The CAT reporter construct pCB.1e258 contains three potential GATA-binding sites and one c-Myb binding site in the 258-bp intronic enhancer (Fig. 2), but no potential GATA-binding sites in the 104-bp WT1 minimal promoter (16Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA concentrations were held constant by the addition of the empty expression vector DNA (23Tsai S.-F. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1990; 339: 446-454Crossref Scopus (667) Google Scholar). For the c-Myb transactivation experiments, 8.0 μg of either a c-Myb cDNA expression construct or mutant c-Myb cDNA construct (lacking the DNA-binding domain) (24Clarke M.F. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Westin E. Smith M. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) or the empty vector were added to each transfection with 5.0 μg of CAT reporter DNA. Crude nuclear mini-extracts were prepared from exponentially growing K562 cell according to the method of Schreiberet al. (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) as modified by Aggarwal et al., (26Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6.5% glycerol, 90 mmKCl, 0.7 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 4.0 μg of K562 nuclear extract, and 50–100 fmol (>5 × 104 cpm) of the double-stranded probe, GATA-A (5′-CGGCCGCCCGCGTCTGCGATAGGGTTGCCT-3′) or mutant GATA-A (mGATA-A) (5′-CGGCCGCCCGCGTCTGCCTTAGGGTTGCCT-3′). GATA-A or mGATA-A were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The reactions were incubated 15 min at room temperature and then analyzed by electrophoresis at 300 V on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (39:1 acrylamide:N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer (TBE) at 4 °C, dried, and visualized by autoradiography using Hyperfilm-AP (Amersham Corp.). For competition assays, the unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides GATA-A, mGATA-A, and GATA consensus (GATA con) (5′-CACTTGATAACAGAAAGTGATAACTCT-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to each reaction mixture first. After incubation with the K562 nuclear extracts for 15 min at room temperature, the end labeled probe was added and the mixture was incubated an additional 15 min at room temperature and analyzed as described above. For antibody ablation experiments, 0.5 and 1.0 μg of anti-c-Myb rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GATA-1 rat monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GATA-2 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-GATA-3 mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were added before the addition of labeled probe and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After the addition of labeled probe, the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature and analyzed as described above. Nuclei were isolated essentially as described by Levy-Wilson et al.(27Levy-Wilson B. Fortier C. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Suspension cells and confluent monolayers from the K562 and HeLa cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm. The cell pellet was washed in 20 ml of reticulocyte standard buffer (RSB)/sucrose (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by gentle homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer, followed by a low-speed spin as described above. Cells were suspended in 3 volumes of RSB/sucrose/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by the addition of Nonidet P-40 at a final concentration of 0.5% for 5 min on ice. The nuclear pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm. Nuclei were washed once with RSB/sucrose/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and their integrity and purity were checked by light microscopy after they had been stained with trypan blue (0.4%). Intact nuclei were suspended at a DNA concentration of 1 mg/ml in RSB/sucrose/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. DNase I (10 units/μl, Boehringer Mannheim) were added to various final concentrations, and the mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × lysis buffer (0.6 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.5, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). RNase A (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was added at 40 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C, and then proteinase K was added at 100 μg/ml for 4–16 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified by extraction with an equal volume of phenol, phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v), and chloroform, followed by precipitation with isopropyl alcohol at room temperature. The DNA was recovered by centrifugation, washed once with 70% ethanol, and suspended in 100 μl of H2O. Aliquots containing 30 μg of DNA digested as above were digested with bothEcoRI and XbaI. DNA was purified by extraction with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform and chloroform followed by precipitation with ethanol at −20 °C for 2 h. The DNA was recovered by centrifugation, washed once with 70% ethanol, and suspended in 30 μl of TE. Purified DNA were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels, and transferred by vacuum blotter (Bio-Rad) onto Zeta-Probe® GT blotting membranes (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacture's manual. All hybridizations were done according to the manufacture's instruction manual. The probe (EcoRI/SphI fragment, Fig. 9 B) was32P-labeled using the Megaprime DNA labeling system kit (Amersham). The filters were exposed to x-ray film for 1–3 days. The sizes of the hybridizing bands appearing in the autoradiogram were determined by using λ HindIII/EcoRI-digested marker DNA fragments as standards in each gel. Analysis of distant regulatory elements and intragenic enhancers for WT1 have been hampered by the size of theWT1 gene. We therefore focused on two regions often reported to contain regulatory elements: the 3′- and 5′-flanking regions and the first few introns (Fig.1 A). We determined the BamHI and BglII sites in theWT1 genomic sequence in the 5′-flanking region cosmid cB5–2 (Fig. 1 A) and subcloned small BamHI fragments from the cosmid into pCB.7PH, in which the CAT gene is under control of the WT1 promoter. Initially, we identified an enhancer element in the region between the 3′ end of exon 2 and the 5′ end of intron 3 (Fig. 1 A). This 1.5-kb enhancer increased the basal transcription from the WT1 promoter by 5.84-fold in the human BC-CML cell line K562 but not in 293 (a human embryonic kidney cell line) or II-14 (a rat mesothelioma cell line), which also expressed WT1 (Fig. 1 A). This suggested that the activity of the 1.5-kb fragment was hematopoietic specific. We also screened about 10 kb of the 3′-flanking region of WT1 in 293 and II-14 cells but found no enhancer elements (data not shown). To delineate the enhancer region, the 1.5-kb fragment was subcloned into pCAT®-Promoter to generate pCATp1.5, and the deletion constructs derived from it were transfected into K562 cells (Fig.1 B). We found that the 1.5-kb fragment could enhance the activity of the WT1 promoter, but not the SV40 promoter. This lack of activity can be partially explained by the presence of an SV40 repressor in the 5′-enhancer region in pCATp678 (Fig.1 B). Therefore, we examined the 3′-region (in, pCATp833), which had strong enhancer activity (4.54 times to that of the SV40 promoter). Further deletion of the 833-bp fragment showed that the most 3′ 258-bp fragment was sufficient for enhancer activity in K562 cells. When the fragment was transfected into K562 cells, it increased the basal transcription level of the SV40 promoter by 3.29 times and had enhancer activity nearly equivalent to that of the SV40 enhancer (data not shown). The 258-bp enhancer was located in WT1 intron 3, approximately 11 kb downstream of the promoter (Fig. 1 A). Sequence analysis showed that this 258-bp fragment contains many potential binding sites for transcription factors, including Ets-1, GATA, c-Myb, and AP-2 (Fig. 2). It is possible that one or more of these transcription factors facilitate the expression of WT1 in hematopoietic cells. To determine the tissue specificity of the intronic enhancer, the 258-bp enhancer was cloned into pCB.7PH 3′ of the WT1 promoter to generate the construct pCB.7e258. The 258-bp enhancer increased basal transcription of the WT1 promoter in K562, HL60, and HEL cells but not in 293, HeLa, and CEM cells (TableI). This indicates that the 258-bp enhancer was hematopoietic specific. Although the 258-bp fragment functioned in three hematopoietic cell lines (K562, HL60, and HEL), the enhancer had different degrees of activity in each cell line: it increased the basal transcription levels of the WT1 promoter by 8–9-fold in K562 cells, 5–6-fold in HL60 cells, and only 2–3-fold in HEL cells. This suggested the intronic enhancer had the strongest activity in myeloid-lineage uncommitted progenitor cells.Table ICorrelation of GATA-1 expression with the activities of the WT1 enhancersCell lineExpression of1-aReverse transcriptase PCR analysis of RNA from cell lines; yes, PCR products visible by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels; no, PCR products not visible by ethidium bromide staining.Enhancer activity1-bCAT activity of enhancer relative to that of the 652-bpWT1 promoter. ++++, 8–9-fold; +++, 5–6-fold; +, 2–3-fold; +/−, 1.5–2.0-fold; −, <1.5-fold.WT1GATA-1Intronic3′K562YesYes+++++++HELYesYes++++HL6"
https://openalex.org/W2062086746,"We have analyzed the ability of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules to capture proteins in the biosynthetic pathway and whether this may be associated with MHC class II-dependent antigen processing. When coexpressed with HLA-DR 4 molecules in HeLa cells, influenza hemagglutinin was inhibited from folding and trimerization in the biosynthetic pathway, targeted to endosomal compartments, and rapidly degraded. Due to the interaction with MHC class II molecules, therefore, unfolded forms of hemagglutinin were bypassing the quality control mechanism of the secretory pathway. More important, however, the transport, endocytosis, and rapid degradation of unfolded hemagglutinin in the presence of MHC class II molecules suggest that proteins captured in the endoplasmic reticulum by class II molecules may become substrates for antigen processing and presentation to CD4-positive T cells. In insect cells we show that this phenomenon is not restricted to a few proteins such as hemagglutinin. A highly heterogeneous mixture of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum including coexpressed hemagglutinin can form stable complexes with soluble HLA-DR α and β chains that were transported into the supernatant. This mechanism may gain biological significance in abnormal situations associated with accumulation of unfolded or malfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, for example during viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2052421451,"A clone containing the open reading frame of endo-α-d-mannosidase, an enzyme involved in earlyN-linked oligosaccharide processing, has been isolated from a rat liver λgt11 cDNA library. This was accomplished by a strategy that involved purification of the endomannosidase from rat liver Golgi by ligand affinity chromatography (Hiraizumi, S., Spohr, U., and Spiro, R. G. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 4697–4700) and preparative electrophoresis, followed by sequence determinations of tryptic peptides. Using degenerate primers based on these sequences, the polymerase chain reaction with rat liver cDNA as a template yielded a 470-base pair product suitable for library screening as well as Northern blot hybridization. EcoRI digestion of the purified λ DNA released a 5.4-kilobase fragment that was amplified in Bluescript II SK(−) vector. Sequence analysis indicated that the deduced open reading frame of the endomannosidase extended from nucleotides 89 to 1441, encoding a protein of 451 amino acids and corresponding to a molecular mass of 52 kDa. Data base searches revealed no homology with any other known protein. When a vector coding for this protein fused to an NH2-terminal peptide containing a polyhistidine region was introduced intoEscherichia coli, high levels of the enzyme were expressed upon induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Purification of the endomannosidase to electrophoretic homogeneity fromE. coli lysates was accomplished by Ni2+-chelate and Glcα1→3Man-O-(CH2)8CONH-Affi-Gel ligand chromatographies. Polyclonal antibodies raised against this protein reacted with Golgi endomannosidase. By both immunoblotting and silver staining, the purified E. coli-expressed enzyme was approximately 8 kDa smaller than anticipated from the open reading frame; timed induction studies indicated that this was due to scission of the enzyme's COOH-terminal end by host cell proteases. All rat tissues examined demonstrated mRNA levels (4.9-kilobase message) for the endomannosidase that correlated well with their enzyme activity. A clone containing the open reading frame of endo-α-d-mannosidase, an enzyme involved in earlyN-linked oligosaccharide processing, has been isolated from a rat liver λgt11 cDNA library. This was accomplished by a strategy that involved purification of the endomannosidase from rat liver Golgi by ligand affinity chromatography (Hiraizumi, S., Spohr, U., and Spiro, R. G. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 4697–4700) and preparative electrophoresis, followed by sequence determinations of tryptic peptides. Using degenerate primers based on these sequences, the polymerase chain reaction with rat liver cDNA as a template yielded a 470-base pair product suitable for library screening as well as Northern blot hybridization. EcoRI digestion of the purified λ DNA released a 5.4-kilobase fragment that was amplified in Bluescript II SK(−) vector. Sequence analysis indicated that the deduced open reading frame of the endomannosidase extended from nucleotides 89 to 1441, encoding a protein of 451 amino acids and corresponding to a molecular mass of 52 kDa. Data base searches revealed no homology with any other known protein. When a vector coding for this protein fused to an NH2-terminal peptide containing a polyhistidine region was introduced intoEscherichia coli, high levels of the enzyme were expressed upon induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Purification of the endomannosidase to electrophoretic homogeneity fromE. coli lysates was accomplished by Ni2+-chelate and Glcα1→3Man-O-(CH2)8CONH-Affi-Gel ligand chromatographies. Polyclonal antibodies raised against this protein reacted with Golgi endomannosidase. By both immunoblotting and silver staining, the purified E. coli-expressed enzyme was approximately 8 kDa smaller than anticipated from the open reading frame; timed induction studies indicated that this was due to scission of the enzyme's COOH-terminal end by host cell proteases. All rat tissues examined demonstrated mRNA levels (4.9-kilobase message) for the endomannosidase that correlated well with their enzyme activity. Endo-α-d-mannosidase is unique among the processing enzymes involved in trimming newly attached N-linked glucosylated polymannose oligosaccharides in that it cleaves internally to release a Glcα1→3Man disaccharide rather than excising single terminal sugar residues (1Lubas W.A. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3775-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lubas W.A. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3990-3998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since this enzyme also has the capacity to remove tri- and diglucosylated mannose (Glc3Man and Glc2Man) from nascent carbohydrate units, it provides an alternate processing pathway that can circumvent glucosidase blockades imposed by inhibitors or enzyme deficiencies and thereby make possible the continued synthesis of complexN-linked oligosaccharides (3Moore S.E.H.

In a previous report from this laboratory (6Hiraizumi S. Spohr U. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4697-4700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purification of the endomannosidase from rat liver Golgi membranes was achieved by affinity chromatography on a Glc-Man-Affi-Gel 1The abbreviations used are: Glc-Man-Affi-Gel, Glcα1→3Man-O-(CH2)8CONH-Affi-Gel; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; CST, castanospermine; DMJ, 1-deoxymannojirimycin; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). column and yielded a preparation that upon examination by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two protein bands (molecular mass, 60 and 56 kDa) present in approximately equal amounts. Since the larger of the these two components has now been identified as the molecular chaperone, calreticulin, which like the endomannosidase has a high affinity for monoglucosylated polymannose oligosaccharides, it was presumed that the 56-kDa protein represents the enzyme (7Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V Söling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Indeed, the purification achieved by the ligand affinity chromatography gave us the opportunity in the present investigation to isolate the endomannosidase and, from the amino acid sequences of several of its trypsin-generated peptides, synthesize primers for the preparation of a probe to screen a rat liver cDNA library. A clone isolated in this manner encompassed the unique open reading frame of the enzyme and permitted the formation of a vector for transfection ofEscherichia coli. High endomannosidase levels were induced in these cells so that the protein carrying this activity could be isolated to electrophoretic purity. This permitted the generation of antibodies which reacted with the rat liver Golgi enzyme and provided a tool for future explorations of its biological function and subcellular distribution. Endomannosidase was isolated from rat liver Golgi membranes by affinity chromatography on Glc-Man-Affi-Gel as described previously (6Hiraizumi S. Spohr U. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4697-4700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme preparation was submitted to 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS and then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for 6 h (60 V) at 4 °C in 10 mm CAPS, pH 10.6, buffer in a manner previously described (7Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V Söling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). After visualization of the two protein bands by a brief exposure to 0.1% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid, the 56-kDa component was excised, washed with water, and sent frozen to the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility. Under the direction of William S. Lane, solid phase trypsin digestion was carried out, followed by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography of the resulting peptides. Several of the latter were then selected for amino acid sequencing by automated Edman degradation (8Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Degenerate primers (9Compton T. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, NY1990: 39-45Google Scholar) based on the amino acid sequences for three peptides from the affinity purified endomannosidase were synthesized by the Midland Certified Reagent Co. and were used for PCR with rat liver cDNA as a template (CLONTECH, oligo(dt) primed mRNA from 10–12-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats). The reactions were performed in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.3, buffer containing 0.2 mm mixed deoxynucleotides, 2 mm MgCl2, 300 pmol of each primer, 1 ng of cDNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with a Techne Thermal Cycler. Cycles were carried out as follows: 3 min at 72 °C, 45 s at 94 °C, and 2 min at 46 °C; these were repeated 35 times with an 8-min extension at 72 °C following the final cycle. Products were ligated into a pCR-II vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) for amplification in E. coli TOP10F′ cells (Invitrogen). After purification of plasmids on tip-500 columns (Qiagen), sequencing of the inserts utilized primers intrinsic to the vector (SP6, M13F, M13R, T7, and T3). For isolation of the insert containing the sequence for all three peptides (EM1, Fig. 1), the plasmids were cleaved withEcoRI (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by electrophoresis on low-melt agarose gel (Bio-Rad). Recovery of the EM1 from the gel was accomplished by digestion with β-agarase (Calbiochem) at 45 °C followed by precipitation of the DNA with ethanol. The size of the electrophoresed DNA fragments was assessed with 123-bp and 1-kb ladders (Life Technologies, Inc.). A λgt11 cDNA library prepared from adult male Sprague-Dawley rat liver by oligo(dt) and random priming was obtained from CLONTECH(5′-Stretch Plus) and screened with the PCR-generated probe EM1 after radiolabeling with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) using the Megaprime Labeling Kit (Amersham Corp.). Host cells (strain Y1090r−, CLONTECH) and phage were grown on 150-mm plates; nitrocellulose filters were prehybridized in 50% formamide in 5 × Denhardt's solution containing 5 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA and hybridized in the same solution for 20 h at 42 °C. Filters were washed at room temperature three times in 2 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS, followed by washes in 0.2 SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 50 °C, 1 h at 55 °C, and 30 min at 60 °C. A total of four rounds of screening were performed before selecting a single positive plaque. After amplification of the clone, purification of the λ DNA was accomplished with Wizard Lambda columns (Promega). Purified λ DNA containing the endomannosidase sequences was digested withEcoRI (Life Technologies, Inc.), as was the phagemid, pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene); the latter was also digested with alkaline phosphatase. After electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose, the 5.4-kb DNA fragment representing EM2 was eluted from the appropriate gel segment by maceration in buffer, followed by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min through a 1-ml Aerosol Block tip (Marsh). Ligation of EM2 into the vector was performed overnight at 14 °C using T4 ligase (Invitrogen). Transfection of XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene) for subcloning was accomplished by the 42 °C heat-shock technique (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.74-1.84Google Scholar). Transformants were grown in SOC medium (20 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, and 20 mm glucose) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to spreading on agar plates that were prepared in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and precoated with IPTG plus 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. After overnight growth at 37 °C, white colonies were selected for streaking on fresh plates. From the second set of plates, several white colonies were chosen for growth overnight at 30 °C in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmids purified using the Plasmid Mini kit (Qiagen) and digested with EcoRI were found to contain the 5.4-kb insert. Sequencing was carried out using the automated fluorescent dye terminator technique (Perkin-Elmer ABI model 373) by the DNA core of the Joslin Diabetes Center. The primers utilized in this procedure, in addition to those representing sequences present in the several vectors (SP6, T3, T7, M13F, and M13R), were initially based on the endomannosidase peptides 1, 2, and 3 (Table I). Subsequent primers (Table II) were based on the DNA sequences determined for the PCR product, EM1, as well as for clone EM2 (Fig. 1) and were synthesized by the DNA core of the Joslin Diabetes Center.Table ISequence of trypsin peptides from rat liver Golgi endomannosidasePeptide1-aPeptides are designated by the order of their HPLC elution which coincided with their relative position in the peptide chain.Sequence1-bThe amino acid symbols given in parentheses represented probable amino acids; the nucleotide sequence confirmed the presence of all except the (L) at position 387 which proved to be serine.Position in protein1-cSee Fig. 2 for the numbering of the amino acid sequence.P-1YGNHPAFYR234–242P-2TWANLLTPSGSQXVR266–280P-3YYEVGL(S)AALQTQP(S)LI(L)IT370–3891-a Peptides are designated by the order of their HPLC elution which coincided with their relative position in the peptide chain.1-b The amino acid symbols given in parentheses represented probable amino acids; the nucleotide sequence confirmed the presence of all except the (L) at position 387 which proved to be serine.1-c See Fig. 2 for the numbering of the amino acid sequence.

Open table in a new tab Northern blotting was performed with a rat Multiple Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) representing 2 μg of purified poly(A) RNA from each of several rat tissues, using the PCR-generated probe, EM1 (Fig. 1), after radiolabeling with [32P]dCTP by the Megaprime labeling system (Amersham Corp.). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 68 °C for 30 and 90 min, respectively, utilizing ExpHyb buffer (CLONTECH). The blots were washed for 40 min at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS, followed by two 50 °C rinses in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS prior to exposure to X-Omat AR film (Kodak) at −80 °C. The components visualized by autoradiography were quantitated by scanning with a laser densitometer (model 300A, Molecular Dynamics). To produce theE. coli endomannosidase as a fusion protein containing in its NH2-terminal region a polyhistidine tag suitable for nickel-affinity purification, as well as an enterokinase susceptible cleavage sequence, the pTrcHisB vector (Invitrogen), which contains the trp-lac promoter (11Amann E. Brosius J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst .). 1983; 25: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), was chosen and appropriate PCR primers designed. The 5′ primer contained the nucleotide sequence of EM2 (Fig. 1) from positions 78–96 (CCAGGAAAAACATGGGAGC), which included the first in-frame ATG; additionally, the sequence GGATC was added to the 5′ end to permit digestion with BamHI (Fig. 1). The antisense primer (ACAGTAGCAAGCACACATTG) was complementary to positions 1540 to 1521 of EM2. The template for PCR treatment was the pBluescript II plasmid pEM2 (160 ng) containing the 5.4-kb insert; the reaction volume was 100 μl and contained 50 mm Tris chloride, pH 9.2, 16 mm NH2SO4, 1.75 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 1 μmeach primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). All of the 27 cycles involved 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR II vector of the TA Cloning System (Invitrogen) and its identity confirmed by sequencing. After release of the insert by digestion of the TA plasmid withBamHI and EcoRI, ligation was carried with the similarly cleaved pTrcHisB vector to produce pTrcHisEM (Fig. 1) which was used to transform the competent E. coli strains TOP10F′ and JM109 (Invitrogen) using the heat-shock procedure (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.74-1.84Google Scholar). Similar transformations of the E. coli with the pTrcHisB vector itself were also performed to serve as controls. These transformed cells were streaked on ampicillin-containing plates, and colonies were selected for growth in SOB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The kinetics of expression were determined from a time course after initiation of induction. Cells were grown in SOB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm. After addition of IPTG to a concentration of 1 mm, the cells were shaken vigorously at 27 or 37 °C, and samples were taken at various times. For determination of endomannosidase activity, cell pellets suspended in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.8, with 500 mm NaCl were submitted to 4 × 10-s bursts of a Branson sonifier (setting 1) followed by four cycles of freeze-thawing; subsequent to centrifugation (4,000 × g for 30 min) aliquots of the supernatants were assayed for enzyme activity. Large scale (250–500 ml) preparations of JM109 or Top10F′ cells containing the pTrcHisEM vector were grown in SOB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin as above and induced with 1 mm IPTG. After centrifugation to recover the cells, extraction medium (20 mm phosphate, pH 7.8 containing 500 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added, using 1 ml for each 10 ml of the cell culture which represented approximately 6 mg of protein. The suspended cells were then disrupted at 4 °C in 5-ml portions with 4 × 10-s bursts of a Branson sonifier (setting 1) and then subjected to four cycles of freeze-thawing (ethanol/dry ice followed by 37 °C water); this was followed by a 15-min room temperature digestion with DNase (10 μg/ml) in the presence of 1 mmmagnesium acetate. After centrifugation (20,000 × gfor 20 min) the lysates contained approximately 30% of the total cellular protein and 80% of the endomannosidase activity. For purification of the polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein, nickel-affinity chromatography was carried out at a room temperature on a column (1 × 13 cm) of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), equilibrated with the extraction medium. The lysate from 250 to 500 ml of cell culture, after concentration (Centriprep 30, Amicon) to 12 ml, was applied to the column in 4-ml aliquots, each of which was allowed to equilibrate for 20 min. The column was then washed with extraction medium and subsequently was eluted with this medium containing 20 mmimidazole. The chromatography was carried out at room temperature, and aliquots were taken for endomannosidase assay and electrophoretic examination. The tubes containing the enzyme were pooled for further purification by Glc-Man-Affi-Gel affinity chromatography. After concentration, the Ni-NTA column enzyme pool was applied to Glc-Man-Affi-Gel at 2 °C in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm CST, and protease inhibitors as described previously (6Hiraizumi S. Spohr U. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4697-4700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a wash with the buffer containing 1 m NaCl, the enzyme was eluted with 0.1 m glycine HCl buffer, pH 3.0 (purified by filtration using a Centriprep-30 membrane), containing 0.1% Triton and 1 m NaCl (6Hiraizumi S. Spohr U. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4697-4700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while 4-ml fractions were collected; these acidic fractions were immediately neutralized by the addition of solid NaMES. For evaluation of the NH2-terminal region of the fusion protein the purified endomannosidase was digested with 1 unit of recombinant enterokinase (Novagen) at 25 °C for 16 h prior to examination by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antiserum against peptide 2 (Table I), synthesized by the Joslin Diabetes Center Peptide Laboratory employing the Applied Biosystem Model 430A synthesizer and subsequently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through an NH2-terminal cysteine (12Green N. Alexander H. Olson A. Alexander S. Shinnick T.M. Sutcliffe J.G. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), was prepared in a New Zealand White rabbit with a program of multiple intradermal injections. Polyclonal antibodies of highly purified endomannoside from transfected JM109 E. coli lysates were prepared in rabbits by intradermal injection of the enzyme (204 μg of protein) followed by two booster doses of 68 μg each of this protein. Electrophoretic analysis of E. colilysates and column fractions was performed by the procedure of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on 10% gels (1.5 mm thick); protein bands were visualized by silver staining (14Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). For immunological identification, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 60 V for 5 h at 2 °C (15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The membranes, after staining with 0.2% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid and destaining in water, were blocked by treatment with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris chloride, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl). Interaction of the antiserum against peptide 2 with the nitrocellulose sheet was followed by treatment with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) and SuperSignal substrate (Pierce); detection was accomplished by chemiluminescence on X-Omatic AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For the visualization of the components that reacted with the polyclonal antibodies against the intact endomannosidase, a procedure utilizing 125I-labeled protein A followed by autoradiography was employed as described previously (16Mohan P.S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4328-4336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For enzyme analysis of tissues from male rats (200 g, CD strain, Taconic, Inc.), homogenization was carried out in 4 volumes of 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.5, with a Polytron for three 10-s bursts at setting 5. Postnuclear supernatants (800 × g for 10 min) of the homogenates were then centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g to obtain membrane pellets which, after a wash with the homogenizing buffer, were suspended in the same buffer at a protein concentration of about 18 mg/ml. Endomannosidase activity of the postnuclear membranes of the rat tissues as well as of E. coli lysates and column fractions was determined by incubations with 14C-labeled Glc1Man9GlcNAc substrate (10,000 dpm) in the presence of CST (1 mm) and DMJ (2 mm) in 60 μl of 0.1 m NaMES buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.2% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 2 h in a manner similar to that previously described (1Lubas W.A. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3775-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The released disaccharide (Glcα1→3Man) was separated from the oligosaccharide substrate by thin layer chromatography of the desalted and deproteinized samples on plastic sheets precoated with cellulose (0.1-mm thickness, Merck) in pyridine/ethyl acetate/water/acetic acid, 5:5:3:1. The radioactive components were detected by fluorography and quantitated after elution with water as previously reported (1Lubas W.A. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3775-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of endomannosidase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the release of 1,000 dpm of Glcα1→3Man per h. Protein was determined by the dye-binding technique (17Bradford M.M. Anal.

Also in parallel with the increasing MICs for the particular antibiotic used in the selection was the gradual accumulation of an unusual muropeptide in the peptidoglycan of the mutants, muropeptide 12, which is a minor component of the cell wall of the parental strain. Analysis of muropeptide 12, its peptide derivative, and its lysostaphin degradation products by high pressure liquid chromatography, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry suggests that muropeptide 12 is a dimer in which the two monomeric components are interlinked by two pentaglycyl cross-bridges, thus generating a 14-member macrocyclic ring structure. This unusual cross-linked structure may be the product of the abnormal activity of penicillin-binding protein 2 which has grossly reduced antibiotic binding capacity in the mutant staphylococci.

This unusual cross-linked structure may be the product of the abnormal activity of penicillin-binding protein 2 which has grossly reduced antibiotic binding capacity in the mutant staphylococci. The staphylococcal peptidoglycan is the product of the cooperative activity of a number of proteins including the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; rpHPLC, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry; PSD, post-source decay.1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; rpHPLC, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry; PSD, post-source decay. While transpeptidase activity of the four better-studied staphylococcal PBPs have been implied from the properties of staphylococcal mutants, the specific contribution of individual PBPs to the system of covalent bonds cross-linking the more than 30 muropeptide components of the staphylococcal peptidoglycan are not known. In an attempt to assign such catalytic roles for staphylococcal PBPs, we used a number of β-lactam antibiotics with relatively selective affinity for the different staphylococcal PBPs to isolate resistant mutants with selective involvement of the particular target PBP. In this article we describe the cell wall peptidoglycan composition and some related physiological properties of a set of cefotaxime-resistant and methicillin-resistant mutants. We describe the accumulation of an unusually structured muropeptide dimer in the peptidoglycan of the mutants, muropeptide 12, in which the two monomeric subcomponents appear to be interlinked by a macrocyclic peptide composed of two oligoglycine bridges. This abnormal muropeptide may be the product of a functional abnormality of PBP2 which has grossly reduced antibiotic binding capacities in the mutants.DISCUSSIONThe most interesting finding emerging from the analysis of the peptidoglycans of cefotaxime- and methicillin-resistant laboratory mutants was the gradual increase in a single muropeptide component, muropeptide 12, in each one of the mutants examined in parallel with the increase in MIC values for the selective antibiotic. This was particularly striking in the methicillin-resistant mutant M250 in which the ratio of muropeptide 12 to muropeptide 11 (the major penta-tetra dimer of the parental staphylococci) changed from 0.26 in the parental strain to 3.01 in the mutant. In the peptidoglycan of M250, muropeptide 12 represented as much as 8.5% of all muropeptide components. The relationship between the abnormal physiological properties of the resistant mutants (e.g. increased rates of wall turnover and autolysis) and the changes in the relative proportion of muropeptide components other than muropeptide 12 (see Fig. 2) are not clear at the present time.Because of these observations, our effort was concentrated on the determination of the structure of muropeptide 12. We would like to recapitulate the critical findings (obtained by a combination of chemical analysis, Edman degradation, determination of molecular sizes by mass spectrometry, and MALDI-PSD analysis of the purified muropeptide 12 or its enzymatic degradation products) and arguments that led us to propose a unique macrocyclic cross-link structure for this unusual muropeptide dimer.Elution of muropeptide 12 from the HPLC column occurred in the dimer region (retention time 66.5 min) and amino acid analysis of muropeptide 12 in combination with mass spectrometry indicated that muropeptide 12 was closely related to the structure of the major penta-tetra dimer of the peptidoglycan (muropeptide 11) except for a deficit of 89 molecular mass units. Out of this deficit, the loss of 71 mass units was accounted for by the loss of one alanine residue confirmed by amino acid analysis of muropeptides 12 and 11, leaving a deficit of 18 molecular mass units which corresponds to the molecular mass of water.We considered two alternative structures for muropeptide 12. In the tentative structure 1 (see Fig. 4), we assigned the deficit in one alanine residue to the loss of a d-alanine from the carboxyl terminus of a dimer analogous in structure to muropeptide 11. The loss of water (18 molecular mass units) was assigned to an anhydro bond that was assumed to form between the 1 and 6 carbons of one of the two muramic acid residues. While such anhydromuramyl components have not been reported in Gram-positive bacteria, such structures are frequent in the cell walls of Escherichia coli (9Holtje J.V. Mirelman D. Sharon N. Schwarz U. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A variety of attempts to test the validity of tentative structure 1 were not supportive. Instead, all analysis produced a significant body of evidence supporting the alternative structure 2 for muropeptide 12. The novel cyclic structure explains the loss of an alanine residue as well as the deficit in 1 mol of water which was attributed to the formation of an unusual second oligoglycine cross-bridge between the two monomeric subcomponents of muropeptide 12, thus generating an unusual macrocyclic ring structure (see Fig. 4). The critical experimental results favoring structure 2 were as follows.While both structures 1 and 2 have the same molecular weight of 2324, upon sodium borohydride reduction the anhydro structure would only have one reducing end while the proposed cyclic structure has two. Consequently, the reduced forms would differ from one another in two molecular mass units: the anhydro structure would have a deficit of 91 molecular mass units (as compared with muropeptide 11) instead of the deficit of 89 as determined by the MALDI analysis and consistent with the proposed structure 2 (Fig. 4 B). On the other hand, the MALDI-PSD data strongly supported structure 2: the fragmentation product expected for anhydromuramic acid were not detected; neither was there a detectable loss of glycine residues that one would expect to find if muropeptide 12 contained a free pentaglycine bridge.Further evidence against structure 1 was obtained through MALDI-MS analysis of muropeptide 12 (Fig. 3 A): again there was no evidence for the spontaneous loss of glycine residues expected for a free pentaglycine bridge (and experimentally confirmed for the cases of muropeptides 5 and 11) 2N. Xu and D. A. Gage, personal communication. (Fig.3 B). The MALDI-MS analysis only produced prompt fragments indicating loss of GlcNAc groups consistent with the absence of a free pentaglycine bridge in the molecule.Muropeptide 12 was digested with recombinant lysostaphin, a glycylglycine endopeptidase (10Schindler C.A. Schuhardt V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 11Schindler C.A. Schuhardt V.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 97: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MALDI analysis of the lysostaphin digests detected only products that were consistent with structure 2 but not structure 1 (Fig. 6 and Table III). One of the striking observations from the MALDI spectrum was the complete symmetry of the digestion products which was in sharp contrast with the asymmetry observed when lysostaphin degradation products of muropeptide 11 were analyzed. In the latter, the presence of the d-alanyl-d-alanine moiety in one of the two monomeric components are responsible for the asymmetry of the spectrum. Clearly this was not the case for muropeptide 12.While the experimental data rigorously exclude structure 1 for muropeptide 12, the presence of a macrocyclic ring structure, as proposed in the alternative structural assignment, was quite unusual. For this reason attempts were made to obtain additional evidence for the proposed structure 2.To do this, we prepared an enzymatic degradation product of muropeptide 12 by the use of an amidase enzyme. The peptidoglycan of mutant M250 was used as a source of such a stem peptide 12. HPLC analysis indicated that this procedure yielded stem peptide 12 with only negligible contamination by stem peptide 11 (Fig. 8). Amino acid analysis confirmed the relationship between muropeptide 12 and stem peptide 12. Analysis by Edman degradation gave results that were consistent with structure 2: 2 mol of alanine were produced in the first cycle of degradation but there were no detectable glycine residues produced even after five consecutive cycles of Edman degradation. Also, a final MALDI experiment of the stem peptide 12 (Fig. 10) produced results that confirmed structure 2.These results together provide strong evidence for the proposed structure of muropeptide 12. The unique feature of the proposed structure is that both monomeric components of muropeptide 12 are assumed to have served as donors as well as acceptors in two consecutive transpeptidase reactions. Cefotaxime- and methicillin-resistant mutants contain PBP 2 of reduced β-lactam affinity (data not shown), and muropeptide 12 may be the product of an abnormal catalytic activity by this PBP. The accumulation of such an abnormal dimer in the peptidoglycan may be responsible for the increased cell wall turnover and autolytic rates and may also explain the decrease in the cross-linked oligomeric muropeptides in the cell walls of the mutant bacteria since the structure proposed for muropeptide 12 would represent a “dead end” for further oligomerization of muropeptides. A tentative scheme for the generation of this structure through the proposed abnormal catalytic activity of a transpeptidase is depicted in Fig. 11. The staphylococcal peptidoglycan is the product of the cooperative activity of a number of proteins including the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; rpHPLC, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry; PSD, post-source decay.1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; rpHPLC, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry; PSD, post-source decay.

In the present study, we determined the effect of protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (PSSG), formed at Cys-131 in bovine αA-crystallin, and Cys-131 and Cys-142 in human αA-crystallin, on the function of α-crystallin as a molecular chaperone. After incubation of calf and young human αL-crystallin fractions with oxidized glutathione, levels of PSSG were determined by performic acid oxidation of the mixed disulfides followed by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography separation of phenylisothiocyanate-derivatized glutathione sulfonic acid. Levels of PSSG increased from 0.01 to 0.14 nmol/nmol (20 kDa) in bovine αL-crystallin and from 0.022 to 0.25 nmol/nmol in human αL-crystallin. The presence of glutathione adducts at Cys-131 and Cys-142 were confirmed by mass spectral analysis. The chaperone-like activity was determined by the heat denaturation assay using βL-crystallin as the target protein. To examine the reversibility of the effect of mixed disulfides on chaperone activity, studies were done before and after reduction with the glutathione reductase system. Increased levels of PSSG resulted in lower chaperone activities. Treatment with the glutathione reductase system led to 80% reduction in PSSG levels with a concomitant recovery of the chaperone activity. These results suggest that cysteine(s) in the αA-crystallin subunit play an important role in the function of α-crystallin as a molecular chaperone.

It comprises two homologous subunits, αA and αB, with a molecular mass of 20 kDa each. Native α-crystallin exists as an oligomer with a molecular mass in the 360–800 kDa range. Historically, it was thought to be lens-specific, playing a structural role in maintaining transparency and thus facilitating light transmission to the retina. The idea that α-crystallin is purely lens-specific, playing only a structural role in the lens is no longer tenable. α-Crystallin, especially the αB subunit, is known to be widely expressed in other tissues, such as heart, kidney, placenta, lungs, and skeletal muscle (1Bhat S.P.

Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K.H. Goldman J.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), multiple sclerosis (7van Noort J.M. van Sechel A.C. Bajramovic J.J.

Mayer R.J. Lancet. 1990; 336: 515-516Abstract PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The natural occurrence of α-crystallin in various cell types and its increased expression in neurological diseases and other stress conditions like heat stress (9Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and hypertonic stress (10Dasgupta S. Hohman T.C. Carper D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) suggest an important functional role besides a structural role. Ingolia and Craig discovered sequence similarities between small heat shock proteins (hsp) of Drosophila and α-crystallins (11Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Based on this sequence homology both αA- and αB-crystallins are considered members of the hsp family. αB-Crystallin and hsp 27 can be induced in cell lines under stress conditions such as heat shock, oxidative stress, and exposure to transition metals (12Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4127-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Arrigo A.P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). One of the functions of a heat shock protein is to act as molecular chaperone, binding to partially denatured proteins preventing further denaturation and/or facilitating refolding of proteins to their native state. α-Crystallin has been shown to have such a chaperone-like function and is known to form a stable complex with denatured or partially unfolded proteins, preventing further aggregation (14Horwitz J.

During aging and cataractogenesis of the lens, both subunits of α-crystallin undergo extensive post-translational modifications such as deamidation (18Groenen P.J.T.A. van Dongen M.J. Voorter C.E.M.

The ocular lens is under constant oxidative stress. In most types of cataracts, the common factor appears to be depletion of glutathione (GSH 1The abbreviations used are: GSH, glutathione; PSSG, protein-glutathione mixed disulfides; GSSG, oxidized glutathione, PSSC, protein-cysteine mixed disulfides; GR, glutathione reductase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PITC, phenylisothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: GSH, glutathione; PSSG, protein-glutathione mixed disulfides; GSSG, oxidized glutathione, PSSC, protein-cysteine mixed disulfides; GR, glutathione reductase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PITC, phenylisothiocyanate.), presumably through the formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), which in turn forms protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (PSSG) (23Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Garadi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Dickerson Jr., J.E. Lou M.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Eye Res. 1992; 55: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a precursor of protein disulfides. PSSG and protein-cysteine mixed disulfides (PSSC) are two major forms of protein-bound thiols in human lenses (24Dickerson Jr., J.E. Lou M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Horwitz first reported the molecular chaperone-like function of α-crystallin (14Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). The chaperone function of α-crystallin has been shown to decline with aging in human lenses (28Cherian M. Abraham E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 208: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, determining the factors that lead to its dysfunction as a chaperone is important in understanding the age-related changes causing opacification of the lens. The central focus of this communication is the formation of mixed disulfide between α-crystallin and oxidized glutathione, and the effect of mixed disulfides on chaperone activity of α-crystallin. Preliminary studies have shown that incubation of bovine α-crystallin with GSSG leads to a significant decrease in the chaperone-like activity (28Cherian M. Abraham E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 208: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, it is not certain whether protein-glutathione mixed disulfides are the true cause of this decrease. This investigation shows that incubation with GSSG causes mixed disulfides to form at Cys-131 of bovine αA-crystallin and at both Cys-131 and Cys-142 of human αA-crystallin. Additionally, we show that the chaperone activity can be recovered by reducing the mixed disulfides with glutathione reductase (GR). Freshly collected calf lenses were obtained from a local abattoir. Human lenses from the Eye Bank of the Medical College of Georgia were pooled from 12–20-year-olds. Calf and human lenses were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, 50 mmNaHSO3, 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant water-soluble fractions were collected. About 30 mg of the soluble protein was resolved by preparative Sephacryl S-300-HR chromatography on a 100 × 1.5-cm column. The purity of calf and human crystallin fractions used in this study was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The αL-crystallin fraction from calf lenses or 12–20-year-old human lenses (5 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris buffer, 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 containing 0.02% NaN3 was sterile filtered through 0.2 μm filters (Gelman Sciences) and incubated for 24 h with 25 mm GSSG. After incubation, analysis of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis did not reveal any degradation during incubation. To reduce the PSSG formed during the GSSG incubations, half of the incubation mixtures from both bovine and human αL-crystallins were further incubated for 90 min with 10 units/ml of GR and 2 mm NADPH. Part of the old (60–70 years) human αL-crystallin (10 mg/2 ml) was also subjected to treatment with GR and NADPH. The procedure of Kumari et al. (30Kumari K. Khanna P. Ansari N.H. Srivastava S.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with minor modifications was used to determine protein-glutathione mixed disulfides. About 10 mg of the calf or human αL-crystallin were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed thoroughly in 5% trichloroacetic acid, methanol:ether, 1:1 and oxidized with performic acid, which releases glutathione as glutathione sulfonic acid. The sulfonic acid was derivatized by PITC. The phenylthiocarbamyl derivative was separated by HPLC on a phenomenex reversed-phase ODS 2 Sphereclone; 3 μ poresize; 100 × 4.6-mm column. The column was equilibrated in a developer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.05% triethylamine (v/v), 0.5% acetonitrile (v/v), with pH adjusted to 6.6 with acetic acid. After applying the sample, the column was developed isocratically with the same developer. Using glutathione sulfonic acid standard, concentrations of glutathione sulfonic acid were calculated from the recorded peak areas and expressed per nmol of 20-kDa α-crystallin. The molecular weights of the α-crystallins were determined using an on-line reversed-phase microbore column (5-cm × 1.0-mm inner diameter Vydac C-4, 300 A) attached to an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Micromass Platform II Quadrupole, Manchester, UK). The sample, 20 μl of the incubation mixture, was injected into the column at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. A post-column splitter directed 5 μl/min to the mass spectrometer and 45 μl/min to a UV monitor and fraction collector. A linear gradient of 35–60% acetonitrile in water, with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, over 25 min separated the αA- and αB-crystallins. MassLynx software was used to calculate the molecular weights of the proteins from the multiple charged peaks of the electrospray ionization mass spectrometry spectrum. Chaperone-like activity of αL-crystallin was determined by performing heat denaturation studies according to Horwitz (14Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). The ability of the unmodified or modified human or bovine α-crystallin preparation to protect calf βL-crystallin (used as the target protein) from heat-induced denaturation and aggregation was assessed as follows: 40 μg of αL-crystallin fraction was added to 400 μg of βL-crystallin into a 1.5-ml cuvette and made up to a final volume of 1 ml with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The cuvette was placed in a temperature-regulated cell holder attached to a Shimadzu model UV 160 spectrophotometer. Light scattering due to protein denaturation and aggregation was monitored (scanned) at 360 nm absorbance over a time period of 3000 s at 55 °C or 1800 s at 58 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system. 10 μg of the samples were loaded onto a reducing gel and run at 200 volts. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Glutathione mixed disulfides were determined by reversed-phase HPLC separation of glutathione sulfonic acid after oxidation with performic acid (Fig. 1). The αL-crystallin from calf and young human lenses, before and after GSSG treatment, was used for these analyses; the results are summarized in Table I. Calf αL fraction contained a very low level (0.01 nmol/nmol of 20-kDa monomer) of PSSG. After GSSG treatment, the level increased 14-fold to 0.142 nmol/nmol. Treatment of young human αL-crystallin with 25 mm GSSG increased the PSSG content to 0.25 nmol/nmol of protein. Since about one-third of calf (or young human) α-crystallin is αB-crystallin (32Delcour J. Papaconstantinou J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) containing no cysteine, the level of αA-crystallin modification was approximately 0.21 nmol/nmol in calf αL-crystallin and 0.38 nmol/nmol in human αL-crystallin. Subsequent treatment with GR almost completely reduced the in vitroformed PSSG.Table ILevels of protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (PSSG) in various α L -crystallin preparationsSource of αL-crystallinLevels of PSSG (20-kDa αL-crystallin)nmol/nmolCalf αL0.010 ± 0.007 (3)Calf αL + GSSG0.142 ± 0.053 (4)Calf αL + GSSG + GR0.030 ± 0.007 (4)Human αL (12–20 years)0.021 (2)Human αL (12–20 years) + GSSG0.250 (2)Glutathione mixed disulfides were first converted to glutathione sulfonic acid, derivatized by PITC, separated on a Phenomenex ODS 2 Sphereclone reversed-phase HPLC, and developed isocratically in 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.05% triethylamine (v/v), pH 6.6, and 0.5% acetonitrile (v/v) (see “Experimental Procedures” for the details).

Calculations were based on peak areas using the glutathione sulfonic acid standard. Values are mean ± S.D. Number of samples is in parentheses. Human αL-crystallin (from young lenses) was analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry before and after incubation with GSSG. αB- and αA-crystallins were first separated by on-line reversed-phase HPLC and both were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Only αA-crystallin showed a change in molecular weight (Fig. 2) (19Miesbauer L.R. Zhou X. Yang Z. Yang Z. Sun Y. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12494-12502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electrospray ionization mass spectrum of αA-crystallin, before incubation with GSSG, showed peaks corresponding to αA-crystallin (calculatedM r 19,952), αA-crystallin minus the C-terminal serine (M r 19,865), and αA-crystallin with one phosphorylation (M r 20,032). After incubation with GSSG, the molecular weights indicated that both cysteines were partially modified (Fig. 2). The formation of a GSH adduct at a cysteine increases the molecular mass by 305 Da. The mass spectrum of the αL-crystallin incubated in GSSG included additional peaks corresponding to αA plus one GSH (M r20,257); αA minus serine plus one GSH (M r20,170); αA plus a phosphate and one GSH (M r20,357); αA plus two GSH adducts (M r 20,562); αA minus serine, plus two GSH adducts (M r20,475); and αA plus a phosphate and two GSH adducts (M r 20,642). The largest peak in a mass spectrum is displayed as 100% response, and all other peaks are adjusted relative to this peak. Thus, comparison of the sizes of the various peaks within a mass spectrum indicates relative abundance of the proteins. However, such comparisons between two mass spectra are not valid. The mass spectra (Fig. 2, A and B) show that all the peaks with masses of 20,032 and below belong to αA-crystallin without GSH adducts. The remaining six major peaks are generated entirely due to in vitro thiolation with GSSG. There is about 50% modification of αA-crystallin by mixed disulfide formation (Fig. 2 B). The target protein for the chaperone assay was calf βL-crystallin. Characteristically, βL-crystallin aggregates at elevated temperatures. The addition of α-crystallin either prevented or decreased the heat-induced aggregation of βL-crystallin, which was measured by light scattering at 360 nm. Short term experiments were done with an α:β ratio of 1:10. The ratio of α to β determines the degree of protection against heat-induced aggregation. After incubation with 25 mm GSSG, α-crystallin showed a diminished ability to prevent the heat-induced aggregation of βL-crystallin (Fig.3). Correlation of the decrease in chaperone activity with the formation of mixed disulfides indicated that protein mixed disulfides contributed to the loss of α-crystallin chaperone-like function (see Table I). To confirm that the formation of protein-glutathione mixed disulfides was indeed the cause of this decrease in chaperone function, GR was added in the presence of 2 mm NADPH to reduce the mixed disulfides. The chaperone assay resulted in 40% reversal of chaperone-like activity in the calf αL-crystallin (Fig. 3). Similar experiments were conducted with αL-crystallin fractions from young human lenses incubated with GSSG. The chaperone assay showed a 54% decrease of the chaperone-like function. Then, with the addition of GR, a 33% recovery of its function was shown (Fig.4).Figure 4Effect of in vitro formed glutathione mixed disulfides on the chaperone function of human α-crystallin.

It has been shown to protect against heat-induced denaturation and aggregation of many proteins (14Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 15Horwitz J. Emmons T. Takemoto L. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) thus acting as a chaperone by interacting only with denatured nonaggregated crystallins. α-Crystallin differs from true chaperones in that it binds to unfolded proteins in a chaperone-like manner preventing aggregation but does not release its target protein as true chaperones do (33Roa P.V. Huang Q. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Carver J.A. Guerreiro N. Nicholls K.A. Truscott R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this chaperone-like activity seems indispensable in maintaining lens transparency and possibly as a mammalian shock protein in other disorders (6Srinivasan A.N. Nagineni C.N. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23337-23341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7van Noort J.M. van Sechel A.C. Bajramovic J.J. El Ouagmiri M. Polman C.H. Lassmann H. Ravid R. Nature. 1995; 375: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 8Lowe J. Landon M. Pike I. Spendlove I. McDermott H. Mayer R.J. Lancet. 1990; 336: 515-516Abstract PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have attempted to answer whether aging affects this chaperone function and the underlying cause of it in human lenses. Some of the causes of this chaperone malfunction are believed to be posttranslational modifications of α-crystallin by oxidation, glycation, and mixed disulfide formation (28Cherian M. Abraham E.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 208: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that the formation of glutathione mixed disulfides is a major cause of decreased molecular chaperone-like function of α-crystallin due to aging. This decrease in chaperone function can in turn affect the stability of other crystallins and the state of transparency of the whole lens causing lens opacification. Lou et al. (23Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Garadi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have reported two or more species of mixed disulfides in the human lens. The two major species of thiols bound to proteins are glutathione (PSSG) and cysteine (PSSC). The ratio of PSSG to PSSC in human is 4:1; PSSC in human lenses appears to be concentrated in the nuclear region and the water-insoluble fraction (27Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study however, we did not detect PSSC, perhaps because we have used only the α-crystallin from the soluble fraction. Therefore, the focus of the present work is on protein-glutathione mixed disulfides. Depletion of reduced GSH in the lens is associated with the normal aging process. Depletion of GSH and a concomitant increase of protein-thiol mixed disulfides during aging have been reported earlier (23Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Garadi R. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Lou M.F. Dickerson Jr., J.E. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 55: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In vitro induction of mixed disulfide formation in young human and calf α-crystallin via incubation with GSSG, showed a direct effect of mixed disulfides on chaperone activity (Figs. 3 and4). Restoration of chaperone activity, as a result of mixed disulfide reduction by GR also supports this conclusion. These results suggest that PSSG formation is one of the major causes of declining chaperone activity in aging lenses. Wang and Spector (35Wang K. Spector A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1995; 36: 311-321PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that α-crystallin can protect oxidation of thiols in γ-crystallin and that 70% oxidation of α-crystallin thiols with H2O2 decreased only 20% of chaperone activity as compared with the native α-crystallin. We found a 40% decrease in the chaperone activity in calf αL-crystallin and a 54% decrease in human αL-crystallin after the treatment with GSSG. Calf αA-crystallin has only one cysteine (Cys-131) and the human αA-crystallin contains two cysteines (Cys-131 and Cys-142). Both cysteines in human lenses formed mixed disulfides, as shown by mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 2). Therefore, human αL-crystallin showed a higher level of modification (Table I) and decrease in chaperone activity than calf αL-crystallin. Takemoto (36Takemoto L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 223: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) has shown oxidation of Cys-131 and Cys-142 of αA-crystallin forming intramolecular disulfides during human cataract development. Miesbauer et al. (19Miesbauer L.R. Zhou X. Yang Z. Yang Z. Sun Y. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12494-12502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed the presence of disulfides in the water-soluble fraction of α-crystallin from young lenses. Lund et al.(22Lund A.L. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) on the other hand showed all cysteines forming disulfide bonds in the water-insoluble fraction of α-crystallin. Mixed disulfide formation in human α-crystallin could be the precursor for such disulfide formation. However, the level of α-crystallin-bound PSSG in the old human lenses is still unknown. Our preliminary data indicated that significant individual variations can be expected because values of 0.097 mol and 0.022 mol of PSSG/mol of 20-kDa protein were observed in two different αL-crystallin preparations from senile lenses (a large number of human lenses are under study). Variations in PSSG levels will not be a surprising observation (24Dickerson Jr., J.E. Lou M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) because of the varying degrees of oxidative stress senile lenses are subjected to. In addition, levels of PSSG will be influenced by the presence of cataracts (24Dickerson Jr., J.E. Lou M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the loss in chaperone activity due to mixed disulfide formation is not clear. One explanation is that the modification of the abovementioned cysteines causes conformational changes at the binding site on αA-crystallin. It should be emphasized here that the αB subunit is not expected to be modified, and the conformational changes in the α-crystallin oligomer are triggered by modification of one or two sites on αA-crystallin. Takemoto and associates (17Boyle D. Gopalakrishnan S. Takemoto L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1993; 192: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have concluded by immunological localization of denatured γ-crystallin binding that the binding site on α-crystallin is localized in the central region of the oligomeric α-crystallin. However, it is not certain whether the cysteine residues under study are a part of this region, although it is generally believed that the C-terminal domain of αA polypeptide is an integral part of this central region. One important outcome of this study is the possibility of reversing the age-dependent decline in the α-crystallin chaperone activity. Young human and calf αL-crystallins that formed mixed disulfides were further incubated with GR in the presence of NADPH to reduce the mixed disulfides. Reduction of the preformed PSSG led to significant improvement in the chaperone activity. This investigation provides insight into the role of protein-mixed disulfides in chaperone function. Controlling the formation of PSSG by activating the redox system may be important in protecting the α-crystallin, thus delaying or preventing cataractogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2017877814,"The topology of Ca2+-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles was investigated with the aid of sequence-specific antibodies, produced against oligopeptides corresponding to sequences close to the membranous portions of the protein. The antisera in competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays only reacted with intact SR vesicles to a limited extent, but most epitopic regions were exposed by low concentrations of nondenaturing detergent, octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E8) or after removal of cytosolic regions by proteinase K. In particular, these treatments exposed the loop regions in the C-terminal domain, including L7–8, the loop region located between transmembrane segments M7 and M8, with a putative intravesicular position, which had immunochemical properties very similar to those of the C terminus with a documented cytosolic exposure. In contrast to this, the reactivity of the N-terminal intravesicular loop regions L1–2 and L3–4 was only increased by C12E8 treatment but not by proteinase K proteolysis. Complexation of Ca2+-ATPase with β,γ-CrATP stabilized the C-terminal domain of Ca2+-ATPase against proteinase K proteolysis and reaction with most of the antisera, but immunoreactivity was maintained by the L6–7 and L7–8 loops. Immunoelectron microscopic analyses of vesicles following negative staining, thin sectioning, and the SDS-digested freeze-fracture labeling method suggested that the L7–8 epitope, in contrast to L6–7 and the C terminus, can be exposed on either the intravesicular or cytosolic side of the membrane. A preponderant intravesicular location of L7–8 in intact vesicles is suggested by the susceptibility of this region to proteolytic cleavage after disruption of the vesicular barrier with C12E8 and in symmetrically reconstituted Ca2+-ATPase proteoliposomes. In conclusion, our data suggest an adaptable membrane insertion of the C-terminal Ca2+-ATPase domain, which under some conditions permits sliding of M8 through the membrane with cytosolic exposure of L7–8, of possible functional significance in connection with Ca2+translocation. On the technical side, our data emphasize that extreme caution is needed when using nondenaturing detergents or other treatments like EGTA at alkaline pH to open up vesicles for probing of intravesicular location with antibodies.

P-type ATPases comprise a family of homologous membrane proteins involved in the active transport of inorganic cations via an aspartateλ-phosphorylated intermediate. Common for all types is the presence of an N-terminal and a C-terminal membrane-bound domain, separated by a cytosolic domain that contains the ATP binding site and the catalytically important aspartate residue. Most eucaryotic ATPases, comprising the Ca2+-, Na+,K+-, and H+,K+-ATPases and the H+-pump ATPases present in plants and fungi, are distinguished by a long C-terminal domain (including transmembrane segments 5 and 6) that, together with the central membranous region (transmembrane segment 4), presumably is directly involved in the cation translocation through the membrane (1Karlish S.J.D.

In addition, the possibility of other kinds of membrane association than the classical α-helical traverse has been considered for the C-terminal domain of P-type ATPases (17Xie Y.

Rabon E. Hersey S. Sachs G. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1992; 607: 77-88PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to the various models for the topology of P-type ATPases, it may be noted (i) that the 10-transmembrane folding, as depicted in Fig. 1, probably is a maximal model in that it assumes thatall peaks and shoulders in the hydropathy plots, irrespective of peak height, reflect membrane spanning segments and (ii) that the hydropathy profile of various P-type ATPases, in particular those of Ca2+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase, are strikingly similar, suggesting that a consensus model should be sought (19Møller J.V. le Maire M.

Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). With this in mind, it may first be noted that the model with three C-terminal membrane segments proposed by Ovchinnikov (21Ovchinnikov Y.A. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 434-438Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for Na+,K+-ATPase, in which the confluent P5-P6 peaks were assumed to represent only one membrane traverse, is now virtually ruled out in favor of two membrane traverses of this segment on the basis of unequivocal proteolytic evidence for a cytoplasmic location of the following L6–7 loop in both Na+,K+-ATPase (14Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Jørgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3471-3478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SR Ca2+-ATPase (22Shin J.M. Kajimura M. Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. Sachs G. J. Biol.

The existence of M7 is based on the presence of a long hydrophobic segment, combined with immunological evidence for an extracytosolic location of the following L7–8 loop in SR Ca2+-ATPase (8Matthews I.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in H+,K+-ATPase cysteine residue(s) in the L7–8 loop seem to participate in the acid-catalyzed reaction with omeprazole (24Besançon M. Shin J.M. Mercier F. Munson K. Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). An extracellular disposition of the L7–8 loop is also suggested on the basis of evidence for interaction of this segment with the ectodomain of the β-chain in H+,K+-ATPase (29Shin J.M. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Na+,K+-ATPase (30Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Takeyasu K. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning the remaining C-terminal part of the polypeptide chain, immunological and protein-chemical evidence has been interpreted in favor of the existence of only one further full membrane traverse at the C terminus (15Canfield V.A. Norbeck L. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14165-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Jørgensen P.L. de Pont J.J.H.H.M. Molecular Aspects of Transport Proteins.

However, other data point to the cytosolic presence of the intervening L8–9 region (34Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D.

This conclusion is also supported by data obtained with molecular biology techniques that generally have yielded results in favor of the presence of two additional membrane traverses in the C-terminal part of H+,K+-ATPase (38Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Mg2+transporter present in Salmonella typhimurium (39Smith D.L. Tao T. Maguire M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6942-6948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the folding of SR Ca2+-ATPase in the membrane with the aid of sequence-specific antisera. These were produced by immunization of rabbits with oligopeptides, corresponding to sequences in SR Ca2+-ATPase close to the putative transmembrane segments (Fig. 1). The ability of SR vesicles to react with these antibodies was then probed in competitive ELISA assays, and their localization was established by immunoelectron microscopy. The experiments involved pretreatment of the SR vesicles with proteolytic enzyme or the addition of nondenaturing detergent to expose epitope regions close to the membrane (8Matthews I. Sharma R.P. Lee A.G. East J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18737-18740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Matthews I. Colyer J. Mata A.M. Green N.M. Sharma R.P. Lee A.G. East J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The use of oligopeptide antibodies was tested in separate experiments, which involved detailed characterization of the antisera employed. Overall, our data are consonant with a 10-transmembrane model as the basis for a description of the topology of eucaryotic ATPases. However, it is apparent that SR Ca2+-ATPase exhibits deviations from this topology that probably reflect a lability of some portions of the C-terminal part of the polypeptide chain with respect to insertion into the membrane. While most of the membranous polypeptide chain has a well defined location, being exposed on either the cytosolic or the extracytosolic side, the positions of some portions of the polypeptide chain with respect to the membrane appear to be more adaptable and, depending on experimental conditions, may become exposed on either side of the membrane. This phenomenon, which we term plasticity, in particular concerns evidence for cytosolic interaction of an antibody, directed against the L7–8 region with a putative intravesicular location. Possible implications of this and other findings for the structure and function of the C-terminal domain are discussed. Oligopeptides corresponding to selected sequences at the N terminus, C terminus, and putative loop regions (see Fig.1 and Table I) of rabbit fast twitch Ca2+-ATPase were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry by Neosystem A.S. (Strasbourg, France). Biotinylated oligopeptides were synthesized by the pin technology of Chiron Mimotopes (Victoria, Australia). The vector pGEX-KT (42Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal.

Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany).

The reaction was terminated at the desired times by the addition of PMSF (1 mm), and the digests were used for subsequent ELISA and EM experiments. In some experiments, the immunoreactivity of SR vesicles was studied after solubilization by C12E8 at a 2.5:1 (w/w) detergent:protein weight ratio. The serial dilutions of these samples were performed in the presence of 0.1 mg of C12E8/ml to maintain the detergent level above the critical micellar concentration (cmc) (0.05 mg/ml).

Chem. 1990; 265: 12020-12028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used for reconstitution of Ca2+-ATPase, according to the procedure described by Levyet al. (47Levy D. Seigneuret M. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19524-19534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by Cornelius and Møller (48Cornelius F. Møller J.V. Barenholz Y. Lasic D.D. Handbook of Nonmedical Application of Liposomes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 219-243Google Scholar). In this procedure, Ca2+-ATPase in SR vesicles, solubilized by C12E8 at a protein:detergent weight ratio of 2.5:1, was added to the dioleoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes (13–15 mg of phospholipid/ml), partially solubilized by β-octylglucoside and suspended in the bis-Tris medium mentioned above, at a 1:50–1:20 protein:lipid weight ratio. After complete removal of detergent with Biobeads, the reconstituted sample was fractionated by centrifugation overnight at 150,000 × g on a 3–12% (w/v) continuous sucrose gradient. This resulted in the formation of two bands at the upper end of the gradient. The lower band was used for experiments involving the susceptibility to proteolytic degradation by proteinase K and trypsin; although both fractions transport Ca2+, the best reconstitution, in terms of coupled Ca2+ transport, was present in the lower band, which had a transport stoichiometry of close to 2 Ca2+/ATP split and a low ATP hydrolysis rate (0.7 μmol/mg/min at 23 °C), which was activated about 8-fold after solubilization of the lipid with C12E8. Furthermore, as evidence of a symmetric insertion, ATP hydrolysis of both fractions was increased by the addition of ionophore to about half the level observed after solubilization with C12E8. In these assays, polystyrene plates (Nunc-Maxisorp, Life Technologies) were coated for 2 h at room temperature with denatured Ca2+-ATPase, prepared by mixing SR vesicles (5 μg of protein/ml) with 0.5% SDS and boiling for 3 min. This was followed by blocking with 3% BSA, solubilized in the buffer used in the following ELISA procedure (either the bis-Tris buffer mentioned above or PBS). Competitive ELISA procedures were carried out by mixing SR vesicles (in the presence of 0.1% BSA) or oligopeptides with suitable dilutions of antisera (final volume, 100 μl) and incubation for 2 h at room temperature in the coated plates. Dilutions of antisera (500–20,000 ×) were chosen so as to make the subsequent color development by the immobilized Ca2+-ATPase-antibody complex approximately proportional to the concentration of free (unreacted) antibody in the reaction medium,i.e. it was performed under conditions where there remained an excess of adsorbed Ca2+-ATPase, uncombined with antibody, on the solid phase. After rinsing with antibody-free incubation medium, bound antibody was assayed by treatment with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-γ-rabbit antibody (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) for 1 h, followed by reaction witho-phenylenediamine and 0.003% H2O2. After stopping the reaction with sulfuric acid, readings were performed by dual wavelength spectrophotometry (495/405 nm) on a model 3550 microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Binding properties of the antibodies by the denatured Ca2+-ATPase immobilized on the ELISA wells were measured at different antisera dilutions. The determinations were performed by a double plate technique in which the 2-h incubate from the first plate, instead of being discarded, was transferred to a second plate, which was then processed in the same way as the first plate. After the second incubation, there was a decrease in color development, resulting from the removal of part of the antibody from the mobile phase during the first incubation. The amount adsorbed by the immobilized phase during the first incubation could then be estimated from a calibration curve relating color development to antiserum dilution. The fraction of bound antibody removed from the solution was subtracted to estimate the concentration of free antibody at the end of the first assay, and apparent dissociation constants were evaluated from plots of bound antibody (measured on the basis of the color development)versus free antibody (antisera dilutions, corrected for antibody removal). Semiquantitative estimations of antibody concentrations in terms of weight units were calculated from measurements of the amount of denatured Ca2+-ATPase present on the sides of the wells, determined with radiolabeled Ca2+-ATPase as described below, assuming that all of this participated in a binding reaction with a 1:1 stoichiometry (TableI). Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy before and after treatment with proteinase K and C12E8. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice, 20-μl aliquots of each sample were applied to gelatin-coated glass slides and heated to room temperature for 5 min to allow the vesicles to remain on the glass slide. The samples were labeled by applying suitable dilutions with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). In control samples, the specific antibodies were omitted or substituted by preimmune sera. The glass slides were observed with a 50 × oil objective lens in a Leica Laborlux S microscope and recorded on Kodak TMY400 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Ultrastructural detection of antibody labeling was performed on detergent or proteinase K-treated SR vesicles, fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldeh"
https://openalex.org/W2041238731,"The role of the nerve growth factor (NGF) carboxyl terminus in the function of NGF is not well understood. Previous work showed that deletion of residues 112–120 abolished NGF bioactivity. Several mutagenesis studies, however, have localized the binding sites of the two NGF receptors, p75 and TrkA, to other regions of the NGF molecule. To investigate the role of the NGF COOH terminus, we performed a detailed structure-function analysis of this region by deleting stepwise each of the nine COOH-terminal residues as well as constructing six point mutants. We found that point mutations within the 111–115 region, but not deletion of residues 116–120, significantly decreased NGF bioactivity, as determined by TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells. Mutation of the absolutely conserved Leu112 led to severely disrupted p75 binding on A875 cells but had only a modest effect on TrkA binding to MG87-TrkA fibroblasts. This suggests that the p75 binding surface is more extended than previously believed and includes not only charged residues within loops 1 and 5 but also spatially discontinuous, uncharged residues in a region where the NH2 and COOH termini are in close proximity. Unexpectedly, deletion of COOH-terminal residues beyond Ala116 led to significantly decreased stability. These results demonstrate that residues 111–115, but not residues 116–120, are important for both the structural stability and biological activity of NGF.

The neurotrophins are a family of survival and differentiation factors that exert a profound influence on development and maintenance of the nervous system (1Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1525-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). This feature makes neurotrophins promising candidates as therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurological disorders (2Lindsay R.M. Wiegand S.J. Altar C.A. DiStefano P.S. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 182-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 3Ibanez C.F.

The crystal structure of the prototype neurotrophin, NGF, 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; NT, neurotrophin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; wt, wild type. revealed that it belongs to the cystine knot superfamily of structurally related growth factors (4McDonald N.Q. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 421-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The well conserved “core” of the NGF molecule consists of two pairs of anti-parallel β-strands that form an elongated dimer interface and are held together by three disulfide bridges uniquely arranged in a characteristic cystine knot motif. The β-strands are connected to the “north” of the protomer by three β-hairpin loops, whereas the NH2 and COOH termini appear to be located closer to the “south” of the protomers (see Fig. 7 for details). The loops and termini were not well resolved by x-ray crystallography and are thus likely to be highly flexible (5McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 6Holland D.R. Cousens L.S. Meng W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, these domains are regions of highest sequence divergence among neurotrophins. There is ample evidence for an involvement of these neurotrophin regions in specific receptor binding (7Bradshaw R.A. Murray-Rust J. Ibanez C.F. McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1901-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Two NGF receptors have been identified: the p75 neurotrophin receptor and the tyrosine kinase TrkA (8Meakin S.O. Shooter E.M. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 9Bothwell M. Annu. Rev.

Although TrkA is able to elicit NGF responses by itself in some systems, p75 can co-operate with TrkA to increase NGF binding to and activation of TrkA at low ligand concentration (11Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 12Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Ibanez C.F. Persson H. Kaplan D.R. Benedetti M. Chao M.V. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have previously demonstrated that the binding of NGF to p75 is dominated by three charged residues at positions 32, 34, and 95 in the loops at the north of the molecule because a triple mutant with alanine at these positions resulted in a loss of p75 binding (27Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus as well as residues 31, 40–49, and 91–97 have been identified as determinants of NGF binding to TrkA (13Kahle P. Burton L.E. Schmelzer C.H. Hertel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22707-22710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ibanez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6278-6285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The importance of the COOH terminus in NGF structure and function remains controversial. Previous work in this laboratory showed that a deletion mutant lacking 9 COOH-terminal residues was completely inactive (18Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a chimeric molecule in which the 10 COOH-terminal residues of NGF were substituted by the homologous sequence of BDNF had decreased bioactivity as measured by neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells, which co-express TrkA and p75 NGF receptors (19Suter U. Angst C. Tien C.L. Drinkwater C.C. Lindsay R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 306-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other investigators found that a similar chimera between rat NGF and rat BDNF had a 10% reduction in binding to TrkA-expressing fibroblasts and normal bioactivity (14Ibanez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The NGF COOH terminus contains a potential proteolytic processing site, and it remains uncertain whether cleavage at this site modifies NGF bioactivity. Forms of recombinant mouse NGF expressed in insect cells, which differed from submandibulary gland-derived NGF by the presence of the COOH-terminal Arg-Gly dipeptide, displayed altered bioactivity (20Luo Y. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12275-12283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recombinant human NGF isoforms with two or three COOH-terminal residues proteolytically removed, and thus designed to resemble mouse submandibular gland preparations (which contain a certain percentage of isoforms lacking the NH2-terminal eight amino acids and/or the COOH-terminal two residues), exerted wild type bioactivity (21Burton L.E. Schmelzer C.H. Szonyi E. Yedinak C. Gorrell A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, on the basis of molecular modeling (22Shamovsky I.L. Ross G.M. Riopelle R.J. Weaver D.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9743-9749Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) it has been suggested that an interaction between the NH2 and COOH termini may contribute to TrkA binding. In this study we have used a series of point and deletion mutants to investigate the NGF COOH terminus, with the goal of clarifying its role in NGF structure, receptor binding, and biological activity. COS-7 cells, A875 cells, and PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 6% bovine calf serum and 6% horse serum. MG87 cells expressing human TrkA (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. Mutated cDNAs were constructed by polymerase chain reaction in pKS-mNGF (18Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a T7-primer as common 5′-primer and specific 3′-primers introducing a newEcoRI site downstream of the stop codon. Polymerase chain reaction products were purified by a Qiaex kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and digested with PflMI/EcoRI, and the 3′-fragment was subcloned into the previously described pBJ-5-mNGF (18Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs were verified by sequencing using the dideoxy method. COS-7 cells at ∼50% confluency on 10-cm dishes were transfected with 15 μg of plasmid DNA by the DEAE-dextran-chloroquine method as described previously (18Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conditioned media (containing 1% fetal calf serum) were collected 72 h later and cleared by high speed centrifugation. To produce conditioned media with high concentrations of wt NGF and mutants, supernatants were concentrated using Centricon 10 columns (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After concentration on Centricon 10 columns and determination of NGF concentration by ELISA, samples were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed as described previously (23Heymach Jr., J.V. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12297-12304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using polyclonal rabbit anti-NGF antisera (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma). Blots were developed using the Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent (NEN Life Science Products). The test for proteolytic degradation was performed as follows: equal amounts of wt NGF and mutant Δ114–120 were incubated for 3 days at 37 °Cversus 4 °C and afterward subjected to the above described anti-NGF Western blot analysis. Conditioned media from transfected COS-7 cells expressing wt NGF and mutants were incubated at 4 °Cversus 37 °C for 3 days and subjected, in triplicate, to a previously described ELISA (23Heymach Jr., J.V. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12297-12304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using the monoclonal MCβ-1 as capture and a polyclonal anti-NGF antiserum (Sigma) as detection antibody. This ELISA recognizes only native NGF and not reduced or denatured NGF (data not shown). The percentage of recovery for the mutants was defined as the 37 °C ELISA concentration divided by the 4 °C ELISA concentration multiplied by 100. The “27/21” ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). 80% confluent PC12 cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and subsequently incubated with wt NGF or mutants, adjusted to equal concentrations of 2, 10, or 50 ng/ml, in a total volume of 6 ml. After an incubation of 5 min at 37 °C, supernatants were removed, and plates were placed on ice and rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After removal of the phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation using D203 anti-pan Trk antibody (a gift of Dr. D. Kaplan, Montreal Neurologic Institute, Montreal, Canada) and Protein A/G Plus Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Beads were pelleted, washed three times, subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked and then incubated with PY20, an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Reactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence as described above. PC12 cells (5 × 104/well) were seeded out in six-well Costar plastic plates with 2.5 ml of medium. After allowing cell adherence to the culture dish overnight, cells were washed, and 2-fold serial dilutions of conditioned media containing wt NGF or mutants in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 1% fetal calf serum) were added. Neurite outgrowth (percentage of cells with neurites > 2 × cell diameter in a representative visual field) was scored after 3 days. Binding of wt NGF and mutants to TrkA-expressing fibroblasts (MG87-TrkA) or p75-expressing A875 human melanoma cells was measured in a modification of the PC12 receptor binding assay (18Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified 2.5 S NGF (Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Indianapolis, IN) was iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method to a specific activity of ∼1.5 × 108 cpm/μg. For each data point, 125I-NGF (1 ng) was incubated in triplicate with increasing amounts of concentrated wt NGF or mutants and 105 A875 cells or 5 × 105 MG87-TrkA cells in a total volume of 100 μl on ice for 2 h with gentle vortexing every 10 min. After centrifugation through a 0.15 m sucrose gradient, cell pellets were counted in a γ counter (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). “Vector control” binding was determined by adding increasing amounts of concentrated medium from COS cells transfected with pBJ-5 vector alone. At low concentrations, no displacement of125I-NGF was observed, although about 25% displacement was observed at the highest concentration. The percentage of125I-NGF binding was calculated as follows: (mean cpm obtained for each recombinant competitor/mean cpm obtained in the presence of an equivalent amount of vector-transfected medium) × 100. The crystal structure of purified mouse desocta-βNGF (6Holland D.R. Cousens L.S. Meng W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was displayed using Insight II, version 95.0 (Biosym, San Diego, CA). Coordinates of the C2 space group structure were downloaded from the Brookhaven protein data base. Hydrogen atoms were omitted, as well as the third protomer, which is also packed into the C2 unit cell. Amino acid residues with relevance to this report were highlighted in color, and the van der Waals' surface of the polypeptides was calculated. Using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis, a series of COOH-terminal mutants of murine NGF were constructed (Fig.1). Eight stepwise deletions covering the region between residues 113–120 of mature NGF, as well as five point mutants covering the stretch between residue 111–115 and a double point mutant in which residues Arg118 and Arg119 were exchanged to serines (R118S/R119S). We also made use of previously described constructs from our laboratory such as deletion mutant Δ112–120 (18Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as several chimeric NGF/BDNF proteins designated as CH1 to CH12 (19Suter U. Angst C. Tien C.L. Drinkwater C.C. Lindsay R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 306-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CH12 contains the BDNF COOH terminus on an NGF backbone and therefore lacks residues 119–120 and contains five additional amino acid substitutions (V111T, S113T, R114I, A116R, and T117G). The mutated cDNAs were sequenced, subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pBJ-5 (24Suter U. Heymach Jr., J. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2395-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and expressed by transient transfection of COS-7 cells. Conditioned media were subjected to a NGF-specific ELISA based on the monoclonal MCβ-1 (25Zimmerman A. Sutter A. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4611-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as capture antibody and a polyclonal anti-NGF antiserum (Sigma) as detection antibody. This ELISA only recognizes native but not reduced nor denatured NGF (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, expression levels were generally in the range of 200–400 ng/ml, but surprisingly, mutants Δ114–120 and Δ115–120 consistently appeared to be expressed at lower levels as determined by the monoclonal based ELISA, whereas mutants Δ112–120 and Δ113–120 were not detectable at all. The same result was obtained using a commercially available NGF-ELISA based on a different monoclonal antibody, 27/21 (data not shown). In contrast to the ELISA results, mutants Δ112–120 and Δ113–120 were detected at levels comparable with those of the other mutants by the less sensitive Western blot analysis, in which aliquots of the same conditioned COS supernatants were detected by the anti-NGF polyclonal antiserum (Fig.2). Because this antiserum was also used as detection antibody for the MCβ-1 based ELISA, we concluded that mutants Δ112–120 up to Δ115–120 might have a decreased recognition by the monoclonal MCβ-1 used as capture antibody for the ELISA. We considered two possible explanations: the COOH terminus could represent the epitope for MCβ-1, or deletions at the COOH terminus might induce conformational changes that alter an epitope located in a different part of the NGF structure. To test the first possibility, we took advantage of previously described NGF/BDNF chimeras to investigate the MCβ-1 epitope. In these chimeras, short stretches of approximately 10 amino acids are systematically exchanged from BDNF into the homologous NGF backbone substituting the corresponding NGF sequences (19Suter U. Angst C. Tien C.L. Drinkwater C.C. Lindsay R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 306-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because MCβ-1 does not cross-react with BDNF (data not shown), it is unlikely to recognize a chimera in which the epitope within NGF is replaced by the corresponding region of BDNF. Chimeric proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells, and supernatants were subjected ELISA analysis. The COOH-terminal chimeras CH10, CH11, and CH12, as well as NH2-terminal chimeras CH1 and CH2 were recognized well by ELISA, providing evidence that MCβ-1 does not recognize the COOH terminus nor the NH2 terminus. Moreover, this suggested that the larger deletion mutants were not recognized by MCβ-1 (nor the 27/21 monoclonal) due to a broader conformational disruption or destabilization. To investigate if COOH-terminal deletions destabilized NGF, we assayed the stability of all NGF mutants used in this study using the following assay. Conditioned COS cell media containing wt NGF or mutant proteins were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C versus 4 °C and afterward subjected to MCβ-1-ELISA. As shown in Fig.3 A, most of the mutants as well as wt NGF were stable for 3 days at 37 °C. Deletions beyond residue 116, however, led to a time-dependent decrease in NGF recovery (Fig. 3 B). This decrease in MCβ-1 ELISA recognition was not accompanied by obvious proteolytic events, as shown in Fig. 3 C, where wt NGF and Δ114–120 were subjected to Western blot analysis after a 3-day incubation period at 37 °Cversus 4 °C. No lower molecular weight bands were observed in the samples incubated at 37 °C. We therefore limited our subsequent analysis of the mutants to those that were stable for at least 3 days. Next, we determined the activity of the COOH-terminal mutants using a standard PC12 neurite outgrowth assay. Serial dilutions of wt NGF and mutants were applied to the cells, and neurite outgrowth was scored after 3 days. As seen in Fig.4, deletion mutant Δ116–120 showed no appreciable decrease in neurite outgrowth compared with wt NGF, suggesting that residues 116–120 are not essential for bioactivity. Consistent with these findings, R118S/R119S also had normal levels of bioactivity. Deletion mutants extending beyond residue 116 (Δ115–120, Δ114–120, and so on) had reduced bioactivity (data not shown), but for reasons described above, we could not determine if this was due to decreased stability, impaired activation of receptors, or both. Several point mutants showed significantly reduced bioactivity. L112A showed approximately a 6-fold reduction, V111T, R114S, and K115S showed a 4-fold reduction, and S113T had only a slightly reduced activity. The binding of NGF to TrkA induces receptor homodimerization and transphosphorylation, which activates downstream signaling events (26Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To further characterize the activity of selected mutants we analyzed their ability to activate TrkA receptors in PC12 cells. COS cell-conditioned supernatants containing wt NGF or mutants were applied to PC12 cells in three different concentrations ranging from 2 to 50 ng/ml. Cells were lysed, and TrkA was immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.5). Consistent with the PC12 neurite outgrowth data, R118S/R119S and Δ116–120 (not shown) had wild type activity. R114S, K115S, and CH12 showed significant reductions in TrkA activation, whereas L112A and V111T were the most strongly impaired. Because PC12 cells express both the TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors, impaired neurite outgrowth and TrkA phosphorylation may reflect decreased binding to either TrkA or p75. To measure the ability of selected mutants to interact with each receptor individually, we performed binding competition experiments on p75-expressing A875 cells or TrkA-expressing fibroblasts (Fig. 6). Consistent with the above mentioned results, R118S/R119S had wild type binding to both TrkA and p75. L112A and CH12 both showed small but reproducible reductions in TrkA binding. By contrast, the binding of L112A to p75 was reduced by at least 50-fold; the exact IC50 could not be determined because 100 nm of L112A was able to displace only 25% of radiolabeled NGF tracer. The binding of CH12 to p75 was also impaired but to a lesser extent than that of L112A, with an approximately 15-fold increase in the IC50. In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to analyze the role of the COOH terminus in NGF bioactivity as well as its binding to the NGF receptors p75 and TrkA. We focused on this region for several reasons. The COOH terminus contains a potential cleavage site that has been proposed to modify NGF bioactivity (20Luo Y. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12275-12283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, although previous mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that deleting residues 112–120 of the COOH terminus abolishes NGF bioactivity (18Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and substituting the corresponding region of BDNF reduces its bioactivity (19Suter U. Angst C. Tien C.L. Drinkwater C.C. Lindsay R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 306-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other mutagenesis studies have highlighted spatially distinct regions of the NGF structure as being critical for NGF-receptor interactions (14Ibanez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that part of the COOH terminus plays a role in NGF receptor binding, particularly to p75. Perhaps more surprisingly, we also found that, although the COOH terminus does not form part of the NGF core, certain mutations nevertheless destabilized the NGF structure, causing significant conformational perturbations. Previous mutagenesis studies have implicated charged residues in the first and fifth loops of NGF, located at the north end of the molecule, as being critical for p75 binding (Fig. 7). For example, mutants in which residues Arg32, Arg34, and Arg95 have been changed to alanine were severely impaired in their ability to bind p75 but had only mildly reduced TrkA binding (27Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Basic residues located in the corresponding regions in BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 were also shown to participate in p75 binding (28Ryden M. Murray-Rust J. Glass D. Ilag L.L. Trupp M. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald N.Q. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The alteration of Trp-21, an uncharged residue located at the north end of the dimer interface (see Fig. 7), led to impaired “fast” binding (presumably to p75) but normal “slow” binding (29Drinkwater C.C. Suter U. Angst C. Shooter E.M. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 246: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); it was not, however, determined if this mutation induced broader conformational changes and/or reduced stability. Interestingly, additional contact points for p75 were suggested by a set of NT-3 mutants located in the southern part of the molecule. NT-3 mutants R68A and R114A/K115A displayed more than 100-fold less affinity for p75 than wild type NT-3, whereas the reduction of TrkC binding was less than 50% (30Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. Soppet D. Escandon E. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5896-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study we find that the COOH-terminal mutants L112A and CH12 were severely impaired in their ability to bind p75. It has previously been noted that forms of NGF with deletions at the NH2terminus have moderately reduced p75 binding (13Kahle P. Burton L.E. Schmelzer C.H. Hertel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22707-22710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shih A. Laramee G.R. Schmelzer C.H. Burton L.E. Winslow J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these data, it is interesting to note that the NH2 terminus of one protomer crosses the COOH-terminal sequence Val111-Leu112 of the other protomer (5McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 6Holland D.R. Cousens L.S. Meng W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Leu112 is partially occluded by Phe12 and Trp76 of the other protomer in the P6522 structure of NGF (5McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, in the C2 structure (6Holland D.R. Cousens L.S. Meng W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) these aromatic side chains exhibit less intimate contact, forming a groove with Leu112 at the bottom (Fig. 7). This could indicate some degree of conformational freedom in the region where the NGF NH2 and COOH termini are in close proximity. Even subtle changes, like the conservative substitutions of Val111 and Leu112 with alanine might locally alter the configuration of the area where the NGF termini overlap (22Shamovsky I.L. Ross G.M. Riopelle R.J. Weaver D.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9743-9749Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Given that alanine is less bulky than valine and leucine, the observed effects are unlikely to be due to the introduction of steric hindrance. Because L112A is comparable with wt NGF in terms of stability (Fig.3 A) and retains considerable Trk binding (Fig.6 A), its impaired p75 binding is more likely to be the result of a local modification of the p75 binding surface rather than a global conformational disruption. Alternatively, carboxyl-terminal mutations could disrupt some interaction between the NH2and COOH termini, which is important for receptor binding. We cannot, however, rule out the theoretical possibility that mutation relieves the termini from constrained conformation, thereby allowing them to interfere with interactions between p75 and loops 1 and 5 of NGF (27Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Leu112 is strictly conserved in all known neurotrophins, suggesting that it may play a similarly critical role in other neurotrophins as well. Previous studies highlighted the importance of basic residues in neurotrophins for binding to p75 (Lys32, Lys34, and Lys95 of NGF; Lys95, Lys96, and Arg97 of BDNF; Arg31, His33, Arg68, Arg114, and Lys115 of NT-3; Arg34 and Arg36 of NT-4/5) (27Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 28Ryden M. Murray-Rust J. Glass D. Ilag L.L. Trupp M. Yancopoulos G.D. McDonald N.Q. Ibanez C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1979-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. Soppet D. Escandon E. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5896-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because Leu112 is surrounded mostly by uncharged amino acid residues, nonionic interactions are also likely to play a role in the binding of NGF to p75. Taken together with previous studies, our data suggest that p75, like TrkA (14Ibanez C.F. Ilag L.L. Murray-Rust J. Persson H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2281-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), binds to an extended surface of NGF. This surface appears to include not only positively charged residues at the north end of NGF, but also uncharged residues in spatially discontinuous region of the COOH terminus located at the south end in close proximity to the NH2 terminus of the other protomer (Fig. 7). An extended interface between p75 and northern plus southern contact points on NGF would be generally compatible with a hypothetical molecular model of the NGF·p75 complex (31Chapman B.S. Kuntz I.D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A chimeric protein consisting of the BDNF COOH terminus with an NGF backbone, CH12, differs from wt NGF in that it contains five different residues and lacks residues 119–120 (19Suter U. Angst C. Tien C.L. Drinkwater C.C. Lindsay R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 306-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We find that CH12 has a 15-fold decreased ability to compete with wt NGF on p75-expressing A875 cells, indicating that the NGF COOH terminus contains structural features that cannot be substituted by the homologous BDNF sequences. This supports the recent suggestion that p75 recognizes the different neurotrophins as related but not identical ligands (32Timm D.E. Ross A.H. Neet K.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm-Matthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). We have determined the bioactivity of the mutants in PC12 cells, which express both p75 and TrkA receptors. Neurite outgrowth can occur via TrkA activation alone (27Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 34Rovelli G. Heller R.A. Canossa M. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8717-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, p75 is likely to facilitate TrkA-mediated signaling at low ligand concentrations (11Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 12Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Ibanez C.F. Persson H. Kaplan D.R. Benedetti M. Chao M.V. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Therefore, decreased neurite outgrowth may reflect impaired binding to TrkA, p75, or both. We find that conservative point mutations in the 111–115 region (V111T, L112A, R114S, and K115S) significantly reduced bioactivity. By contrast, deletion of the five COOH-terminal residues (Δ116–120) had no discernible effect. Consistent with these findings, point mutants in the 111–115 region also had a reduced ability to induce TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation in PC12 cells. Interestingly, L112A, which exhibited severely impaired p75 binding, had only a relatively modest reduction in binding to fibroblasts expressing TrkA alone but a far greater reduction in both Trk phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Although the binding, Trk phosphorylation, and neurite outgrowth results cannot be directly compared quantitatively, the L112A data suggest that the loss in p75 binding leads to a reduction in Trk activation and bioactivity in PC12 cells, as suggested by earlier studies (11Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). For COOH-terminal mutants containing deletions of more than five residues (mutants Δ112–120 up to Δ115–120), we observed a striking discrepancy in the amount of NGF detectable by Western blotting, which uses a polyclonal antiserum to detect reduced, denatured protein, and a two-site ELISA, which utilizes a monoclonal antibody (MCβ-1) that recognizes native but not denatured NGF. For example, conditioned media from cells transfected with Δ113–120 contained near wild type levels of NGF as detected by Western blotting but no detectable NGF by ELISA (the detection limit of the Western blot is ∼5 ng/ml; the detection limit of the ELISA is ∼0.025 ng/ml). Two possible explanations for the discrepancy are that 1) the deleted region of the COOH terminus forms part of the MCβ-1 epitope, or 2) the deletions cause conformational perturbations in regions not contained within the epitope. We consider the first explanation unlikely for several reasons. First, experiments using a second monoclonal antibody (27/21) yielded similar results. Furthermore, MCβ-1 does not cross-react with BDNF but does recognize CH12, a chimera in which the NGF COOH terminus is replaced by the corresponding region of BDNF. Experiments using additional chimeras indicate that the epitope for MCβ-1 does not lie between residues 92–120 nor at the NH2 terminus (residues 1–22). Therefore we consider it likely that the observed discrepancy is caused by significant perturbations in the neurotrophin structure. The crystal structure of NGF revealed that the NGF core contains a cystine knot motif as well as an extended dimer interface, both of which are presumably critical for the structural integrity of the protomers (5McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R. Murray-Rust J. Gunning J. Wlodawer A. Blundell T.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In light of this structural information, it is somewhat unexpected that mutants lacking residues upstream of 116 (Δ115–120 to Δ112–120) are dramatically less stable than wt NGF. For example, Δ114–120 underwent a 50% decrease in NGF immunoreactivity (detected by ELISA) over 24 h without apparent proteolytic events or a decrease in the amount of protein detected by Western blotting. This instability may be due to the proximity of these residues to Cys110, which forms part of the cystine knot, or because interactions not easily appreciated in the crystal structure are critical for stabilizing the neurotrophin protomers. These observations highlight the importance of rigorously characterizing novel mutants; incorrectly folded or unstable mutants could lead to a discrepancy between the results of short lasting assays, such as TrkA phosphorylation and binding, and longer assays such as neurite outgrowth. In light of these observations, the finding from an earlier study by our laboratory that Δ112–120 was biologically inactive (18Drinkwater C.C. Barker P.A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23202-23207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may reflect a conformational disruption rather than a direct effect on the TrkA binding site. To avoid such potential sources of ambiguity we limited our analysis to mutants that were found to be relatively stable. Although our data provide evidence that the 111–115 region is important for both NGF stability and bioactivity, we do not find residues 116–120 to be essential for either function. Both R118S/R119S, the mutant in which the dibasic proteolytic processing site is replaced, and Δ116–120 were essentially indistinguishable from wt NGF in terms of stability, TrkA phosphorylation, and PC12 neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, R118S/R119S and wt NGF were comparable in TrkA and p75 binding. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that this region of the COOH terminus serves other functions not tested in this study, such as directing intracellular targeting or adhesion to the extracellular matrix. It is worth noting, for example, that the β chain of PDGF, a cystine knot family member structurally related to NGF, contains a stretch of basic residues at the carboxyl terminus that has been identified as a cell surface retention signal (35Andersson M. Ostman A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 926-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we found that the Δ117–120 mutant undergoes regulated secretion like wild type NGF when transiently expressed in neuroendocrine cells (36Heymach Jr., J.V. Krüttgen A. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25430-25437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), indicating that at least this part of the COOH terminus does not serve to direct NGF to the regulated secretory pathway. In conclusion, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the NGF COOH terminus. Mutations of residues within the 111–115 region, most notably L112A, dramatically impaired the binding of NGF to p75 and, to a lesser extent, TrkA. The p75 binding surface is therefore more extended than previously known, involving not only a cluster of positively charged residues in loops 1 and 5 but also nonionic interactions in a noncontiguous part of the molecule. Unexpectedly, the same region of the COOH terminus also plays a role in stabilizing the NGF structure. The remainder of the COOH terminus, residues 116–120, was found to be nonessential for stability and bioactivity. Further investigations will be needed to determine if the COOH terminus serves a similar role in other neurotrophins as well. We thank Ueli Suter for providing the NGF/BDNF chimeras, Anne Baldwin for assistance with the binding experiments, and Peter DiStefano (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) for providing iodinated NGF."

The MARCKS protein is dramatically phosphorylated by PKC in many cell types in response to phorbol esters, diacylglycerols, neurotransmitters, drugs, and various growth factors, implying that it is involved in the signaling pathways linking PKC activation to specific cellular responses. MARCKS also plays an essential role in the early development of vertebrates (3Stumpo D.J. Bock C.B. Tuttle J.S. Blackshear P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and its gene transcription is developmentally regulated (4Blackshear P.J. Lai W.S. Tuttle J.S. Stumpo D.J. Kennington E. Nairn A.C. Sulik K.K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 96: 62-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the mouse, MARCKS mRNA and protein are first detected in the nascent neural folds early on embryonic day 8 (E8) and then become highly expressed throughout the developing central nervous system (4Blackshear P.J.

Consistent with this expression pattern, MARCKS gene “knock-out” mice exhibited lethal defects in neurulation, cerebral hemisphere fusion, cortical and retinal lamination, and other central nervous system developmental processes (3Stumpo D.J.

Stumpo D.J. Tuttle J.S. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 145: 46-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The MARCKS gene is also regulated by other factors. It has been noted that MARCKS expression is severely decreased in cells transformed with a variety of oncogenes (6Wolfman A. Wingrove T.G. Blackshear P.J. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16546-16552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Reed J.C. Rapp U. Cuddy M.P. Cell Signal. 1991; 3: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Joseph C.K.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 755-760PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in v-src-transformed murine fibroblasts, MARCKS transcription is down-regulated by 68% compared with untransformed cells (8Joseph C.K. Qureshi S.A. Wallace D.J. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1327-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); inhibiting the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of v-srcwith herbimycin A restores MARCKS mRNA levels to normal, suggesting that the reduced MARCKS mRNA levels are a direct effect of v-src activity. MARCKS transcription can also be dramatically stimulated by tumor necrosis factor α or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in macrophages and neutrophils (10Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Harlan D.M. Graff J.M. Stumpo D.J. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Boyle J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14399-14405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, it has been estimated that MARCKS constitutes 90% of all new protein synthesis in these cells in response to tumor necrosis factor α or lipopolysaccharide (10Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The promoter elements responsible for oncogene and cytokine regulation of the MARCKS gene, however, have not been determined.Previous reports from this laboratory have described the cloning and mapping of the human and mouse MARCKS genes (11Harlan D.M. Graff J.M. Stumpo D.J. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Boyle J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14399-14405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Blackshear P.J. Tuttle J.S. Oakey R.J. Seldin M.F. Chery M. Philippe C. Stumpo D.J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments indicated that a sequence of about 240-bp of human promoter is sufficient for high level expression of the growth hormone reporter gene in fibroblasts (11Harlan D.M. Graff J.M. Stumpo D.J. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Boyle J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14399-14405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we used this 240-bp fragment to drive the expression of a MARCKS-lacZfusion gene in transgenic mice. 2W. S. Lai and P. J. Blackshear, unpublished data.2W. S. Lai and P. J. Blackshear, unpublished data. This fragment was able to direct correct temporal and tissue-specific expression of the MARCKS-lacZ fusion protein during mouse embryogenesis, suggesting that this fragment contains most, if not all, important elements required for developmental regulation of MARCKS gene transcription in mice.However, specifically what cis- andtrans-regulatory elements are involved in MARCKS gene regulation has not been described. It is conceivable that by serial deletion/mutation analysis of the promoter in transgenic mice, it might be possible to identify regulatory elements that are important for developmental control of the MARCKS gene. However, such experiments would be expensive and time-consuming. Alternatively,Xenopus embryos provide a more convenient system in which “transient transgenic” experiments can be relatively easily performed, mainly because large numbers of embryos can be easily obtained and manipulated. Microinjection of DNA constructs intoXenopus embryos has proven to be an effective approach in the study of developmental regulation, not only of many amphibian genes but also of some mammalian genes (13Wilson C.

We cloned the cDNA and genomic sequences encoding Xenopus MARCKS and examined the mechanisms of its transcriptional control. Our results indicate that a CBF/NF-Y-like factor and an Sp1-like factor bind to theXenopus MARCKS promoter and that mutations of their binding sites that prevent transcription factor binding also inhibit activation of the MARCKS gene at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). The regulatory expression patterns of these two factors suggest that they might play a general role in selectively activating theXenopus genome at MBT.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vitro PhosphorylationEnzymatically defolliculated oocytes were homogenized in 10 μl/oocyte of a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.6% (v/v) Triton X-100. After incubating on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing, the homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. Because MARCKS is heat-stable, we then boiled the supernatant for 10 min and recentrifuged. The supernatants were subjected to phosphorylation by using protein kinase M (PKM), the active catalytic fragment of PKC, as described previously (22Graff J.M. Rajan R.R. Randall R.R. Nairn A.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14390-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Verghese G.M. Johnson J.D. Vasulka C. Haupt D.M. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9361-9367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to 54 μl of the supernatant was added 110 volume of Mg2+/ATP/PKM for final concentrations of 20 mmMgCl2, 75 mm [γ-32P]ATP (approximately 4 mCi/nmol; ICN, Irvine, CA), and a 1:480 dilution of the purified PKM. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with shaking and stopped with 10 μl of 5 × SDS sample buffer (5% (w/v) SDS, 0.05 m EDTA, 1.25 m sucrose, 0.42 m dithiothreitol, 0.006% (w/v) pyronin Y). The reaction products were separated on one- or two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography.Cloning of a Xenopus MARCKS cDNA and Genomic ClonesDegenerate Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)Two thousand oocytes were defolliculated in 2% (w/v) collagenase (type II; Worthington) in 1 × MBS (88 mmNaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4), pulverized with a mortar and pestle under liquid N2, and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer for 30 s at 30,000 rpm in 20 ml of phenol (prewarmed to 60 °C) plus 20 ml of a buffer consisting of 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS. Standard phenol/chloroform extractions and oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography were then performed to purify oocyte mRNA. PCR primers were chosen based on the conserved amino-terminal sequences of mammalian MARCKS proteins (2Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward primer was (5′ to 3′) ATGGGTGCCCAGTTCTCCAAGA, and the reverse primer was (5′ to 3′) TGGCCITTITCCTGICCATTIGCITT, where I stands for inosine. One μg of mRNA was reverse transcribed using MuLV reverse transcriptase and 50 pmol of the reverse primer as described (24Kawasaki E.S. Wang A.M. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 89-97Crossref Google Scholar). Following the addition of the forward primer andTaq DNA polymerase, the DNA was amplified for 35 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 42 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C). A single PCR fragment of 108 bp was subcloned into the PCR 1000 plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using an automated sequencer.cDNA CloningSequence analysis showed significant homology between the PCR fragment and mammalian MARCKS cDNAs. Therefore, this fragment was used as a probe to screen two λ gt10 cDNA libraries made from stage 11 and stage 17 Xenopusembryos (generously provided by Dr. Douglas Melton, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) under high stringency conditions. Positive clones were purified according to standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The EcoRI cDNA inserts from positive clones were subcloned into pBluescribe (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and characterized by restriction mapping. Restriction fragments were subcloned and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52367) Google Scholar) using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Sequences were analyzed with the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis package.Cloning of Genomic SequencesCloning was performed essentially as described above, except that a Xenopusgenomic λ FixII library (Stratagene) was used. Several positive clones were obtained, two of which were analyzed by restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blotting. A 2.6-kilobase pair AccI fragment was found in both clones that hybridized strongly to the cDNA probe. Therefore, this fragment was subjected to sequencing as described above.Analysis of MARCKS mRNA by RT-PCRAnalysis was performed as described previously (27Graff J.M. Thies R.S. Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Melton D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The two primers, Xmp12, and Xmp11, were based on the proximal 3′-untranslated region of the Xenopus MARCKS cDNA; their sequences were 5′-TTGTGATAATCAAAGGACTTT-3′ and 5′-CATGTATGGGTAATTGTCCA-3′, respectively.Plasmid Construction and Site-directed MutagenesisFor construction of the 1047-bp promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion gene, an SspI fragment extending from nucleotide −344 to −99 of the XenopusMARCKS 5′-flanking region (where +1 represents the initiation codon) was subcloned into a promoterless pCAT-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which had been cut with AccI and treated with Klenow to fill in the 5′-overhang. For construction of other CAT reporter genes, different lengths of the Xenopus MARCKS promoter were amplified by PCR, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under standard conditions (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 5′-primers were designed to contain a HindIII site, and the 3′-primers were designed to contain a XbaI site. The PCR products were then digested withHindIII and XbaI and subcloned between theHindIII and XbaI sites of the pCAT-Basic vector. In all cases, the PCR-derived fragments were sequenced to confirm sequence fidelity.Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites IIin vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Mutated clones were analyzed by restriction mapping and by sequencing to ensure they were otherwise identical to the wild type sequence except for the indicated mutations. The oligonucleotide sequences used for PCR and mutagenesis are available upon request.Protein ExtractsNuclear extracts from XTC-2 cells, Xenopus embryos, and mouse brains were prepared as described (20Leibham D.

BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 984-987PubMed Google Scholar) except that for the brain extracts, the final dialysis buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.Low/high salt embryo extracts were prepared by a modification of the method of Brewer et al. (21Brewer A.C. Guille M.J. Fear D.J. Partington G.A. Patient R.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pools of 10 embryos at each developmental stage were dejellied in 2% (w/v) cysteine-HCl (pH 8.0), washed in 0.1 × MBS and then snap-frozen in liquid N2and stored at −70 °C for no more than 1 week. Frozen embryos were homogenized by repeated pipetting in 100 μl (10 μl/embryo) of homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). The lysed mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of the clear liquid fraction located underneath the fat cake was carefully removed without disturbing the fat cake and was used as the low salt extract. The remaining 50 μl of the supernatant fraction containing the fat cake was discarded. The pellet was reextracted with 50 μl of the original homogenization buffer plus 300 mmKCl and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was diluted with 100 μl of homogenization buffer (without KCl) to adjust the final salt concentration to 100 mm KCl and was used as the high salt extract. The low and high salt extracts were used immediately without freezing.Cell Culture, Transfections, CAT Assays, and Luciferase AssaysXTC-2 cells (a generous gift from Dr. David J. Shapiro, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL) were maintained and transfected according to Smith and Tata (30Smith J.C. Tata J.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 635-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, these cells were maintained at room temperature in 70% (v/v) Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% (v/v) heat-treated fetal calf serum, 100 mm HEPES, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4. The medium was switched to 70% (v/v) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Sigma), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4, 3–7 days before transfection. One day before transfection, approximately 106 cells were plated out on a 100-mm culture dish, and the medium was changed to fresh medium 3 h prior to transfection. DNA-CaPO4co-precipitation (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used to transfect 15 μg of recombinant CAT constructs and 5 μg of a pGL2 luciferase vector (Promega) in each plate. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed and fed with fresh medium. Cells from each plate were harvested in 100 μl of 0.25m Tris-Cl (pH 7.8)/5 mm EDTA 48 h after transfection and broken by four cycles of quick freezing in liquid N2 and thawing at 37 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70 °C or were assayed for CAT activity and luciferase activity immediately.For CAT assays, 50 μl of protein extract was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5 μl of [14C]chloramphenicol (0.025 mCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) and 5 μl of 4 mmacetyl-coenzyme A (Sigma) in a total volume of 120 μl containing 0.25m Tris (pH 7.8). The reaction products were extracted with 300 μl of xylene and then back-extracted twice with 150 μl of 0.25m Tris (pH 7.8), after which 200-μl aliquots of the xylene phase were subjected to liquid scintillation counting.For luciferase assays, 20-μl protein extracts were assayed using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) and a LB 9501/16 luminometer (Berthold System Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) according to the manufacturers' instructions.Microinjection of Embryos and CAT AssayThe procedures for maintenance of frogs, hormonal stimulation of egg laying, and in vitro fertilization have been described previously (13Wilson C. Cross G.S. Woodland H.R. Cell. 1986; 47: 589-599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One blastomere of two-cell stage embryos was injected with 10 nl of a solution containing 75 pg of the supercoiled DNA construct. The injections were performed in 1 × MBS containing 5% (w/v) Ficoll, and the injected embryos were kept in the same solution for a period of 3–5 h at room temperature. After that, the incubation medium was changed to 0.1 × MBS, and the embryos were allowed to develop until the desired stage. All embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (31Nieuwkoop P. Faber P. Normal Table of Xenopus Laevis. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Groups of 10–20 embryos were homogenized in a buffer containing 0.25 m Tris (pH 7.8), 5 mm EDTA (20 μl/embryo) by repeated pipetting. The homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and five embryo-equivalents of supernatant were assayed for CAT activity as described above.Gel Shift and DNase I Protection AnalysisFor gel shift analysis, plasmid restriction fragments or synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.; Table I) were labeled by filling in the 5′-overhangs with [α-32P]dCTP and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using standard methods (32Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out with the appropriate amount of protein and 2 × 104 cpm probe in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 μg of poly(dI-dC). One μg of the XTC-2 nuclear extract, three embryo equivalents of embryo nuclear extract, or one embryo equivalent of low/high salt extract was used in each binding reaction. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 45 min and then separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 × TBE buffer (0.0045 m Tris borate, 0.001 mEDTA). For competition analysis, 0.1 μg of unlabeled probe was added to the reaction mixture together with the other components. For supershift analysis, antibodies were incubated with the protein extracts for 20 min before the other components of the mixture were added. The anti-human NF-YA or anti-human NF-YB IgG were purchased from Rockland (Gibertsville, PA); 2 μg of IgG was used in each reaction. The anti-Sp1 antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Jonathan M.

The DNA probe was derived from the chimeric CAT construct containing the 245-bp (−344/−99) MARCKS promoter cloned between HindIII and XbaI sites. Ten μg of this construct was digested with XbaI and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled DNA was ethanol-precipitated and digested with HindIII to release the 245-bp promoter insert, which was then purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 105 cpm of the purified probe was incubated with 50 μg of XTC-2 nuclear extract in a final volume of 50 μl containing 5 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, 5 μl of 1 μg/ml DNase I (Promega) in 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mmCaCl2 was added to the reaction for exactly 1 min.

The sample was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was separated on a 6% sequencing gel and subjected to autoradiography.DISCUSSIONThese investigations into the transcriptional regulation of theXenopus MARCKS gene revealed a promoter region of about 250 bp that was significantly conserved between Xenopus and other animal species. The corresponding region of the human MARCKS promoter was able to drive high level expression of a reporter gene in mouse fibroblasts (11Harlan D.M. Graff J.M. Stumpo D.J. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B.

https://openalex.org/W2124304811,"We have characterized the transcription unit of a murine Hox gene in the fourth paralogous group,Hoxd4. We have identified two Hoxd4transcription start sites by S1 analysis. The upstream promoter (P2) is 5.2 kilobase pairs upstream from the coding region, while the downstream promoter (P1) is 1.1 kilobase pairs distant. Both promoters bear a cluster of start sites. Multiple transcripts were identified by Northern blot, originating from both promoters and multiple polyadenylation signals. Expression of P1 transcripts in the neural tube shows an anterior border at the rhombomere 6/7 boundary, corresponding to previous reports (Gaunt, S. J., Krumlauf, R., and Duboule, D. (1989) Development 107, 131–141; Morrison, A., Moroni, M. C., Ariza-McNaughton, L., Krumlauf, R., and Mavilio, F. (1996) Development 122, 1895–1907). A more posterior boundary in the central nervous system was observed for P2 transcripts. We observed strong expression up to somite 6 and weak expression in somite 5, correlating with the phenotype of Hoxd4 null mutant mice (Horan, G. S. B., Nagy Kovàcs, E., Behringer, R. R., and Featherstone, M. S. (1995) Dev. Biol. 169, 359–372). In response to retinoic acid, expression from P1 in the hindbrain was anteriorized after 4 or 24 h of treatment. P2 transcripts seemed to be less responsive and/or to have an indirect response to retinoic acid. The long 5′-untranslated region found in all Hoxd4 transcripts suggests that translation does not occur by a classical ribosome scanning mechanism.

The long 5′-untranslated region found in all Hoxd4 transcripts suggests that translation does not occur by a classical ribosome scanning mechanism. Hox genes encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors that specify positional identity along the anteroposterior and appendicular axes of the developing embryo (4Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Hox homologs can be found from Hydra to humans in the animal kingdom. This high degree of conservation throughout evolution suggests that these genes are indispensable participants in embryonic development. Mammals have 39 Hox genes, organized in four clusters, namely Hox A, B, C, and D(4Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 5Zeltser L. Desplan C. Heintz N. Development. 1996; 122: 2475-2484PubMed Google Scholar). These multiple clusters are the result of duplication events from the original cluster. Therefore, corresponding genes are distributed in the same order along each cluster and are called paralogs. During embryogenesis, Hox genes are sequentially expressed both in time and space, according to their position in the cluster. The genes at the 3′-end are the first to be expressed and have the most anterior borders of expression. The genes more to the 5′-end are expressed later in time and have more posterior domains of expression (4Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). To safeguard their correct expression and function, Hoxgenes must be under precise regulation. Misexpression caused by either loss or gain of function has shown that the mutant mice present transformations and malformations that can affect central nervous system organization, somite derivatives, limbs, and other structures (4Krumlauf R.

Featherstone M.S. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The Hoxd4 gene bears an autoregulatory element and a retinoic acid response element in its 5′-flanking region, and both elements are functional in vitro in transfected P19 cells (8Pöpperl H.

The retinoic acid response element is highly conserved in the human homolog (10Moroni M.C. Vigano M.A. Mavilio F. Mech.

Moroni M.C. Ariza-McNaughton L. Krumlauf R. Mavilio F. Development. 1996; 122: 1895-1907PubMed Google Scholar). Although two regulatory elements have been mapped, a more basic feature of the murine Hoxd4 transcription unit remains unknown, the transcription start site(s). To better understand the regulation of murine Hoxd4, we have characterized its transcription unit. We have mapped two promoters, each one composed of a cluster of start sites. A complex splicing pattern gives rise to transcripts originating from the upstream start sites. We demonstrate that both promoters are active in the embryo and that a number of transcripts are expressed as a result of alternative promoter and/or polyadenylation signal usage. The anterior expression boundary of the upstream promoter is posterior to that of the downstream promoter and thus follows the colinearity rule. In addition, the two promoters respond differentially to RA induction. First strand synthesis and tailing were performed under the conditions recommended by Life Technologies, Inc. 5′-RACE kit, except for the reverse transcriptase reaction, which was incubated at 42 and 37 °C for 30 min each (11Lipkowitz S. Gobel V. Varterasian M.L. Nakahara K. Tchorz K. Kirsch I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21065-21071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μg of kidney or 11.5-day-old embryo total RNA was used for first strand cDNA synthesis. The RNA was annealed to antisense primer a (5′-CTCGCCTAGGTAGCCACCCC-3′) ore (5′-GAGATGGCGGCTTAATTGCC-3′) (Figs. 1 and 2). The cDNA was amplified using an antisense oligonucleotide from Hoxd4, primer b (5′-GCAAATATTCCTCGCACGGA-3′) or primer f(5′-TCCTAGAATTCGAGCAATTTACCT-3′), and an anchor primer complementary to the oligo(dC) tail (5′-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′) supplied by the manufacturer. PCR conditions were 0.4 μm primer, 0.2 mm dNTP mix, 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), and PCR reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.01% Tween 20). Cycling parameters were one long cycle (95 °C for 5 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 40 min) followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 3 min (11Lipkowitz S. Gobel V. Varterasian M.L. Nakahara K. Tchorz K. Kirsch I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21065-21071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the second round of amplification, 5 μl (110) of the first PCR reaction was used as template, and the long cycle was omitted. Nested antisense oligonucleotide c (5′-TCCTTACTCACCATCGCCTG-3′) org (5′-TTTCGGATCCCGCTGCTGCTGCTTCTGCTG-3′) and a shorter version of the anchor primer (5′-CUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGRCGACTAGTAC-3′) were used in the second PCR. For both rounds of PCR, the enzyme was added to the reaction after the denaturation step.Figure 2Hoxd4 transcripts are composed of multiple exons.

T-tailed vector was made by linearizing pBluescript KS with EcoRV and incubating with Taq polymerase in the presence of 2 mm dTTP for 2 h at 70 °C. The T-tailed vector was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. RACE clones were sequenced by the standard Sanger method (Pharmacia T7 sequencing kit). S1 analysis was performed exactly as described (12Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Wiley Interscience, Boston1989: 4.6.1-4.6.13Google Scholar). For single-stranded DNA probes, antisense oligonucleotideh (5′-TGGTAGAGAAGCTTAGAGG-3′) or d(5′-GGCTGTACAATTTCACCAGGCAAAGTCGATCATCCTGG-3′) was kinase-labeled, extended with Klenow using genomic murine Hoxd4 as template, and linearized with HindII or KpnI, respectively. 5 × 104 cpm of probe was hybridized to 50 μg of 11.5-day-old embryo total RNA. The BamHI-AccI probe was a 2.1-kb fragment double-stranded, labeled at theAccI end. An RNase protection assay was performed to verify if the 5′-end of the RACE clone (shown in Fig. 1 b) corresponded to a transcription start site (data not shown). Probe synthesis and hybridization were carried out as described (13Nédellec P. Dveksler G.S. Daniels E. Turbide C. Chow B. Basile A.A. Holmes K.V. Beauchemin N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4525-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNase T2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for digestion (14Saccomanno C.F. Bordonaro M. Chen J.S. Nordstrom J.L. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 847-849Google Scholar), and protected fragments were resolved in a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. The probe was made by subcloning a 493-bp EcoRI-KpnI fragment from the Hoxd4 5′ region into pBluescribe (Stratagene), which was called EK (Fig. 4 a). The template was linearized with EcoRI, and the antisense probe was synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). 5 × 104 cpm of probe was hybridized to 30 μg of 11.5-day-old embryo total RNA. A control reaction using tRNA was run in parallel. Northern blot was performed essentially as described by Chow et al. (15Chow L.M.L. Ratcliffe M.J.H. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (isolated using the Dynabeads system, Dynal) from 11.5-day-old mouse embryo was used. The 32P-labeled probe was added at 1 × 106 cpm/ml. Probe H-X is homologous to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR), and it is aHindIII-XbaI fragment about 400 bp long. Probe A is a 323-bp-long PCR fragment, from −1811 to −1489 from the coding region. Probe B is a PstI-EcoRI fragment within the intronic region just upstream of exon 5. Probe C is a 282-bp-long PCR fragment, from −402 to −121 from the coding region. To avoid cross-hybridization across paralog group 4, we designed probe C outside a region of high homology among the members of this group (from −120 up to the coding region). The blot hybridized with probe C was run alongside commercial size markers (Promega). Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed essentially as described (16Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), incorporating one extra step (17Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Development. 1992; 116: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Just before prehybridization, embryos were treated with 0.1% borohydride in PBT (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 20 min at room temperature followed by three PBT washes. The alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) was preadsorbed with embryo powder prepared as described (16Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) and used at a 1:5000 dilution. Embryos were incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C; washed the next day, with five changes of the washing solution; and left overnight in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm levamisole). Color reaction was performed as described (16Wilkinson D.G. Nieto M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Single-stranded RNA probes containing digoxigenin were synthesized from linearized template DNA exactly as directed by the manufacturer (DIG RNA labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim). Probe BgH is a 950-bp-longBglII-HindIII fragment of murine Hoxd4starting in the homeobox, cloned into pGem-1 (Promega) (1Gaunt S.J. Krumlauf R. Duboule D. Development. 1989; 107: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar). The template was linearized with EcoRI, and the antisense strand was synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Probe Sma is a 470-bp Sma fragment starting 370 bp upstream of theHoxd4 coding region, cloned into pBluescribe. Probe EK is a 493-bp EcoRI-KpnI fragment 5′ of the downstream start site, cloned into pBluescribe. Both templates were linearized with EcoRI, and the probes were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The Krox20 probe was generously provided by Dr. D. Wilkinson. Pregnant CD-1 female mice were administered RA essentially as described by Conlon and Rossant (17Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Development. 1992; 116: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A stock solution of 25 mg/ml all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) in Me2SO was diluted 10 times in corn oil just before use, and 0.2 ml was delivered by gavage for a final dose of approximately 20 mg/kg of maternal body weight. Control mice were administered the same mixture without RA. For treatments of 4 h (short treatment), mothers were treated at 8 a.m. on embryonic day 8.5, and the embryos were recovered at noon of the same day. For treatments of 24 h (long treatment), mothers were treated at noon on embryonic day 8.5, and the embryos were recovered at noon on the following day. The day of appearance of the vaginal plug was taken as 0.5 days postcoitus. For all treatments, we analyzed between 10 and 25 embryos. To map the transcriptional start site of Hoxd4, we performed an initial S1 analysis with mouse kidney RNA. Using aBamHI-AccI fragment as a probe, we observed two end points of protection (indicated as x and y in Fig. 1 a). This suggested that murine Hoxd4 may have two promoters, as does its human homolog (18Cianetti L. Cristofaro A.D. Zappavigna V. Bottero L. Boccoli G. Testa U. Russo G. Boncinelli E. Peschle C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4361-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We designed a 5′-RACE strategy based on the S1 end point of protection y(Fig. 1 b). The first RACE product was obtained using oligonucleotide a as a primer for the reverse transcriptase reaction and using primers b and c for each round of PCR, respectively (Fig. 1 b). Hoxd4-specific fragments (evaluated by Southern blot; data not shown) were cloned into pBluescript and sequenced. One clone, 140 bp long, showed homology to mouse Hoxd4 sequence; however, the homology was not contiguous. The 5′-end of the clone started at position −1372 from the coding region, and at position −1300 the homology was interrupted. The sequence continued from position −402, and the 3′-end of the clone corresponded to primer c (Fig. 1 b). Analysis of the genomic sequence flanking the point of discontinuity showed homology to the conserved consensus for 5′-donor and 3′-acceptor splice sites. An intron between positions −1300 and −402 within the 5′-UTR was thus delimited. Interestingly, neither splice site is conserved in the human HOXD4 sequence, which demonstrates a divergence between the two species (Fig.2 b). RNase protection analysis showed a protection of the probe by sequences upstream of the 5′-end of the RACE product. This demonstrated that the RACE clone 5′-end did not correspond to a transcription start site (data not shown). S1 analyses were performed on sequences further upstream in an attempt to map the start site. An S1 analysis product was finely mapped to a cytidine at position −1817 from the coding region, which is preceded by PyAG, the known consensus for a 3′-splice acceptor site (see Fig. 2 a). To test the possibility of another splice event, we designed a second 5′-RACE strategy (Fig.2 a). For the second RACE product, primer e was used for the reverse transcriptase reaction, and nested primersf and g were used for the two rounds of PCR, respectively. Specific fragments (evaluated by Southern blot; data not shown) were cloned into a T-tailed vector and sequenced. Eleven clones contained a sequence whose 3′-end corresponded to primer gbut became discontiguous at position −1817, at the S1 end point of protection. The diverged 5′-end of these products was composed of three juxtaposed sequences of 85, 79, and 36 bp with homology toHoxd4 genomic sequences in a region between 4 and 5 kb upstream of the open reading frame. We compared the genomic flanking residues of these three segments and observed a very good homology with splice site consensus sequences (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, this cDNA clone was composed of four exons, which we named 1, 2, 3, and 4. Overall, the two cDNA clones demonstrated that the transcript starting from an upstream promoter undergoes several splice events (Fig. 4 a) and therefore is composed of multiple exons. We had yet to confirm whether the 5′-end of the second RACE clone corresponded to a transcription start site. For that purpose, we did an S1 analysis using a probe made by extension from primer h, within exon 1, and extending up to a HindII site (Fig.3, a and c). We obtained 10 end points of protection covering 70 nucleotides. These were further confirmed on a second S1 analysis using a longer probe linearized at the Pst site and gave one more protection (data not shown). This gave a total of 11 start sites spanning a region of 120 nucleotides. In this manner, we mapped a distal promoter (P2) 5.2 kb upstream from the coding region, whose transcripts are processed by the splicing machinery to yield a 5′-UTR of 1.1 kb (Fig.4 a). The original S1 end point of protection x (Fig. 1 a) was confirmed by an S1 analysis using a probe 183 nucleotides long, extended from oligonucleotide d and linearized with KpnI (Fig.3, b and c). This S1 product was analyzed beside a sequencing reaction, and the promoter (P1) was finely mapped. P1 is composed of a cluster of four start sites, ATGG, at positions −1137 to −1140 from the coding region (Fig. 3 b). This maps very close to a human HOXD4 start site (18Cianetti L. Cristofaro A.D. Zappavigna V. Bottero L. Boccoli G. Testa U. Russo G. Boncinelli E. Peschle C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4361-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and suggests a conservation of regulatory elements between the two species. In the human HOXD4 gene, there is a downstream promoter 21 bp 5′ from the coding region (18Cianetti L. Cristofaro A.D. Zappavigna V. Bottero L. Boccoli G. Testa U. Russo G. Boncinelli E. Peschle C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4361-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether an equivalent start site was present in the murine gene, we performed an RNase protection assay spanning that region. However, we were unable to detect any transcripts originating from this area (data not shown). Northern blot analysis had shown that multiple transcripts of Hoxd4 are present in the mouse embryo (7Featherstone M.S. Baron A. Gaunt S.J. Mattei M.-G. Duboule D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4760-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We wished to correlate these multiple transcripts with the usage of the two promoters identified. For this purpose, we did Northern blots using probes derived from the 5′-UTR (Fig. 4 a). Probe A should only detect transcripts originating at P2. Probe B should detect transcripts originating from P1 and potential unspliced transcripts originating from P2 (if there are any). Probe C detects transcripts originating at both promoters. With all three probes, we detected three major bands of similar sizes, which are 2.6, 4.2, and 5.6 kb, based on commercial molecular size markers run alongside blot C (Fig.4 b and data not shown). The 2.6-kb band corresponds to the predicted size of transcripts originating from either P1 or P2 (assuming that all introns have been spliced out of the P2 transcript). The two known poly(A) signals are 270 and 572 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon. 2M. S. Featherstone, unpublished results. We believe that the broad 2.6-kb band comprises transcripts terminating at both of these sites. In the human HOXD4 homolog, there are poly(A) signals 3 kb downstream of the stop codon (18Cianetti L. Cristofaro A.D. Zappavigna V. Bottero L. Boccoli G. Testa U. Russo G. Boncinelli E. Peschle C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4361-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility of additional poly(A) signals further downstream in the mouseHoxd4 homolog as well. Using aHindIII-Xba fragment as a probe (Fig.4 a), we detected two bands corresponding to the larger size range, at 4.2 and 5.6 kb (data not shown). Based on this result, we propose two additional polyadenylation signals further downstream. Alternatively, there could be only one additional poly(A) signal, and the transcripts would be subject to additional post-transcriptional processing at the 3′-end. Either option would result in two more variations in the 3′-UTR. Therefore, we conclude that both promoters are used in the mouse embryo and that the variety of molecular weights detected in the Northern blots is due to the presence and usage of various poly(A) signals. Having demonstrated that at least twoHoxd4 promoters are used in the mouse, we wanted to examine how these promoters are regulated in the mouse embryo, for which we used whole mount in situ hybridization. We first hybridized 9.5-day embryos with probe BgH (Fig. 4 a). Expression in the CNS confirmed the anterior boundary at the border of rhombomeres 6 and 7 (Fig. 5, a andb), as earlier described (1Gaunt S.J. Krumlauf R. Duboule D. Development. 1989; 107: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar). In the somitic mesoderm, expression was strong in somite 6 and posterior and was weak in somite 5 (Fig. 5 b). There was strong expression in the fore limb bud, as previously shown (19Dollé P. Izpisúa-Belmonte J.-C. Falkenstein H. Renucci A. Duboule D. Nature. 1989; 342: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and along the tail bud. In addition, we detected expression in the fourth branchial arch (Fig.5 a). We used different probes to compare the expression of the P1 and P2 promoters. Probe EK detects only transcripts originating at P2 (Fig.4 a). Probe Sma detects transcripts originating at both promoters (Fig. 4 a). Thus, expression domains uniquely detected by the P1-P2 Sma probe reflect the specific activity of the P1 promoter. In both 8.5- and 9.5-day-old embryos, the staining was different for the two probes, especially in the CNS, thus demonstrating differential activity of the two promoters (Fig. 5, c and d). The staining with the P1-P2 Sma probe reproduced the pattern observed with probe BgH, which is consistent with the predicted ability of both probes to detect all transcripts from the Hoxd4 locus (Fig.5 c, embryo on bottom; d, embryo onleft). However, transcripts detected with the P2-specific EK probe have an anterior border in the CNS that is more posterior (Fig.5 c, embryo on top; d, embryo onright). This result shows that the more anterior expression domain in the CNS is due to P1 activation but not P2. In the other domains, including the entire somitic column, the activity of both promoters overlaps (Fig. 5, c and d). Both mouse and human Hoxd4 transcripts are induced in cell culture upon treatment with RA. A retinoic acid response element is conserved in the genes of both species (2Morrison A. Moroni M.C. Ariza-McNaughton L. Krumlauf R. Mavilio F. Development. 1996; 122: 1895-1907PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pöpperl H. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 10Moroni M.C. Vigano M.A. Mavilio F. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), located between the P1 and P2 promoters as mapped here (Fig. 4 a). We wished to examine how each promoter would respond to retinoic acid in vivo. After a 4-h RA treatment on day 8.5, embryos hybridized with the P1-P2 Sma probe showed an anterior shift of Hoxd4 expression in the hindbrain. This anteriorization is especially evident in embryos labeled simultaneously for Hoxd4 and Krox20 (Fig.6 a). In the RA-treated embryos, the Hoxd4 boundary is pushed anteriorly toward r5 (Fig. 6 a, embryo on the right). Embryos stained with P2-specific EK probe showed no difference in expression after 4 h of RA treatment (data not shown). The 24-h RA treatment also led to anteriorization in the CNS of transcripts detected with the P1-P2 Sma probe. The anterior border is now halfway overlapping with the otic vesicle at the rhombomere 5 and 6 boundary, which is one rhombomere more anterior than the normal border (Fig. 6 b, embryo on the right). Embryos stained with the P2- specific EK probe showed anteriorization in one limited domain, ventral to the neural tube (Fig. 6 c, embryo on theright). Overall, these results suggest that embryonic Hoxd4expression is responsive to RA treatment. This response is primarily from P1, which is affected after 4 h of treatment. Thus, P1 is more sensitive to RA and probably subject to a direct effect of RA. P2 showed a delayed and limited response; therefore, we concluded that it is less sensitive to RA and responds indirectly to its action. We have analyzed various aspects of the murine Hoxd4transcription unit. First, we mapped two transcription start sites that drive Hoxd4 expression and dissected the ensemble of transcripts present in 11.5-day-old embryos. Second, we characterized the differential usage of these promoters in the mouse at 8.5 and 9.5 days postcoitus and their response to exogenous retinoic acid. Both the upstream and the downstream promoters of murine Hoxd4 are composed of a cluster of start sites and do not bear a recognizable TATA box. TATA-less promoters were originally found in so-called “house-keeping” genes but later became a common feature especially among genes that are differentially expressed during development, such as oncogenes, growth factors, growth factor receptors, and transcription factors (20Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of a TATA box, another class of binding sites might be present, the initiator motif (21Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). There are different classes of initiatior elements, and they can bear binding sites for specific DNA-binding proteins (22Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nuc"

The two ATP-dependent partial reactions (Reactions 2 and 4) occur at different sites, and there is now convincing evidence (23Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miles B.W. Mareya S.M. Post L.E. Post D.J. Chang S.H. Raushel F.M.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that CPS.A catalyzes the activation of bicarbonate, whereas the phosphorylation of carbamate to form carbamoyl phosphate is catalyzed by CPS.B. The site of carbamate formation (Reaction 3) is not known, but the rate of production of NH3 and carboxy phosphate is precisely coordinated, and once formed, these intermediates probably react spontaneously. Although CPS.A and CPS.B have different specific functions when fused together in the wild-type protein, the isolated domains are functionally equivalent. When CPS.A and CPS.B were separately cloned (27Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13762-13769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the half-molecules could each catalyze both partial reactions and the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia. When the mammalian domains are fused to the GLN domain, glutamine is hydrolyzed and the ammonia thus produced is used for carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. Thus, the catalytic sites are located within both CPS.A and CPS.B. There is extensive evidence that CPS.A and CPS.B domains are in turn comprised of subdomains. The CPSase model (15Simmer J.P.

The conclusions of the biochemical studies are consistent with the recently solved x-ray structure (65) of E. coli carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase. To establish whether the subdomains of CPS.A and CPS.B correspond to autonomously folded substructural elements with specific functions, we have separately cloned and expressed some of the individual E. coli CPSase subdomains and combinations of subdomains. The 7.9-kb plasmid, pLLK12 encoding both subunits of E. coli CPSase, and the 6.8-kb plasmid, pHN12, which encodes the E. coli CPSase large subunit, were kindly provided by Dr. Carol Lusty (The Public Health Research Institute of the City of New York) as were the E. colistrains, RC50 and L673 (28Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) which are each defective in both thecarA and carB genes, encoding the E. coli CPSase GLN and CPS subunits, respectively. The strain, L673, is also defective in the Lon protease. The plasmid, pABGB6, encodes theE. coli GLN and CPSase B subdomain of E. coliCPSase. 2A. Bouvier, H. Guy, and D. R. Evans, unpublished results. The recombinant proteins, which are expressed constitutively under the control of thecarAB promoter, were isolated from 60-ml cultures of transformed L673 cells grown to stationary phase (28Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in 3 ml of 50 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0, and broken by sonication for 2 min at 4 °C. The sonicate was centrifuged at 29,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Transformation was carried out by the Hanahan procedure (48Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985Google Scholar). Restriction digests, ligations, and other DNA methods were carried out using standard protocols (49Maniatis T. Fritsch E.R. Sambrook I. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The plasmid, pHGGA12, encoding the E. coli GLN and CPS A1-A2 subdomains (Fig. 1, residues 1–359), was constructed by reacting the plasmid, pLLK12, which encodes the wild-type CPS, with NspV (2730) and SmaI (site in the vector). The 5.4-kb fragment was then religated using T4 DNA ligase following treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The expressed protein includes an additional 4 residues from A3 and 7 residues from the vector appended to the carboxyl end of A1-A2. The plasmid, pHGGA12, was then reacted with BssHII-(1932) and ApaI-(1688) and the ends made flush using mung bean nuclease prior to ligation. The resulting 5.2-kb plasmid, pHGGA2, encodes the E. coli GLN and CPSA2-(111–359) subdomain and 15 amino acid residues derived from the amino end of A1. The carboxyl end of the protein is the same as A1-A2 described above. The construct encoding B1-B2 (residues 560–892) was derived from the 6.4-kb plasmid, pABGB6, which encodes the E. coli GLN subunit, the CPS.B subdomains, and part of the carboxyl end of CPS.A. The plasmid was reacted with AvaI-(4339) and SstI (in the vector) and the ends were made flush using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and then religated. The resulting 5.6-kb plasmid, pHGB12, encodes the GLN subunit and CPSB12 and included an additional 53 residues derived from A3 and 7 residues from B3 on the amino and carboxyl ends, respectively. The plasmid, pHN12, encoding the large subunit of E. coliCPS, was reacted with ApaI-(1688) andPinAI-(3616), and the resulting 4.4-kb fragment encodingE. coli B2 and B3 was reacted with the Klenow fragment and T4 DNA ligase to yield pHGB2B3. The plasmid, pHGB2, encoding only the B2 subdomain (residue 658–892), was constructed by reacting pHGB2B with AvaI-(4339) and SstI (in the vector). The 3.5-kb fragment was then reacted with the Klenow fragment and religated. The recombinant protein has the 7 amino acid residues of the amino end of B3 and 4 residues from the vector appended to the carboxyl end. All of the plasmids, except pHGB2, also contain the carA gene so that the GLN subunit is also expressed as a separate polypeptide. The four recombinant plasmids constructed for this study also encoded the first 15 amino acids of the E. coli CPS subunit which are appended to the amino end of the expressed protein. It is very unlikely that the presence of these residues alters the function of the recombinant proteins, since the amino end of the CPSase synthetase domain is poorly conserved among members of this family of proteins, both in sequence and in the number of residues preceding the core A1 domain. Moreover 12 of these same 15 residues (50Guy H.I. Rotgeri A. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19913-19918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were deleted from the amino end of the CPS.A domain without effect on the properties of the E. coli enzyme. Nevertheless, we are now refining these constructs to remove these additional residues and more precisely define the limits of the functional domains. The procedures for the isolation of the wild type E. coli CPSase (28Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the CPS subunit (51Rubino S.D. Nyunoya H. Lusty C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4382-4386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from pLLK12 and pHN12, respectively, were described previously. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye-binding method (52Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) and by scanning Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. SDS-gel electrophoresis was carried out on 7.5–15% linear polyacrylamide gradients (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). The gels were scanned, and the concentration of the individual proteins was determined by measuring the ratio of peak density to total density in a given lane and the total amount of protein applied to the gel. The background density was subtracted, and all measurements were made within the linear range of the densitometer. Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity was assayed using a radiometric procedure (7Coleman P.F. Suttle D.P. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6379-6385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mally M.I. Grayson D.R. Evans D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6647-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas the GLNase activity was measured (23Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) spectrophotometrically. The only modification was that the GLNase assay buffer also contained 15% Me2SO and 2.5% glycerol. The molecular mass was determined by gel filtration chromatography using an open 1.9 × 42-cm Sephacryl S-300 column equilibrated with 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. Alternatively, a Pharmacia FPLC system fitted with a 1.6 × 50-cm Sephacryl S-300 high resolution (HR 16/50) Pharmacia column was used. The column was equilibrated in 0.1 mKH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min at room temperature. Column fractions were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, SDS-gel electrophoresis, and CPSase assays. The column was calibrated with carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and blue dextran. Extensive sequence identity (15Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that E. coli and mammalian CPSases have common subdomain structures. We elected to work with E. coli CPSase, rather than the mammalian enzyme, because the level of expression of the bacterial protein in E. coli tends to be higher. The assignment of theE. coli CPS subdomain junctions, shown in Fig.1, was based on the CAD substructural analysis (29Kim H. Kelly R.E. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7177-7184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by aligning the sequences of the mammalian and bacterial proteins. The construction (Fig. 2) of the four recombinant plasmids used in this study is described under “Experimental Procedures.” Plasmid pHGGA12 encodes the fused A1-A2 subdomains; pHGGB12 encodes B1-B2, and pHGGA2 encodes the A2 subdomain. These three plasmids also contain the intactcarA gene so that the GLN subunit is also expressed as a separate polypeptide chain. The plasmid pHGB2, encoding the B2 subdomain, does not include the carA gene. In L673 cells transformed with pHGGA12 and pHGGB12, the 42-kDa GLN subunit was expressed along with the 40- and a 44-kDa fragment, respectively. A1-A2 and B1-B2 were produced (Fig.3) as soluble, stable proteins representing 21 and 14% of the total cellular protein, respectively. Transformation of the same strain with pHGGA2 and pHGB2 produced much lower levels, 0.4% of the soluble 31-kDa A2 and 28-kDa B2 subdomains. The function of the recombinant proteins was assayed in cell extracts prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The A1-A2 and B1-B2 subdomains were both found to catalyze ammonia-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthesis. The ATP saturation curves (Fig.4 A) of A1-A2 exhibit typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K m for ATP (TableI) that was about 3-fold higher than the value obtained for native E. coli CPSase. Thek cat2 values of A1-A2 are approximately the same as that of the parent molecule. For B1-B2 (Fig.4 B and Table I), the k cat values are lower. This result is probably due to appreciable substrate inhibition exhibited by B1-B2, which made it difficult to obtain accurate values for the kinetic parameters.Table ISummary of kinetic parameters from ATP saturation curvesProteinGln-CPSaseNH3-CPSaseK mV maxk cat1-aCalculated from the V max assuming a molecular mass of 120 kDa for E. coli CPSase synthetase subunit, and 40, 44, 31, and 28 kDa for A1-A2, B1-B2, A2 and B2, respectively.

Minor groove-specific drugs inhibit TIF-IB binding, with higher concentrations needed to disrupt preformed complexes because of drug exclusion by bound TIF-IB. TIF-IB/DNA interactions were mapped by hydroxyl radical and uranyl nitrate footprinting. TIF-IB contacts four minor grooves in its binding site. TIF-IB and DNA wrap around each other in a right-handed superhelix of high pitch, so the upstream and downstream contacts are on opposite faces of the helix.

Extensive in vitro and in vivo analyses have shown that efficient transcription of the rRNA gene by RNA polymerase I requires formation of a stable transcription factor-promoter DNA complex, the committed complex (for review, see Refs. 1Paule M.R. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar and 2Paule M.R. Conaway R. Conaway J. Transcription: Mechanism and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 83-106Google Scholar). In most species, two regions of the rRNA promoter, the core promoter element (CPE) 1The abbreviations used are: CPE, core promoter element; UPE, upstream promoter element; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TIF-IB, transcription initiation factor-IB; TAF, TBP-associated factor; UBF, upstream binding factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CREB, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; CRE, cyclic AMP response element; ddH2O, double distilled H2O; MPE-Fe, methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II); bp, base pair(s); DMS, dimethyl sulfate. and upstream promoter element (UPE), participate in expression of the rRNA gene and formation of the committed complex. The CPE is located between −50 and +10 relative to the transcription start site (position +1), is absolutely required in all organisms, and is sufficient in some for initiation. It is the primary binding site for the TBP-containing transcription factor. The UPE is located farther upstream, from approximately −150 to −110, and acts primarily to stimulate transcription. It has a variable requirement between species; at one end of the spectrum,Acanthamoeba castellanii has no UPE discernible in vitro (3Kownin P. Iida C.T. Brown-Shimer S. Paule M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 6237-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We (4Radebaugh C.A. Gong X. Bartholomew B. Paule M.R. J. Biol.

The Plant J. 1995; 8: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown recently that the CPE can be subdivided into an element that interacts intimately with TIF-IB and an element that functions like the initiator element (Inr) of some RNA polymerase II promoters, interacting with a specific TAFI. The UPE and CPE are important because they serve as the binding sites for two RNA polymerase I transcription factors, UBF and TIF-IB (also known as SL1, factor D, Rib1, or core-binding factor) respectively. These two proteins interact, by mechanisms that are still unclear but apparently involve DNA looping (6Bazett-Jones D.P. Leblanc B. Herfort M. Moss T. Science. 1994; 264: 1134-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), to form a stable initiation complex capable of directing specific RNA polymerase I recruitment through multiple rounds of transcription. The need for UBF is variable between species; UBF is required in human and Xenopus (7Bell S.P. Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Tjian R.

Cell. 1987; 50: 693-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, TIF-IB is, by elimination, the fundamental transcription factor for rRNA genes, recruiting RNA polymerase I in the next step of the initiation process (16Paule M.R. Nature. 1990; 344: 819-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). TIF-IB has recently been purified to homogeneity from several eukaryotic species, including human (17Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), mouse (18Eberhard D. Tora L. Egly J.-M. Grummt I.

Paule, manuscript in preparation.Biochemical analysis has shown that TIF-IB consists of TBP and several TAFI factors. The RNA polymerase I TAFs vary in size and number depending on the species from which they were isolated. For example, human TAFI factors have molecular masses of 110, 63, and 48 kDa, whereas yeast TAFI factors are 102, 66, and 60 kDa. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis has revealed that homogeneous A. castellanii TIF-IB consists of TBP and four TAFI factors of 145, 99, 96, and 91 kDa, all of which specifically cross-link to various regions in the promoter (19Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Curiously, this is one more TAFI than in yeast or vertebrates. The genes for the human, mouse, and yeast TAFIfactors have been cloned (12Lalo D. Steffan J.S. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. J. Biol.

Unexpectedly, the lower and higher eukaryotic TAFI factors show no significant homology at either the nucleotide or amino acid level. This lack of similarity of RNA polymerase I TAFI factors from distantly related species is consistent with the poor conservation of rRNA promoter primary sequence and their species-specific behavior (22Grummt I. Roth E. Paule M.R. Nature. 1982; 296: 173-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), mediated mainly through these fundamental transcription factors (7Bell S.P. Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Bell S.P. Jantzen H.-M. Tjian R.

Biol. 1989; 9: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, rRNA promoters do exhibit a common variation from canonical B-DNA in groove width, base tilt, and axis linearity along their length (25Marilley M. Pasero P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that promoter recognition could involve interactions other than primary sequence. Indeed, UBF does not bind a common primary sequence, but instead recognizes DNA structure (8Pikaard C.S. Smith S.D. Reeder R.H. Rothblum L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3810-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Copenhaver G.P. Putnam C.D. Denton M.L. Pikaard C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2651-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Little is known about how the fundamental transcription factors for RNA polymerase I interact with DNA. In most cases, the affinity of TIF-IB alone for the CPE is too low to carry out detailed in vitrobinding experiments. This is not true for A. castellaniiTIF-IB, which binds the promoter with a K d of ∼50 pm without the aid of additional proteins. 3C. A. Radebaugh, K. Stiffler, and M. R. Paule, manuscript in preparation. Therefore, we have taken advantage of this unique opportunity to investigate the interactions of TIF-IB with the wild-type rRNA promoter. Several observations led us to hypothesize that TIF-IB might bind in a relatively sequence-independent manner, presumably by interaction with the minor groove. A. castellanii TIF-IB binds the rRNA core promoter from −67 to −17, as shown by previous DNase I and methidiumpropyl-EDTA·Fe(II) footprints (27Bateman E. Iida C.T. Kownin P. Paule M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8004-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Bateman E. Paule M.R. Cell. 1986; 47: 445-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, deletion and point mutagenesis (29Iida C.T. Kownin P. Paule M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Kownin P. Bateman E. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed that sequences upstream of about −45 could be altered without measurably affecting binding, and 5′-deletions to −32 still allowed robust transcription. Surprisingly, 5′-deletions all the way to −6 allowed weak transcription with correct start site selection (4Radebaugh C.A. Gong X. Bartholomew B. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3141-3144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Site-specific photocross-linking (19Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) revealed that TBP and all four TAFI factors were in close proximity to the DNA in the region upstream of −38, whereas only TAFI96 interacted downstream of this position. Substitution of thymine residues at various locations throughout the TIF-IB binding site with the uracil derivative 5-[N-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl]deoxyuracil, which protrudes markedly into the major groove, has little effect on TIF-IB binding (31Wolffe A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2055-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary dimethyl sulfate protection footprinting assays showed very limited protection of guanines in the major groove. 4E. Bateman, unpublished data. Unfortunately, none of these experiments were sensitive enough to determine the precise interactions made between TIF-IB and the DNA, such as which groove of the DNA is being contacted. We show here using minor groove-binding drugs and discriminating chemical footprinting that TIF-IB recognizes the A. castellanii rRNA promoter primarily through the minor groove, not the major groove as is the case with most DNA-binding proteins. This minor groove binding occurs by TIF-IB recognizing either sequence-specific variations in the architecture of the minor groove backbone(s) or functional groups on the base pairs in the minor groove, and our data cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. This is the first detailed description of the DNA-binding mechanism for TIF-IB from any species and makes plausible the notion that these fundamental transcription factors may recognize their binding sites by the variation in DNA intrinsic structure, such as minor groove width, and not (exclusively) by primary sequence. This notion is supported by the recent finding of conserved intrinsic structures in a variety of eukaryotic rRNA promoters, despite their disparate primary sequences (25Marilley M. Pasero P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A fragment of the A. castellanii core promoter (−96 to +18, relative to the transcription start site, position +1) was removed from pEBH10 (27Bateman E. Iida C.T. Kownin P. Paule M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8004-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by partial digestion with EagI and isolated on a 3.5% Metaphor agarose gel (FMC Corp. BioProducts, Rockland, ME). This 114-base pair fragment was subcloned into the NotI site of pBluescript II SK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Two clones were identified by sequencing: plasmid pGG4C, with −96 oriented toward theSacI site, was used to label the template strand, and plasmid pGG17C, with −96 near the XbaI site, was used to label the RNA-like strand for footprinting. The templates used in TIF-IB binding assays were made by digestion of pGG4C and pGG17C with BamHI, treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Corp.), and digestion with SacI to generate a fragment of 150 base pairs. Fragments were separated from linear plasmid on a 1% agarose gel, visualized by UV shadowing (to minimize nicking), and eluted with a Schleicher & Schuell Elutrap apparatus for 2 h in 1 × TAE (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 454Google Scholar). The eluate was phenol/CHCl3-extracted and precipitated, and the DNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Both strands (100 ng) were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Corp.), purified by electrophoresis on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and eluted as described (19Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), the labeled template strand from pGG4C was purified with a QIAEX kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) using the manufacturer's desalting protocol. Before purification, aliquots of labeled DNA were spotted on Whatman DE81 filter discs; washed five times with 5% Na2HPO4, H2O, ethanol, and ether; and counted in a liquid scintillation counter to determine specific activity. TIF-IB was isolated from nuclear extracts (33Imboden M.A. Matthews J.L. Lofquist A.K. Paule M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24601-24610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zwick M.G. Imboden M.A. Paule M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1681-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and purified through one round of promoter affinity chromatography as described (35Radebaugh C.A. Matthews J.L. Geiss G.K. Liu F. Wong J. Bateman E. Camier S. Sentenac A. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For some footprinting experiments, promoter affinity-purified TIF-IB was concentrated with a Microcon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Cloned and expressed A. castellanii TBP and recombinant human CREB were purified as described (36Wong J.-M. Liu F. Bateman E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). For EMSA experiments, CREB was diluted 1:2000 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol to a final concentration of 225 ng/ml. Distamycin A and mithramycin A were obtained from Sigma. Netropsin was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Stock solutions of 2, 2, and 10 mm, respectively, were made in ddH2O and filtered through 0.2-μm filters. For EMSA experiments, serial dilutions were made, in ddH20, from stock solutions. All solutions were stored at −20 °C. The sites of binding of the drugs to the core promoter were determined by MPE-Fe footprinting (see Fig. 3). The 150-bpBamHI/SacI fragment of pGG4C was 5′-end-labeled and used for all EMSAs, except those with CREB. TIF-IB binding conditions were 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 1–2 nm pBR322 (as nonspecific competitor), and 2–5 fmol of labeled core promoter DNA (∼25,000 cpm) in a 20-μl final volume. The amount of TIF-IB required to saturate the rRNA promoter was determined by titration in the absence of drug and used in all relevant EMSA experiments (data not shown). DNA was preincubated either with a minor groove-binding drug or with 5 fmol of TIF-IB for 20 min at 25 °C. The second reagent was added 20 min after the first and incubated under the same conditions. Reactions were stopped on ice and loaded on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels as described (19Gong X. Radebaugh C.A. Geiss G.K. Simon M.N. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4956-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The polyacrylamide gel support medium GelBond (FMC Corp. BioProducts) was used for all EMSA polyacrylamide gels. Gels were run at 200 V for 1.5 h, dried, exposed to Eastman Kodak storage phosphor screens, visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), and quantified using ImageQuant software (Version 3.3, Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). EMSAs with the minor groove-binding protein TBP were performed with 0.8 μg of recombinant TBP on the rRNA core promoter (pGG4C,BamHI/SacI). The sequence of the promoter from −7 to +3 contains two overlapping consensus TATA boxes (TATATATA +1 AA; see Fig. 10,upper panel). Binding reactions were essentially the same as for TIF-IB, except that the KCl concentration was changed to 60 mm (38Horikoshi M. Wang C.K. Fujii H. Cromlish J.A. Weil P.A. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4843-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and competitor DNA was changed to 3 nmpoly(dI-dC) to prevent formation of slower migrating complexes.Acanthamoeba TBP binding to this site under these conditions was verified by MPE-Fe footprinting (data not shown). Either TBP or drug incubations were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min; then the other reagent was added, and the incubations were continued for 30 min. For EMSAs of TBP, MgCl2 was added to both the gel and the running buffer to a final concentration of 5 mm (38Horikoshi M. Wang C.K. Fujii H. Cromlish J.A. Weil P.A. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4843-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Gels were run at 150 V for 1.5 h, dried, and analyzed as described above. EMSAs with CREB were performed in a 10-μl reaction containing 50 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The template used for these reactions was a 5′-end-labeled 77-bp DNA fragment (39Brauweiler A. Garl P. Franklin A.A. Giebler H.A. Nyborg J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12814-12822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) containing the consensus CRE. For reactions in which drug was preincubated with DNA, 1 μl of the appropriate stock solution of drug was added to 5 μl of labeled CRE (∼1 fmol). The reaction was incubated for 30 min, and then 5 μl of CREB (∼1.1 ng) was added to a final volume of 11 μl and incubated for an additional 30 min. The concentration of drug in the first incubation was nearly double that in the final incubation. For reactions in which CREB was prebound, 5 μl of CREB was added directly to 5 μl of labeled CRE. After a 30-min incubation, 1 μl of drug was added to a final concentration of 100 μm (for controls, 1 μl of ddH2O was added instead of drug), and the incubation was continued for 30 min as described above. Samples were electrophoresed on 5% gels and analyzed as described for TIF-IB. The binding conditions for footprinting were the same as for EMSAs of TIF-IB, except that binding was carried out at pH 7.5 to increase the efficiency of the UO2(NO3)2-DNA cleavage reaction (40Nielsen P.E. Hiort C. Sonnichsen S.H. Buchardt O. Dahl O. Norden B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4967-4975Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ten fmol of TIF-IB in HEG10 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) or buffer alone was added to the reaction and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Conditions for the UO2(NO3)2 cutting reactions and precipitations were modified from published procedures (41Jeppesen C. Nielsen P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4947-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Nielsen P.E. Mollegaard N.E. Jeppesen C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3847-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The final uranyl nitrate concentration was 1 mm. The reactions were exposed to 366 nm UV light (Model UVGL-58 lamp with 6-watt bulb, UVP Inc., San Gabriel, CA) held 4 cm above an open 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped with 10 mm sodium citrate. For MPE-Fe footprinting experiments at pH 7.5, 1 μl of 70 μm MPE and 50 μm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 solution and 1 μl of 0.5 m dithiothreitol were added to the 20-μl reactions instead of uranyl reagents. MPE-Fe reactions were stopped with a final concentration of 10 mmbathophenanthroline (43de Villiers J. Olson L. Tyndall C. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7965-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 44Bateman E. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1940-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After the addition of 30 μl of 1 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.1% SDS solution, samples were incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. The DNA solution was made 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5; precipitated with 70% ethanol; resuspended in 98% formamide (with bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol used as tracking dyes); and analyzed on 8 or 10% sequencing gels (7 m urea and 1 × Tris borate/EDTA). Gels were run at 1100–2000 V for 2–3 h, depending on the percentage of acrylamide and the DNA strand being analyzed. The concentrations of hydroxyl radical reagents and the basic design of experiments were modified from published methods (45Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 46Price M.A. Tullius T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 194-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The final binding conditions were as described for EMSAs of TIF-IB, with several important modifications. The final volume of the prebinding reaction was reduced to 3 μl while keeping the final concentrations of reagents the same, except that glycerol was reduced to 1.67% and the DNA and TIF-IB concentrations were ∼6 times higher. The low reaction volume was required to achieve efficient TIF-IB binding in the low concentration of glycerol by effectively increasing DNA and protein concentrations. The addition of either 0.5 μl of TIF-IB (10–20 fmol) or HEG10 buffer supplied the only glycerol in the reaction. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Three aliquots (1.5 μl each) of 10 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.3% H2O2, 1 mm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, and 2 mm EDTA were suspended as droplets on the side of the tube, but not mixed. All three solutions were freshly made just before use. Then 7.5 μl of HE buffer (HEG10 without glycerol) was used to mix all three reagents with the prebinding reaction mixture and to dilute the reagents to their final concentrations of 1 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.03% H2O2, 100 μm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, and 200 μm EDTA in a final reaction volume of 15 μl. This step lowered the glycerol concentration in the footprinting reaction to 0.33% to prevent quenching of hydroxyl radicals and increased cutting efficiency. Reactions were incubated for 3 min at room temperature and stopped by adding 15 μl of 10% glycerol. MPE-Fe control footprints were performed the same way, except that 0.5 μl of 70 μm MPE and 50 μm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 and 0.5 μl of 0.5 m dithiothreitol were added as droplets to the side of the tube. Eleven μl of HE buffer was added to mix the reaction and to dilute the reactions to 15 μl as described above. The cutting reaction was performed at 25 °C for 10 min and stopped with 15 μl of 20 mm bathophenanthroline. Proteinase K treatment, precipitation, resuspension, and electrophoresis of samples were done exactly as described for uranyl footprinting. DMS protection assays were modified from those of Shaw and Stewart (47Shaw P.E. Stewart A.F. Kneale G.G. DNA-Protein Interactions. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 79-87Google Scholar). Protection assays were performed under saturating TIF-IB conditions, and protein-DNA complexes were not separated by EMSA prior to cutting with piperidine. Binding conditions were the same as for EMSAs of TIF-IB. DMS was added to preformed TIF-IB-promoter complexes to a final concentration of 130 μm. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 3 min and stopped with 180 μl of DMS stop buffer (350 mmsodium acetate, 220 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 83 μg/ml linear polyacrylamide). Samples were extracted once with an equal volume of phenol/CHCl3, ethanol-precipitated, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10% piperidine (Sigma) and heated to 95 °C for 30 min. Piperidine was evaporated under vacuum, and the pellet was suspended in 30 μl of ddH2O, dried, resuspended in 20 μl of ddH2O, and dried again. The DNA pellets were resuspended in 6 μl of 98% formamide containing tracking dyes, heated to 95 °C for 4 min, and electrophoresed on 8–10% standard sequencing gels (see above). Kodak storage phosphor screens were exposed to EMSA and footprinting gels, and the radioactivity was visualized by scanning with a PhosphorImager. For drug inhibition studies, the amount of the complexed and free DNAs was estimated using ImageQuant software (Version 3.3), and the percent complex was calculated. The relative percent complex was determined by normalizing to the amount of the shifted complex when no drug is added. The values of relative percent complex were averaged from multiple experiments. IC50 is the amount of drug required to decrease the relative percent complex by 50%. Footprinting gel data were scanned as described above, but were analyzed with Phoretix Photometrics 1D-full software (Version 2.51, Non-Linear Dynamics Ltd). Using this program, the volume for each band (or “peak”) in the DNA alone or footprinted lane was determined. To correct for nicks in the DNA used for footprinting, the volumes of the corresponding bands in the untreated DNA lane were subtracted from the volumes of the experimental lanes. In some experiments, the overall cutting efficiency in lanes with added TIF-IB was lower than in those without protein, probably because free protein quenches the footprinting reagents. Thus, to quantitatively compare individual bands in the unprotected DNA ladder and the footprinted lane, the two lanes were normalized using bands outside the footprinted region. All bands were first paired using the “matching” function of this program. This function aligns the peaks of parallel lanes based on the relative position of the band in the gel. Matched bands well outside the footprinted region of the experimental lane and in the no-protein DNA lane were normalized to 1 and used as reference bands. The volumes for every other band within each lane were automatically normalized to the designated reference band. This procedure also normalizes the lanes of different experiments even if they were exposed for different times or used variable amounts of labeled DNA and therefore have different intensities. Next, the normalized volumes for each band from nine independent experiments were averaged. Relative protection was calculated by dividing the mean value for each individual band in lanes with added TIF-IB by the sum of the mean volumes for the corresponding bands in lanes with and without TIF-IB. Therefore, an ideal unprotected band should have a value of 0.50. Theoretically, any values below this could be considered protected, and those above, enhanced. We defined any value below 0.35 as a protected base and those above 0.65 as a base with enhanced reactivity. We used the minor groove-binding antibiotics netropsin, distamycin A, and mithramycin A to investigate the interactions of TIF-IB with the rRNA core promoter. The"

We examined the roles for the phospholipase Cγ-InsP3 pathway and the emptying of InsP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+stores in PDGF-mediated Ca2+ entry. Intracellular Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry were measured with fluorometric methods in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild type or mutant PDGF receptors. Activation of the wild type PDGF receptor caused both intracellular “Ca2+ release,” measured in nominally 0 Ca2+ extracellular medium, and “Ca2+ entry,” measured upon addition of 2 mm Ca2+ medium. Both phases were absent in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a PDGF receptor mutant (Y977F,Y989F) that fails to bind phospholipase Cγ. Blockade of the InsP3 receptor, by microinjection of single cells with low molecular weight heparin (5–50 mg/ml), blocked only Ca2+ i release (following PDGF or flash photolysis of caged InsP3) and had no effect on PDGF-induced Ca2+ entry. In whole cell patch-clamp experiments, intracellular heparin also failed to block PDGF-evoked ion currents. Release of InsP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ stores, by flash photolysis of caged InsP3, was apparently not sufficient to maximally activate Ca2+ entry. Intracellular InsP3 caused significantly less Ca2+ entry than PDGF alone. These data suggest that InsP3 alone is not sufficient to maximally activate Ca2+ entry by the capacitative pathway and that products of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate breakdown other than InsP3 probably play a role in PDGF-mediated Ca2+ entry.

The initial Ca2+ transient results from InsP3-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+ stores (5Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6134) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ transient is usually followed by sustained influx of Ca2+ from the medium. The signaling mechanism for this extracellular Ca2+ entry process is not well defined. The most widely accepted model for regulation of Ca2+ entry, termed the “capacitative” model, argues that entry is activated by prior depletion of the InsP3-mediated intracellular Ca2+ stores (6Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). A weakness of this model is that the interaction between the intracellular stores and the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel has never been characterized. Receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry may involve pathways other than the proposed capacitative entry system. In hepatocytes (7Hansen C. Yang L.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol.

Invest. 1996; 97: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PDGF-induced Ca2+ entry can occur in the absence of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in several cell types. Taken together, these data suggest that some receptors may signal intracellular Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry separately, such that Ca2+ entry would not require prior release of intracellular stores. One candidate for a separate signal for Ca2+ entry is direct G-protein regulated opening of the membrane Ca2+channels (15Penner R. Mathew G. Neher E. Nature. 1988; 334: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Alternatively, second messengers such as inositol phosphates (15Penner R. Mathew G. Neher E. Nature. 1988; 334: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 16Kuno M. Gardner P. Nature. 1987; 326: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) or diacylglycerol (17Xuan Y.-T.

Pflugers Arch. 1997; 433: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) might be involved in regulation of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels. In support of the latter idea, Huang et al. (1Huang C.L. Takenawa T. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4045-4048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that antibodies to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) block PDGF-mediated Ca2+ entry, suggesting that the mechanism involves a metabolite of PIP2. In this study, we used PDGF receptor mutations, microinjected heparin, and caged InsP3 to examine PDGF-induced Ca2+entry. We show that PDGF-induced Ca2+ entry does not require InsP3-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+ stores and that PDGF causes substantially more Ca2+ entry than InsP3 alone. We propose that in this system PDGF does not induce Ca2+ entry predominantly via the capacitative mechanism, but rather via a direct pathway involving a metabolite of PIP2. Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Low molecular weight heparin was Sigma H-5271. Fura-2-AM and Ca2+-green-1 pentapotassium salt were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bovine serum albumin was fatty acid-poor fraction V from Miles (Kankakee, IL).

PDGF receptor mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (20Escobedo J. Williams L. Nature. 1988; 335: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing the mutated receptor cDNA were also used to stably transfect CHO cells (19Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. Del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T.

Cooper J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). CHO cells transfected with PDGF wild-type and mutant receptors were grown in Ham's F-12 medium in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Media contained 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml). Medium for stable transfectants was supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. Culture medium was changed every 2–3 days until cells were confluent. Cells were made quiescent by replacement of serum with bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml) and transferrin (5 μg/ml). For measurement of Ca2+ i , cells were plated at 500 cells/ml on a microscope cover glass (Fisher, 25-mm circle) and grown in serum-containing medium until 70–80% confluence was achieved. Serum was removed 24 h prior to Ca2+ i measurements to eliminate any residual PDGF activity in the serum. Cells grown on coverslips were incubated with 5 mm fura-2-AM in assay medium at room temperature for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted on a temperature-controlled chamber at 31 °C in assay medium (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 25 mm glucose, 25 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.2), and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with or without 2 mm CaCl2 (22Huang C.L. Cogan M.G. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14134-14140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solution without added CaCl2 was termed “0” Ca2+medium. Fura-2 fluorescence was measured using a Nikon epifluorescence inverted microscope fitted with a rotating holder for excitation filters (340 and 380 nm) as described previously (1Huang C.L. Takenawa T. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4045-4048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signals were digitized using a Labmaster interface board (Scientific Solutions, Solon, OH) and were recorded in an IBM style computer using the UMANS software package (Chester Regen, Bio-Rad). To calibrate the fluorescence signals, the ratio of fluorescence at 340/380 nm was compared with ratios obtained at maximal Ca2+ i (achieved by the addition of 10 μm 4BR-A23187) and 0 Ca2+ i (achieved by the addition of 20 mm EGTA). Ca2+ i was calculated as described previously (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For Ca2+ i measurements with caged 1,4,5-InsP3, single cells grown on coverslips were microinjected with Ca2+ green-1-pentapotassium salt (0.1 mm) with caged 1,4,5-InsP3 in the absence or presence of heparin. The fluorescence signal for the photorelease experiments was measured with excitation light passed through a narrow-band interference filter centered at 490 nm to excite Ca2+ green-1 fluorescence. Increases in fluorescence emission collected at 515 nm correspond to increases in the free Ca2+ i concentration (24Bird G. St J. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17722-17725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following microinjection of caged 1,4,5-InsP3, photolysis of caged 1,4,5-InsP3 was achieved using a modification of the method of Bird et al. (24Bird G. St J. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17722-17725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Light from a continuously burning xenon arc flashlamp was passed through a broad 120-nm bandwidth filter centered at 350 nm and directed to the specimen for times ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 s. The timing and duration of the UV flashes were controlled by the computer. Immediately following these computer-controlled flashes, Ca2+ i measurements were started. Cells were microinjected using glass capillary needles held in a Narishige micromanipulator. Pipettes were made from borosilicate glass tubes (0.9 mm) using a Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller from Sutter Instrument Co. (Novato, CA). Volumes of approximately 5 × 10−14 liters are microinjected by this method (25Graessmann A. Graessmann M. Mueller C. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of heparin in buffer (27 mm K2HPO4, 8 mmNaH2PO4, 26 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) were microinjected with 0.1 mm Ca2+ green-1-pentapotassium salt with or without caged 1,4,5-InsP3 to achieve an estimated intracellular concentration that was 10-fold diluted. For whole cell patch-clamp measurements, cells were plated on glass coverslips and cultured in serum-containing medium. Coverslips were transferred from the culture dish onto the bottom of the recording chamber, which was then perfused with Ringer's solution (155 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH) for 2–3 min to remove the cell culture medium. The internal solution loaded in the recording pipettes contained 140 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm CsCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgATP, and 10 mmHepes (pH 7.3, adjusted with CsOH). 10 μl of PDGF was added into the recording chamber with a scaled pipette. Heparin was mixed with the internal solution and loaded in the recording electrode. All electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). Patch-clamp recordings were performed using the whole cell recording configuration of the patch-clamp technique (26Hamill O. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15060) Google Scholar) at the holding potential of −60 mV with an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Electrodes pulled from KG-33 borosilicate glass capillaries (Garner Glass, Inc., Claremont, CA) with an outer diameter of 1.5 μm and inner diameter of 1.0 μm were filled with the internal solution. The current responses were evoked by adding PDGF (final concentration 30 ng/ml). The generation of voltage-clamp protocols and the acquisition of data were controlled by an IBM/AT-compatible computer through pClamp software (Axon Instruments) via a 12-bit digital/analog and analog/digital converter (TL-1 DMA Labmaster Interface, Axon Instruments). The signal was filtered at 5 kHz (−3 dB, 8 pole, low pass Bessel filter; Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and digitized on-line at a sampling interval of 0.25 ms, and directly stored on the computer hard disk for off-line analysis. Specific patch-clamp protocols are described in the legend of Fig. 3. Under a microscope (× 600 magnification), CHO-PDGF cells were visually identified. Each cell was held at −60 mV and data was generated by a voltage step-ramp-step protocol during each experiment. The protocol consisted of the following pulses: holding potential (−60 mV, 37.5 ms); step (−90 mV, 18.75 ms); ramp (−90 to 50 mV, 400 ms); step (50 mV, 18.75 ms), and holding potential (−60 mV, 37 ms). This protocol was repeated continuously every 4 s until the experiment was stopped. During whole cell recordings, the access resistance was usually 4–10 MΩ, 80% of which was canceled by electronic compensation. The currents studied in this paper were typically less than 200 pA, so the maximum error in voltage due to uncompensated access resistance was less than 2 mV. Only those recordings with stable and low access resistance were included in the final analysis. Our patch-clamp results are derived from a total population of 34 CHO-PDGF cells. The PDGF evoked responses were recorded with pClamp 5.6 and analyzed with pClamp 6.1 Data plotting and curve fittings were performed with Origin (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by the paired or unpaired Student'st test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Ca2+ transients were measured in CHO cells using either fura-2 or Ca2+ green. For the purposes of this study, the first phase measured in nominally 0 Ca2+ extracellular medium was termed “Ca2+release” and the second, measured upon re-addition of Ca2+ to the medium, was termed “Ca2+entry.” Previous work from this laboratory showed that PDGF-induced Ca2+ entry can occur in the absence of intracellular Ca2+ release in vascular smooth muscle cells (1Huang C.L. Takenawa T. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4045-4048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, microinjection of anti-PIP2 antibodies blocked both PDGF-mediated Ca2+ release and Ca2+ entry (1Huang C.L. Takenawa T. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4045-4048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that metabolites of PIP2, possibly acting through two separate pathways, are responsible for both intracellular Ca2+ release and extracellular Ca2+ entry. We sought to confirm these findings using various signaling mutations in the PDGF receptor. In wild-type CHO cells, which do not express native PDGF receptors, PDGF did not produce changes in Ca2+ i (Fig.1 A). Solution changes from 2 mm to 0 Ca2+ produced small intracellular Ca2+ transients in the direction of the solution change. In CHO cells expressing the wild-type PDGF receptor, PDGF (5 or 25 ng/ml) raised Ca2+ i in a biphasic fashion (Fig.1 B). In 0 Ca2+ medium, PDGF produced a transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ to 625 ± 32 nm (Ca2+ release). Subsequent addition of 2 mm Ca2+ to the medium produced a greater and more prolonged Ca2+ transient to 845 ± 48 nm, representing Ca2+ entry. In CHO cells expressing the Y977F/Y989F mutation (which disrupts the binding of PLCγ to the activated PDGF receptor) (21Kashishian A. Cooper J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), PDGF (5 ng/ml, Fig. 1 C) failed to elicit any normal Ca2+transients. Similar results were obtained when PDGF concentration was increased to 25 ng/ml (data not shown). Following addition of PDGF in 0 Ca2+ medium, re-addition of 2 mmCa2+ resulted in only a small Ca2+ transient, no different from that observed in wild-type CHO cells in Fig.1 A. Thus, PLCγ appears critical to the development of all Ca2+ signals produced by PDGF. Other signaling mutations in the PDGF receptor (20Escobedo J. Williams L. Nature. 1988; 335: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) did not significantly affect Ca2+ responses. Activation of the PDGF receptor in CHO cells expressing PDGF receptors mutated at either the PI 3′-kinase site (Y708F/Y719F) (Fig. 1 D) or GTPase-activating protein-binding site (Y739F) (Fig.1 E) induced both Ca2+ release (525 ± 38 and 575 ± 27 nm) and Ca2+ entry (725 ± 43 and 630 ± 51 nm). Ca2+ responses to PDGF were somewhat variable for Y708F/Y719F and Y739F. However, for neither mutant was the Ca2+ response eradicated as it was for the PLCγ mutant. These findings are identical to results obtained with normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells expressing the same PDGF receptor mutations (data not shown). To determine whether PDGF-mediated Ca2+ entry depends on InsP3-dependent release of intracellular Ca2+ stores, cells were microinjected with heparin to block the InsP3 receptor. To first demonstrate that heparin blocks the InsP3 receptor, Ca2+ green (0.1 mm) and caged 1,4,5-InsP3 (0.375 mm) were microinjected into CHO-PDGF cells in the absence or presence of low molecular weight heparin (5–50 mg/ml). Photorelease of InsP3 was achieved with flashes of UV light (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cells in 0 Ca2+ medium were exposed to multiple flashes (∼8) of 0.5–2 s duration (Fig.2 A). Each flash resulted in a single transient Ca2+ spike. In the absence of caged 1,4,5-InsP3, multiple flashes of UV light (0.5 to 4 s duration) had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ levels (data not shown). Heparin, a competitive inhibitor of the InsP3receptor (27Ghosh T.K. Eis P.S. Mullaney J.M. Ebert C.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11075-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when injected at 20 mg/ml, blocked intracellular Ca2+ release in 0 Ca2+ medium both following flash photolysis of caged 1,4,5-InsP3 and after subsequent addition of PDGF (Fig. 2 B). However, addition of 2 mm Ca2+ to the medium in the ongoing presence of PDGF resulted in a substantial increase in intracellular Ca2+. These data suggest that PDGF-mediated Ca2+ entry can occur despite blockade of InsP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+release by heparin. It has previously been reported in fibroblasts (28Frace A. Gargus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2415-2511Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and rat kidney mesangial cells (4Ma H. Matsunaga H. Li B. Schieffer B. Marrero M. Ling B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Matsunaga H. Ling B. Eaton D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C456-C465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that activation of the PDGF receptor results in opening of a nonselective cation channel. Using a whole cell patch-clamp, we measured cellular currents in CHO-PDGF cells following the addition of PDGF to the extracellular medium. To reduce noise and membrane breakdown, these studies were performed at 22–24 °C. PDGF (30 ng/ml) caused an inward current which slowly inactivated (Fig.3 A). The peak amplitude was 124 ± 40 pA at −60 mV. There was a latency from the time of PDGF addition to the peak current of 110 ± 28 s (n = 5). The ramp plot shows the current-voltage relationship for this current (Fig. 3 B). The reversal potential was 5.6 ± 6.5 mV (n = 5). In most recordings, there was a noticeable inward sodium current on the ramp plot (> −20 mV). In 18 cells studied, 5 cells responded to the addition of PDGF (response rate ∼27%). This response rate following PDGF was nearly identical to the response rate (28%) when Ca2+ i was measured by fura-2 at 23 °C. In 8 of 8 cells, there was no comparable current observed in response to thapsigargin. We next determined the effect of intrapipette application of heparin on PDGF-activated cation currents. In a CHO-PDGF cell in which the patch-clamp was loaded with heparin (1 mg/ml), PDGF (30 ng/ml) evoked an ion current in 25% (2 of 8) of cells studied (Fig. 3 C). This current was similar to the PDGF-activated cation current observed without heparin. The peak current amplitude was 255 pA at −60 mV with a latency of 122 s. The reversal potential (Fig. 3 D) of the PDGF-activated current in the presence of heparin was also near 0 (2.6 mV). The similar percentage of cells activated by PDGF and the similar characteristics of the channel following heparin exposure suggest that heparin did not alter the ability of PDGF to activate the cation channel. To determine whether photolysis of caged 1,4,5-InsP3 could (through release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores) activate the Ca2+ entry pathway, Ca2+ green (0.1 mm) and caged 1,4,5-InsP3 (0.375 mm) were microinjected into CHO-PDGF cells. Cells exposed to sequential changes in medium Ca2+ concentration without flash photolysis or PDGF demonstrated a small, short-lived Ca2+ transient, in the same direction as the medium change (Fig.4, left). The same cell containing caged-InsP3 and incubated in 0 Ca2+medium was then exposed to multiple flashes (∼11) of 0.5 to 4 s duration. Each flash caused a single spike in intracellular Ca2+. Subsequent re-addition of 2 mmCa2+ to the medium caused a Ca2+ transient that was similar in magnitude from that observed in the same cell when medium Ca2+ concentration was increased prior to flash photolysis. When PDGF (25 ng/ml) was added to the cells, it produced a single intracellular Ca2+ spike that was similar in magnitude and duration to the spikes caused by each flash photolysis of caged InsP3. However, the increase in Ca2+ i following re-addition of Ca2+ to the medium was much larger and longer lasting than was seen in either control cells or in cells exposed to photolysis of caged-InsP3. In 11 experiments, re-addition of Ca2+ after caged-InsP3 increased fluorescence by 3.2 ± 0.2 arbitrary fluorescence units. The identical procedure following PDGF increased fluorescence by 4.4 ± 0.1 units (p = 0.0002). Thus, PDGF appears to produce a signal for Ca2+ entry that differs from that produced by photolysis of caged InsP3. This additional signal results in a larger Ca2+ response than that caused by InsP3 alone. One explanation for the finding of Fig. 4 that would fit with the capacitative entry model is that PDGF results in more complete emptying of intracellular stores despite the similar appearance of Ca2+ spikes generated by PDGF and photorelease of caged-InsP3. To address this possibility, CHO-PDGF cells containing microinjected Ca2+ green (0.1 mm) and caged 1,4,5-InsP3 (0.375 mm) were exposed to PDGF and then to multiple UV flashes in 0 Ca2+ medium. PDGF (25 ng/ml) produced a single Ca2+ transient, and subsequent photolysis of caged 1,4,5-InsP3 generated multiple Ca2+ transients (Fig.5), showing that PDGF alone did not completely empty intracellular Ca2+ stores. Addition of 2 mm Ca2+ to the medium then resulted in Ca2+ entry that was comparable to that observed with PDGF alone (Fig. 1 B). These findings suggest that complete emptying of InsP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ stores is not necessary for activation of the Ca2+ entry pathway by PDGF. The capacitative model of receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry proposes that Ca2+ entry occurs when intracellular Ca2+ stores become depleted (6Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Activation of many receptors results in the release of InsP3 into the cytoplasm which then binds to InsP3 receptors on intracellular membranes, opening InsP3-gated Ca2+ channels (5Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6134) Google Scholar). Depletion of these InsP3-dependent intracellular stores is proposed to generate a signal that opens Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane, causing Ca2+ influx from outside the cell (6Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Several models for such a signal have been proposed, including: (a) formation of a factor (CIF, Ca2+influx factor) which could diffuse from the Ca2+ stores to the plasma membrane (30Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), or (b) direct physical coupling of intracellular Ca2+ stores to Ca2+ entry channels (31Irvine R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3085-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A weakness of the capacitative model is that the signal necessary to couple the state of the intracellular stores to the Ca2+ entry channel has never been clearly defined. A number of recent studies indicate that in some systems Ca2+ entry can occur by a non-capacitative mechanism. For example, angiotensin II in adrenal chromaffin cells (14Stauderman K.A. Pruss R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18349-18355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the cholecystokinin analogue, CCK-JMV-180, in pancreatic acinar cells (12Dawra R.K. Saluja A.K. Runzi M. Steer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20237-30242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activated Ca2+ entry in the absence of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. We have found that blockade of intracellular Ca2+ release by microinjected heparin does not interfere with PDGF-mediated Ca2+ entry in single vascular smooth muscle cells (1Huang C.L. Takenawa T. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4045-4048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in CHO cells (the current study). Blockade of intracellular Ca2+ release by anti-InsP3 receptor antibodies also failed to prevent PDGF-mediated Ca2+entry. 2R. Mathias, K. Mikoshiba, T. Michikawa, A. Miyawaki, and H. E. Ives, unpublished observations. Taken together, these data indicate that in at least some systems, Ca2+ entry can occur without activation of the capacitative system. Further evidence to support that release of Ca2+ from heparin-sensitive InsP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ stores is not necessary for opening of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels was provided by patch-clamp studies in which the response rate for activation of cation currents by PDGF was unaffected by intracellular heparin. These findings are consistent with the work of Ma et al. (4Ma H. Matsunaga H. Li B. Schieffer B. Marrero M. Ling B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) who found in excised patches of mesangial cells that intrapipette application of heparin failed to block PDGF-evoked ion currents. These findings contrast with other patch-clamp studies in which heparin did block cholecystokinin Ca2+-dependent currents (32Thorn P. Petersen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23219-23221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vasopressin-mediated Ca2+ transients (33Blatter L.A. Wier W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H576-H586PubMed Google Scholar), acetylcholine-dependent Ca2+ oscillations (34Wakui M. Osipchuk Y. Peterson O. Cell. 1990; 63: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and angiotensin II-dependent channel activity (35Lacy P. Murray-McIntosh R. McIntosh J. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 420: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Since heparin is a competitive inhibitor of the InsP3 receptor, one might speculate that the failure of heparin to block PDGF-evoked currents in our patch-clamp experiments may be due to a heparin concentration that was insufficient to completely block the InsP3 receptor. However, the intrapipette heparin concentration used in our patch-clamp studies was 2–20-fold greater than that used in experiments in other systems in which heparin did block receptor-mediated ion currents (32Thorn P. Petersen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23219-23221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Blatter L.A. Wier W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H576-H586PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wakui M. Osipchuk Y. Peterson O. Cell. 1990; 63: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 35Lacy P. Murray-McIntosh R. McIntosh J. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 420: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intrapipette heparin concentration we used was probably substantially higher than the intracellular heparin concentrations achieved in previous microinjection studies in which we demonstrated blockade of PDGF-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release.2 Currents that flow-through capacitative Ca2+ entry channels have been referred to as Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ currents (Icrac) (36Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 37Premack B. McDonald T. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar). Several findings in the current study and earlier work by others (4Ma H. Matsunaga H. Li B. Schieffer B. Marrero M. Ling B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Gargus J. Frace A. Jung F. EXS. 1993; 66: 289-295PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the PDGF-activated current may differ from Icrac. Icrac has been reported to have a low conductance, approximating 24 fS (39Zweifach A. Lewis R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Although we were not able to directly assess unitary conductance of the PDGF-activated ion channel, Frace and Gargus (28Frace A. Gargus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2415-2511Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) demonstrated in fibroblasts that PDGF activated an ion channel with a much larger conductance of 28 pS. The PDGF-activated cation current we observed was not inwardly rectified, in comparison to Icrac which is typically inwardly rectified (40Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Icrac is generally described as being Ca2+ selective (40Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), while Gargus et al. (38Gargus J. Frace A. Jung F. EXS. 1993; 66: 289-295PubMed Google Scholar) and Ma et al. (4Ma H. Matsunaga H. Li B. Schieffer B. Marrero M. Ling B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) found that the PDGF-activated ion current occurs through a nonselective cation channel. The reversal potential near 0 which we observed in the present work also suggests that the current is not Ca2+ selective. Finally, 8 of 8 cells exposed to thapsigargin in our study failed to evoke any cation currents, suggesting that Icrac is too small to detect under the conditions we used. Taken together, these findings all suggest that ion currents produced by activation of the PDGF receptor are not Icrac. The fact that PDGF can lead to opening of a channel other than Icrac is consistent with the notion that PDGF can cause Ca2+ entry via a pathway that bypasses the capacitative Ca2+ entry system. The fact the PDGF may bypass the capacitative entry system does not rule out the possibility that this system still plays an important role in cellular Ca2+ metabolism under certain conditions. The data of Fig. 4 suggest that caged InsP3 does not cause a Ca2+ entry signal any larger than that seen in control cells. However, caged InsP3 under these conditions did not completely empty intracellular Ca2+ stores (data not shown). These data therefore cannot eliminate capacitative entry as a mechanism which participates in Ca2+ regulation. Fig. 4does, however, show that PDGF produces a significantly larger entry signal than InsP3 alone, suggesting that PDGF produces a signal in addition to the capacitative signal for the generation of Ca2+ entry. Previous work from this laboratory showed that when intracellular Ca2+ stores were held in the depleted state, removal of PDGF from its receptor nearly abolished Ca2+ entry (1Huang C.L. Takenawa T. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4045-4048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This earlier data also indicates that PDGF receptor occupancy, and not simply depletion of intracellular stores, is essential to the generation of Ca2+ entry in vascular smooth muscle cells. What signal is produced by PDGF receptor occupancy that leads to non-capacitative Ca2+ entry? Previous work with anti-PIP2 antibodies (1Huang C.L. Takenawa T. Ives H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4045-4048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the current work with PDGF receptor mutants (Fig. 1) indicates that this signal derives from PLCγ-mediated breakdown of PIP2. The failure of heparin to block Ca2+ entry and the finding that PDGF causes much larger Ca2+ entry than 1,4,5-InsP3 alone suggests that this signal is not simply 1,4,5-InsP3. Alternatives to InsP3 include other inositol phosphates such as InsP4, or lipid products of PIP2breakdown. The possibility of a role for InsP4 in extracellular Ca2+ entry has been studied extensively in other systems with conflicting results (31Irvine R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3085-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 41Hamada E. Nakajima T. Ota S.-I. Terano A. Omata M. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Kurachi Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 102: 667-692Google Scholar, 42Shirakawa H. Miyazaki S. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A role for diacylglycerol and protein kinase C in regulating Ca2+ entry has also been studied extensively and the results are also contradictory (17Xuan Y.-T. Wang O.-L. Whorton A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1550-C1567Crossref Google Scholar, 18Ubl J. Reiser G. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 433: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 43Balasubramanyam M. Kimura M. Aviv A. Gardner J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C321-C327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Xu Y. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23887-23890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 45Baranska J. Chaban V. Czarny M. Sabala P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In some work, PKC has been shown to promote or enhance Ca2+ entry (17Xuan Y.-T. Wang O.-L. Whorton A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1550-C1567Crossref Google Scholar, 18Ubl J. Reiser G. Pflugers Arch. 1997; 433: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), while other work suggests that PKC may blunt Ca2+ entry (43Balasubramanyam M. Kimura M. Aviv A. Gardner J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C321-C327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Xu Y. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23887-23890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 45Baranska J. Chaban V. Czarny M. Sabala P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One explanation for the variability in these findings is the failure to consider the isoforms of PKC expressed in various cell lines. Xu and Ware (44Xu Y. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23887-23890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) recently showed the PKCβ may be a specific negative regulator of thrombin-mediated Ca2+ entry. On the other hand, preliminary work in our laboratory suggests that the ε-isoform of protein kinase C may play a key positive role in Ca2+entry in CHO cells. A specific peptide inhibitor of this isoform blocked Ca2+ entry, but not intracellular Ca2+release, following stimulation of CHO cells by endothelin (46Lobo E. Dumitrescu O. Ives H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 368aGoogle Scholar). This new data suggests that diacylglycerol, rather than an inositol phosphate, may be the critical second messenger for Ca2+entry following hormonal stimulation of CHO cells. A model of the various pathways potentially involved in Ca2+ signaling by PDGF, and the points at which we have interfered with it, is shown in Fig. 6. Our earlier work showed that PIP2 (A) is essential for both Ca2+ release and extracellular Ca2+ entry. This was confirmed by showing that mutations in the PDGF receptor that prevent PLCγ activation (B) failed to produce Ca2+ transients. However, blockade of InsP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+release (C) did not prevent PDGF-mediated Ca2+entry. Finally, we showed that InsP3-mediated release of intracellular Ca2+ stores (D) alone is insufficient to cause maximal Ca2+ entry in CHO cells. This leaves InsP4 and diacylglycerol as the most likely candidates for molecules which can signal Ca2+ entry by bypassing the capacitative system."
https://openalex.org/W1971536571,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) employs a number of complex strategies to interfere with the synthesis, stability, and subcellular localization of its specific cellular receptor CD4. To define better the mechanisms of inhibition of CD4 expression, we used a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro system, in which cDNAs derived from HIV-1-infected cells were used to generate mRNA for the Tat, Vpu, and gp160 envelope proteins that were translated together with CD4-encoding mRNA. In the presence of microsomal membranes, we observed that cotranslation of Env mRNA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of CD4 translation. This effect was enhanced further when an mRNA-encoding Vpu in addition to Env mRNA was utilized. However, the activity of Vpu was mostly post-translational, since translation of Vpu alone, but not Env, was able to destabilize CD4 molecules presynthesized into microsomes. The Env-mediated inhibitory effect was specifically targeted at CD4 and did not affect the synthesis or stability of the CD8 molecule. Interestingly, mutated CD4 species, with a 20-fold lower affinity for HIV-1 Env than wild-type, were less sensitive to cotranslational inhibition. Our report identifies the envelope as the HIV-1 protein responsible for down-regulation of CD4 translation. We further propose a mechanism whereby direct interactions between gp160 and nascent CD4 molecules can cause interference with and premature termination of CD4 protein elongation."
