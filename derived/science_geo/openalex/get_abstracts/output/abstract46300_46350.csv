https://openalex.org/W2030365976,Optical trapping and manipulation of viruses and bacteria by laser radiation pressure were demonstrated with single-beam gradient traps. Individual tobacco mosaic viruses and dense oriented arrays of viruses were trapped in aqueous solution with no apparent damage using approximately 120 milliwatts of argon laser power. Trapping and manipulation of single live motile bacteria and Escherichia coli bacteria were also demonstrated in a high-resolution microscope at powers of a few milliwatts.
https://openalex.org/W2007372895,"To identify candidates for neuronal recognition molecules in Drosophila, we used monoclonal antibodies to search for surface glycoproteins expressed on subsets of axon bundles (or fascicles) during development. Here we report on the characterization and cloning of fasciclin III, which is expressed on a subset of neurons and axon pathways in the Drosophila embryo. Fasciclin III is also expressed at other times and places including transient segmentally repeated patches in the neuroepithelium and segmentally repeated stripes in the body epidermis. Antisera generated against each of four highly related forms of the protein were used for cDNA expression cloning to identify a single gene, which was confirmed to encode fasciclin III by tissue in situ hybridization and genetic deficiency analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1483915559,"The family of human cell surface heterodimers which includes VLA-1 and VLA-2 is now shown to include three additional heterodimers, here called VLA-3, VLA-4, and VLA-5. Each of these separate VLA structures is composed of a distinct alpha subunit (Mr 110,000-200,000 nonreduced) noncovalently associated with a common beta subunit (Mr 110,000 nonreduced). Chemical cross-linking experiments provided evidence that each VLA complex exists predominantly as a 1:1 alpha beta heterodimer. The VLA proteins are widely distributed, with one or more of the heterodimers present on nearly all cell types tested. Evidence for five distinct VLA alpha subunits was obtained from differences observed in antibody recognition, cell distribution patterns, two-dimensional gel analyses, and V8 protease cleavage patterns. On the other hand, the beta subunit present in each heterodimer was immunochemically and electrophoretically indistinguishable, and yielded identical V8 cleavage fragments. Immunoblotting experiments revealed that besides the Mr 110,000 beta normally seen, another beta protein was present that is smaller in size (Mr 90,000 nonreduced), altered or deficient in glycosylation, and not available for cell surface radiolabeling."
https://openalex.org/W2044042298,"In addition to the ensemble of intact, expressed genes the chromosomes of many vertebrates are cluttered with degenerate copies called pseudogenes (Vanin, Ann. Rev. Genet. 79,253-272,1985). One type of pseudogene, the “processed pseudogene,” is usually found at a different chromosomal location from the expressed gene and often contains mutations in the coding region. Processed pseudogenes lack promoter sequences and introns and contain a 3’poly(A) stretch that is missing from the same portion of the expressed gene. These features of processed pseudogenes have led to speculation that they weie generated from reverse transcripts of cellular RNAs. Surprisingly, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has few, if any, processed pseudogenes despite the fact that yeast cells have both a reverse transcriptase and several genes with introns. The yeast reverse transcriptase is encoded by the Ty transposon, a repetitive DNA element whose structure is similar to that of retroviral proviruses found in vertebrates (Garfinkel et al., Cell 42, 507-517, 1985). The level of Ty reverse transcriptase is normally low, but can be much higher in a strain containing a genetically engineered Ty element. If this enzyme were able to reverse transcribe cellular mRNAs, then one might expect the yeast genome to be peppered with pseudogenes, like the vertebrate genome. Yet no gene in yeast has the features of a typical processed pseudogene. A second striking feature of the Saccharomyces genome is the paucity of genes with introns. Of the several hundred genes that have been sequenced, only seventeen contain introns. The infrequent occurrence of introns in Saccharomyces is not some peculiar quirk of fungi since the distribution of introns within the genes of Neurospora and Schizosaccharomyces pombe is not different from that found in plants and vertebrates. The existence of pseudogenes in vertebrates and their apparent absence from Saccharomyces could be a consequence of the nature of the recombination process that leads to cDNA integration. In mammalian cells, exogenous DNA introduced by transfection usually integrates by nonhomologous recombination. If an endogenous cDNA were integrated by the same process, the resultant gene copy would have all the features of a processed pseudogene (new chromosomal location, poly(A), no intron, no promoter). By contrast, exogenous DNA introduced into yeast always integrates by homologous recombination. This recombination system is extremely active, as shown by the fact that the yeast genetic map is roughly the same size as that of humans (3300 centiMorgans) even though a yeast cell has only about 1% as much DNA as a human cell.

https://openalex.org/W1982166181,"A DNA sequence (HOT1) from the repeated ribosomal RNA gene cluster of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can stimulate genetic exchange when inserted at novel locations in the yeast genome. Localization of the sequences required for HOT1 activity demonstrates that two noncontiguous fragments of DNA are required for the stimulation of recombination. One of these fragments contains the transcription initiation site for the major 35S ribosomal RNA precursor. The other contains an enhancer of RNA polymerase I transcription. We suggest that transcription by RNA polymerase I initiating in the inserted rDNA and proceeding through the adjacent sequences is responsible for the stimulation of exchange. Consistent with this interpretation, insertion of the putative termination site for RNA polymerase I transcription between HOT1 and the adjacent recombining DNA abolishes the recombination stimulation. Transcription through both copies of the homologous recombining sequences appears to be necessary for enhanced exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2044491461,"During adipose conversion of murine 3T3-L1 cells, the arrangement of vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) changes from an extended fibrillar state to a complex cage formation tightly associated with the forming lipid globules. The fully developed cage complex surrounding the lipid globule consists of a monolayer of groups of regularly spaced vimentin IFs that in turn is closely ensheathed by a special endoplasmic reticulum cisterna. The same IF cage is also seen in other adipocytes in culture and in tissues. The specificity of the association of lipid globules with vimentin IFs during adipose conversion is discussed as a special form of compartmentalization supporting adipogenesis and is taken as an example of a possible IF function in relation to a cell differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2046484554,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two functional homologues of the ras oncogene family, RAS1 and RAS2. These genes are required for growth, and all evidence indicates that this essential function is the activation of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, ras in mammalian cells does not appear to influence adenylate cyclase activity. To clarify the relation between ras function in yeast and in higher eukaryotes, and the role played by yeast RAS in growth control, it is necessary to identify functions acting upstream of RAS in the adenylate cyclase pathway. The evidence presented here indicates that CDC25, identified by conditional cell cycle arrest mutations, encodes such an upstream function."

https://openalex.org/W1576158258,"Superoxide dismutase is considered important in protection of aerobes against oxidant damage, and increased tolerance to oxidant stress is associated with induction of this enzyme. However, the importance of superoxide dismutase in this tolerance is not clear because conditions which promote the synthesis of superoxide dismutase likewise affect other antioxidant enzymes and substances. To clarify the role of superoxide dismutase per se in organismal defense against oxidant-generating drugs, we employed Escherichia coli transformed with multiple copies of the gene for bacterial iron superoxide dismutase. These bacteria have greater than ten times the superoxide dismutase activity of wild-type E. coli but, importantly, are normal in other oxidant defense parameters including catalase, peroxidases, glutathione, and glutathione reductase. High superoxide dismutase and control bacteria were exposed to the O2–generating drug paraquat and to elevated pO2. We find; high superoxide dismutase E. coli are more readily killed by paraquat under aerobic, but not anaerobic, conditions. During exposure to paraquat, high superoxide dismutase E. coli accumulate more H2O2. Coincidentally, the reduced glutathione content of high superoxide dismutase E. coli declines more than in control E. coli. E. coli with high superoxide dismutase activity are also more readily killed by hyperoxia. Interestingly, the susceptibility of the parental and high superoxide dismutase E. coli to killing by exogenous H2O2 is not significantly different. Thus, under these experimental conditions, greatly enhanced superoxide dismutase activity accelerates H2O2 formation. The increased H2O2 probably accounts for the exaggerated sensitivity of high superoxide dismutase bacteria to oxidant-generating drugs. These results support the concept that the product of superoxide dismutase, H2O2, is at least as hazardous as the substrate, O2-. We conclude that effective organismal defense against reactive oxygen species may require balanced increments in antioxidant enzymes and cannot necessarily be improved by increases in the activity of single enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1499918582,"A new ATP-dependent, casein-degrading proteolytic complex has been identified and partially purified from Escherichia coli. The proteolytic complex can be isolated from wild-type cells as well as from mutants in which the gene for the ATP-dependent Lon protease is deleted. The complex consists of at least two components (components I and II) that can be separated from each other (and from wild-type Lon protease) by phosphocellulose chromatography. Neither component has casein-degrading activity when added separately to assay solutions with or without ATP. Both components must be present simultaneously for casein degradation to occur. Of the nucleotides tested, only ATP activates the proteolytic complex, and the ATP must be present continuously for degradation to occur. Component II copurifies with an ATPase activity and binds to a Type 4 ATP affinity column. ATP protects component II from heat inactivation, suggesting that component II interacts with ATP. Proteolysis was not inhibited by any serine protease inhibitors but was inhibited by reagents such as the organomercurial Neohydrin and N-ethylmaleimide, which react with sulfhydryl groups. Our data provide convincing evidence that E. coli possesses a previously undescribed proteolytic system composed of at least two complementary components and absolutely dependent on ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1535328119,"The soluble form of a bacteriophage-induced endo-N-acetylneuraminidase (Endo-N) specific for hydrolyzing oligo- or poly-alpha-2,8-linked sialosyl units in sources as disparate as bacterial and neural membrane glycoconjugates was purified approximately 10,000-fold and characterized. The enzyme appears homogenous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and has a subunit Mr 105,000. This corresponds to one of the higher Mr phage proteins which comprises 7.5% (by weight) of the total phage protein. The holoenzyme is active at neutral pH and has a Mr by gel filtration of 328,000, suggesting that the active enzyme is a trimer. Endo-N requires a minimum of 5 sialyl residues (DP5, where DP represents degree of polymerization) for activity. The limit digest products from the alpha-2,8-linked polysialic acid capsule of Escherichia coli K1 are DP4 with some DP3 and DP1,2. DP2-4 do not appear to inhibit depolymerization of polysialic acid. Endo-N digestion of the polysialosyl moiety on neural cell adhesion molecules yields sialyl oligomers with DP3 and DP4. The presence of a terminal sialitol changes both the distribution of limit digestion products and the apparent minimum substrate size. Higher Mr alpha-2,8-linked sialyl polymers (approximately DP200) are better substrates (Km 50-70 microM) than sialyl oligomers of approximately DP10-20 (Km 1.2 mM). Endo-N activity is inhibited by DNA and several other poly-anions tested. An examination of the distribution of intermediate products shows that Endo-N binds and cleaves at random sites on the polysialosyl chains, in contrast to initiating cleavage at one end and depolymerizing processively. Endo-N can serve as a specific molecular probe to detect and selectively modify poly-alpha-2,8-sialosyl carbohydrate units which have been implicated in bacterial meningitis and neural cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1985850161,"This report describes the characterization of a genomic locus in the rat that encodes overlapping genes occupying both strands of the same piece of DNA. One gene (strand) encodes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). A second gene, SH, is transcribed from the other DNA strand to produce RNA of undefined function. The RNAs transcribed from each DNA strand are spliced and polyadenylated, and share significant exon domains. GnRH is expressed in the central nervous system while SH transcripts are present in the heart. Thus, the genome of a mammalian organism encodes two distinct genes by using both strands of the same DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1602557976,"Abstract Preliminary studies from our laboratory have suggested the existence of a novel set of fatty acyltransferases in extracts of Escherichia coli that attach two R-3-hydroxymyristoyl moieties to UDP-GlcNAc (Anderson, M.S., Bulawa, C.E., and Raetz, C.R.H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15536-15541). The resulting glucosamine-derived phospholipids appear to be crucial precursors for the biosynthesis of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide. We now describe an assay and a 1000-fold purification of the first enzyme in this pathway, which catalyzes the reaction: UDP-GlcNAc + R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-acyl carrier protein----UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc + acyl carrier protein. The covalent structure of the monoacylated UDP-GlcNAc product was established by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The UDP-GlcNAc acyltransferase has a strict requirement for R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-acyl carrier protein, since R-3-hydroxymyristoyl coenzyme A and myristoyl-acyl carrier protein are not substrates. Of various NDP-GlcNAc preparations examined, only the uridine and thymidine derivatives were utilized to a significant extent. When the product of the reaction (UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-GlcNAc) was isolated and reincubated with crude E. coli extracts, it was rapidly converted to more hydrophobic products in the presence of R-3-hydroxymyristoyl-acyl carrier protein. We propose that the addition of an R-3-hydroxymyristoyl residue to the 3 position of the GlcNAc moiety of UDP-GlcNAc is the first committed step in lipid A biosynthesis and that UDP-GlcNAc is situated at a biosynthetic branchpoint in E. coli leading either to lipid A or to peptidoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W1602729937,"A three-dimensional model of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, based on the homologous horse liver enzyme, was used to compare the substrate binding pockets of the three isozymes (I, II, and III) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the enzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Isozyme I and the S. pombe enzyme have methionine at position 294 (numbered as in the liver enzyme, corresponding to 270 in yeast), whereas isozymes II and III have leucine. Otherwise the active sites of the S. cerevisiae enzymes are the same. All four wild-type enzymes were produced from the cloned genes. In addition, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to change Met-294 in alcohol dehydrogenase I to leucine. The mechanisms for all five enzymes were predominantly ordered with ethanol (but partially random with butanol) at pH 7.3 and 30 degrees C. The wild-type alcohol dehydrogenases and the leucine mutant had similar kinetic constants, except that isozyme II had 10-20-fold smaller Michaelis and inhibition constants for ethanol. Thus, residue 294 is not responsible for this difference. Apparently, substitutions outside of the substrate binding pocket indirectly affect the interactions of the alcohol dehydrogenases with ethanol. Nevertheless, the substitution of methionine with leucine in the substrate binding site of alcohol dehydrogenase I produced a 7-10-fold increase in reactivity (V/Km) with butanol, pentanol, and hexanol. The higher activity is due to tighter binding of the longer chain alcohols and to more rapid hydrogen transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1571670108,"The translocation of occupied surface insulin receptors to the nuclei of isolated hepatocytes was studied using the biologically active photosensitive insulin derivative, B2(2-nitro-4-azidophenylacetyl)-des-PheB1-insulin (NAPA-DP-insulin). When hepatocytes were photolabeled at 4 degrees C, extensively washed, and then further incubated at 37 degrees C for 1 h, photolabeled insulin receptors, which were initially localized to the cell surface, accumulated in the subsequently isolated nuclei. When the isolated nuclei were solubilized and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and radioautography, labeled proteins with Mr identical to the cell surface insulin receptor were detected. Light microscopic radioautography of nuclei isolated from cells incubated for 1 ha at 37 degrees C demonstrated that 28% of these nuclei were specifically labeled with one or more grains. Electron microscopic radioautography of intact cultured hepatocytes, incubated 60 min at 37 degrees C, revealed that 26% of the thin-sectioned nuclei contained at least a single grain and 8.3% of the total cell-associated associated grains were located over the nuclei. Only 1.6% of grains were localized to lysosomes. In contrast, if photolabeled hepatocytes were incubated at 4 degrees C for up to 2 h, negligible accumulation of nuclear radioactivity was observed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on light or electron microscopic radioautography. Conclusions are as follows. Occupied cell surface insulin receptors can internalize and translocate to the nucleus of intact hepatocytes by a time- and temperature-dependent mechanism. Accumulation and possible degradation of insulin receptors in lysosomes involves only a small percentage of the receptors internalized. Nuclear translocation of occupied cell surface insulin receptors may be a mechanism which mediates insulin's long term effects."
https://openalex.org/W1548206622,"The lon gene product in Escherichia coli is an ATP-dependent protease (La) that plays an important role in the breakdown of abnormal proteins and certain normal polypeptides. Since transcription of the lon gene rises as part of the heat-shock response, we studied the physiological effects of increased levels of protease La. In cells carrying additional copies of the lon gene under the control of the lac or tac promoter, induction of the protease resulted in a rapid cessation of cell growth and in a loss of viability at stationary phase. Similarly, cells carrying a multicopy plasmid encoding the lon gene contained 2-5-fold more protease La and grew much more slowly than did control cells. In such cells, insertion sequences appeared spontaneously in the lon gene on the plasmid and prevented the excess protease production and allowed more rapid growth. The cells with increased content of protease La (due to the lon plasmid or induction of the lon gene) exhibited severalfold higher rates of degradation of abnormal proteins containing amino acid analogs and of incomplete polypeptides containing puromycin. Also, a beta-galactosidase fusion protein with enzymatic activity was relatively stable in control cells but unstable in the cells with high protease La content. In these cells, the overall degradation of normal proteins increased 2-fold, and certain cellular polypeptides appeared particularly sensitive to proteolysis. Thus, rates of protein degradation in vivo are limited in part by the cellular content of the ATP-dependent protease, and increases in transcription of the lon gene enhance proteolysis and can be deleterious to the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1539163638,"We have isolated, cloned, and characterized cDNA and genomic DNA corresponding to the mRNA and gene for the rat mast cell protease, RMCP II. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA provides evidence that this protease is synthesized as a precursor, with a signal peptide and additional residues at the N and C termini. RNA homologous to the cDNA is expressed only in mast cells. Analysis of RNA from the two subclasses of mast cell, mucosal and serosal, indicates subclass specific expression of the different proteases found in each of these two subclasses. S1 protection analysis and the sequence of the genomic clone indicate that the serosal mast cell protease, RMCP I, is likely to be coded for by a separate, highly homologous gene. A comparison of the exon/intron structure of the RMCP II gene with genes of related serine proteases further indicates that RMCP II is a member of a family of proteases distinct from those found in the pancreas. We have also isolated a third gene, highly homologous to RMCP II but different from it and from the gene for RMCP I. Analysis of the 5' transcriptional control region of both genes showed striking homology to the TATA box and enhancer regions of the pancreatic proteases."

https://openalex.org/W1587897047,"A 1476-base pair DNA fragment from Haemophilus haemolyticus containing the HhaI methyltransferase gene was isolated from a cell library and cloned into pBR322. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined. The structural gene is 981 nucleotides in length coding for a protein of 327 amino acids (Mr 37,000). The translational start signal (ATG) is preceded by the putative ribosome-binding site (TAAG). Recombinant plasmids containing the 1476-basepair fragment are completely methylated when isolated from Escherichia coli, as judged by their insusceptibility to the HhaI restriction endonuclease. However, the presence of an active HhaI methylase gene in certain E. coli strains results in a very poor yield of transformants and/or in vivo-originated deletions due to the Rg1 functions of these hosts. The in vivo transcription initiation sites have been identified by S1 protection and primer-extension experiments using specific probes with total RNA prepared from E. coli cells (HB101 or RR1) which tolerate the expression of MHhaI."
https://openalex.org/W2141586704,"We have used the Nitella-based movement assay to localize the site of force production in myosin. Methods were developed to use nonfilamentous myosin or proteolytic fragments of myosin in place of the thick filaments used in the original assay. In the experiments described here, the tail of myosin or its subfragments is anchored via antibodies to the surface of small particles. Nonfilamentous myosin or its subfragments move along Nitella actin cables at speeds similar to those obtained with filamentous myosin. We generated short HMM, a myosin fragment containing the heads and only 400 Å of the tail. Although short HMM lacks the “hinge” region proposed by Harrington to be the site of force generation, and is incapable of forming thick filaments, it moves along actin at speeds above 1 μm/sec. Therefore, neither a thick filament nor the carboxy-terminal 1100 Å of the tail is required for movement along actin. The results indicate that force production occurs in or near the myosin heads."
https://openalex.org/W1501105062,"The RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 is sensitive to cleavage by a protease associated with the membrane fraction of many strains of Escherichia coli. A major degradation product is a T7 RNA polymerase that is proteolytically cleaved between amino acids 172 (lysine) and 173 (arginine) (Tabor, S., and Richardson, C.C. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 1074-1078). The cleavage splits the enzyme into a large fragment (Mr approximately 75,000) and a small fragment (Mr approximately 23,000) which remain tightly associated during the purification of nicked RNA polymerase. The protein retains RNA polymerase activity, but specific activity is reduced 3.5-fold. The proteolytic cleavage also reduces the Mg2+ requirements, increases the apparent Michaelis-Menten constants for the utilization of the ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates, increases the temperature sensitivity, increases the sensitivity to inhibition by heparin, and increases the probability that a transcript will not be removed from the template. The reduced activity of nicked T7 RNA polymerase is apparently a consequence of inefficient initiation and premature termination. Nicked T7 RNA polymerase successfully initiates at the phi 10 promoter at half the efficiency of native T7 RNA polymerase. Transcripts synthesized by the nicked enzyme are also significantly shorter than transcripts synthesized by the native enzyme. In contrast, nicked T7 RNA polymerase and T7 RNA polymerase exhibit equivalent poly(dI).poly(dC)-dependent activity and equivalent polymerization velocities (60 bases/s at 25 degrees C)."
https://openalex.org/W1537396811,"The giant extracellular hemoglobin (3,800 kDa) of the oligochaete Lumbricus terrestris consists of four subunits: a monomer (chain I), two subunits each of about 35 kDa (chains V and VI), and a disulfide-bonded trimer (50 kDa) of chains II, III, and IV. The complete amino acid sequence of chain I was determined: it consists of 142 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 16,750 including a heme group. Fifty-nine residues (42%) were found to be identical with those in the corresponding positions in Lumbricus chain II (Garlick, R. L., and Riggs, A. F. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9005-9015); 45 (32%), 56 (40%), 44 (31%), and 45 (32%) residues were found to be in identical positions in the sequences of chains I, IIA, IIB, and IIC, respectively, of Tylorrhynchus heterochaetus hemoglobin (Suzuki, T., and Gotoh, T.

When the sequences of all six annelid chains are compared, 18 invariant residues are found in the first 104 residues of the molecule; very little homology exists among the annelid chains in the carboxyl-terminal 38-residue region. Nine of the 18 invariant residues are also found in the human beta-globin chain."
https://openalex.org/W1542794937,"We have employed equilibrium dialysis to help study the mechanism by which the unliganded Escherichia coli trp aporepressor is activated by L-tryptophan to the liganded trp repressor. By measuring the relative affinity of L-tryptophan and various tryptophan analogues for the co-repressor's binding site, we have estimated the extent to which each of the functional groups of L-tryptophan contributes to the liganding process and discuss their role in the context of the crystal structures of the trp repressor and aporepressor. We have found that the indole ring and alpha carboxyl group of L-tryptophan are mainly responsible for its affinity to the aporepressor. The alpha amino group, however, has a small negative contribution to the affinity of L-tryptophan for the aporepressor which may be associated with its essential role in operator-specific binding."
https://openalex.org/W1565622256,"The specificity and reactivity of complement serine proteases D, B, Bb, C2, and C2a were determined using a series of peptide thioester substrates. The rates of thioester hydrolysis were measured using assay mixtures containing the thiol reagent 4,4'-dithiodipyridine at pH 7.5. Each substrate contained a P1 arginine residue, and the effect of various groups and amino acids in the P2, P3, P4, and P5 positions was determined using kcat/Km values to compare reactivities. Among peptide thioesters corresponding to the activation site sequence in B, dipeptide thioesters containing a P2 lysine residue were the best substrates for D. Extending the chain to include a P3 or P4 amino acid resulted in loss of activity, and neither the tripeptide nor the tetrapeptide containing the cleavage sequence of B was hydrolyzed. Overall, D cleaved fewer substrates and was 2-3 orders of magnitude less reactive than C1s against some thioester substrates. C2 and fragment C2a had comparable reactivities and hydrolyzed peptides containing Leu-Ala-Arg and Leu-Gly-Arg, which have the same sequence as the cleavage sites of C3 and C5, respectively. The best substrates for C2 and C2a were Z-Gly-Leu-Ala-Arg-SBzl and Z-Leu-Gly-Leu-Ala-Arg-SBzl, respectively, where Bzl is benzyl. B was the least reactive among these complement enzymes. The best substrate for B was Z-Lys-Arg-SBzl with a kcat/Km value of 1370 M-1 s-1. The catalytic fragment of B, Bb, had higher activity toward these peptide thioester substrates. The best substrate for Bb was Z-Gly-Leu-Ala-Arg-SBzl with a kcat/Km similar to C2a and 10 times higher than the value for B. Both C2a and Bb were considerably more reactive against C3-like than C5-like substrates. Bovine trypsin hydrolyzed thioester substrates with kcat/Km approximately 10(3) higher than the complement enzymes. These thioester substrates for D, B, and C2 should be quite useful in kinetic and active site studies of the purified enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1503889371,"The effects of insulin therapy in streptozotocin diabetic rats on the glucose transport response to insulin in adipose cells have been examined. At sequential intervals during subcutaneous insulin infusion, isolated cells were prepared and incubated with or without insulin, and 3-O-methylglucose transport was measured. Insulin treatment not only reversed the insulin-resistant glucose transport associated with diabetes, but resulted in a progressive hyperresponsiveness, peaking with a 3-fold overshoot at 7-8 days (12.1 +/- 0.3 versus 3.4 +/- 0.1 fmol/cell/min, mean +/- S.E.) and remaining elevated for more than 3 weeks. During the peak overshoot, glucose transporters in subcellular membrane fractions were assessed by cytochalasin B binding. Insulin therapy restored glucose transporter concentration in the plasma membranes of insulin-stimulated cells from a 40% depleted level previously reported in the diabetic state to approximately 35% greater than control (38 +/- 4 versus 28 +/- 2 pmol/mg of membrane protein). Glucose transporter concentration in the low-density microsomes from basal cells was also restored from an approximately 45% depleted level back to normal (50 +/- 4 versus 50 +/- 6 pmol/mg of membrane protein), whereas total intracellular glucose transporters were further increased due to an approximately 2-fold increase in low-density microsomal membrane protein. However, these increases remained markedly less than the enhancement of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in the intact cell. Thus, insulin treatment of diabetic rats produces a marked and sustained hyperresponsive insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in the adipose cell with little more than a restoration to the non-diabetic control level of glucose transporter translocation. Because this enhanced glucose transport activity occurs through an increase in Vmax, insulin therapy appears to be associated with a marked increase in glucose transporter intrinsic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1485166055,"Certain phosphatidylglycerol-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli accumulate two fatty acylated monosaccharides related to lipid A biosynthesis that have been identified as 2,3-diacylglucosamine 1-phosphate (lipid X) and triacylglucosamine 1-phosphate (lipid Y) (Raetz, C. R. H. (1984) Rev. Infect. Dis. 6, 463-472). Lipid Y has the same structure as lipid X, except that it bears an additional palmitoyl moiety, esterified to the 3-OH of the N-linked R-3-hydroxymyristoyl residue. We now describe a membrane-associated system for the enzymatic conversion of lipid X to lipid Y. Removal of glycerophospholipids form such membranes by washing with cold ethanol abolishes the activity. The system can be reactivated by the addition of exogenous phospholipids dispersed as mixed micelles with Triton X-100. When reconstituted in this manner, the formation of lipid Y is strictly dependent upon a glycerophospholipid donor bearing a palmitoyl residue in the sn-1 position. The enzyme system does not utilize palmitoyl coenzyme A or palmitoyl acyl carrier protein. It does not catalyze efficient transfer of fatty acids differing from palmitate by only one carbon atom. In contrast, the enzyme has relatively little specificity for the polar headgroup of the phospholipid donor, and it also appears to utilize a disaccharide precursor of lipid A as an alternative palmitoyl acceptor. Since the in vitro synthesis of lipid Y proceeds with a high yield, we have isolated the product and verified its structure by 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The transesterification reaction that converts lipid X to lipid Y may be a model for the enzymatic synthesis of other acyloxyacyl structures, known to occur in mature lipid A."
https://openalex.org/W1602494726,"Amino acids have been deleted from the processing site of pre-beta-lactamase, either into the signal sequence or into the mature protein. Whereas the loss of more than 2 amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of the signal sequence prevents the translocation of the protein into the periplasm, the removal of two or more amino acids from the beginning of the mature protein has no effect on the translocation of the truncated protein. The insertion of an additional one to three amino acids at the processing site has no detectable phenotypic consequence either. It appears that many sequences for the first few residues of the mature protein allow successful translocation and processing. In sharp contrast, the removal of one (but not both) of the amino acids that flank the processing site results in a severe growth defect in the host cell and very low expression of the protein. Yet removal of two amino acids from either side of the processing site, or removal of both the flanking residues of the processing site, results in normal secretion and signal cleavage. These results illustrate the limits on the amino acid sequence around the processing junction and suggest that interference with the signal cleavage step can lead not only to aborted secretion but also to pleiotropic consequences for the growth of the host organism."
https://openalex.org/W1544588529,"Abstract Effects of insulin on the kinetic parameters of hexose transport in rat epididymal adipocytes were re-examined. The transport activity was assessed by measuring the rate of uptake of 3-O-[3H]methyl-D-glucose (MeGlc) under equilibrium exchange and zero-trans conditions. The incubation was carried out at 37 degrees C in an infant incubator. During the incubation, the cell suspension (25%, v/v, in a total volume of 48 microliter) was mechanically swirled at a rate of 600 rpm (r = 2 mm). The swirling facilitated the rapid uptake of MeGlc without stimulating the basal transport activity by mechanical agitation. The basal and insulin-treated cells were incubated under identical conditions, except for the length of the incubation period. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 350 microliters of 1 mM phloretin, which inhibited transport in approximately 0.06 s. The time course of MeGlc uptake was consistent with the view that the process was a multiple-phase reaction. The initial phase of the reaction was completed when the intracellular distribution space of MeGlc was approximately 1% of the total cell volume. Insulin (10 nM) increased the Vmax value of MeGlc uptake 16-fold in equilibrium exchange experiments and 18-fold in zero-trans experiments. At the same time, the hormone decreased the Km value of MeGlc uptake from 11.7 to 5.4 mM in equilibrium exchange experiments and from 9.7 to 4.8 mM in zero-trans experiments. It is concluded that the major effect of insulin on MeGlc uptake is to increase the Vmax value, but the hormone has the additional effect of lowering the apparent Km value."
https://openalex.org/W1515986743,"The binding affinity of the Escherichia coli lactose repressor to operator-containing plasmids was increased by negative supercoiling of the DNA. The increased affinities observed were dependent on the sequence context of the DNA as well as the degree of supercoiling. Dissociation rate constants for plasmids containing a single operator site decreased as a function of the negative supercoil density. However, the presence of pseudooperators in the plasmid DNA in addition to the primary operator sequence resulted in a significant decrease in the operator-plasmid dissociation rate at higher negative supercoil densities. Approximately eight ionic interactions were determined for both the supercoiled plasmids and the linear DNAs examined. These results suggest that the stabilization provided by the topology of supercoiled DNA affects the nonionic component of the protein-DNA interaction. The ability to form a ternary complex of protein with two DNA segments is increased by the presence of multiple operator-like sites on the DNA. Furthermore, supercoiling DNA with multiple operator-like sequences profoundly diminishes the dissociation rate and results in a remarkably stable ternary, presumably looped complex (t1/2 approximately 28 h). These data suggest a critical role in vivo for DNA topology and pseudooperator(s) in transcriptional regulation of the lac operon."
https://openalex.org/W1584257931,"Abstract The hydrogenase solubilized from the particulate fraction from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F (IAM 12604) has been crystallized. Although the solubilized hydrogenase purified by the previous method (Yagi, T., Kimura, K., Daidoji, H., Sakai, F., Tamura, S., and Inokuchi, H. (1976) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 79,661-671) revealed a single band upon disc electrophoresis, it could not be crystallized. The apparently homogeneous hydrogenase has been separated into three components of similar molecular weights by high performance liquid chromatography on DEAE-Toyopearl. Each hydrogenase component was successfully crystallized by means of the vapor diffusion method with polyethylene glycol or 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as a precipitating agent. Seeding procedure is necessary to grow an x-ray grade crystal. Preliminary x-ray experiments reveal that crystals grown from one component are in space group of P2(1)2(1)2(1) with a = 102.1(1), b = 126.8 (3), and c = 66.9(1) A. The unit cell volume of 8.66 X 10(5) A3 suggests that it contains one molecule/asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.43). The crystals grown from another component are in the same space group with a = 99.6(1), b = 126.8(3), c = 66.9(1) A, and the unit cell volume is 8.45 X 10(5) A3 (Vm = 2.37). The crystals diffract more than 2.5 A and are suitable for complete crystal analysis. Up to 4 A resolution native data have been collected on a diffractometer."
https://openalex.org/W1542255203,"Counterflow centrifugal elutriation and Percoll density gradient centrifugation were employed to prepare cell populations from rat bone marrow that were selectively enriched in the cytoplasmically immature megakaryocytes and depleted of the most mature megakaryocytes. The incorporation of [14C]leucine into the platelet-specific alpha-granule protein, platelet factor 4, as well as the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into platelet proteoglycans synthesized by the maturing megakaryocytes were monitored as markers of cytoplasmic maturation. Rat platelet factor 4 was specifically isolated and characterized by its high affinity for heparin-Sepharose and its amino-terminal sequence homology to human and rabbit platelet factor 4. The [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans were primarily composed of chondroitin 4-sulfate glycosaminoglycans and were identified as platelet granule components by their ability to be secreted by megakaryocytes in response to thrombin or A23187. The production of both components was increased as much as 3-fold in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of picomolar concentrations of purified megakaryocyte stimulatory factor, without a concomitant increase in general protein synthesis. The above results suggest that the megakaryocyte stimulatory factor may regulate the synthesis of platelet granule components by megakaryocytes and hence control the rate and/or extent of cytoplasmic maturation during megakaryocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W1565917945,"Glucosidase II is regarded as a resident protein of the endoplasmatic reticulum. The enzyme removes alpha-1-3-linked glucose from high mannose oligosaccharides N-linked to asparagine residues of glycoproteins. Monospecific antibodies raised against the pig kidney enzyme are used to study the metabolism of the enzyme in a rat hepatoma cell line. These antiglucosidase II antibodies specifically immune precipitate glucosidase II as a 100,000-Da species from [35S]methionine-labeled cells. In addition, protein blotting and immune staining of cell extracts from both rat liver and human and rat hepatoma cell lines show identity in apparent Mr (100,000). Glucosidase II synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin is approximately 94,000 Da, indicating the presence of one or more N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Cell-free protein synthesis of rat hepatoma total RNA demonstrates that glucosidase II is synthesized as a slightly higher molecular weight species as compared to the polypeptide synthesized in whole cells in the presence of tunicamycin, indicating that the enzyme has a cleavable signal sequence. Using a pulse-chase protocol, the apparent molecular weight does not change upon longer chase periods. In addition, the 100,000-Da protein remains sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H regardless of prolonged chase periods. The cells incorporate [3H]mannose into the enzyme; after release with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, most of the radioactivity comigrates with Glc1-Man9-GlcNAc on a gel filtration column. Phase separation in Triton X-114 shows a partition between the aqueous and the Triton phase, the major portion being separated in the aqueous phase. In rat hepatoma cells glucosidase II has a half-life of 50 min. This value is not altered if the cells are grown in the presence of monensin nor of methyl-deoxynoijirimycin. However, tunicamycin and low concentrations or primaquine (raising the pH of acidic compartments) causes a 100% increase in half-life of glucosidase II. We conclude that glucosidase II is a hydrophilic, probably not a transmembrane membrane, protein with a short half-life. It is the first example of an oligosaccharide-processing enzyme not being an integral membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1560972500,"S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is one of a small group of enzymes that use a pyruvoyl residue as a cofactor. Histidine decarboxylase from Lactobacillus 30a, the best studied pyruvoyl-containing enzyme, has an (alpha beta)6 subunit structure with the pyruvoyl moiety linked through an amide bond to the NH2-terminal of the larger alpha subunit (Recsei, P. A., Huynh, Q. K., and Snell, E. E. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 973-977). To examine potential structural analogies between the two enzymes, we have isolated and partially characterized S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. The purified enzyme comprises equimolar amounts of two subunits of Mr = 14,000 and 19,000 (by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and has a native molecular weight of 136,000 (by gel filtration). Approximately 4 mol of [methyl-3H] adenosylmethionine are incorporated per mol of enzyme (Mr = 136,000) when the enzyme is inactivated with this substrate and NaCNBH3. These data suggest an (alpha beta)4 structure with 1 pyruvoyl residue for each alpha beta pair. The two subunits have been separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography after reduction and carboxymethylation. The smaller subunit (beta) has a free amino terminus. The amino terminus of the larger subunit (alpha) appears to be blocked by a pyruvoyl group; this subunit can be sequenced only after this group is converted to an alanyl residue by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence of ammonium acetate. This work suggests that S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is structurally much more similar to histidine decarboxylase than previously thought."

https://openalex.org/W1576801374,"The association of nicked RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 (Ikeda, R. A., and Richardson, C. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3790-3799) with the T7 phi 10 promoter has been examined by DNA cleavage protection. The phi 10 promoter consists of a 23-base pair consensus sequence that extends from −17 to +6 with respect to the site of the initiation of transcription (+1). Nicked T7 RNA polymerase alone protects 20 bases from −21 to −2 (+/- 1) base at each border. Initiation and synthesis of the trinucleotide r(GGG) expands and shifts the sequence protected by nicked T7 RNA polymerase. Twenty-five bases are protected from −17 to +8 (+/- 1). The polymerization of three additional ribonucleotides, synthesis of the hexamer r(GGGAGA), further expands the protected sequence. Twenty-seven bases are protected from −17-+10 (+/- 1). Finally, the synthesis of a pentadecaribonucleotide transcript, r(GGGAGACCACGG), leads to the formation of a transcription complex that protects 22 bases from −2-+20 (+/- 1). In comparison to the sequences protected by T7 RNA polymerase the sequences protected by the nicked enzyme are shortened at the 5' end and are translocated downstream much earlier during the initiation of transcription. It appears that a portion of the DNA contacts made at the amino terminus of T7 RNA polymerase are disrupted in the small fragment of nicked T7 RNA polymerase. The changes that are observed in the sequences protected by nicked T7 RNA polymerase are reflected in the physical characteristics of the DNA X enzyme complexes. The number of ion pairs formed by the r(GGG)-initiated complex of the nicked enzyme is reduced, and the association constant for the formation of the r(GGG)-initiated complex is decreased as compared to the intact T7 RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1560554160,"The Daudi line of human lymphoblastoid cells requires insulin and transferrin for growth in serum-free medium and is highly sensitive to the inhibitory effect of human leukocyte interferon (IFN-alpha) on cell proliferation. A variant subline of Daudi cells, which is resistant to the antiproliferative action of IFN-alpha, also has been grown in serum-free medium containing insulin and transferrin. The proliferation of IFN-sensitive and -resistant Daudi cells is dependent on the occupancy of insulin receptors, with optimal cell proliferation observed at high receptor occupancy (nearly 100%). No evidence was found for receptors for insulin-like growth factor I on Daudi cells. IFN treatment of IFN-sensitive cells decreased the capacity of the cells to bind 125I-insulin. The altered binding capacity was due to diminished specific, lower affinity insulin binding, as detected at high 125I-insulin concentrations. Higher affinity insulin binding was not altered by IFN. Insulin binding was also reduced in detergent-solubilized extracts from IFN-treated sensitive Daudi cells and the magnitude of the effect was comparable to that observed in intact cells. This indicates that the total number of insulin binding sites (surface + internal) is decreased in IFN-treated sensitive cells. Insulin binding to IFN-sensitive cells decreased linearly with time between 6 and 48 h from the addition of IFN. The effect on lower affinity insulin binding developed more rapidly than the inhibitory effect of IFN on cell proliferation. The insulin-binding capacity of Daudi cells resistant to the antiproliferative effect of IFN was unaffected by IFN, despite the fact that these cells contain as many cell surface IFN receptors as sensitive cells. These observations raise the possibility that lower affinity insulin binding is important in the growth-promoting actions of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1526201630,"The glutamic acid:tyrosine (Glu:Tyr) synthetic polymer was observed to inhibit the insulin receptor beta subunit autophosphorylation with an IC50 of 0.20 mg/ml in the absence and 0.15 mg/ml in the presence of insulin. Even though complete blockade of beta subunit autophosphorylation was observed at 4.0 mg/ml Glu:Tyr, insulin was still capable of stimulating the exogenous protein kinase activity of the insulin receptor toward Glu:Tyr. Histone H2B (1.3 mg/ml) was also observed to inhibit the beta subunit autophosphorylation by approximately 80% with an IC50 of 0.31 and 0.35 mg/ml in the absence and presence of insulin, respectively. Similar to the results with Glu:Tyr, insulin was found to stimulate histone H2B phosphorylation under these conditions. Comparisons between the time courses of beta subunit autophosphorylation with those of Glu:Tyr phosphorylation both in the presence and absence of insulin confirmed that insulin can stimulate the exogenous protein kinase activity of the insulin receptor in the complete absence of beta subunit autophosphorylation. Prephosphorylation of the insulin receptor (from 0 to 1.3 mol of phosphate/mol of insulin receptor) in the absence of insulin was found to have no significant effect on the exogenous protein kinase activity when assayed both in the presence and absence of insulin. Insulin was observed to stimulate the phosphorylation of Glu:Tyr approximately 3-fold independent of the extent of beta subunit autophosphorylation. In contrast, prephosphorylation of the insulin receptors in the presence of insulin was observed to enhance the exogenous protein kinase activity dependent on the extent of autophosphorylation, such that by 1.4 mol of phosphate incorporated per mol of insulin receptor, insulin was found to maximally stimulate the initial rate of Glu:Tyr phosphorylation (approximately 9-fold). These results demonstrate that the insulin-dependent autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor results in an amplification of the insulin stimulation of the exogenous protein kinase activity, whereas the insulin-independent autophosphorylation does not."
https://openalex.org/W1580019381,"The gene 1.2 protein of bacteriophage T7, a protein required for phage T7 growth on Escherichia coli optA1 strains, has been purified to apparent homogeneity and shown to restore DNA packaging activity of extracts prepared from E. coli optA1 cells infected with T7 gene 1.2 mutants (Myers, J. A., Beauchamp, B. B., White, J. H., and Richardson, C. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5280-5287). After infection of E. coli optA1 by T7 gene 1.2 mutant phage, under conditions where phage DNA synthesis is blocked, the intracellular pools of dATP, dTTP, and dCTP increase 10-40-fold, similar to the increase observed in an infection with wild-type T7. However, the pool of dGTP remains unchanged in the mutant-infected cells as opposed to a 200-fold increase in the wild-type phage-infected cells. Uninfected E. coli optA+ strains contain severalfold higher levels of dGTP compared to E. coli optA1 cells. In agreement with this observation, dGTP can fully substitute for purified gene 1.2 protein in restoring DNA packaging activity to extracts prepared from E. coli optA1 cells infected with T7 gene 1.2 mutants. dGMP or polymers containing deoxyguanosine can also restore packaging activity while dGDP is considerably less effective. dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and ribonucleotides have no significant effect. The addition of dGTP or dGMP to packaging extracts restores DNA synthesis. Gene 1.2 protein elevates the level of dGTP in these packaging extracts and restores DNA synthesis, thus suggesting that depletion of a guanine deoxynucleotide pool in E. coli optA1 cells infected with T7 gene 1.2 mutants may account for the observed defects."
https://openalex.org/W1530964561,"Proteolytic digests of biologically active fractions of recombinant human leukocyte interferon A expressed in large quantities in Escherichia coli were analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. The values observed in the mass spectra of digests of the major fraction of recombinant human leukocyte interferon A with trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus protease V8 accounted for 93% of the amino acid sequences of human leukocyte interferon A predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the protein, indicating that the major fraction of recombinant human leukocyte interferon A was expressed with the same amino acid sequence as that translated from the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the protein. Mass spectrometry of proteolytic digests of two minor fractions of recombinant human leukocyte interferon A and mass and amino acid analyses of their high-performance liquid chromatography fractions showed that the amino group of the N-terminal amino acid residue of interferon was in part acetylated, and the Cys-1 and Cys-98 residues were oxidized to cysteic acid or linked to glutathione. These findings suggest that amino acid residues in recombinant proteins prepared in large quantities in E. coli are modified post-translationally."

https://openalex.org/W1607616043,"The existence of two types of circulating bovine plasma high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) was predicted from analyses of complementary DNAs coding for this protein (Kitamura, N., Takagaki, Y., Furuto, S., Tanaka, T., Nawa, H., and Nakanishi, S. (1983) Nature 305, 545-549). The present protein-based study provided evidence in support of the proposed amino acid sequence derived from analysis of the cDNA clone, and the results confirm the existence of two types of circulating HMWK. Type I HMWK contains a heavy chain composed of 361 residues, while the heavy chain of type II HMWK contains 359 residues. The amino acid sequences of type I and type II HMWK determined in this study were identical to that inferred from the cDNA sequence with the exception of microheterogeneity observed in the cDNA at position 87 (Glu/Gln) and 168 (Lys/Arg). The heavy chain of type I HMWK contains 4 asparagine-linked carbohydrate chains at Asn-69, −150 (or −151), −179, and −186, while the heavy chain of type II HMWK contains these and an additional carbohydrate chain at Asn-264. In addition, a carbohydrate chain was found to be O-glycosidically linked to Thr-118 in both chains. Among nine disulfide linkages found in HMWK, eight intrachain disulfide pairs were established in the heavy chain. One interchain disulfide bridge occurs between the heavy chain and the light chain. This disulfide pairing, as well as repeating amino acid sequences observed in the heavy chain, provides strong evidence for the existence of three homologous domains in the heavy chain of bovine HMWK."
https://openalex.org/W1590916512,"The aggregate structure of lipopolysaccharide isolated from an Re strain of Escherichia coli was examined at different pH values using small angle neutron scattering. At pH values of 6 and 7.4, angle-averaged scattering of the sodium salt of this isolate was consistent with randomly coiled tubular micelles approximately 100 A in diameter. At pH 9.1, however, Kratky analysis of the scattering data was distinctly different and consistent with pairing of uniform tubular micelle sections of length 1440 and 110 A in diameter. Contrast variation measurements of the micelles yielded an average micellar weight of the sample at pH 9.1 of approximately 1.11 X 10(7) daltons and suggested that the aggregates were tubular micelles of size and length similar to that derived from the scattering intensity data. Anisotropic scattering patterns of samples under shear indicated a rigidification of the micelles as the pH was increased to 9.1 and the temperature decreased from 25 to 10 degrees C. The rotational diffusion constants deduced from the observed shear anisotropy indicate that the structure at pH 9.1 must have smallest and largest dimensions which differ by at least an order of magnitude, ruling out spherical or moderately ellipsoidal structures. Analysis of the shear rate needed to induce anisotropic scattering indicated that the stiffness length of the micelles at pH 9.1 was approximately 1000 A and decreased at higher and lower pH values."

https://openalex.org/W1529664986,Yeast genes under general amino acid control contain multiple copies of a sequence known as the TGACT repeat in the 5'-flanking DNA. The yeast TRP5 gene contains two copies of the TGACT repeat sequence in its 5'-flanking region. The upstream TGACT repeat of TRP5 is required for normal basal expression as well as derepression by general control. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing a TGACT sequence were inserted into previously constructed TRP5 control region deletion mutants. A synthetic 17-base pairs (bp) oligonucleotide containing a TGACT copy along with flanking nucleotides from HIS3 was able to restore derepression in all deletion mutants tested. The 17-bp oligonucleotide also functioned bidirectionally. Replacements in the upstream control region by synthetic oligonucleotides indicated that sequences other than the TGACT repeat are required for high basal expression. Replacements of the downstream repeat sequence by the 17-bp oligonucleotide suggest its main role in this position is for derepressed expression. High level derepressed expression was found to correlate with the presence of two repeats.
