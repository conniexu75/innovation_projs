https://openalex.org/W2080032941,"The oxygen-regulated control system responsible for the induction of erythropoietin (Epo) by hypoxia is present in most (if not all) cells and operates on other genes, including those involved in energy metabolism. To understand the organization of cis-acting sequences that are responsible for oxygen-regulated gene expression, we have studied the 5′ flanking region of the mouse gene encoding the hypoxically inducible enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH). Deletional and mutational analysis of the function of mouse LDH-reporter fusion gene constructs in transient transfection assays defined three domains, between −41 and −84 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site, which were crucial for oxygen-regulated expression. The most important of these, although not capable of driving hypoxic induction in isolation, had the consensus of a hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) site, and cross-competed for the binding of HIF-1 with functionally active Epo and phosphoglycerate kinase-1 sequences. The second domain was positioned close to the HIF-1 site, in an analogous position to one of the critical regions in the Epo 3′ hypoxic enhancer. The third domain had the motif of a cAMP response element (CRE). Activation of cAMP by forskolin had no effect on the level of LDH mRNA in normoxia, but produced a magnified response to hypoxia that was dependent upon the integrity of the CRE, indicating an interaction between inducible factors binding the HIF-1 and CRE sites.

The regulation of gene expression by oxygen is an important feature of many biological processes. In energy metabolism for instance, mRNA levels for a number of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes are subject to transcriptional regulation by oxygen in a coordinate and reciprocal manner(1Miles M.F.

Recent studies of Epo gene regulation have provided important insights into the mechanism of the cellular response to hypoxia. First, they have led to the proposal of a specific oxygen sensing mechanism, possibly involving a heme protein liganding with dioxygen (14Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) or forming part of a non-mitochrondrial electron transport system(15Gorlach A. Fandrey J. Holtermann G. Acker H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, they have provided strong evidence of a transcriptional response to hypoxia, which operates in a wide variety of cells. The Epo 3′ hypoxic enhancer can drive oxygen-regulated expression in many cells that do not produce the hormone(16Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 17Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and a nuclear factor termed hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which binds to a functionally critical region of the Epo enhancer, has also been shown to be widespread(18Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 19Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), with the implication that the same control mechanism might operate on other genes. A link between the regulation of Epo and of glycolytic enzymes was established by the demonstration that these genes shared similar inducible characteristics, and that the gene encoding phosphoglycerate kinase-1 also contained a functionally critical HIF-1 binding site in its 5′ enhancer(22Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Further work has demonstrated HIF-1 sites at other glycolytic gene loci(23Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not yet clear whether all of these are functional, or how they cooperate with other binding sites to produce oxygen-regulated control sequences. Detailed analysis of the oxygen-regulated enhancer lying 3′ to the Epo gene has defined at least three functional domains and has shown that cooperative interaction between these domains is required for function. Neither the Epo HIF-1 site nor the other domains in the Epo enhancer are individually capable of driving oxygen-regulated expression of a reporter, even when reiterated; cooperative interaction of at least two domains seems to be necessary for functional activity(17Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Beck I. Weinmann R. Caro J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3928-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this is a general property of oxygen-regulated gene control elements containing HIF-1 sites, because only the Epo enhancer has been subject to detailed analysis. To understand the organization of hypoxically inducible cis-acting sequences, we have therefore performed a detailed analysis of a second hypoxically inducible sequence: that contained in the mouse lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) 5′ flanking region(22Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase catalyses the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate. In anaerobic cells conversion of pyruvate to lactate regenerates NAD+ and is essential for continued glycolytic flux. The LDH-A gene encodes the M subunit of the enyzme; the isoform that is adapted for the anaerobic function. The M4 homotetramer has a low Km for pyruvate and a high Vmax, and is the predominant form expressed in glycolytically active skeletal muscle and in many tissue culture cell lines(27Markert C.L. Shaklee J.B. Whitt G.S. Science. 1975; 189: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Previous work has established that expression of both LDH-A mRNA and protein are inducible by hypoxia(3Robin E.D. Murphy B.J. Theodore J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 118: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Marti H.H. Jung H.H. Pfeilschifter J. Bauer C. Eur. J.

A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar); they are also inducible by cAMP(1Miles M.F. Hung P. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12545-12552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1994; 429: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), raising the interesting issue as to how these inducible stimuli might interact. A series of mutations in the LDH-A 5′ flanking region, scanning a region of 56 bp that was indicated as being functionally important by deletional studies, define three domains that are crucial for oxygen-regulated function. One of these is a HIF-1 binding site and is absolutely required for inducible activity. The two other domains lie on either side of this motif. One, which lies 5′ to the HIF-1 site, occupies a position similar to that of a critical cooperative site in the Epo enhancer. The other lies 3′ to the HIF-1 site and has the characteristic motif of a cyclic AMP response element (5′-TGACGTCA-3′) (28Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional cooperativity is shown between these sites; concatamers that contain the HIF-1 site alone are not capable of driving oxygen-regulated expression of a reporter through a heterologous promoter, whereas concatamers containing the HIF-1 site in conjunction with either of the other sites are, and the combination of all three sites together confers the greatest level of hypoxic inducibility. Moreover, forskolin, which modulates activity of the cAMP system by activation of protein kinase A, is shown to increase the magnitude of hypoxic induction of the LDH-A gene by interacting with the CRE. All experiments were performed on HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells grown in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml). In studies of endogenous gene expression plates were used when 70% confluent. Hypoxic stimulation (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94%N2 in most experiments; in some 0.5%, 3% and 5% O2, each with 5% CO2 and N2 to balance) was provided by incubation for 14-16 h in a Napco 7100 incubator. In all experiments the test plasmid (20-40 μg), encoding human growth hormone as a reporter, was transfected by electroporation in combination with a control plasmid (20-40 μg), which expressed human α1-globin. Transfected cells were split equally and incubated in parallel under normoxic (20% O2, 5% CO2, 75%N2) or hypoxic conditions as described above. RNA was extracted, analyzed by RNase protection, and quantitated as described previously(29Pugh C.W. Tan C.C. Jones R.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10553-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For assay of material from transiently transfected cells, double hybridization with probes that protected 120 bp of GH mRNA and 132 bp of α-globin mRNA was performed on 3-5 μg of RNA. For assay of endogenous gene expression, 25 μg of RNA was hybridized with a cRNA probe that protected 92 bp of human LDH-A mRNA transcribed from exons 2 and 3. A small quantity of antisense RNA generated by in vitro transcription of a fragment of the rat endothelin 1 gene was added to each of these samples, together with a sense probe that protected 333 bp of that transcript. Estimation of the recovery of the endothelin hybridization product served to control for the effects of variation in sample processing and gel loading between specimens. The plasmid LDHGH formed the basis for deletional and mutational analysis of the mouse LDH-A promoter(22Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This contained 233 bp of mouse LDH-A promoter and adjacent 5′ sequence, extending from position −186 to 47 (where 1 is the transcription initiation site), cloned into the BamHI site in the 5′ untranslated region of the growth hormone (GH) reporter. Progressive 5′ truncations of the LDH element in this construct were made by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides (Fig. 1). The region that was defined as critical for oxygen-regulated control of the reporter was then examined using a series of 14 consecutive 4-bp mutations of the LDHGH plasmid in which purines were substituted for their non-complementary pyrimidines, and vice versa (Fig. 2). These were made using the pALTER-based Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system as directed by the manufacturers (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom). The nucleotide sequence of the LDH element in all plasmids was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing.Figure 2:Mutational analysis of the area of the mouse LDH-A 5′ flanking region defined by the deletional study as being involved in the response to hypoxia.

The three largest elements (Fig. 3, panelB: A-C) were made from LDHGH by PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides with 5′ ends that could be digested with XbaI (5′-GCTCTAGA-(LDH sequence)-3′). The three smallest elements (Fig. 3, panelB: D-F) were synthesized as oligonucleotides, which, when phosphorylated and annealed, produced elements with 5′ XbaI- and 3′ SpeI-compatible ends (top strand: 5′-CTAGA-(LDH sequence)-A-3′; bottom strand: 5′-CTAGT-(LDH sequence)-T-3′). The elements were each then cloned into an XbaI site located 10 bp 5′ to the herpes simplex thymidine kinase TATTAA box of the reporter plasmid, which had low basal activity and was not itself inducible by hypoxia(22Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of dimers or trimers of each element was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. A modification of the protocol of Dignam et al.(30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) was used to prepare nuclear extract. Oligonucleotides used as probes or competitors (Table 1) were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeling of the 5′ nucleotide of probes was performed with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using phage T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled oligonucleotides were annealed with a 4-fold molar excess of the complementary strand. Unlabeled oligonucleotides were annealed in molar equivalent quantities. Binding reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.15-0.30 μg of sonicated poly(dI-dC). Nuclear extract (5 μg) was incubated with this mixture for 5 min at room temperature, before probe (approximately 0.1 ng) and specific competitors were added. Incubation was continued for another 10 min. Reactions were electrophoresed (12.5 V/cm) at 4°C using 5% polyacrylamide in 0.3 × TBE (30 mM Tris, 30 mM boric acid, 0.06 mM EDTA, pH 7.3, at 20°C).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The mutational analysis and the functional testing of concatamerized elements both suggested that one of the functional domains important for oxygen-regulated expression had the characteristic sequence motif of a CRE (5′-TGACGTCA-3′)(28Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of agents that modulate activity of the cAMP system on oxygen-regulated expression of the endogenous LDH gene and of transiently transfected constructs was therefore examined. Two agents were used: H8 (N-(2-[methylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide), an inhibitor of protein kinase A; and forskolin, an activator of the cAMP-protein kinase A system. For assay of endogenous LDH expression, H8 (15 μM) or forskolin (50 μM) were applied to cells incubated in normoxia, and 8 h later the plates were transferred into the hypoxic incubator, where they remained for 16 h. Controls were exposed to the agents for 24 h of normoxic incubation. In transient transfection experiments, cells were incubated with the same concentrations of H8 or forskolin for 8 h before they were harvested for electroporation, and the chemicals were applied again immediately after the cells had been plated out following transfection. Control transfections were performed in parallel using cells that were not exposed to either agent. We and others have previously reported that LDH-A mRNA is inducible by exposure to 1% O2(5Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 77: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Marti H.H.

A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In this study we found that it was inducible by hypoxia over a range of oxygen concentration from 5% to 0.5%. In comparison with paired normoxic control plates we found induction as follows: 5% O2, 1.85 ± 0.16-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 5); 3% O2, 2.03 ± 0.41 (n = 4); 1% O2, 1.67 ± 0.26 (n = 4); 0.5% O2, 2.00 ± 0.10 (n = 5). For comparison with previously published work, all experiments were performed with the 1% O2 stimulus(5Webster K.A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1991; 88: 10553-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The effect of a series of truncations of the 5′ end of the LDH sequence on the ability to drive expression of the reporter in normoxia and hypoxia are shown in Fig. 1. Deletion of 16 bp between L3 and L3.2 caused a reduction of only 16 ± 6% (n = 4) in the level of normoxic expression, but a fall in the ratio of hypoxic/normoxic expression from 7.9 ± 1.9 to 1.5 ± 0.3, thus defining the 5′ extent of the oxygen-regulated control element. The effect of a series of 14 consecutive 4 bp mutations, the most 5′ of which begins 8 bp 5′ to the first truncation shown to ablate oxygen-regulated function (L3.2), is shown in Fig. 2. Three domains are important, defined by mutations (M) 1, M4-M5, and M10-M11, of which the one affected by M4-M5 seems to be the most significant, since these mutations completely abrogated the ability to respond to hypoxia. The capacity of the three domains to drive hypoxic expression through a heterologous minimal promoter, when concatamerized either singly or in combination with one another, is shown in Fig. 3. Neither a dimer nor a trimer containing solely the domain defined by M4-M5 could confer oxygen-regulated expression. By contrast, dimers containing both the M4-M5 domain and either of the other domains were capable of oxygen-regulated action, although one construct containing both the M4-M5 and M10-M11 domains was not, for reasons that are unknown. A dimer containing all three domains conferred the greatest level of hypoxic inducibility. The domain defined by M4-M5 has the motif of a HIF-1 site (5′-(C/G/T)ACGT(G/C)C(G/T)-3′). For analysis of the ability of this element to bind hypoxically inducible nuclear factors, a double-stranded oligonucleotide based on the domain was incubated with nuclear extract from normoxic and hypoxic HeLa cells. Figs. 4 and 5 show a pattern of binding to this oligonucleotide that closely resembles that seen using oligonucleotides derived from HIF-1 binding sites in the Epo 3′ enhancer and the PGK 5′ flanking sequence. They also demonstrate that there is cross-competition for binding of hypoxia-inducible factor(s) between these sequences, and that this is lost when the HIF-1 binding site of either the Epo or PGK oligonucleotide is mutated. The domain defined by M10-M11 has the motif of a CRE. To test for functional involvement of cAMP in basal normoxic and hypoxically induced expression of LDH-A, the effects of the protein kinase inhibitor H8 and the protein kinase A activator forskolin were examined. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Neither agent altered the level of normoxic expression of the endogenous gene. Both M4 and M10 produced a lower level of normoxic expression than did the wild type LDHGH construct. The level of normoxic expression of all three constructs was reduced in the presence of forskolin, whereas H8 was without effect. Forskolin induced a substantial increase in the ratio of hypoxic/normoxic expression of both the endogenous gene (control 1.40 ± 0.09, forskolin 3.80 ± 0.89, n = 6, p < 0.05) and the reporter after transfection with wild type LDHGH (control 6.7 ± 1.4, forskolin 17.1 ± 1.5, n = 3, p < 0.05). As expected, the M4 construct was not capable of driving oxygen-regulated expression and did not become so in the presence of either H8 or forskolin. Construct M10 did exhibit hypoxic inducibility, but in contrast with wild type LDHGH, the magnitude of this inducibility was not altered by forskolin (ratio of hypoxic/normoxic expression:control 5.2 ± 1.5, forskolin 6.4 ± 0.6, n = 3, p not significant), providing functional evidence that the ability of cAMP to magnify the hypoxic induction of LDH is modulated by the CRE motif placed between −48 and −41 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Functional similarities between the oxygen-dependent regulation of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and the regulation of the Epo gene have led to the analysis of glycolytic gene control sequences for sites that bind HIF-1, a nuclear factor that is critical for inducible operation of the Epo 3′ enhancer(22Firth J.D.

A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), providing firm evidence linking the hypoxic induction of glycolytic enzymes and Epo to a common cellular oxygen sensing mechanism. Other potential HIF-1 sites have been defined by sequence analysis of glycolytic gene loci. For several of these, HIF-1 binding activity has been shown, and for some the functional activity of concatamerized sequences has been demonstrated on heterologous reporters(23Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no detailed analysis of the organization of an hypoxically regulated enhancer or promoter has been made in this group of genes, although there have been many analyses of their regulatory sequences in normoxic cells. In this paper we present such an analysis for the LDH-A promoter in HeLa cells, a cell line that demonstrates hypoxically inducible expression of the LDH-A gene and that provides a suitable basis for transfection studies. Whereas progressive deletion from −186 bp to −63 bp had only modest effects on normoxic promoter function, a sharp reduction in hypoxic activity resulted when sequences between −88 bp and −80 bp were deleted, thus defining a hypoxically inducible promoter of approximately 90 bp. Mutational analysis was focused on this region, and defined three domains within a 52-bp sequence lying 5′ to the “TATA” box: M1 (−84/−81), M4-M5 (−72/−65), and M10-M11 (−48/−41), which were necessary for hypoxically inducible function. The M4-M5 site corresponds to the HIF-1 binding element recently reported in independent experiments during the course of this work (23Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current analysis shows that mutation of this site completely abolishes oxygen-regulated expression, indicating that it is functional. Mutations at the other two sites, M1 and M10-M11, severely reduced but did not entirely abrogate the response to hypoxia. Thus, as with the Epo 3′ enhancer, the HIF-1 site is absolutely necessary, but not sufficient, for inducible activity(17Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Beck I. Weinmann R. Caro J. Blood. 1993; 82: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L.

One significant difference between the function of the HIF-1 site in the LDH-A promoter and that in the Epo enhancer relates to its basal activity. Whereas the latter has little activity in normoxic cells (17Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the former has strong constitutive action, and mutation at the HIF-1 site has a substantial effect on this. Either HIF-1 or the constitutive complexes that bind to the HIF-1 site in the LDH-A promoter (see Fig. 4and Fig. 5) could be responsible.Figure 5:Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showing cross-competition for the binding of hypoxia-inducible nuclear factor to the LDH oligonucleotide by unlabeled wild type PGK and Epo oligonucleotides, but not by PGK and Epo oligonucleotides in which the HIF-1 site has been mutated (PGK-M and Epo-M). Details are as described in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutation M1 had no action on constitutive promoter function but severely reduced inducible promoter function. It is interesting that there is a striking similarity between the position of this domain with respect to the HIF-1 site in LDH, and the arrangement of functional domains in the Epo 3′ enhancer(17Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Beck I. Weinmann R. Caro J.

Table 2shows an alignment of the LDH-A promoter (in reverse orientation) with the sequences of the mouse and human Epo enhancers. It can be seen that in each case mutational analysis has defined a functionally critical domain in the same position, between 7 and 11 bp 3′ to the HIF-1 site. There is sequence homology between this region in mouse LDH-A and mouse Epo, with 3 of 4 bp identical, but not between the mouse sequences and that of human Epo. The nature of the factor that binds to this site is unknown. In LDH-A, but not Epo, the sequence that is mutated in M1 is part of a Myo-D left binding site (5′-CACGTG-3′)(31Anthony C.S. Benfield P.A. Fairman R. Wasserman Z.R. Brenner S.L. Stafford W. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. De G.W. Science. 1992; 255: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the consensus extends into the mutants M0 and M2, neither of which affected function. Nevertheless, it is possible that in muscle cells Myo-D could affect the inducible operation of the LDH promoter by binding at this site.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The third domain (M10-M11) involved in hypoxically inducible function of the LDH-A promoter has the characteristic motif of a cyclic AMP response element (5′-TGACGTCA-3′)(28Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of this site reduced, rather than abolished, the magnitude of induction by hypoxia, and in keeping with previous analyses it was also found to contribute to constitutive promoter function(1Miles M.F. Hung P. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12545-12552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol.

The minimal requirements for hypoxically inducible function were determined by assay of concatamerized subsequences placed adjacent to a minimal promoter. None of the constructs that omitted the HIF-1 site showed any inducible activity. However, the HIF-1 element alone was unable to support inducible expression, even as a multimer. By contrast, constructs that contained the HIF-1 site, accompanied by either the upstream domain or the CRE, could convey inducible function, indicating that cooperative interactions necessary for hypoxic function could take place with factors binding either of these sites. A requirement for cooperation between HIF-1 and other binding sites is consistent with analysis of the Epo enhancer(17Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Beck I. Weinmann R. Caro J. Blood. 1993; 82: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Blanchard K.L. Acquaviva A.M. Galson D.L.

However, in our analysis of the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase-1 enhancer, we found that a multimerized 18-bp sequence containing the HIF-1 site was sufficient to confer hypoxic inducibility on a heterologous promoter (22Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Semenza and colleagues (23Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.-M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated this property using a dimer of 24 bp of sequence from the human phosphoglycerate kinase gene, and with a trimer of a 26-bp oligonucleotide derived from mouse phosphofructokinase L sequence. It is not clear whether the HIF-1 complexes at these sites are in some way different from those in Epo and LDH-A in being able to drive oxygen-regulated expression on their own, or whether the elements studied contain other cooperative domains. The finding that the CRE was one of the functional domains in the LDH-A promoter required for the response to hypoxia was clearly of interest in relation to the ability of cAMP to stimulate LDH-A expression in some cells(1Miles M.F. Hung P. Jungmann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12545-12552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Jungmann R.A. Kelley D.C. Miles M.F. Milkowski D.M. J. Biol.

In HeLa cells we found that neither the protein kinase A inhibitor H8 nor the c-AMP agonist forskolin produced significant changes in LDH-A mRNA in normoxia. By contrast, hypoxic induction of the endogenous gene was much magnified in the presence of forskolin. The transfected wild type LDHGH construct also had this property, but the M10 promoter mutated construct did not, demonstrating that the interaction occurred within the LDH-A promoter, and was dependent on an intact CRE. The M4 mutated promoter was completely unresponsive to hypoxia in the presence of forskolin, indicating that the HIF-1 site remained absolutely necessary for hypoxic function. Although we did not measure protein kinase A activity, the observation that forskolin did not augment the response to hypoxia in the CRE-mutated construct strongly suggests that this action was modulated by the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A/CRE-binding protein system, rather than through one of forskolin's other effects(33Laurenza A. Sutkowski E.M. Seamon K.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 442-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). We do not know which of the many CRE binding species are involved in this interaction; however, the finding that while forskolin augmented the hypoxic response, H8 did not reduce it, may indicate that both constitutive and inducible CRE species are involved. The small reduction in expression of all LDHGH plasmids in normoxic cells treated with forskolin, an effect not seen on expression of the endogenous gene, was not dependent on the CRE and is unexplained. One possibility is that sequence(s) excluded from the promoter construct may act on the endogenous gene to negatively regulate the effect that forskolin had on normoxic expression of that construct. Overall, these results indicate the potential for complex interaction between the HIF-1 site and the CRE in the LDH-A promoter, the most marked being that stimulation of the CRE leads to a magnified hypoxic response. The precise nature of this interaction may vary between cell types, since in a study of vascular smooth muscle cells Marti and colleagues (9Marti H.H. Jung H.H. Pfeilschifter J. Bauer C. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 429: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) found that forskolin induced LDH in normoxic cells, but did not produce enhancement of the response to hypoxia, and H8 reduced the induction of LDH by hypoxia. Agonists and antagonists of the cAMP system have been reported to affect a variety of cellular responses to hypoxia, including expression of the Epo gene(34Rodgers G.M. George W.J. Fisher J.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1972; 140: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since cAMP levels can be increased by hypoxia, it has been proposed that this second messenger is directly involved in the cellular signaling system that responds to this stimulus(9Marti H.H. Jung H.H. Pfeilschifter J. Bauer C. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 429: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Rodgers G.M. George W.J. Fisher J.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1972; 140: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The current experiments demonstrate a different type of involvement of the cAMP system in hypoxic gene regulation, where factors binding to two distinct cis-acting sequences, the HIF-1 site and the CRE, interact. In summary, we have performed a detailed analysis of the mouse LDH-A promoter, demonstrating that oxygen-regulated function depends upon cooperation between three domains: a HIF-1 binding site, which is absolutely necessary, but not by itself sufficient, for hypoxically inducible function; a domain adjacent to this, located in the same position relative to the HIF-1 site as a site critical for function of the Epo enhancer; and a CRE. These findings indicate both that HIF-1 is critical to the mechanism of hypoxic induction of LDH-A and demonstrate that the mechanism requires cooperation of HIF-1 with neighboring sites. The interactions of stimuli acting at the HIF-1 site and the CRE illustrate how different characteristics of an inducible response can be generated from interactions between specific binding sites.

The IC50 of SNAP for GPx was 2 μM at 1 h of incubation and was 20% of the IC50 for another thiol enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, in which a specific cysteine residue is known to be nitrosylated. Incubation of the inactivated GPx with 5 mM dithiothreitol within 1 h restored about 50% of activity of the start of the SNAP incubation. A longer exposure to NO donors, however, irreversibly inactivated the enzyme. The similarity of the inactivation with SNAP and reactivation with dithiothreitol of GPx to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggested that NO released from SNAP modified a cysteine-like essential residue on GPx. When U937 cells were incubated with 100 μM SNAP for 1 h, a significant decrease in GPx activity was observed although the change was less dramatic than that with the purified enzyme, and intracellular peroxide levels increased as judged by flow cytometric analysis using a peroxide-sensitive dye. Other major antioxidative enzymes, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, and catalase, were not affected by SNAP, which suggested that the increased accumulation of peroxides in SNAP-treated cells was due to inhibition of GPx activity by NO. Moreover, stimulation with lipopolysaccharide significantly decreased intracellular GPx activity in RAW 264.7 cells, and this effect was blocked by NO synthase inhibitor Nω-methyl-L-arginine. This indicated that GPx was also inactivated by endogenous NO. This mechanism may at least in part explain the cytotoxic effects of NO on cells and NO-induced apoptotic cell death."

We have demonstrated previously that overexpression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) in NIH 3T3 cells growing in 10% fetal calf serum leads to highly elevated levels of cyclin D1 protein without significant increase in cyclin D1 mRNA levels, suggesting that a post-transcriptional mechanism is involved.

In the present reseach, we did not find any significant effect of eIF-4E on polysomal distribution of cyclin D1 mRNA. However, the total amount of cyclin D1 mRNA associated with polysomes was significantly increased by eIF-4E overexpression. Further, we determined that the levels of both cyclin D1 protein and mRNA are increased in serum-deprived cells overexpressing eIF-4E. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated that the rate of the cyclin D1 transcription is not down-regulated in serum-deprived cells overexpressing eIF-4E. Thus, elevated levels of eIF-4E may lead to increased transcription of the cyclin D1 gene, and this effect becomes visible when serum deprivation down-regulates the rate of cyclin D1 mRNA synthesis in control cells. However, artificial overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA in serum-deprived cells in the absence of eIF-4E overexpression did not cause the elevation of cyclin D1 protein, and this overexpressed cyclin D1 mRNA accumulated in the nucleus, suggesting that one post-transcriptional role of eIF-4E is to transport cyclin D1 mRNA from the nucleus to cytoplasmic polysomes.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). One of the functions of cyclin D1 is to bind the tumor suppressor protein, pRB, which allows hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of pRB by a cyclin D1-dependent kinase that is necessary for G1/S transition(18Dowdy S.F.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 is expressed late in G1 and its induction by growth factors requires new protein synthesis(20Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

In addition, cyclin D1 is identical to the PRAD1 oncogene that is overexpressed in parathyroid and breast tumors and is located near the bcl-1 breakpoint in some lymphomas(21Motokura T. Bloom T.

We have found that the levels of cyclin D1 protein, but not pRB, are specifically and very strongly increased in continuously growing NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing eIF-4E(1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We did not observe a proportional increase in cyclin D1 mRNA levels, a finding which suggests that the effect of eIF-4E on cyclin D1 expression involves a post-transcriptional mechanism. In the present report we describe our progress on identifying the nature of regulation of cyclin D1 gene expression by translation initiation factor 4E. Parental NIH 3T3 cells and cells overexpressing wild-type eIF-4E [4E(P2)] or mutated (not active) eIF-4E (Ala) have been described previously(1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N.

Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing cyclin D1 mRNA following transfection with cyclin D1 gene under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter have also been described(1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), unless otherwise indicated. Cells were lysed by guanidine thiocyanate, and RNA was pelleted by centrifugation in a CsCl gradient. Total cellular RNA (10 μg/lane) was size fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes, and cross-linked by UV light. The membranes were hybridized overnight at 42°C with cyclin D1, cyclin A, c-myc, EF-1α, actin, or rRNA cDNA fragments 32P-labeled by the Klenow reaction using random priming (Stratagene) as described(6Rosenwald I.B.

Run-on experiments were performed on purified nuclei as described (36Schibler U. Hagenbuchle O. Wellauer P.K. Pilet A.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For each cell sample 5 × 107 nuclei were purified and used for the assay. Total transcription was measured after purification of RNA using Trizol (Life Technologies Inc.) and scintillation counting of incorporated [α-32P]UTP. Labeled RNA at a concentration of 106 counts/min/ml was hybridized to cDNA immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane for 48 h. 200 ng of each DNA probe (Fig. 4) were used for dot-blot after alkaline denaturation(37Khochbin S. Principaud E. Chabanas A. Lawrence J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After hybridization filters were rinsed and treated with 10 μg/ml RNase H for 5 min at 42°C in 2 × SSC, and membranes were exposed against a PhosphorImager screen(37Khochbin S. Principaud E. Chabanas A. Lawrence J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) except that the cells were lysed in a modified buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 420 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mM leupeptin. Each cell suspension was passed 15 times through a 20G1 gauge needle to lyse the nuclei following which the lysates were kept on ice for 15 min, centrifuged at 10 × 103 revolutions/min at 4°C for 15 min, and the supernatants were analyzed for protein content by using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Forty μg of total protein from each lysate were run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted for 18 h at 20 V in a cold room onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a liquid transfer solution containing 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 192 mM glycin, 10% methanol, and 0.01% SDS. Polyclonal rabbit anti-human eIF-4E antibody (1:2500 dilution, (35Frederickson R.M. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)), polyclonal rabbit anti-human cyclin D1 antibody (1:1500, provided by Dr. A. Arnold, Massachusetts General Hospital), mouse monoclonal anti-human cyclin B (1:5, provided by Dr. E. Harlow, Massachusetts General Hospital) and monoclonal anti-actin antibody (1:5000, N350, Amersham Corp.) were used sequentially to detect corresponding proteins with the ECL system (Amersham). Preparation of RNA from polysomal and subpolysomal fractions was performed as described in (26Kaspar R.L. Kakegawa T. Cranston H. Morris D.R. White M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 508-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were cultured to three-fourths of confluence (subconfluent) in 15-cm cell culture dishes. The cells were treated with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide for 5 min at 37°C, harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C. The pelleted cells were swollen for 2 min in 375 μl of low salt buffer (LSB, 20 mM Tris, pH 9.0, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 200 units of recombinant RNAsin (Promega). The cells were lysed by addition of 125 μl of lysis buffer (1 × LSB, 0.2 M sucrose, 1.2% Triton N-101 (Sigma)) followed by 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation in a microfuge at 10 × 103 revolutions/min for 1 min. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract, approximately 500 μl) was poured into a new tube containing 50 μl of 10 mg/ml of heparin (Sigma) and 15 ml of 5 M NaCl. The cytoplasmic extracts (200 μl) were layered over 0.5-1.5 M linear sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 45,000 revolutions/min in a Beckman SW50 rotor for 90 min at 4°C. Gradients were fractionated using ISCO Density Gradient Fractionator (ISCO INC, Lincoln, NE) equipped with absorbance monitor (254 nm) and collected into one-tenth volume of 10% SDS. The RNA from each fraction was extracted as described (26Kaspar R.L. Kakegawa T. Cranston H. Morris D.R. White M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 508-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by Northern blot. We have previously reported that the steady-state levels of cyclin D1 protein, normalized to total cellular protein, are dramatically increased in eIF-4E overexpressing cells continuously growing in the presence of 10% FCS as determined by Western blot(1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Here, the levels of cyclin D1 were analyzed in serum-deprived and serum-stimulated NIH 3T3, Ala (non-functional eIF-4E overexpressing cells), and 4E(P2) cells, that overexpress functional eIF-4E. As shown in Fig. 1, the level of eIF-4E is very low in serum-deprived (resting) NIH 3T3 cells. The increase in eIF-4E is observed after resting NIH 3T3 cells are stimulated by serum; this is followed by an increase in cyclin D1 protein. The overexpression of mutated (non-functional) eIF-4E does not increase expression of cyclin D1. In contrast, constitutively high expression of functional eIF-4E leads to an increase in cyclin D1 protein levels. Interestingly, the level of cyclin D1 protein in serum-deprived eIF-4E overexpressing cells (0 time point in [4E(P2)] group) is significantly higher than in control cells stimulated with 10% FCS for 12 h. To find out whether eIF-4E affects cytosolic distribution of cyclin D1 mRNA we performed a polysome analysis in mutated (Ala) eIF-4E and wild-type eIF-4E-overexpressing cells. Both Ala and 4E(P2) cells were initially deprived of serum growth factors for 3 days (designated by R in Fig. 2) and then stimulated (activated) by serum for 4 h. As can be seen in the Fig. 2A, cyclin D1 mRNA is detectable in the polysomes of Ala cells when they are activated (designated by A in Fig. 2) by serum, but there are higher levels of cyclin D1 mRNA in polysomes of both serum-deprived and stimulated 4E(P2) cells. To verify that such a significant increase in the amount of cyclin D1 mRNA found in polysomes of 4E(P2) cells is not due to overloading the RNA-separating gel, we extracted RNA from subpolysomal and polysomal fractions of resting and stimulated Ala and 4E(P2) cells and loaded approximately equal amounts of RNA on the gel. The amount of cyclin D1 mRNA is much higher in polysomes of wild-type eIF-4E-overexpressing cells than in polysomes of Ala cells under conditions of serum deprivation (R) and stimulation (A), see Fig. 2B. The effect of eIF-4E is specific, since its overexpression had no effect on the amounts of c-myc and actin mRNAs associated with polysomes. Thus, cyclin D1 mRNA was found predominantly associated with polysomes in resting cells and no change in the distribution of cyclin D1 mRNA was seen following mitogenic activation. Another important finding (Fig. 2A) is that polysomal distribution of translationally regulated mRNA for elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) is not affected by eIF-4E at all. As demonstrated previously(25Kaspar R.L. Rychlik W. White M.W. Rhoads R.E. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3619-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kaspar R.L. Kakegawa T. Cranston H. Morris D.R. White M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 508-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have found that EF-1α mRNA is localized in subpolysomal fractions of resting cells, but is shifted to heavy polysomes upon mitogenic stimulation. However, overexpression of functional eIF-4E has no effect on polysomal distribution of EF-1α mRNA in both resting or serum-activated cells (Fig. 2A). These findings suggest that translational regulation of EF-1α is independent of eIF-4E. To understand the reason for the observed increase in the amount of cyclin D1 mRNA in polysomes of eIF-4E-overexpressing cells, we determined the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA in serum-deprived and stimulated parental NIH 3T3 cells and in eIF-4E-overexpressing cells by Northern blot. As can be seen in the Fig. 3, the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA are very low in serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells and nonfunctional eIF-4E-overexpressing cells (Ala). The levels of cyclin D1 mRNA increase after resting cells are stimulated with 10% FCS. In contrast, the level of cyclin D1 mRNA remains high in serum-deprived eIF-4E-overexpressing cells, and it does not increase significantly after serum stimulation. The effect of eIF-4E on cyclin D1 mRNA levels is specific as there is no difference in the expression of cyclin A and c-myc in 4E(P2) and control cells. Thus, the increased amount of cyclin D1 mRNA in polysomes of serum-deprived eIF-4E-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2) can be explained at least in part by an increase in total amount of cyclin D1 mRNA in these cells. To determine whether overexpression of eIF-4E leads to increased cyclin D1 gene transcription under serum starvation conditions, we performed a nuclear run-on assay. Nuclei were prepared from Ala and 4E(P2) cells continuously growing in 10% FCS or serum-deprived by culturing in 0.5% FCS for 3 days (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, there is no apparent increase in cyclin D1 transcription in the 4E(P2) cells overexpressing wild-type eIF-4E when grown in 10% FCS, which agrees well with an absence of significant increase in cyclin D1 mRNA in 4E(P2) cells grown in 10% FCS(1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the general transcription rate (data not shown), as well as transcription of both actin and GAPDH decreases in Ala and 4E(P2) cells when they are serum-deprived. In contrast, the rate of transcription of cyclin D1 gene remains the same when 4E(P2) cells are serum deprived, while in control Ala cells it is significantly down-regulated. The rate of transcription of cyclin D1 gene is 9-fold higher in serum-deprived 4E(P2) cells than in serum-deprived Ala cells when normalized to the general transcription rate. These findings indicate that the high levels of cyclin D1 mRNA observed when 4E(P2) cells are serum-deprived (Fig. 3) are due to constitutively high rates of cyclin D1 gene transcription. To find out whether increased concentration of cyclin D1 mRNA can account for the observed increase of cyclin D1 at the protein level in serum-deprived eIF-4E-overexpressing cells (Fig. 1), we determined the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and proteins in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with a cyclin D1 expression vector in which cyclin D1 transcription is controlled by a dexamethasone-inducible MMTV promoter (CD-10 cells, (1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)). Fig. 5(left) shows that the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA are much higher in serum-deprived CD-10 cells than in parental NIH 3T3 cells and are further increased by treatment with dexamethasone. However, Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, right) revealed that there is no increase in cyclin D1 protein in serum-deprived CD-10 cells whether treated or untreated with dexamethasone. Thus, increased levels of cyclin D1 mRNA per se are not able to provide for elevated levels of cyclin D1 protein. In order to account for the observed discrepancy in cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels, we analyzed the distribution of cyclin D1 mRNA between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in cyclin D1 mRNA-overexpressing cells. We found that cyclin D1 mRNA is concentrated in the nuclei of CD-10 cells and is not transported efficiently to cytoplasm (Fig. 6). Furthermore, we have found that nucleocytoplasmic transport of cyclin D1 mRNA is more efficient in functional eIF-4E-overexpressing cells than in control cells. 2D. Rousseau, R. Kaspar, I. B. Rosenwald, L. Gehrke, and N. Sonenberg, manuscript in preparation. Since cyclin D1 protein levels are much higher in cells overexpressing eIF-4E than in control cells under conditions of serum deprivation (Fig. 1), we addressed the question whether elevation of cyclin D1 protein levels correlates with the ability of eIF-4E-overexpressing cells to proliferate when they are deprived of serum growth factors. In order to do so, cells initially plated in 10% FCS were cultured in 0.5% FCS, and cell cycle distribution was analyzed (Fig. 7). The data suggest that increased expression of cyclin D1 is not sufficient for the cells to proliferate in low serum, as wild-type eIF-4E-overexpressing cells withdraw from the cell cycle almost as efficiently as control cells during the initial 6 days of serum deprivation. However, overexpression of eIF-4E appears to allow the cells to re-enter the cell cycle at a later period (Fig. 7), while the control NIH 3T3 and Ala cells die out with G0/G1 DNA content (data not shown). One possible explanation is that the synthesis of autocrine growth factors is increased by eIF-4E, and these factors gradually accumulate in the media reaching a mitogenic concentration after several days of culturing. We have found previously that increased expression of cyclin D1 protein in continuously growing eIF-4E-overexpressing cells cannot be explained simply by elevated cyclin D1 mRNA levels, suggesting the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation(1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In this paper we provide data suggesting the complex involvement of eIF-4E in the regulation of cyclin D1 gene expression. First, the levels of eIF-4E protein become critical in determining the amount of total cyclin D1 mRNA when cells are deprived of growth factors (Fig. 3). Further, the levels of total cyclin D1 mRNA (Fig. 3) and the amount of cyclin D1 mRNA in polysomes of serum-deprived and stimulated eIF-4E-overexpressing cells are greatly increased (Fig. 2). These increases correlate with the elevated levels of cyclin D1 protein in these cells (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the transcription rate of cyclin D1 gene remains high when 4E(P2) cells are deprived of growth factors, but it is readily down-regulated in control Ala cells (Fig. 4). It has been demonstrated recently that eIF-4E increases the levels of transcription factors responsible for interleukin-2 gene expression in T-lymphocytes (40Barve S.S. Cohen D.A. De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Kaplan A.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1171-1181PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that eIF-4E facilitates translation of some transcription factor which is rate limiting for cyclin D1 mRNA synthesis under conditions of serum deprivation. However, the failure of increased cyclin D1 mRNA levels to provide for elevated cyclin D1 protein levels (when mRNA is overexpressed by exogenous cyclin D1 expression vector in serum-deprived or continuously growing cells, Fig. 5and (1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)) suggests that the post-transcriptional step is also involved in the control of cyclin D1 expression. The role of post-transcriptional events is also suggested by findings that strong overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA in transgenic mice from the same construct as in our NIH 3T3 cells provides for much less pronounced (although significant) increase in cyclin D1 protein in the mammary glands of those mice(38Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Also, dramatic increase in cyclin D1 protein levels ((1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)) and the lack of changes in both the transcription rate of cyclin D1 gene (Fig. 4) and its mRNA levels ((1Rosenwald I.B. Lazaris-Karatzas A. Sonenberg N. Schmidt E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7358-7363Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)) in 4E(P2) cells continuously growing in 10% FCS, suggest the important role for post-transcriptional control. The molecular interactions of eIF-4E protein and cyclin D1 mRNA in post-transcriptional regulation are not understood yet. However, high GC content in the 5′-untranslated region and possible secondary structures in the 5′-untranslated region probably do not play a crucial role in this regulation because most of the 5′-untranslated region is deleted in the MMTV cyclin D1 construct providing high levels of cyclin D1 mRNA (cD-10 cells, Figs 5 and 6) without corresponding increase in cyclin D1 protein levels. Our findings that exogenously overexpressed cyclin D1 mRNA accumulates in the nucleus (Fig. 6) and the demonstration that the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio for cyclin D1 mRNA is increased in eIF-4E overexpressing cells 3D. Rousseau, R. Kaspar, I. B. Rosenwald, L. Gehrke, and N. Sonenberg, manuscript in preparation. suggest that expression of cyclin D1 is regulated in part by eIF-4E-facilitated transport of cyclin D1 mRNA from the nucleus to cytoplasm. This is consistent with the localization of eIF-4E in both the nucleus and cytoplasm(33Lejbkowicz F. Goyer C. Darveau A. Neron S. Lemieux R. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9612-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, our findings that the total level of cyclin D1 mRNA is greatly increased in serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells when they overexpress wild-type eIF-4E and the lack of down-regulation of cyclin D1 gene transcription in serum-deprived 4E(P2) cells suggest that eIF-4E is involved in the regulation of cyclin D1 gene by increasing its transcription (Fig. 3, 4). Mitogen-inducible regulatory elements in the cyclin D1 promoter have been identified (27Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar) and transcription factors that bind to those elements could be possible candidates for regulation by eIF-4E. In summary, there seem to be at least two distinct steps where eIF-4E regulates the expression of cyclin D1 gene: first is the level of cyclin D1 mRNA and second is recruitment of this mRNA from the nucleus into polysomes. The overexpression of cyclin D1 has been shown to accelerate the transition of fibroblasts through the G1 period(28Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J-y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). In addition, microinjection of cyclin D1 antibodies or treatment with cyclin D1 antisense oligonucleotide prevented mitogen-activated NIH 3T3, Rat 2, or human lung fibroblasts from entering the S phase of the cell cycle(28Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J-y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 29Baldin V. Likas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Bartek J. Draetta G. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). However, introduction of cyclin D1-overexpressing Rat 6 cells into nude mice did not readily produce tumors because an increase in the number of injected cells from 2 × 106 to 1 × 107 was required for raising the occurrence of tumors from 25 to 100% of cases(30Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Zhou P. Zhang Y-J. Cacace A.M. Infante A.S. Doi S. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3447-3457PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 by itself was not able to transform rat embryo fibroblasts and required cooperation with Ha-ras for transformation(31Lovec H. Sewing A. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Moroy T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings demonstrate that overexpression of cyclin D1 in mammary glands of transgenic mice leads to tumor formation in mice with a latency of 550 days(38Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). These data taken together suggest that increased cyclin D1 levels per se may be necessary but not sufficient for cell cycle progression and tumorigenicity, and additional events have to occur to bring about cell proliferation and transformation. Our analysis of the cell cycle in serum-deprived cells demonstrated that marked increase of cyclin D1 protein in cells overexpressing eIF-4E does not prevent them from efficient cessation of their proliferation during first 6 days of serum deprivation (Fig. 7). These data are in agreement with the demonstration that cyclin D1-overexpressing Rat 6 fibroblasts withdraw from the cell cycle almost as efficiently as control cells (30Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Zhou P. Zhang Y-J. Cacace A.M. Infante A.S. Doi S. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3447-3457PubMed Google Scholar) and with the findings that increased expression of cyclin D1 in response to the treatment of human diploid fibroblast with defined mitogens is not sufficient for their entry into S phase(32Won K-A. Xiong Y. Beach D. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9910-9914Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Remarkably, wild-type eIF-4E-overexpressing cells seem to re-enter the cell cycle after 11 days of culture in 0.5% serum. At this time control Ala and parental NIH 3T3 cells died out (data not shown). One explanation is that eIF-4E-transformed cells secrete growth factor(s) into the media(39Lazaris-Karatzas A. Smith M.R. Frederickson R.M. Jaramillo M.L. Liu Y.-l. Kung H.-f. Sonenberg N. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1631-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which provide for their survival and re-entry into the cell cycle when a threshold mitogenic concentration is reached. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that eIF-4E can increase the expression of the important cell cycle regulating protein, cyclin D1, by acting through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory pathways. Finally, it is most likely that cyclin D1 is only one of many growth-promoting proteins whose expression is directly and/or indirectly regulated by translation initiation factor 4E."

Inactivation of low concentrations of normal factor Va (<5 nM) by 0.15 nM APC in the presence of phospholipid vesicles proceeded via a biphasic reaction that consisted of a rapid phase (k = 4.3 × 107M−1s−1), yielding a reaction intermediate with reduced cofactor activity that was fully inactivated during the subsequent slow phase (k = 2.3 × 106M−1s−1). Inactivation of factor VaR506Q proceeded via a monophasic reaction (k = 1.7 × 106M−1s−1). Immunoblot analysis showed that APC-catalyzed inactivation of factor Va occurred via peptide bond cleavages in the heavy chain. The rapid phase of inactivation of normal factor Va was associated with cleavage at Arg506 and full inactivation of factor Va required subsequent cleavage at Arg306. The slow monophasic inactivation of factor VaR506Q correlated with cleavage at Arg306. Cleavage at Arg506 in normal factor Va resulted in accumulation of a reaction intermediate that exhibited 40% cofactor activity in prothrombin activation mixtures that contained a high factor Xa concentration (5 nM). Compared with native factor Va, the reaction intermediate retained virtually no cofactor activity at low factor Xa concentrations (0.3 nM). This demonstrates that factor Va that is cleaved at Arg506 is impaired in its ability to interact with factor Xa. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis showed that cleavage at Arg506 in membrane-bound factor Va was characterized by a low Km for factor Va (20 nM) and kcat = 0.96 s−1. For cleavage at Arg306 in factor VaR506Q the kinetic parameters were Km= 196 nM and kcat = 0.37 s−1. This means that differences between APC-catalyzed inactivation of factors Va and VaR506Q become much less pronounced at high factor Va concentrations. When factor VaR506Q was inactivated by APC in the absence of phospholipids, cleavage at Arg679 of the heavy chain also contributed to factor Va inactivation. Comparison of rate constants for APC-catalyzed cleavage at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679 in the absence and presence of phospholipids indicated that phospholipids accelerated these cleavages to a different extent. This indicates that the binding of factor Va to phospholipids changes the accessibility of the cleavage sites and/or the sequence of peptide bond cleavage by APC.

INTRODUCTIONHuman blood coagulation factor Va is a heterodimeric glycoprotein (1Suzuki K. Dahlbäck B. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6556-6564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that consists of a heavy chain (Mr = 105,000) associated via a single Ca2+ ion with a light chain (Mr = 74,000 or 72,000, cf. Ref 2). Factor Va is formed during hemostasis from the inactive procofactor V after limited proteolysis. Factor Va is an essential nonenzymatic cofactor of the prothrombin-activating complex, which further comprises the serine protease factor Xa, calcium ions, and a procoagulant membrane surface. Depending on the reaction conditions factor Va accelerates prothrombin activation 103-105-fold (3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The loss of cofactor activity of factor Va is associated with peptide bond cleavages in the heavy chain of factor Va at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679(11Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

The physiologic importance of the down-regulation of factor Va activity by APC is underscored by the observation of recurrent thromboembolic events in individuals that are deficient in either protein C or protein S(13Griffin J.H.

A. 1993; 90: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar), several laboratories have associated the occurrence of familial thrombophilia in a large group of patients with a poor anticoagulant response to APC (APC resistance). APC resistance is at least 10 times more common than all other known genetic thrombosis risk factors together and has an allelic frequency of ~2% in the Dutch population (17Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. de Ronde H. Briët E. Vandenbroucke J.P. Bertina R.M. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1503-1506Abstract PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). The molecular defect in APC-resistant patients was recently demonstrated (18Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P.C. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Dirven R.J. de Ronde H. van der Velden P.A. Reitsma P.J.

Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this paper we present a kinetic analysis of APC-catalyzed inactivation of human factor Va that was either obtained from normal plasma or from the plasma of a patient who is homozygous for the mutation (Arg506→ Gln). Parallel experiments were performed in which changes of functional activity of factor Va during inactivation by APC were correlated with the cleavage of peptide bonds in the factor Va molecule. This study was undertaken in order to elucidate the consequences of the molecular defect in factor V for the regulation of in vivo prothrombin activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHepes, Tris, bovine serum albumin, and Russel's viper venom were purchased from Sigma. DOPC and DOPS were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. The chromogenic substrates S2238 and S2366 were supplied by Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden. D-Pro-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl was obtained from Calbiochem and p-NPGB was from Nutritional Biochemicals. Micro BCA protein assay kits were from Pierce. Fast protein liquid chromatography equipment and column materials used for protein purification were purchased from Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden.ProteinsHuman coagulation factors used in this study were isolated from fresh frozen plasma. Human prothrombin and factor X were purified according to DiScipio et al.(22DiScipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Human thrombin was prepared from prothrombin activation mixtures as described by Pletcher and Nelsestuen(23Pletcher C.H. Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5342-5345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human factor Xa was obtained from purified factor X after activation with RVV-X and isolation from the activation mixture by affinity chromatography on soybean trypsin inhibitor-Sepharose(24Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olsen S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). RVV-X was purified from Russel's viper venom according to Schiffman et al.(25Schiffman S. Theodor J. Rapaport S.J. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein C was purified and activated as described by Gruber et al.(26Gruber A. Griffin J.H. Harker L. Hanson S.R. Blood. 1989; 73: 639-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first steps of the preparation of human factor V and factor VR506Q were essentially as described by Dahlbäck (27Dahlbäck B. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with minor modifications(28Tans G. Rosing J. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Heeb M.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1991; 77: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The factor V (in 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2) thus obtained was applied to a Resource S column and eluted with 20 ml of a linear gradient (50-1000 mM NH4Cl) in 25 mM Hepes (pH 6.5), 5 mM CaCl2. Aliquots from column fractions were incubated for 15 min with 5 nM thrombin and factor Va-containing fractions were pooled. Factor Va was prepared by incubating factor V (33 μg/ml) for 20 min with 5 nM thrombin in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 175 mM NaCl, and 5 mM CaCl2. After activation 15 nMD-Pro-Phe-Arg-CH2Cl was added to inhibit thrombin. Factor Va was further subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono S column (HR 5/5) at room temperature (2Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The factor Va bound to the Mono S column was eluted with 15 ml of a linear gradient (50-1000 mM NH4Cl) in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 5 mM CaCl2. Factor Va activity eluted from the column in two well-separated protein peaks containing factor Va with light chains of Mr = 74,000 and 71,000, respectively(2Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two factor Va containing peaks were pooled and brought into 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 175 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 by a buffer exchange on a PD-10 column. Factor V and factor Va from an APC-resistant patient were purified by the same methods. The patient was a female with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Plasma from the patient was obtained by plasmapheresis. The APC-resistance ratio was 1.31 (Coatest APC-resistance kit, Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden). The patient was identified as homozygous for the substitution G1691→ A in the factor V gene (amino acid substitution Arg509→ Gln in factor V) by genetic analysis in genomic DNA samples isolated from peripheral blood(29Beauchamp N.J.

Heamatol. 1994; 88: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Protein ConcentrationsProtein concentrations were determined with the micro BCA protein assay(30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Malia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olsen B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18442) Google Scholar). Molar thrombin and factor Xa concentrations were determined by active-site titration with p-NPGB(31Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 32Smith R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2418-2423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prothrombin concentrations were determined after complete activation of prothrombin with Echis carinatus venom and quantitation of thrombin with p-NPGB. APC concentrations were determined with S2366 using kinetic parameters reported by Sala et al.(33Sala N. Owen W.G. Collen D. Blood. 1984; 63: 671-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V and factor Va were quantitated as described below.Phospholipid Vesicle PreparationsSmall unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared as described earlier(2Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis(34Böttcher C.J.F. van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-207Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar).Gel Electrophoretic and Immunoblot AnalysisPurity of protein preparations was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide slab gels (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The inactivation patterns of factor Va were analyzed after SDS-PAGE, electrophoretic transfer of proteins from the gel to Immobilon-P membranes, and visualization with a polyclonal rabbit-antibody directed against the heavy chain of factor Va and goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase as described by Blake et al.(36Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russel-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar).Factor Va AssayFactor Va cofactor activity was quantitated by determining the rate of factor Xa-catalyzed prothrombin activation in reaction mixtures that contained a limiting amount of factor Va, a saturating concentration factor Xa (5 nM), 50 μM phospholipid vesicles (DOPS/DOPC, 10/90, mol/mol), and 0.5 μM prothrombin(28Tans G. Rosing J. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Heeb M.J. Zwaal R.F.A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1991; 77: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of prothrombin activation were determined with the chromogenic substrate S2238(4Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar factor Va concentration in the assay mixture was calculated from the rate of prothrombin activation using a turnover number of 6000 mol of prothrombin activated per min/mol of factor Xa-Va complex(37Tans G. Janssen-Claessen T. Hemker H.C. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21864-21873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V was quantitated by the same method after activation with 5 nM thrombin.Kinetic Data AnalysisThe formation of a membrane-bound factor Xa-Va complex was determined by measuring rates of prothrombin activation in the presence of phospholipid vesicles at a fixed (limiting) concentration of factor Va and varying amounts of factor Xa. Factor Xa, factor Va, and phospholipid vesicles were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 175 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and 5 mg/ml BSA. Prothrombin activation was started by the addition of prothrombin (preincubated at 37°C in the same buffer) and rates of prothrombin activation were determined with the chromogenic substrate S2238(4Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent Kd for dissociation of the membrane-bound factor Xa-Va complex (K1/2Xa) was obtained from plots of the rate of prothrombin activation as a function of the factor Xa concentration that were fitted to the equation for a single-site binding isotherm (hyperbola) via non-linear least squares regression analysis.The kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) for factor Xa-catalyzed prothrombin activation were determined by measuring the rate of thrombin formation at varying prothrombin concentrations in the presence of a fixed phospholipid concentration, a limiting amount of factor Xa, and a saturating concentration of factor Va as described in the previous paragraph. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear least squares regression analysis.Curve Fitting of Pseudo-first Order Time Courses of Factor Va InactivationTime courses of factor Va or factor VaR506Q inactivation by APC were determined by following the loss of cofactor activity of factor Va as a function of time. Data reported in the literature (11Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and in this paper demonstrate that the loss of factor Va cofactor activity can proceed via 2 pathways: Factor Va→k1Factor Vaint→k2Factor Vai(Eq. 1) Factor Va→k3Factor Vai(Eq. 2) in which factor Vaint is a reaction intermediate with partial cofactor activity, factor Vai is a reaction product that has no cofactor activity, k1 is the second-order rate constant for cleavage of peptide bond 1, k2 is the second-order rate constant for cleavage of peptide bond 2 in factor Vaint, and k3 is the second-order rate constant for cleavage of peptide bond 2 in native factor Va.Under first order conditions, i.e. conditions at which the inactivation rate is directly proportional to the factor Va and APC concentrations, the loss of cofactor activity is described by (38Fersht A. Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 128-138Google Scholar): Vat=Vao⋅e-(k1+k3)⋅t+B⋅Vao⋅k1⋅e(-k2⋅t)(k1+k3-k2)⋅(1-e{-(k1+k3-k2)⋅t})(Eq. 3) in which Vat is the cofactor activity determined at time t, Vao is the cofactor activity determined before APC is added, B is the cofactor activity of factor Vaint (expressed as fraction of the cofactor activity of native factor Va), and k1, k2, and k3 are the rate constants defined above. The rate constants and the cofactor activity of factor Vaint were obtained by fitting the data to using non-linear least squares regression analysis.In the case of normal factor Va inactivation, k3 appeared to be associated with cleavage of the peptide bond at Arg306. Therefore, time courses of normal factor Va inactivation were fitted with a fixed k3, obtained from kinetic analysis of factor VaR506Q inactivation.In some experiments (factor Va inactivation in free solution) there was a slow loss of factor Va cofactor activity in the absence of APC. In these cases the spontaneous loss of cofactor activity (0.4%/min) was added to k3.RESULTSPeptide Bonds in Factor Va Susceptible to Proteolysis by APCRecently it was reported (11Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that APC can cleave 3 peptide bonds in the heavy chain of human factor Va that are located at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679. Fig. 1represents a schematic diagram of the heavy chain of factor Va in which we have depicted the sites that are susceptible to APC and the molecular weights of possible cleavage products. In the present paper we will refer to the rate constants associated with the indicated peptide bond cleavages as k306, k506, and k679, respectively.Structural and Functional Properties of Factor Va Purified from Normal and from APC-resistant PlasmaFactor V and thrombin-activated factor Va were purified from normal and homozygous APC-resistant plasma as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The thrombin-activated factor Va and factor VaR506Q preparations had identical gel electrophoretic properties with the characteristic heavy chain with Mr = 105,000 and a light chain doublet at Mr = 74,000 and 71,000 (data not shown).Factor Va and factor VaR506Q had similar cofactor activities in prothrombin activation. Kinetic analysis showed that prothrombin was activated in the presence of 25 μM phospholipid vesicles (DOPS/DOPC, 10/90, mol/mol) with the following kinetic parameters: Kmfor prothrombin = 0.13 μM, kcat = 8570 min−1 and K1/2Xa of Xa-Va complex formation = 0.083 nM for prothrombinase complexes with normal factor Va and Km for prothrombin = 0.12 μM, kcat = 8450 min−1 and K1/2Xa of Xa-Va complex formation = 0.105 nM for prothrombinase complexes with factor VaR506Q (data not shown).This means that the factor Va assay that we used, which measures the cofactor activity of factor Va in prothrombin activation, allows quantitative comparison of factor Va and factor VaR506Q.Kinetic Analysis of APC-catalyzed Inactivation of Membrane-bound Factor Va and Factor VaR506QTime courses of APC-catalyzed inactivation of factor Va and factor VaR506Q in the presence of phospholipid vesicles are shown in Fig. 2. At a low APC concentration (0.15 nM) normal factor Va was inactivated via a biphasic reaction during which 50% of the factor Va activity was lost within 3 min. Factor VaR506Q is inactivated at a considerably lower rate requiring more than 45 min for 50% loss of cofactor activity (Fig. 2A). When a similar experiment was performed at a high APC concentration (1.5 nM) inactivation of factor VaR506Q appeared to occur via a monophasic reaction (the data points could be fitted with a single exponential), whereas the inactivation of normal factor Va still proceeded via a biphasic reaction (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Inactivation of factor Va and factor VaR506Q by APC in the presence of phospholipids. 0.3 nM purified human factor Va (▴) or factor VaR506Q (▪) was incubated with (A) 0.15 nM APC or (B) 1.5 nM APC and 25 μM phospholipid vesicles (DOPS/DOPC, 10/90, mol/mol) in 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 175 mM NaCl, 3 mM CaCl2, and 5 mg/ml BSA at 37°C. At the indicated time points factor Va activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The solid lines represent exponential curves obtained after fitting the data using given under “Experimental Procedures.” The rate constants and activity of the reaction intermediate were determined by nonlinear least-squares regression of the data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The time courses of factor Va and VaR506Q inactivation (% factor Va activity versus time) were not affected by varying the concentrations of factor Va or VaR506Q between 0 and 5 nM. Since the rates of factor Va inactivation were also directly proportional to the amount of APC present (0.05-5 nM) we concluded that factor Va and VaR506Q inactivation were first-order in both factor Va(VaR506Q) and APC. This allows calculation of apparent second-order rate constants for factor Va inactivation from time courses such as shown in Fig. 2.On the basis of literature data (11Kalafatis M.

This reaction intermediate is fully inactivated by subsequent slow cleavage at Arg306. Inactivation of factor VaR506Q likely proceeds via a monophasic reaction that is the result of slow cleavage at Arg306.The time courses of inactivation could indeed be fitted (Fig. 2, solid lines) using an equation that describes the time-dependent loss of cofactor activity when factor Va is inactivated via the random ordered two-step reaction model described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fits of the particular experiment presented in Fig. 2yielded the following second-order rate constants: k506 = 4.7 × 107M−1 s−1, k306 = 1.7 × 106M−1 s−1, and 40% cofactor activity for the reaction intermediate (factor Va cleaved at Arg506) in the case of normal factor Va inactivation and k306 = 1.4 × 106M−1 s−1 and a reaction product that has virtually lost its cofactor activity in the case of factor VaR506Q inactivation.Immunoblot Analysis of APC-catalyzed Inactivation of Membrane-bound Factor Va and Factor VaR506QGeneration of heavy chain fragments during APC-catalyzed factor Va and factor VaR506Q inactivation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transfer to Immobilon-P membranes, and visualization of the reaction products with a polyclonal antibody directed against the heavy chain domain of human factor Va (Fig. 3). In the description of the gel patterns presented below, the formation of reaction products was associated with peptide bond cleavages at Arg306, Arg506, or Arg679 on the basis of molecular weights of heavy chain fragments indicated in Fig. 1.Figure 3:Immunoblot analysis of factor Va and factor VaR506Q inactivation by APC in the presence of phospholipids.

In the case of normal factor Va (A) the APC concentration was increased to 110 nM after 5 min. At the indicated time intervals samples from the inactivation mixture were subjected to SDS-PAGE.

INTRODUCTIONExcessive production or inadequate disposal of reactive derivatives of oxygen, such as superoxide (O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), is called oxidative stress (Sies, 1991). Cells respond to sublethal levels of oxidative stress by coordinately activating batteries of antioxidant genes (Demple, 1991; Hidalgo and Demple, 1995). The molecular signals that activate these multifunctional defense systems have been the objects of considerable recent interest (Meyer et al., 1993; Gounalaki and Thireos, 1994; Nunoshiba et al., 1993; González-Flecha and Demple, 1994).Genetic analysis in Escherichia coli has helped define responses that are triggered by distinct signals of oxidative stress. One group of genes is activated by H2O2-imposed oxidative stress and is controlled by the oxyR gene (Demple, 1991; Storz et al., 1991). In contrast, the soxRS system governs an inducible response to superoxide-generating agents (Nunoshiba et al., 1992; Wu and Weiss, 1992) or nitric oxide (Nunoshiba et al., 1993, 1995). The soxRS response occurs in two stages: an intracellular signal of oxidative stress converts existing SoxR protein into a potent transcriptional activator of the soxS gene; the resulting increase in SoxS levels then triggers expression of the various regulon genes (Amábile-Cuevas and Demple, 1991).SoxR, isolated from bacteria that overproduce the protein, contains an FeS cluster(s) essential for in vitro transcriptional activation of the soxS promoter (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). The metal is not required for the binding of SoxR to the soxS promoter nor for the subsequent binding of RNA polymerase (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). These observations suggest that the critical effect of activated SoxR on transcription occurs at a later stage, perhaps by specific conformational effects of Fe-SoxR 1The abbreviations used are: Fe-SoxRiron-containing SoxRCuPPA5-phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline-copper(I)DTTdithiothreitolFeSiron-sulfurPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisbpbase pair(s). on DNA, as proposed for the homologous MerR protein (Ansari et al., 1992). It seems likely that the FeS center(s) of SoxR is involved in the signal transduction mechanism that links O or NO stress to gene activation in the soxRS system.Although protein FeS centers have been most commonly associated with electron transfer and some enzymatic dehydratase reactions (Johnson, 1994), iron has recently been proposed as an important regulatory component of other genetic responses (Beinert, 1990). In the cytoplasmic form of mammalian aconitase, for example, the iron center regulates the activity of the protein as an RNA-binding factor: the apoprotein binds mRNAs encoding ferritin (blocking its translation) and the transferrin receptor (stabilizing the message), while the [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S] forms do not (Klausner et al., 1993). This protein is thus linked to the iron status of the cell and coordinates key constituents of iron assimilation, utilization, and storage. The Fnr protein of E. coli coordinates transcription of a large number of genes that allow cells to take advantage of electron acceptors other than oxygen (Green and Guest, 1993). Although iron seems to be required for in vitro DNA binding by Fnr, the structure of its metal center has not been elucidated.The structure of the iron center in SoxR is of importance both for the transcriptional activity described above and for the role of this protein as a sensor of oxidative stress. We describe here experiments that define [2Fe-2S] clusters in SoxR, and we show that only the metalloprotein activates in vitro transcription and is apparently associated with formation of the open complex at the soxS promoter.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of SoxRPurification of SoxR protein from E. coli containing the SoxR expression plasmid pKOXR was performed as described previously (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). Fractions eluted from heparin-agarose columns (Life Technologies, Inc.) (purity of ∼65-80%) were used for these studies; the more purified material obtained by DNA-affinity chromatography (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994) could not be obtained in a high enough concentration for the physical studies conducted.In Vitro TranscriptionAll the solutions and reagents used during the assay were prepared RNase-free (Sambrook et al., 1989). Protein-DNA binding reactions were performed in 19 μl containing 75 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, 15 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, ∼200-400 ng of pBD100 DNA, and the indicated amounts of SoxR. Plasmid pBD100 is a pBR322 derivative containing an E. coli genomic insert of ∼4 kilobases that includes the whole soxRS locus (Amábile-Cuevas and Demple, 1991). After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, 1 μl of 1 mg/ml E. coli σ70-containing RNA polymerase (∼300 units/ml; kindly provided by Drs. Linda D'Ari and Michael Chamberlin, University of California, Berkeley) was added to each sample to achieve a final concentration of 0.1 μM, and the reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37°C. One μl of a mixture of the four NTPs (25 mM each) was then added, and the polymerase extension reaction proceeded for another 5 min at 37°C. The in vitro transcription reaction was then stopped by mixing into each sample 330 μl of a mixture of a solution of 73% ethanol, 7 μg/ml tRNA, 0.11 M sodium acetate. After a 45-min precipitation at −20°C, the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g at room temperature. The precipitates were resuspended in 10 μl of H2O treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate.The transcription products were quantified by primer extension analysis. Primer 1 (5′-CTGAATAATTTTCTGATGGG-3′; Nunoshiba et al.(1992)) hybridized 64 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site of the soxS gene. As an internal control for transcription activity, β-lactamase (bla) gene transcript, also directed by pBD100 (Amábile-Cuevas and Demple, 1991), was quantified in parallel by primer extension analysis using primer pBR-1 (5′-GGGTGAGCAAAACAGGAA-3′), which hybridizes to a site 105 bp downstream from the 5′-end of this message (Russell and Bennett, 1981). The primers were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Fifty fmol of the indicated 32P-labeled primer was annealed to 5-μl samples from the in vitro transcription reactions, and primer extension reactions were performed with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples corresponding to 40% of each reaction were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide, 6 M urea gel (Sambrook et al., 1989). 32P-Labeled φX174 DNA digested with HinfI (Promega) was used for size calibration.5-Phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline-Copper(I) (CuPPA) FootprintingA 180-bp DNA fragment containing the soxS promoter was isolated and labeled in one strand as described previously (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). For binding, labeled DNA (∼0.5-1 nM final concentration; ∼10,000 cpm) and SoxR protein (∼25 nM in the reaction mixture) were incubated in an 18-μl reaction containing 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM mgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mM 3-mercaptopropionic acid. After 10 min at room temperature, 1 μl of E. coli RNA polymerase (130 units/ml; Promega) was added (final concentration 50 nM), and the incubation continued for 15 min at 37°C. The cleavage reagent was freshly prepared by mixing 10 μl of 32 mM 5-phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma) in ethanol with 10 μl of 7.2 mM cupric sulfate (Sigma) and immediately diluting it with 80 μl of H2O. One μl of the cleavage reagent was added to each 19-μl binding reaction, and strand scission was initiated by addition of 1.2 μl of 100 mM 3-mercaptopropionic acid (Sigma). After 2 min at 37°C, the reactions were quenched by adding 1.3 μl of 50 mM 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma) (dissolved in ethanol) and further incubation for 2 min at room temperature. The DNA was then precipitated by the addition of a 100-μl aliquot of the following mixture: 1 ml of ethanol, 50 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 10 μl of 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA. After centrifugation, the precipitated DNA was redissolved in 5 μl of formamide loading buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide, 6 M urea gel (Sambrook et al., 1989). The same 180-bp probe was cleaved in a Maxam-Gilbert guanine-specific reaction (Sambrook et al., 1989) and used as a DNA sequence ladder.Sedimentation AnalysisSoxR protein was analyzed by zonal centrifugation as described by Freifelder(1973) in 5-20% sucrose gradients in 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6. The relatively high salt concentration was necessary to maintain SoxR solubility. Bovine carbonic anhydrase (29.0 kDa; Sigma) and soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa; Sigma) were used as markers. After sedimentation for 24 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor, 0.3-ml fractions were collected from the bottoms of the tubes using a peristaltic pump. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and quantitative densitometry (BioImage system, Millipore).Protein, Iron, and Labile Sulfide DeterminationsProtein concentrations were determined by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels using as a standard SoxR previously quantified by amino acid analysis (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994).Iron concentration was determined by two different methods: by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994) and colorimetrically by using the iron chelator ferrozine (Stookey, 1970). For the colorimetric determinations, 460-μl samples of SoxR were mixed with 100 μl of ultrapure concentrated HCl (Baker analyzed), and the mixture was incubated at 80°C for 20 min with occasional vigorous shaking. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove denatured protein, 510 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 20 μl of 10 mM ferrozine and 20 μl of 75 mM ascorbic acid. The mixture was neutralized by the addition of 120 μl of saturated ammonium acetate to allow ferrozine chelation. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 562 nm was determined and iron concentration was calculated using ∈ferrozine-Fe = 27,900 M- cm- (Stookey, 1970).Labile inorganic sulfide was determined by using a modification of the basic methylene blue procedure (Fogo and Popowsky, 1949) as described by Beinert(1983).Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) SpectroscopySamples of purified Fe-SoxR (500 μl at ∼10 μM) inside an anaerobic chamber (Vacuum Atmospheres Co. model HE-493) at an O2 concentration of ∼0.5-1 ppm were incubated with 10 μl of 3 mg/ml dithionite (freshly dissolved; this amount contained ∼25 reducing equivalents (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994)). Oxidized and reduced SoxR were sealed in cuvettes and removed from the chamber, and the spectra were recorded with a Hewlett-Packard model 8452A spectrophotometer to determine the extent of reduction. The cuvettes were then returned to the anaerobic chamber, opened, and 300 μl of each sample was placed inside a 4-mm EPR sample tube. Tubes were sealed with rubber septa, removed from the anaerobic chamber, and immediately frozen in a bath of liquid nitrogen until analysis. EPR spectra at X-band were recorded at 10-100 K on a Bruker model ESP 300 spectrometer maintained at constant temperature either with an Oxford Instruments ESR 910 continuous flow cryostat or with a Bruker ER4111VT variable temperature controller. Spin quantitations were carried out under nonsaturating conditions and were calculated by comparison of the integrated intensity of samples with that of a 1 mM Cu2+ prepared as described by Malmström et al.(1970). Intensities of samples and the standard were corrected for differences in g value as described previously (Aasa and Vänng, 1975).DTT Treatment of Purified Fe-SoxR FractionsSoxR protein was incubated aerobically with increasing concentrations of DTT (10 to 100 mM) for 10 min at room temperature. The spectra of the oxidized and DTT-treated preparations were recorded in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3A UV/VIS spectrophotometer. In vitro transcription reactions for the DTT-treated samples were performed under the conditions described above, except that the same concentration of DTT used for the SoxR treatment was maintained in the transcription reaction. Reversibility of the DTT treatment was analyzed by omitting DTT from the in vitro transcription reaction. Stability of the FeS center in DTT-treated SoxR was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography of 100-μl samples using NICK columns (Pharmacia), following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration in the eluted fractions (∼150 μl) was measured as described above. Colorimetric determination of iron was performed by adding 0.1 M DTT to the eluted fractions (except for those which already contained it), and a further addition of 10 μl of 10 mM ferrozine. The absorption at 562 nm was determined after 20 min of incubation, and iron concentrations were estimated as described above.RESULTSFe-SoxR-dependent Transcription on a Supercoiled TemplateWe previously showed that purified Fe-SoxR, but not apo-SoxR, was able to initiate abortive transcription from a linear template containing the soxS promoter (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). However, we had not examined whether this difference is retained in the more relevant situation of a supercoiled template and transcription of the intact soxS gene in the presence of competing promoters. A supercoiled plasmid containing the whole soxRS locus (pBD100; Amábile-Cuevas and Demple, 1991) was used as the template for these in vitro reactions and allowed for the simultaneous detection of bla (β-lactamase gene) transcription, which was expected to be SoxR-independent. In the presence of E. coli σ70-containing RNA polymerase and Fe-SoxR, a 64-nucleotide primer extension product was detected that corresponded to the size expected for soxS mRNA, while a 105-nucleotide product corresponded to the size expected for the bla transcript. In these experiments (Fig. 1), the amount of soxS mRNA increased strongly with the amount of Fe-SoxR added to the in vitro transcription reaction and was near-maximal with 10 ng of this protein. In contrast, even with 100 ng of apo-SoxR, only a small increase in the production of soxS transcript was observed compared to control reactions with RNA polymerase alone. Thus, the transcriptional activity of SoxR in this assay also depends strongly on its iron content.5-Phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline-Copper(I) FootprintingOur previous studies (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994) showed that Fe-SoxR has only a small effect on the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, which suggested that Fe-SoxR acts at a subsequent step, such as conformational changes leading to the initiation of transcription. We addressed this issue by conducting footprinting studies with 5-phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline-copper(I) (CuPPA), a reagent that is also sensitive to protein-induced changes in DNA structure (Sigman et al., 1991). Footprints of both Fe-SoxR and apo-SoxR across the −10 to −35 region of both strands of the soxS promoter were apparent in the absence and in the presence of RNA polymerase (Fig. 2A). These footprints were not as sharply defined as those observed with DNase I (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994), but were detected consistently.Figure 2:5-Phenyl-1,10-phenanthroline-copper(I) (CuPPA) footprinting of the soxS promoter by SoxR. A, a 180-bp fragment was labeled in the transcribed strand (right panel) or the nontranscribed strand (left panel) and incubated with various combinations of RNA polymerase (50 nM), Fe- or apo-SoxR (25 nM), as indicated. The binding reactions were incubated with the cleavage reagent CuPPA as explained in the text. The sites of hypersensitivity are indicated by arrows. The −10 and −35 sites of the soxS promoter are indicated, as well as the transcriptional start site (+1). Each strand was also chemically digested with dimethyl sulfate and piperidine in a “G-specific” reaction (Sambrook et al., 1989) to generate sequence markers (G in the figure). For the left panel, the marker positions were established from a longer autoradiographic exposure. B, comparison of the DNase I (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994) and CuPPA footprints and hypersensitive sites. The −10 and −35 sites of the soxS promoter are indicated with brackets. The 9-bp inverted repeat is shown in bold, the center of the dyad symmetry being labeled with a dot. The outlined areas show the protection exerted by SoxR against cleavage by DNase I (closed box, upper) or CuPPA (horizontal lines, lower). The hypersensitive sites are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CuPPA-hypersensitive sites were observed in the vicinity of the soxS transcription start site only with Fe-SoxR and RNA polymerase together, in both the nontranscribed (Fig. 2A, left) and the transcribed strand (Fig. 2A, right). CuPPA-hypersensitive sites at −3 to −7 in the transcribed strand and at +4 and +5 of the nontranscribed strand have been associated with open complex formation at other promoters (Sigman et al., 1991; Thederahn et al., 1990). CuPPA-hypersensitive sites were also reported at +4 to +6 in the transcribed strand of the lacUV5 open complex (Thederahn et al., 1990), but were not apparent in our experiments. These sites may have been difficult to detect because they are much weaker than those seen at −3 to −7 in the same strand (Sigman et al., 1991; Thederahn et al., 1990). Taken together, these data indicate that Fe-SoxR specifically leads to open complex formation by RNA polymerase.In addition, three sites in the nontranscribed strand, in the center of the SoxR binding site, became unprotected against CuPPA only with Fe-SoxR and RNA polymerase together (Fig. 2A, left side). This deprotection was observed consistently when the background cleavage by CuPPA was high, but was difficult to detect under milder cleavage conditions. We therefore determined whether the footprinting reagents had specific effects on the in vitro transcription of soxS. CuPPA at 0.16 mM inhibited soxS-specific transcription (relative to bla transcription) by 30%, but 6.7 mM mercaptopropionic acid eliminated detectable transcription of both bla and soxS. Because of the general inhibition of transcription by mercaptopropionic acid, we checked for specific effects on Fe-SoxR. Fe-SoxR retained 90% of the visible absorption characteristic of the intact metalloprotein (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). Therefore, the integrity of Fe-SoxR was not strongly compromised by the footprinting reagents, although partial effects were noted.The CuPPA footprinting results are compared in Fig. 2B with those found previously for DNase I (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). The cleavage sites in the nontranscribed strand that became unprotected with Fe-SoxR and RNA polymerase are in the center of dyad symmetry of the SoxR binding site (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, CuPPA-hypersensitive sites were described for Hg-MerR, also positioned in the center of the protein binding site (Frantz and O'Halloran, 1990).Iron and S2−Content of Dimeric SoxRBefore determining the iron stoichiometry of SoxR, we first established the oligomeric state of the protein. Two features seemed to indicate that SoxR could exist in solution as a dimer (or higher oligomer). First, the SoxR homologue, MerR, is dimeric both in the presence and in the absence of the Hg2+ (Helmann et al., 1990). Second, SoxR binds a DNA site in the soxS promoter that has perfect dyad symmetry (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). This hypothesis was tested by sedimentation analysis of both Fe- and apo-SoxR. In these experiments, a clear peak of SoxR protein was observed sedimenting just slower than carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) and significantly faster than soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa) (Fig. 3). These data indicate that both Fe-SoxR and apo-SoxR are predominantly homodimers at 0.5 M NaCl, even in dilute solution (<1 μM).Figure 3:Pattern for SoxR sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Fe-SoxR (60 μl of 0.167 mg/ml) (A) or apo-SoxR (80 μl of 0.125 mg/ml) (B) were loaded on 5-20% sucrose gradients together with 10 μg of carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) and 10 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa). After centrifugation, fractions were collected and analyzed for protein by SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and quantitative densitometry. The figure shows the percentage of each protein contained in each fraction for the gradients with Fe-SoxR (A) or apo-SoxR (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The amount of iron in freshly purified SoxR was quantified by two independent methods: colorimetrically with the iron chelator ferrozine and by plasma emission spectrometry. As summarized in Table 1, the ratio of Fe to SoxR monomer averaged 2.7 ± 0.3.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For the determination of inorganic sulfide, the low solubility of SoxR necessitated using the assay described by Beinert(1983). These measurements revealed ratios of S2−:SoxR monomer near 2 in 11 independent, freshly prepared samples (Table 1 and data not shown). Together with the iron determinations described above, these data indicate that (SoxR)2 might contain either a single [4Fe-4S] cluster or a pair of [2Fe-2S] centers.EPR Spectroscopy of Fe-SoxREPR spectroscopy was used to obtain more information about the structure and properties of the SoxR FeS center(s). Both oxidized Fe-SoxR and the protein reduced with an excess of dithionite (Fig. 4A) were analyzed by EPR. No signal was observed for oxidized SoxR at temperatures between 10 and 100 K (Fig. 4B). However, the dithionite-treated protein showed a nearly axial signature with apparent g values of 2.01 and 1.93 (Fig. 4B). This signal was observed at temperatures as high as 100 K. The integrated intensity indicated the presence of 1 spin/2.2 Fe (1.3 spin/SoxR monomer). Of the common types of FeS clusters, the symmetry, temperature dependence, and integrated intensity of the SoxR EPR signal are consistent only with a [2Fe-2S] cluster (Orme-Johnson and Orme-Johnson, 1982). A [3Fe-4S] cluster would be expected to exhibit an isotropic signal in its oxidized state, which would integrate to <1 spin/3 Fe. A [4Fe-4S] cluster should exhibit a rhombic signal, which should be observed only at low temperature (<20 K) and which should integrate to <1 spin/4 Fe. In contrast, the data are entirely consistent with the presence in (SoxR)2 of two [2Fe-2S] clusters. The fact that the spin/SoxR monomer ratio exceeds 1 suggests that the SoxR concentration is routinely underestimated (by ∼30%) by our method.Figure 4:Spectroscopic analysis of Fe-SoxR. A, UV/visible absorption. SoxR protein, ∼10 μM in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, 0.5 M NaCl, was reduced with dithionite under anaerobic conditions (see text for details). The absorption spectrum over the range 300-600 nm was recorded immediately after transfer of the sample to a sealed cuvette (reduced SoxR). An untreated Fe-SoxR sample is also shown (oxidized SoxR). The strong absorption below 380 nm is due to the relatively large amount of dithionite used for reduction in this experiment (25 eq relative to SoxR, compared to 5 eq in previous work (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994)). B, EPR spectroscopy. Oxidized or dithionite-reduced SoxR (300-μl samples) were processed for EPR spectroscopy as described under “Materials and Methods.” Upper trace, EPR spectrum of ∼10 μM reduced Fe-SoxR at 40 K; the g values are indicated. Lower trace, oxidized (not dithionite-treated) Fe-SoxR. The upper spectrum was recorded at 40 K with the following spectrometer conditions: microwave frequency, 9.42 GHz; microwave power, 200 microwatts; modulation amplitude, 1 millitesla (mT); receiver gain, 105. The lower spectrum was recorded at 10 K, with a modulation amplitude of 0.4 millitesla, and all other conditions identical with those described for the upper spectrum. No signal was observed for oxidized SoxR at temperatures between 10 and 100 K, and magnetic fields between 290 and 370 millitesla.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Destabilization of the SoxR [2Fe-2S] Center by ThiolsSome transcriptional regulators are thought to be controlled by reversible redox reactions of the protein (Storz et al., 1990; Abate et al., 1990). We therefore tested whether reduction of the [2Fe-2S] centers of SoxR might modulate its transcriptional activity. Preliminary experiments showed that the dithionite-treated protein could not be readily used for this purpose, owing to its easy reoxidation (Hidalgo and Demple, 1994). We therefore examined the effects of treating Fe-SoxR with DTT. Concentrations of this thiol ≤50 mM did not alter the visible spectrum of SoxR. However, incubation of Fe-SoxR with DTT at ≥75 mM decreased the absorption peaks at 414,462 and 548 nm and generated a new maximum at 424 nm (Fig. 5A). The activity of these samples was analyzed in in vitro transcription reactions also containing DTT. In the presence of 100 mM DTT, the transcriptional activity of Fe-SoxR was abolished (Fig. 5B, lane 3 versus lane 2). However, if the DTT concentration was diminished either by gel filtration chromatography in elution buffer lacking the thiol (data not shown) or by omitting the thiol from the transcription reaction (Fig. 5B), Fe-SoxR transcriptional activity was completely recovered. The high DTT concentrations did not affect the transcription of the bla gene (Fig. 5B).Figure 5:Effect of DTT treatment on the visible spectrum, transcriptional activity, and physical properties of Fe-SoxR. A, visible spectra of untreated Fe-SoxR (solid line) and Fe-SoxR incubated with 100 mM DTT (dashed line). B, effect of DTT on in vitro transcription. Reactions were as described for Fig. 1B, except that SoxR treated first with 100 mM DTT was then diluted into the transcription reactions either containing 100 mM DTT or omitting the DTT (to yield a final concentration of 5 mM DTT).

https://openalex.org/W2128060197,"Interferon γ (IFN-γ) signals through a multimeric receptor complex consisting of two different chains: the IFN-γ receptor binding subunit (IFN-γR, IFN-γR1), and a transmembrane accessory factor (AF-1, IFN-γR2) necessary for signal transduction. Using cell lines expressing different cloned components of the IFN-γ receptor complex, we examined the function of the receptor components in signal transduction upon IFN-γ treatment. A specific IFN-γR2:IFN-γ cross-linked complex was observed in cells expressing both IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2 indicating that IFN-γR2 (AF-1) interacts with IFN-γ and is closely associated with IFN-γR1.

INTRODUCTIONIt has been shown that the active receptors for several cytokines consist of at least two subunits (Jung et al., 1987; Kishimoto et al., 1992; Miyajima et al., 1992; Akira et al., 1993; Taniguchi and Minami, 1993). The multicomponent structure of the interferon γ receptor complex was proposed based upon studies with human-rodent and mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids. Interferon γ (IFN-γ) 1The abbreviations used are: IFN-γinterferon γHu-IFN, human interferon; BS3bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; IL, interleukin. binds to the IFN-γ receptor binding subunit (IFN-γR1), a species-specific cell-surface receptor encoded on human chromosome 6 (Rashidbaigi et al., 1986) and mouse chromosome 10 (Mariano et al., 1987; Kozak et al., 1990). However, although IFN-γR1 is the binding subunit of the IFN-γ receptor complex, it alone is not sufficient for signal transduction (Jung et al., 1987, 1988; Hibino et al., 1991). In addition to the binding subunit, an additional factor encoded on human chromosome 21 (Jung et al., 1987, 1988) and mouse chromosome 16 (Hibino et al., 1991) was found to be required for responsiveness of the cells to IFN-γ as measured by MHC class I antigen induction. This additional factor was recently cloned from human and mouse cells and has been designated as the accessory factor (AF-1) or second chain of the IFN-γ receptor complex, IFN-γR2 (Soh et al., 1994; Hemmi et al., 1994).There is no intrinsic kinase motif within the intracellular domains of either IFN-γR1 or IFN-γR2. Two distinct regions of the intracellular domain of IFN-γR1 have been found to be important for signal transduction (Cook et al., 1992; Farrar et al., 1991, 1992). The first, proximal to the transmembrane region, is necessary for both receptor-ligand internalization and biological responses (Farrar et al., 1991). The second region, near the carboxyl terminus, includes Tyr-457 (Tyr-440, starting at the putative first amino acid of the mature chain), Asp-458, and His-461, which are required for biological responsiveness (Cook et al., 1992; Farrar et al., 1992). After phosphorylation of Tyr-457, Stat1α (Schindler et al., 1992) binds to this region (Stat1α recruitment site) due to specific interaction between the SH2 domain of Stat1α and phosphorylated Tyr-457 of IFN-γR1 (Greenlund et al., 1994), with resultant phosphorylation of Tyr-701 of Stat1α (Shuai et al., 1993a). This phosphorylation is probably caused by the IFN-γ-activated tyrosine kinases Jak1 and/or Jak2, members of the Janus kinase (Jak) family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (for review, see Ziemiecki et al., 1994; Ihle et al., 1994, 1995; Ihle and Kerr, 1995). Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases participate in signal transduction initiated by IFN-γ as shown in mutant cell lines defective in the IFN-γ signal transduction pathway suggesting that the IFN-γ receptor components and the Jak kinases interact (Müller et al., 1993; Silvennoinen et al., 1993; Watling et al., 1993). In this report, we elucidate the structure of the IFN-γ receptor complex and the role of the receptor components in the activation of the IFN-γ signal transduction pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Restriction Endonucleases, and Other EnzymesAll restriction endonucleases were from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals or New England Biolabs; Sequenase 2.0 and T4 DNA ligase were from United States Biochemical Corp. The [α-32P]dATP and [γ-32P]ATP were from DuPont NEN. The cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was from Pierce Chemical Co. All other chemical reagents were analytical grade and purchased from United States Biochemical Corp.Plasmid Construction and Site-specific MutagenesisThe full-length Hu-IFN-γR2 cDNA from plasmid pSK1 (Soh et al., 1994) was released by digestion with SalI restriction endonuclease and cloned into the SalI site of the vector M13mp18. The resultant clone was designated M13-IFN-γR2. The oligonucleotides 5′-GCCTTTTTTAGTTATTATGTC-3′, 5′-GATAGAAGAGTTTTTAAAAGAC-3′, and 5′-CTCCACCATAGCATCCCAT-3′ were used to change amino acid codon TGT to AGT (Cys-174 to Ser-174), to mutate Tyr-294 to Phe-294 (codon TAT to TTT), and to introduce a stop codon TAG after Pro-285 of IFN-γR2, respectively. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed as described previously (Kunkel et al., 1987) with single-stranded M13-IFN-γR2 DNA as a template. After site-specific mutation, the cDNA fragments for intact and mutated IFN-γR2 were released from the double-stranded M13-IFN-γR2 DNA by digestion with SmaI and SalI restriction endonucleases and ligated into blunt-ended BamHI and intact XhoI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). These expression vectors were designated pγR2, pγR2-C174S, pγR2-Y294F, and pγR2t-285: plasmid pγR2, the vector expressing the parental Hu-IFN-γR2 chain; plasmid pγR2-C174S, the Hu-IFN-γR2 chain with serine substituted for cysteine 174; plasmid pγR2-Y294F, the Hu-IFN-γR2 chain with phenylalanine substituted for tyrosine 294; and plasmid pγR2t-285, the Hu-IFN-γR2 chain truncated at amino acid position 285 (Soh et al., 1994).To create an expression vector for the glutathione S-transferase/Hu-IFN-γR2 intracellular domain fusion protein (GST/IFN-γR2IC), the polymerase chain reaction was performed with two primers 5′-TCCTGGATCCAAATATAGAGGCCTGATT-3′ and 5′-GGGAATACTGGTCTCTGG-3′ and plasmid pγR2 as a template according to standard protocol (Sambrook et al., 1989). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI restriction endonuclease and ligated into BamHI and SmaI sites of the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia).Cells, Media, and TransfectionThe CHO-B7 cell line is a Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO-K1) transfected with human HLA B7 gene. The 16-9 hamster × human somatic cell hybrid line is the CHO-K1 hybrid containing a translocation of the long arm of human chromosome 6 encoding the IFN-γR1 gene and a transfected human HLA-B7 gene (Soh et al., 1993). The 16-9 cells were maintained in F-12 (Ham's) medium (Sigma) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) (complete F-12 medium). HEp-2 cells, a human epidermoid larynx carcinoma cell line, were maintained in Dulbecco's modifed Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.The expression vectors pγR2, pγR2-C174S, pγR2t-285, and pγR2-Y294F were stably transfected into CHO-B7 or 16-9 cells (1-3 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA per 105-106 cells) with LipofectAMINE™ Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions for stable transfection of adherent cells. All cell lines transfected with plasmids carrying the neoR gene were selected and maintained in complete F-12 medium containing 450 μg/ml antibiotic G418.Cytofluorographic AnalysisCytofluorographic analysis of cells for expression of the HLA-B7 surface antigen was performed as described previously (Cook et al., 1992; Soh et al., 1993, 1994). Hu-IFN-αA/D, a chimeric human interferon active on hamster cells (Rehberg et al., 1982), was used as a control to demonstrate the integrity of the HLA-B7 gene in various cell lines.Cross-linking of IFN-γ to ReceptorsRecombinant Hu-IFN-γ with a specific activity of 2 × 107 units/mg was phosphorylated as reported (Mariano and Pestka, 1991). The [32P]IFN-γ was bound to cells and then cross-linked as follows. Briefly, cells were released with 5 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed with PBS, and finally resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mM MgCl2. About 106 cpm of [32P]IFN-γ (370 μCi/μg) were added to 0.2 ml of the cell suspension with or without a 200-fold excess of unlabeled IFN-γ as competitor and were incubated for 75 min at 4°C. After washing with PBS, the cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 5 mM MgCl2 and cross-linked by adding 0.2 M bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, freshly prepared in PBS) to a final concentration of 2 mM. The cross-linking reaction was terminated after 60 min at 4°C by the addition of 10 μl of 1 M Tris•HCl, pH 7.4. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and then extracted in 25 μl of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine•HCl, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The extracts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide vertical slab gels (Laemmli, 1970). Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen for 12 h at −80°C.AntibodiesRabbit anti-Jak1 and anti-Jak2 antibodies were developed against synthetic peptides (KTLIEKERFYESRCRPVTPSC and DSQRKLQFYEDKHQLPAPKC, respectively) corresponding to the end of the second kinase-like domains of murine Jak1 and Jak2, respectively. Rabbit anti-Stat1α antibody, raised against the carboxyl terminus of Stat1α, was a gift from James Darnell. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Sigma (catalog No. P3300). Rabbit anti-IFN-γR1 antibody was prepared with the extracellular domain of Hu-IFN-γR1 as antigen.Immunoprecipitations and BlottingsCells were starved overnight in serum-free media and subsequently stimulated with IFN-γ (1000 units/ml) for 15 min at 37°C. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer consisting of 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), antipain (1 μg/ml), benzamidine-HCl (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (3 μg/ml), chymostatin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (1 μg/ml). Following a 1-h incubation at 4°C, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were cleared with a suspension of rabbit serum-agarose (Sigma, catalog No. R-6755) for 1 h at 4°C. After separation of the agarose by centrifugation for 1 min, the lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2-16 h at 4°C. Protein A-agarose was then added for 1 h at 4°C to bind the immune complexes. The protein A-agarose was then washed 3 times in the lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer to remove bound components. The samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred with the Trans-Blot S.D. Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, catalog No. 170-3910) according to the manufacturer's instructions to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then blocked with 3% (w/v) blocking agent (Amersham, catalog No. NIP551) and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST), 10% glycerol, 1 M glucose for 1 h at 22°C. The membranes were washed in PBST twice for 15 min and probed with the indicated primary antibodies for 1-18 h at 22°C. The blots were then washed in PBST, incubated for 1 h with donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham, ECL™ Western blotting analysis system, catalog No. RPN2108), according to the manufacturer's protocol.Glutathione S-Transferase/Hu-IFN-γR2 Intracellular Domain Fusion Protein (GST/IFN-γR2IC) for Affinity Binding of ProteinsSf9 insect cells were infected with baculovirus encoding Jak1 or Jak2 kinases, and cell lysates were prepared and incubated with the GST/IFN-γR2IC fusion protein or with GST alone immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (Witthuhn et al., 1993). After extensive washing, the proteins associated with the fusion proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antisera to Jak1 and Jak2 kinases. The Jak1 and Jak2 protein concentrations were normalized from total cellular lysates probed with anti-Jak1 or anti-Jak2 antibodies as described (Witthuhn et al., 1993).Jak1 and Jak2 Activation AssayCells were starved overnight in serum-free media and subsequently stimulated with IFN-γ (200 units/ml) for 10 min at 37°C. The cells were lysed, and Jak1 and Jak2 proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. Activation of Jak1 and Jak2 was determined by an in vitro kinase assay with a peptide corresponding to the putative phosphorylation site of Jak2 as a substrate. Specific phosphorylation of the Jak2 peptide (VLPQDKEYYKVKEPGE) by activated Jak1 and Jak2 was performed as previously reported (Silvennoinen et al., 1993). Equal loading of Jak proteins in the assay was demonstrated by using one-third of the samples in Western blotting with antibodies against Jak1 and Jak2.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)EMSAs were performed with a 22-base pair sequence containing a Stat1α binding site corresponding to the GAS element in the promoter region of the human IRF-1 gene (5′-GATCGATTTCCCCGAAATCATG-3′) (Yuan et al., 1994). Two oligonucleotides, 5′-GATCGATTTCCCCGAAAT-3′ and 5′-CATGATTTCGGGGAAATC-3′, were annealed by incubation for 10 min at 65°C, 10 min at 37°C, and 10 min at 22°C and labeled with [α-32P]dATP by filling-in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of the other three dNTPs (Sambrook et al., 1989). Extracts were prepared by modification of the procedure of Dignam et al.(1983). Cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes, treated with Hu-IFN-γ (1000 units/ml) for 15 min at 37°C, washed with ice-cold PBS, and harvested by scraping in ice-cold PBS. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer RSB (10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, aprotinin (3 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and 100 μM Na3VO4). The cells were then lysed with 40 strokes in a dounce homogenizer (2 ml), and the nuclei were pelleted at full speed (14,000 rpm) in a microcentrifuge for 10 s. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer D (20% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (3 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and 100 μM Na3VO4) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were clarified by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at full speed. The nuclear extracts were used directly for EMSAs or stored at −80°C until use.EMSA reactions contained 2.5 μl of nuclear extract, 1 ng of 32P-labeled probe (specific activity 109 cpm/μg), bovine serum albumin (24 μg/ml), poly(dI:dC) (160 μg/ml), 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mM MgCl2, 4.0% Ficoll (Pharmacia), 40 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol in a total volume of 12.5 μl. For the supershift assay, 1 μl of 1:10 dilution (equivalent to 0.1 μl of the undiluted antibody) of anti-Stat1α antibodies was added to the EMSA reaction. Incubations were performed at 22°C for 20 min, then 4 μl of the reaction mixture were electrophoresed at 400 V for 3-4 h at 4°C on a 20 × 20 cm 5% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen for 12 h at −80°C.RESULTSBiological AssayWe measured class I MHC antigen induction to evaluate the ability of the cloned components of the human IFN-γ receptor complex to transduce a signal upon Hu-IFN-γ treatment in hamster cells. The 16-9 cells, expressing only the IFN-γR1 chain of the human IFN-γ receptor complex, exhibit little or no response to Hu-IFN-γ (Fig. 1A; see also Soh et al.(1994)). The 16-9/IFN-γR2 cells, 16-9 cells stably transfected with an expression vector encoding the intact IFN-γR2 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, exhibited a substantial response to Hu-IFN-γ (Fig. 1C). To test if the intracellular domain of IFN-γR2 is necessary for signal transduction, we introduced a stop codon after amino acid 285 of IFN-γR2 resulting in a deletion of the COOH-terminal 51 amino acids. Hu-IFN-γ did not induce MHC class I antigens in 16-9 cells stably transfected with the expression vector encoding the truncated IFN-γR2t (16-9/IFN-γR2t) (Fig. 1E). As a control, it was shown that all cells responded to Hu-IFN-αA/D demonstrating that the MHC class I antigen could be induced in all cell lines (Fig. 1, B, D, and F). We therefore conclude that the intracellular domain of the IFN-γR2 plays an important role in IFN-γ signal transduction. The portion of the intracellular domain of IFN-γR2, which was removed by a premature termination codon, had only one Tyr residue at position 294. Because phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in various receptors (including IFN-γR1) was shown to be important for signal transduction, we mutated this Tyr residue to Phe. Cells expressing this mutated IFN-γR2-Y294F were active in MHC class I antigen induction (data not shown), indicating that this Tyr is not necessary for the activity of the IFN-γR2 chain.Cross-linkingTo investigate the interaction between the chains of the IFN-γ receptor complex and IFN-γ, we carried out cross-linking experiments with cell lines expressing different components of the human IFN-γ receptor complex. The following cell lines were used: CHO-B7/IFN-γR2 cells, CHO-B7 cells stably expressing Hu-IFN-γR2 but not Hu-IFN-γR1, and 16-9, 16-9/IFN-γR2, and 16-9/IFN-γR2t cell lines defined above. A cross-linked band of IFN-γ:IFN-γR1 of approximately 120 kDa was observed in cell lines expressing the IFN-γR1 chain. However, in cells also expressing IFN-γR2, we observed the appearance of a lower molecular weight cross-linked product (IFN-γ:IFN-γR2) of approximately 60 kDa in size (Fig. 2). This band migrated faster when truncated IFN-γR2t in 16-9 cells (16-9/IFN-γR2t) was substituted for the intact IFN-γR2 chain (16-9/IFN-γR2) (Fig. 2). We therefore conclude that the 60-kDa band is a complex composed of IFN-γR2 and IFN-γ. We did not observe any cross-linked product in the CHO-B7/IFN-γR2 cells expressing only the IFN-γR2 chain.Figure 2:Covalent cross-linking of [32P]IFN-γ to the receptors. Cells were harvested and incubated with [32P]IFN-γ with or without addition of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled IFN-γ and cross-linked as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The extracted ligand-receptor complexes were analyzed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The cell lines were: CHO-B7/IFN-γR2, cells expressing only the intact IFN-γR2 chain, lanes 1 and 2; 16-9 cells, lanes 3 and 4; 16-9/IFN-γR2 cells, lanes 5 and 6; 16-9/IFN-γR2t cells, lanes 7 and 8. The cell lines are defined in the legend to Fig. 1.

To test this hypothesis, we mutated IFN-γR2 at position 174 from Cys to Ser. However, the mutated IFN-γR2-C174S remained fully active in class I MHC induction (data not shown), indicating that Cys-174 is not essential for formation of an active IFN-γ receptor complex.IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2 Chains Are Required for Jak1, Jak2, and Stat1α ActivationPhosphorylation and activation of Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases after IFN-γ treatment of human cells, as well as phosphorylation of Stat1α, have been demonstrated (Silvennoinen et al., 1993; Shuai et al., 1993b). To determine the contribution of each chain of the IFN-γ receptor complex in activation of intracellular signaling, we examined Jak1 and Jak2 activation and activation of Stat1α in cells expressing various components of the receptor.In cells expressing both chains of the human IFN-γ receptor complex (16-9/IFN-γR2), IFN-γ activated Jak1 and Jak2 as measured by the in vitro phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 substrate peptide by immunoprecipitated Jak1 and Jak2 kinases, respectively (Fig. 3). However, we did not observe activation of Jak1 and Jak2 in the 16-9 cells expressing only one chain of the human IFN-γ receptor complex (Fig. 3). The 16-9/IFN-γR2t cells, expressing the IFN-γR1 and the truncated IFN-γR2t, failed to show activation of the Jak kinases (Fig. 3). In addition, we observed ligand-induced phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 only in the cell line 16-9/IFN-γR2 expressing both chains of the human IFN-γ receptor complex (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 upon IFN-γ treatment was not detected in 16-9 and 16-9/IFN-γR2t cells (Fig. 4).Figure 3:Activation of Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases upon IFN-γ treatment. Top panel, the activation of Jak1 and Jak2 was determined with an in vitro kinase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures” with a peptide substrate corresponding to the putative phosphorylation site of Jak2. The cell lines were 16-9, 16-9/IFN-γR2, and 16-9/IFN-γR2t as defined in the legend to Fig. 1.

Untreated and IFN-γ-treated cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak1 (first and second panels) or anti-Jak2 (third and fourth panels) antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cell lines were: 16-9, lanes 1 and 2; 16-9/IFN-γR2, lanes 3 and 4; 16-9/IFN-γR2t, lanes 5 and 6. The cell lines are defined in the legend to Fig. 1.

Only in 16-9/IFN-γR2 cells expressing both receptor chains did IFN-γ produce an active Stat1α as measured by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 5A). The formation of the Stat1α DNA-binding complex upon IFN-γ treatment was suppressed after addition of an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides as a competitor (Fig. 5A). To show that this complex was formed by Stat1α proteins, anti-Stat1α antibodies were added to the nuclear extracts from IFN-γ-treated 16-9/IFN-γR2 cells, and the extracts were incubated with the same radiolabeled probe. The specific DNA-binding complex was supershifted after addition of anti-Stat1α antibodies (Fig. 5B).Figure 5:Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). A, EMSAs were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with the 22-base-pair labeled sequence containing the Stat1α binding site corresponding to the GAS element in the promoter region of the human IRF-1 gene (Yuan et al., 1994) with nuclear extracts from following cells: 16-9, 16-9/IFN-γR2, 16-9/IFN-γR2t, CHO-B7, and CHO-B7/IFN-γR2 cells as defined in the legends to Fig. 1and Fig. 2. In addition, HEp-2 cells, a human epidermoid larynx carcinoma cell line, were used as a positive control. B, the supershift assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” with the 16-9/IFN-γR2 cell line. The position of the Stat1α DNA-binding complex and supershifted complex are indicated by the arrows. The same unlabeled oligonucleotides were used as a competitor in 100-fold excess.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It was shown that overexpression of Jak1 and Jak2 by transient transfection leads to tyrosine autophosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 and activates Stat1α, as measured by DNA binding (Silvennoinen et al., 1993). However, overexpression of Jak1 and/or Jak2 by stable transfection of 16-9 cells, expressing only Hu-IFN-γR1, did not permit IFN-γ to induce MHC class I antigens. 2S. V. Kotenko and O. Silvennoinen, unpublished observation. Furthermore, the activation of Stat1α was not detected in these cells. Thus, both receptor chains are necessary and sufficient for activation of Jak1, Jak2, and Stat1α upon IFN-γ induction.Phosphorylation of the IFN-γR1 Chain Requires the IFN-γR2 ChainIFN-γ induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFN-γR1 chain (Greenlund et al., 1994). To determine the requirements for this phosphorylation, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-IFN-γR1 antibodies on lysates of the 16-9, 16-9/IFN-γR2, and 16-9/IFN-γR2t cells, expressing different chains of the human IFN-γ receptor complex (Fig. 6). After immunoprecipitation, the samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the blot was probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The IFN-γR1 chain was not phosphorylated upon IFN-γ treatment in the 16-9 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN-γR1 occurred upon IFN-γ treatment only in cells expressing both chains of the IFN-γ receptor complex (Fig. 6). The truncated IFN-γR2t did not support the ability of IFN-γ to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFN-γR1 chain. This demonstrates that the IFN-γR2 chain is necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFN-γR1 chain.Figure 6:Tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN-γR1 and coimmunoprecipitation of Jak2 kinase with antibody to IFN-γR1. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with anti-IFN-γR1 antibodies from lysates prepared from untreated and IFN-γ-treated cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cell lines were: 16-9, lanes 1 and 2; 16-9/IFN-γR2, lanes 3 and 4; 16-9/IFN-γR2t, lanes 5 and 6. The cell lines are defined in the legend to Fig. 1.

We now report that the endogenous levels of PLK, its phosphorylation status, and protein kinase activity are tightly regulated during cell cycle progression. PLK protein is low in G1, accumulates during S and G2M, and is rapidly reduced after mitosis. During mitosis, PLK is phosphorylated on serine, and its serine threonine kinase function is activated at a time close to that of p34cdc2. The phosphorylated form of PLK migrates with reduced mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and dephosphorylation by purified protein phosphatase 2A converts it to the more rapidly migrating form and reduces the total amount of PLK kinase activity.

Two receptor serine/threonine kinases (types I and II) have been identified as signal transducing TGF-β receptors. We explored the possibility of inhibiting TGF-β- mediated events in glomerular capillary endothelial cells using a TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II) transdominant negative mutant.A mutant TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-IIM), lacking the cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain, was produced by polymerase chain reaction using rat TβR-II cDNA as template.

INTRODUCTIONAngiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is an integral part of development, wound repair, and tumor growth. The formation of capillary networks requires a complex series of cellular events, in which endothelial cells locally degrade their basement membrane, migrate into the connective tissue stroma, proliferate at the migrating tip, elongate and organize into capillary loops(1Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4020) Google Scholar). In response to angiogenic stimuli, endothelial cells in culture develop networks of capillary-like tubes.Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) 1The abbreviations used are: TGFtransforming growth factorECMextracellular matrixPAplasminogen activatorFGFfibroblast growth factoraFGFacidic FGFbFGFbasic FGFTβR-IITGF-β type II receptorPCRpolymerase chain reactionFBSfetal bovine serumntnucleotidekbkilobase(s)MOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidHBSSHanks' balanced salt solution. is a 25-kDa homodimeric polypeptide that belongs to a family of homologous multifunctional cytokines.

The mechanism by which TGF-β1 induces angiogenesis is not yet well defined.In the early stages of angiogenesis, proteases are required for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis to facilitate endothelial cell migration(9Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 induces endothelial cell secretion of plasminogen activator (PA) which activates plasmin, a protease that degrades ECM proteins(10Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J.

When the transdominant negative mutant construct was stably expressed in glomerular capillary endothelial cells, capillary morphogenesis and associated apoptosis were entirely blocked in these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureGlomerular capillary endothelial cells were isolated from bovine kidney cortex as described previously(22Ballermann B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C182-C189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After collagenase digestion, the cells were plated at low density on gelatin-coated plates, in RPMI 1640 medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to which 8 ng/ml acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) (R & D Systems), 0.1 μg/ml heparin, and 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin were added. The aFGF was used to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, and the heparin both to increase the affinity of aFGF for endothelial cell FGF receptors and to inhibit mesangial cell growth. Colonies of endothelial cells were subjected to two rounds of cloning to establish cell lines free of contaminating mesangial cells. Once the cells were established in culture, they were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 15% FBS and 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells between passages 5 and 15 were used for experiments described herein. That the cells are endothelial cells was documented for each isolation by labeling with fluorescent acetylated low density lipoprotein (Biomedical Technologies Inc.).To induce capillary tube formation, cells grown to confluence were placed in RPMI medium containing 0.5% FBS, in the presence or absence of exogenous 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Collaborative Biomedical Products). For transmission electron microscopy, the cells were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in epon directly on the culture dish, in order to preserve morphology of the capillary tubes. Thin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and subjected to electron microscopy (Paragon Biotech Inc., Baltimore, MD). In experiments with neutralizing antibody to TGF-β1, cells grown to confluence were placed in RPMI medium containing 0.5% FBS in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml turkey anti-human TGF-β1 IgG (Collaborative Biomedical Products).Mutant TβR-II ConstructA truncated TGF-β type II receptor construct (TβR-IIM), lacking the cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain, but with full transmembrane spanning and extracellular domains, was generated by PCR using a rat TβR-II cDNA as the template (Fig. 1). Primer sequences were as follows: sense primer 5′-GTTAAGGCTAGCGACGGGGGCTGCCATG-3′; antisense primer 5′-GGCGGTCGACTAGACACGGTAACAGTAGAAG-3′; and contained the sequences for the restriction enzymes NheI and SalI, respectively (underlined), for directional cloning, and a stop codon in the antisense primer. Each 100-μl PCR reaction mixture contained 1 ng of template DNA, 0.25 μM primers, 0.05 mM dNTPs, 0.75 mM MgCl2, 1 × PCR buffer II (Perkin-Elmer), and 2 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Amplification consisted of initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles (15 s at 95°C, 15 s at 50°C, and 15 s at 72°C) in GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). This reaction product was gel-purified and cloned with NheI and SalI into pMAMneo (CLONTECH), a glucocorticoid-inducible mammalian expression vector. That the clone contained correct directionality and in-frame sequences of the PCR product were verified by restriction mapping with EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII, and sequencing by dideoxy chain termination technique using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical).Stable Transfection of Glomerular Capillary Endothelial CellsTo generate clones that stably expressed TβR-IIM, glomerular capillary endothelial cells were transfected by using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as follows. Cells grown to approximately 50% confluency on 6-well plates were washed with RPMI, then incubated with 1-5 μg of DNA (TβR-IIM ligated in pMAMneo) in RPMI and 5-10 μl of Lipofectin suspension for 5 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Control cells were incubated with pMAMneo vector (not containing TβR-IIM) and Lipofectin. Following a 5-h incubation, medium containing 20% FBS in RPMI was added to each well to make a final concentration of 10% FBS, and incubated further for 48 h. Then the medium was changed to 10% FBS in RPMI (no antibiotics) and incubated for another 24 h. To select for stable transfectants, cells were treated with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in RPMI medium containing 15% FBS, and the medium was changed every 2-3 days. Clones emerged at approximately 14 days after lipofection. Stably transfected clones were subcloned using ring cylinders, expanded, and maintained in RPMI medium containing 15% FBS, 200 μg/ml Geneticin, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin. Four independent, stably transfected clones containing TβR-IIM and 4 clones containing empty vector were expanded. Non-transfected glomerular endothelial cells similarly treated with Lipofectin served as additional controls.Solution Hybridization/RNase ProtectionRNase protection analysis was done using the RPA II kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe was prepared from the linearized plasmid containing a fragment of the rat TβR-II cDNA using T7 RNA polymerase, yielding a probe 488 nucleotides (nt) long. 20 μg of total RNA from wild-type and transfected cells were hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe. Hybridization was for 16-18 h at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The samples were then digested with RNase A/T1, and resolved on a 6% acrylamide, 7.7 M urea sequencing gel. A sample of 32P-labeled 1-kb ladder DNA was loaded in adjacent lanes as the molecular size marker.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA from cells grown in the absence or presence of 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma) was isolated by lysis with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and size fractionated (30 μg/lane) on a 1% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gel in 20 mM MOPS, 5 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2. Messenger RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell) and UV linked to the membrane. The blot was prehybridized at 65°C using 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 7% SDS, 0.5 M phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and 100 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA for 2 h, hybridized in the same solution containing the appropriate 32P-labeled cDNA at 65°C overnight, followed by two 30-min washes at 65°C with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5% SDS, 40 mM phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, then four 15-min washes with 1% SDS, 40 mM phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, at 65°C. The membrane was then exposed to Kodak X-AR 5 film for 25-48 h. The TβR-II probe is a 2.8-kb rat TβR-II full-length cDNA (17Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F.

The cells were then washed twice with 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, in HBSS, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4°C with covalent cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) in dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 0.3 mM in 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, HBSS. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by washing three times with cold 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA. The cells were lysed with 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min to remove particulate matter. Sample loading buffer (sucrose, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2%β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM EDTA) was added (1:1, v/v) and boiled for 5 min, followed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) to visualize equivalence in protein loading, and destained prior to autoradiography.[3H]Thymidine Incorporation104 cells were plated in 24-well dishes and incubated in medium containing 15% FBS and grown to subconfluence. Medium was then changed to serum-free RPMI for 24 h, followed by incubation in 0.5% FBS in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). After 45 h, the medium was removed, and cells were exposed for 3 h to 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% bovine platelet-poor plasma derived serum, at 37°C. The cells were washed three times with RPMI, and then extracted three times with ice-cold 6% trichloroacetic acid, followed by solubilization in 1 N NaOH and counted in a Packard Liquid scintillation counter. For determination of the time course of [3H]thymidine incorporation, similar methods were utilized and the cells were extracted at the various time points, with 3-h [3H]thymidine exposure prior to each period.Genomic DNA Isolation and AnalysisCells were plated on 150-mm plates, and grown to confluence in medium containing 15% FBS, then incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μM dexamethasone for 24 h. The medium was then changed to 0.5% FBS and incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) at 37°C for 5 days. Genomic DNA isolation was performed using Puregene (Gentra) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed directly on the plate by removing the culture medium and adding the cell lysis solution, followed by incubation with RNase A, then protein precipitation solution. The samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min and supernatant transferred to new tubes. Precipitated DNA was resuspended in DNA hydration solution, and quantitated by UV spectrophotometer. 20 μg of DNA was analyzed with a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.RESULTSExpression of TβR-IIMmRNATo demonstrate that the transfected glomerular endothelial cells expressed TβR-IIM mRNA, RNase protection assay was performed using antisense RNA prepared from the rat TβR-II cDNA with some flanking vector sequence. The rat TβR-II probe contained 488 nt of authentic rat TβR-II sequence, which included only 211 nt of TβR-IIM, and predicted to hybridize fully with rat (but not bovine) TβR-II mRNA. Based on the size of the TβR-II cDNA probe, the expected size of the protected fragment produced from transfected rat TβR-IIM cDNA sequence was 211 nt. As shown in Fig. 2A, hybridization with the rat TβR-II antisense riboprobe protected a fragment 211 nt in length from RNase digestion in transfected cells. No protected fragment was seen in the wild-type bovine glomerular endothelial cells or mock transfected cells with vector alone. Expression of TβR-IIM mRNA in glomerular endothelial cells was also demonstrated by RT-PCR utilizing the sense and antisense primers to rat cDNA sequence used in producing the mutant construct (data not shown), and four independent transfected clones expressing TβR-IIM mRNA were propagated for all subsequent experiments.Figure 2:Expression of TβR-II mRNA in wild-type and transfected glomerular endothelial cells. A, RNase protection assay. Total RNA from wild-type and transfected glomerular endothelial cells, treated with 1 μM dexamethasone, was hybridized in solution with a 32P-labeled rat TβR-II cDNA probe followed by RNase digestion. As expected, no protected fragment was observed in the wild-type cells (lane 1). In the transfected cells (lane 2), a 211-nt long protected fragment was seen, demonstrating that mRNA for rat TβR-IIM was expressed. Controls represent 32P-labeled rat TβR-II cDNA probe hybridized with yeast total RNA, followed by digestion with RNase (lane 3), or without RNase treatment (lane 4). No protected fragment was seen with RNase treatment (lane 3). The undigested probe was 488 nt long (lane 4). Molecular size was determined by 32P-labeled 1-kb ladder DNA (not shown). B, Northern analysis. Total RNA (30 μg/lane) from wild-type glomerular endothelial cells incubated in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of 1 μM dexamethasone was subjected to Northern blot hybridization with a 32P-labeled rat TβR-II cDNA probe. Only a 5.5-kb mRNA was detected, corresponding to wild-type TβR-II. Lanes 3 and 4 represent total RNA from transfected endothelial cells incubated in the absence or presence of 1 μM dexamethasone, respectively. Both the 5.5- and a 1.8-kb mRNA are observed, reflecting wild-type TβR-II and TβR-IIM, respectively. The 1.8-kb mRNA was strongly induced by dexamethasone (lane 4). Also, a modest induction of the 5.5-kb wild-type TβR-II mRNA was seen with dexamethasone (lanes 2 and 4). Similar densities for the 18 S signals indicate approximate equivalence of RNA loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from wild-type and transfected glomerular endothelial cells, probed with TβR-II cDNA, showed a 5.5-kb band in all cells (Fig. 2B), corresponding to wild-type TβR-II. A new 1.8-kb band, corresponding to TβR-IIM, was observed only in cells transfected with TβR-IIM, and not present in wild-type or mock transfected cells, and was strongly induced by dexamethasone. Also, a modest induction of the 5.5-kb wild-type TβR-II mRNA was seen with dexamethasone.Cell Surface Expression of TβR-IIMAffinity cross-linking with 125I-TGF-β1 in wild-type glomerular endothelial cells detected two distinct bands with molecular masses of approximately 89 and 70 kDa corresponding with TβR-II and TβR-I, respectively (Fig. 3). Only in the transfected glomerular endothelial cells expressing TβR-IIM, two labeled bands of approximately 48 and 36 kDa were observed, both induced by dexamethasone. Labeling of TβR-I in transfected glomerular endothelial cells appeared diminished in three separate experiments.Figure 3:Affinity cross-linking of 125I-labeled TGF-β1 to cell surface receptors. Lanes 1 and 2 represent wild-type glomerular endothelial cells cross-linked in the presence or absence of unlabeled TGF-β1, respectively. Lanes 3 and 4 represent transfected glomerular endothelial cells in the presence or absence of unlabeled TGF-β1, respectively. Specifically labeled bands are observed at approximately 89 kDa and approximately 70 kDa corresponding to wild-type TβR-II and TβR-I, respectively. Bands of approximately 48 and 36 kDa are seen only in the transfected glomerular endothelial cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of TGF-β1 on Endothelial Cell [3H]Thymidine IncorporationTreatment of wild-type glomerular endothelial cells in culture for 48 h with exogenous TGF-β1 significantly inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation to 63 ± 10% of control (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation was similarly observed in empty vector transfected cells treated with TGF-β1. In contrast, treatment of transfected cells carrying TβR-IIM with exogenous TGF-β1 stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation to 131 ± 9% of control (∗, p < 0.005, Student's t test, n = 4). The time course of [3H]thymidine incorporation in transfected cells grown in 0.5% FBS and in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) is shown in Fig. 4B. The results are mean values of triplicate determinations ± S.E. Exogenous TGF-β1 stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation significantly above the basal rate in 0.5% FBS at 36 and 48 h (p < 0.005, analysis of variance).Figure 4:Effect of TGF-β1 on [3H]thymidine incorporation. A, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 45 h, followed by [3H]thymidine incorporation into the cells for 3 h. Lane 1, TGF-β1 inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation in wild-type glomerular endothelial cells to 63 ± 10%. Lane 2, in transfected glomerular endothelial cells carrying TβR-IIM, TGF-β1 stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation to 131 ± 9% (∗, p < 0.005, Student's t test, n = 4). B, transfected glomerular endothelial cells were incubated in 0.5% FBS and in the presence (•) or absence (Ε) of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml), and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined at various time points. Data represent means of triplicate determinations ± S.E. (p < 0.005, analysis of variance). A second experiment gave essentially the same results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Serum Deprivation and TGF-β1 on Capillary MorphogenesisIn cultured wild-type glomerular endothelial cells, with serum deprivation in the presence or absence of dexamethasone pretreatment, many of the cells detached from their substratum while remaining cells organized into capillary-like structures (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, treatment with exogenous TGF-β1, in the presence or absence of dexamethasone, also induced cell detachment and formation of capillary-like structures (Fig. 5B). These events were accelerated by approximately 48 h when compared to those cells under serum deprivation alone. Both cell detachment and formation of capillary-like structures were observed with serum deprivation in mock transfected cells carrying empty vector. In contrast, cell detachment and formation of capillary-like structures were uniformly and entirely absent in transfected cells carrying TβR-IIM treated either with serum deprivation (Fig. 5C) or exogenous TGF-β1 (Fig. 5D). When examined with a high power phase-contrast objective, after 5 days of culture the cellular cords formed by wild-type glomerular endothelial cells appeared as tubes that contained a central translucent lumen-like space along their length (Fig. 6A), similar to the in vitro angiogenesis models described by Ingber and Folkman (23Ingber D.E. Folkman J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and Montesano et al.(11Montesano R. Pepper M.S. Möhle-Steinlein U. Risau W. Wagner E.F. Orci L. Cell. 1990; 62: 435-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Lumen formation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, which revealed groups of endothelial cells that were joined by interdigitated cell processes and enclosed a central lumenal space, as shown in Fig. 6B. Amorphous material within the lumen, also previously described by Ingber and Folkman(23Ingber D.E. Folkman J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), likely represents matrix and debris. Clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, as well as cell junctional complex are also observed.Figure 5:Effect of serum deprivation and exogenous TGF-β1 on capillary morphogenesis. Formation of capillary-like structures were observed in wild-type glomerular endothelial cells incubated in 0.5% FBS medium, in the absence (panel A) or presence (panel B) of exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). Whereas, capillary-like structures were not observed in transfected glomerular endothelial cells carrying TβR-IIM, incubated in 0.5% FBS medium, both in the absence (panel C) or presence (panel D) of exogenous TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml).View Large Image"

We determined the genomic structure of the human MR (hMR) and identified 10 exons in the gene, including two exons (1α and 1β) that encode different 5′-untranslated sequence. Expression of the two different hMR variants is under the control of two different promoters that contain no obvious TATA element, but multiple GC boxes.

Nuclear receptors are highly specialized ligand-dependent transcription factors which interact with specific cis-acting elements to enhance or repress target gene expression(4Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar). They share the same structure-function organization, and their cDNAs are highly conserved particularly in those regions associated with DNA and hormone binding. The mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor are closely related, and together with the progesterone and androgen receptors they form a subfamily which is closely related both by sequence and functional criteria(3Fuller P.J.

The adrenal steroids aldosterone and cortisol both bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor (type I corticosteroid receptor); cortisol also binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (type II receptor). Specificity is conferred by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts cortisol to the less active compound cortisone, thus allowing aldosterone to bind to mineralocorticoid receptor(6Edwards C.R.W.

Science. 1988; 242: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). The mineralocorticoid receptor is expressed in so called “classical” aldosterone target tissues, which are sodium transporting epithelia (kidney, colon, salivary, and sweat glands) and in a variety of non-epithelial target tissues, such as the central nervous system, mononuclear leukocytes, large blood vessels, and the heart(8Marver D. Litwack G. Biochemical Actions of Hormones. Academic Press Inc., New York1985: 385-431Crossref Google Scholar). In the kidney, the mineralocorticoid receptor regulates the sodium, potassium, and hydrogen ion balance in the distal part of the nephron. In the central nervous system, the mineralocorticoid receptor is expressed in many areas of the forebrain with very high levels of expression reported in the rodent hippocampus. In some, but not all regions in the brain, the mineralocorticoid receptor responds to the diurnal fluctuations in cortisol levels and thus provides, together with the glucocorticoid receptor, a system capable of responding to normal and elevated cortisol concentrations, respectively(9Arriza J.L. Simerly R.B. Swanson L.W. Evans R.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Recent studies have reported the presence of multiple variants of the rat mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA, which encode for the same protein but diverge in their 5′-untranslated sequences(10Kwak S.P. Patel P.D. Thompson R.C. Akil H. Watson S.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2344-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These mineralocorticoid receptor mRNAs are expressed in a tissue-dependent manner and are very likely to be under the control of different promoter sequences, allowing thus an independent regulation of each mRNA isoform. The hMR gene has been localized to chromosome 4q31.1-4q31.2(11Morrison N. Harrap S.B. Arriza J.L. Boyd E. Connor J.M. Hum.

Cell Genet. 1989; 52: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have characterized the structure of the hMR gene and determined the location of the hMR splice sites. Two different 5′-untranslated exons were identified which splice into a common translated region. Expression of these mRNA species is controlled by two distinct promoters. A human placental cosmid library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), a human placental lambda phage library(13Lawn R.M. Fritsch E.F. Parker R.C. Blake G. Maniatis T. Cell. 1978; 15: 1157-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), two human leukocyte cosmid libraries, and a chromosome 4 enriched cosmid library were screened using three different EcoRI restriction fragments of the human mineralocorticoid receptor cDNA following standard colony hybridization techniques(14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Labeling was performed by random priming with nonamers and [α-32P]dCTP (Megaprime DNA labeling system, Amersham). Positively hybridizing colonies were picked and passaged until complete purification. DNA of positive clones was prepared following standard techniques(14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cosmid and phage DNA was digested with different restriction enzymes and characterized by Southern blot analysis using specific [γ-32P]dATP-labeled oligonucleotides as probes(15Komesaroff P. Verity K. Fuller P.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Zennaro M.C. Borensztein P. Jeunemaitre X. Armanini D. Soubrier F. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The sequence of the exon 1β/intron P1 boundary and confirmation of the cDNA sequence was obtained by direct sequencing of the cosmid and by subcloning into M13 for single-stranded sequencing using Taq polymerase (Promega Biotech) and formamide-containing polyacrylamide gels. Inverse PCR was performed according to Ochman et al.(18Ochman H. Medhora M.M. Garza D. Hartl D.L. PCR Protocols: a Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). Briefly, human genomic DNA was digested with different restriction enzymes (HaeIII, RsaI, MspI, and Sau3A). The purified digests were circularized and submitted to 35 rounds of PCR amplification using exon-specific primer pairs. Oligonucleotide primers (20-23-mers) were designed, using the predicted exon-intron organization of the hMR(19Lubahn D.B. Brown T.R. Simenthal J.A. Higgs H.N. Migeon C.J. Wilson E.M. French F.S.

PCR primers were as follows (numbering corresponds to the position of the 5′-nucleotide according to the published hMR cDNA sequence(1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M.

PCR products were fractionated on a 2% agarose gel, subcloned into Bluescript-KS, and sequenced. Mapping of the hMRα transcription initiation site by RACE (21Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) was performed using a commercial kit (5′-RACE, Life Technologies, Inc.) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Total human kidney RNA was extracted by standard techniques (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar) and submitted to reverse transcription using a reverse primer (23-mer) located at position 480 according to the published mineralocorticoid receptor cDNA sequence(1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The 3′-tailed cDNA was submitted to 30 rounds of PCR amplification using an oligo(dC) sense primer and a nested reverse primer (at position 311). PCR included a denaturation step at 96°C for 30 s, an annealing step at 56°C for 30 s, and an elongation step at 72°C for 1 min, after an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min and followed by 10 min elongation. 0.05% of the initial PCR product was subsequently reamplified under the same conditions with a sense oligo(dC) primer containing several cloning sites and a second nested reverse primer at position 83. The PCR products were subcloned into Bluescript-KS and screened with an exon 1α-specific oligonucleotide (position 7); positive clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. Alternative 5′ variants of the mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA were searched for by RACE using reverse primers located in exon 2 at position 311 and 280 for the first and second round of amplification, respectively. After subcloning PCR fragments, colonies which did not hybridize to an exon 1α-specific oligonucleotide (position 7) probe were sequenced. Exon 1β-specific oligonucleotide probes were synthesized and used for direct sequencing of a cosmid containing exon 1β. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the suite of programs provided by the Australian Genomic Information Service and by CITI 2. Four cosmid clones and three phage clones were characterized after the screening for clones containing hMR gene sequences using the hMR cDNA as probe (Fig. 1). Cosmid clones cos25 and cos31 were mapped to the 3′-end of the gene using primer A3206 as a probe (primer position according to the published cDNA(1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). λ9b was characterized using oligonucleotide S1786 and A448 and mapped to the 5′-end of the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. Primer S2054, which maps to the DNA-binding domain, was used to characterize clone λ14, and phage clone λ131 was mapped to the hormone-binding domain of the receptor using oligonucleotides S2381 and A2683. Clones cos72 and cos953 were isolated using EcoRI fragments of the original hMR cDNA(1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Three different inverse PCRs were performed to specifically amplify putative exons not covered by the cosmid/phage clones as indicated (i1-i3). The sequence of the exon for the published 5′-untranslated and its flanking sequence were determined from both cosmid clone cos72 and also using inverse PCR (ip1). Following the nomenclature used for the rat gene(10Kwak S.P. Patel P.D. Thompson R.C. Akil H. Watson S.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2344-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), this is designated as the α5′-untranslated. The cosmid cos72 also hybridized with both exon 2 and rat exon 1β-specific probes. Exon 1β 5′-untranslated was identified by RACE which enabled the sequencing of the flanking region and exon-intron junction from the cosmid. Using this strategy, we determined the exon-intron boundaries and flanking sequences of the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. As shown in Table 1, the intron-exon boundaries have the canonical consensus sequence.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The hMR gene (Fig. 1A and Table 1) consists of a total of 10 exons and spans over 60-90 kb, as deduced from Southern hybridization experiments (data not shown). Exons 1α and 1β are composed only of 5′-untranslated sequence. The N-terminal part of the receptor is encoded by exon 2, which contains 2 bp of 5′-untranslated region and 1757 bp of coding sequence. Two small exons, exons 3 and 4, encode each of the two zinc fingers of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor. The hormone-binding domain of the mineralocorticoid receptor is encoded by five exons, exons 5-9. Among the glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid/androgen/protesterone receptor subfamily of nuclear receptor genes (20Encio I.J. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7182-7188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tilley W.D. Marcelli M. Wilson J.D. McPhaul M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two different hMR 5′-mRNA ends were identified, designated as hMRα and hMRβ. The 5′-untranslated sequence containing exon 1α was obtained both from the cosmid clone cos72 and by inverse PCR (Fig. 1). A 2.1-kb HindIII fragment of cos72 shown to hybridize with a rat exon 1α probe yielded sequence extending from intron A (~900 bp) through the 5′-untranslated and into the flanking region (P1:950 bp). The inverse PCR fragment obtained was ~1.2 kb in size and similarly extends from intron A to include ~750 bp of flanking sequence. Fig. 2shows the hMRα 5′-untranslated and flanking sequences obtained from these clones. No consensus TATA box sequence is present in the putative promoter sequence, and no CCAAT motif is found within the first 100 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, although two are found at positions −172 and −225 (these sequences could be found by chance every 1025 bp).

The 5′-untranslated encoded by exon 1α shows 90% identity with the rat sequence and the first 400 bp of the flanking region of exon 1α show 73% identity with the rat genomic sequence in this region(32Castren M. Damm K. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The transcription initiation site of hMRα mRNA was determined by RACE-PCR. The most 5′-sequence obtained corresponds to nucleotide positions −45/−46, according to the published cDNA sequence(1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), which is therefore the putative transcription initiation site (underlined in Fig. 2). By Southern hybridization with an oligonucleotide at position −45, about 61% of clones were positive for this sequence. Several shorter transcripts could represent minor sites of transcription initiation or truncated artifacts of reverse transcription and amplification. We identified a novel 5′-sequence that spliced onto the mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA at intron A-exon 2 boundary located 2 bp upstream of the mineralocorticoid receptor translation initiation site (Fig. 3). This sequence shares 85% homology with the first untranslated exon of the rat MRβ cDNA isolated from rat hippocampus(33Patel P.D. Sherman T.G. Goldman D.J. Watson S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1877-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The longest transcripts obtained by subsequent RACE using exon 1β-specific reverse primers at position 124 and 103 of the cloned cDNA enabled us to determine a putative transcription initiation site of hMRβ (underlined in Fig. 3). Sequencing of cosmid cos72 with 5′-untranslated-specific primers enabled the identification of both the exon1β-intron P1 junction and the region flanking the 5′-untranslated (P2). It is possible, given the very GC-rich nature of the region which rendered sequencing difficult, that the RACE products are prematurely terminated in the 5′-untranslated. Sequence homology with the rat exon 1β cDNA is observed over 216 bp to the putative transcription initiation site of hMR 1β, after which the sequence similarity decreases. Additional experiments are required to precise whether alternative transcription start sites exist in the human and the rat MRβ promoter. Computer-assisted analysis of P2 revealed two binding sites for transcription factor Sp-1(−62, −150) and one consensus sequence for binding of transcription factor AP-2(−26). In the present study we have determined the genomic organization of the hMR gene. The two different mRNA 5′-ends isolated by RACE suggested the existence of alternative promoters in the hMR gene, as has been reported for the mouse glucocorticoid receptor (34Strahle U. Schmidt A. Kelsey G. Stewart A.F. Cole T.J. Schmid W. Schütz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and suggested for the rat mineralocorticoid receptor(10Kwak S.P. Patel P.D. Thompson R.C. Akil H. Watson S.J.

The expression of the two mRNAs is not mutually exclusive, since the two transcripts were both found in the kidney. Alternative transcription initiation from exon 1α or 1β generates two different hMR transcripts, hMRα and hMRβ, with the same translation product. A third mRNA isoform was found in rat hippocampus (γMR)(10Kwak S.P. Patel P.D. Thompson R.C. Akil H. Watson S.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2344-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and although we could not detect this mRNA in the human kidney, this and possibly other mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA species might be present in low abundance or restricted to particular tissues. It is interesting to compare the genomic structure of the hMR, hGR, hAR, and hPR(20Encio I.J. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. J. Biol.

Although in these genes the same exon-intron organization is used to assemble functional domains of the receptor protein (eight exons), no structural conservation is found for 5′-untranslated exons and regulatory regions. hGR has a unique 5′-untranslated exon, whereas only eight exons compose the hAR gene. The expression of both is driven by a unique promoter, whereas the hPR gene (24Misrahi M. Venencie P.-Y. Saugier-Veber P. Sar S. Dessen P. Milgrom E. Biochim. Biophys.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) contains two different hormone-inducible promoters (Fig. 4). The DNA surrounding the transcription initiation site of hMRα (5′-CCCTCC+1TCT-3′) resembles the initiator sequence from the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene 5′-CCCTCA+1TTCT-3′, which appears to be important in TATA-less promoters, and which has been shown to interact in a position-dependent manner with Sp-1 binding sites to direct high levels of transcription(36Smale S.T.

This sequence also shares homology with the androgen receptor transcription initiation site II (TISII) surrounding sequence (CCCTC+12C+13GAGA), and with the sequence surrounding the putative transcription initiation site of the rat MRα (CTCC+1TGCGC).

Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), both P1 and P2 do not contain any TATA box or CCAAT motifs within the first 100 bp, though several potential Sp-1-binding sites are present. Promoters with these features are found primarily in housekeeping genes and usually contain several transcription initiation sites as well as several potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp-1(36Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The hMR gene is thus regulated by alternative promoters(40Schibler U. Sierra F. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 237-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 41Ayoubi T.A.Y. Creemers J.W.M. Roebroek A.J.M. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9298-9303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism allows more flexibility in the control of expression and generally, alternative promoters are associated with tissue- and/or developmental-specific gene expression. In the rat, MRα is the predominant form expressed in the kidney, whereas in the hippocampus MRα and MRβ are expressed in equal proportions(10Kwak S.P. Patel P.D. Thompson R.C. Akil H. Watson S.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2344-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, alternative transcription initiation can affect both the stability of the transcripts and the efficiency of mRNA translation(42Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Indeed, mineralocorticoid receptor expression seems to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner by the level of its ligand, although conflicting data are reported in the literature. Whereas there is good evidence for hormonal regulation of mineralocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus(10Kwak S.P. Patel P.D. Thompson R.C. Akil H. Watson S.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2344-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Reul J.M.H.M. Pearce P.T. Funder J.W. Krozowski Z.S. Mol.

Chem. 1980; 256: 142-147Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and lack of regulation by corticosteroids have been reported(44Stephenson G. Funder J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: E525-E529PubMed Google Scholar). For the rat distal colonic mineralocorticoid receptor, protein and mRNA levels are neither up-regulated after adrenalectomy nor down-regulated in response to a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist(46Meyer A.S. Schmidt T. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although mineralocorticoid receptor is known to bind specific consensus sequences, such as the GREs contained in the MMTV promoter(1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), no specific mineralocorticoid-responsive element has yet been identified. P1 contains a sequence resembling a GRE in an inverted orientation, which has been shown to confer hormone responsiveness to exogenous promoters in an orientation-independent manner(47Jantzen H.M. Strähle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schütz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that a significant and selective increase in MRα mRNA levels has been reported in rat hippocampus after adrenalectomy, which was reversed by exogenous corticosterone administration, whereas MRβ mRNA levels did not change. Thus, in the rat, MRα may be the hormonally regulated mRNA variant, suggesting that the putative hormone responsive sequence identified in P1 might be of functional significance. In conclusion, the determination of the genomic structure of the hMR will allow the study of its transcriptional regulation and of the tissue-specific and developmental expression of distinct hMR mRNA species. It will also facilitate the search for mutations in the human mineralocorticoid receptor gene which may be responsible for disorders of salt and water balance, such as mineralocorticoid resistance or hypertension.

The Ii gene is generally co-regulated with the MHC class II molecules at the level of transcription and a shared SXY promoter element has been described. This report defines the proximal promoter region of Ii which may regulate Ii transcription distinct from MHC class II. In vivo genomic footprinting identified an occupied, imperfect CCAAT box and an adjacent GC box in the proximal region. These sites are bound in Ii-ositive cell lines and upon interferon-γ induction of Ii transcription. In contrast, both sites are unoccupied in Ii-egative cell lines and in inducible cell lines prior to interferon-γ treatment. Together these two sites synergize to stimulate transcription. Independently, the transcription factor NF-Y binds poorly to the imperfect CCAAT box with a rapid off rate, while Sp1 binds to the GC box. Stabilization of NF-Y binding occurs upon Sp1 binding to DNA. In addition, the half-life of Sp1 binding also increased in the presence of NF-Y binding. These findings suggest a mechanism for the complete functional synergy of the GC and CCAAT elements observed in Ii transcription.

Binding of peptides to the class II molecules is regulated in part by the MHC class II-associated invariant chain (Ii) protein(5Jones P.P. Murphy D.B. Hewgill D. McDevitt H.O.

This association has multiple affects on class II molecules, all of which optimize the binding and presentation of foreign peptides derived from the extracellular environment (reviewed in Refs. 9, 10). The Ii also appears to play a role in targeting the class II molecules to endosomal or endosomal-like compartments where peptide is bound(11Qiu Y. Xu X. Wandinger Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J.

The Ii promoter and the class II promoters share a common DNA motif, S/X/Y, which interacts with at least three distinct transcription factors(4Benoist C. Mathis D. Annu. Rev.

Several studies have clearly demonstrated that this motif is responsible for both the constitutive and IFN-γ-induced coordinate regulation(27Brown A.M. Barr C.L. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3183-3189PubMed Google Scholar, 28Doyle C. Ford P.J. Ponath P.D. Spies T. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1990; 10: 3906-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In class II promoters, this motif is located proximal to the TATA box and is generally sufficient for transcriptional activation. In contrast, the Ii promoter has over 170 base pairs (bp) between the TATA box and the S/X/Y motif. There are several cases of differential regulation between Ii and class II genes(17Koch N. Harris A.W. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 12-15PubMed Google Scholar, 18Momburg F. Koch N. Moller P. Moledanhauer G. Butcher G.W. Hammerling G.J. J.

Loche M. Griscelli C. Mach B. Nature. 1985; 318: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The additional Ii promoter sequences between the S/X/Y and TATA domains may harbor elements mediating the discordant transcription. In the murine Ii promoter, an NF-κB site has been identified which mediates basal and TNFα induction of Ii transcription(33Pessara U. Koch N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4146-4154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, promoter deletion analysis implicated a GC box as important for the basal activity of the murine gene(30Zhu L. Jones P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3906-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, two NF-κB sites have been characterized at position −172 and −118 base pairs of the human Ii promoter(34Brown A.M. Linhoff M.W. Stein B. Wright K.L. Baldwin A.S.J. Basta P.V. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2926-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of these elements is dependent on cell type-specific differences in the binding of NF-κB subunits. Despite these studies, little is known about the Ii proximal promoter and the factors bound there which may be required for transcription as well as potentially mediating the effects of the distal S/X/Y motif. The Y box of the S/X/Y motif is an inverted CCAAT site which binds the heteromeric transcription factor NF-Y (also known as CBF, CP1, and YEBP)(35Chodosh L.A. Baldwin A.S. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A.

NF-Y is composed of an A, B, and C subunit of 42, 36, and 40 kDa, respectively(39Maity S.N. Sinha S. Ruteshouser E.C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

In addition to MHC class II promoters, NF-Y-binding sites are found in many unrelated promoters; e.g. HSV-tk (37Zeleznik Le N.J. Azizkhan J.C. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), collagen(36Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. deCrombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and albumin(43Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Typically the binding sites are located in the proximal promoter region between −60 and −80 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site(44Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Functional analysis has also shown that NF-Y can be important in transcription reinitiation as well as in activation, suggesting a role in basal transcription(43Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 45Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.Y. Knapp A.M. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the MHC class II promoters, NF-Y also functions to stabilize and/or recruit additional transcription factors to the S/X/Y complex. In vitro, NF-Y and the X box-binding protein, RFX, co-stabilize binding to their DNA sites(46Reith W. Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Barras E. Mach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo mutation of the NF-Y-binding site abrogates factor binding to the upstream X1 and X2 sites(47Wright K.L. Vilen B.J. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Moore T.L. Li G. Criscitiello M. Cogswell P. Badley Clark J. Ting J.P.-Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4042-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, NF-Y requires that the DNA stereospecifically align the X and Y boxes for activation(48Vilen B.J. Cogswell J.P. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). NF-Y has also been studied at the serum albumin promoter and in that context functions synergistically with C/EBP to activate transcription(43Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The interaction between these factors partially destabilizes NF-Y binding but results in a large synergistic increase in the formation of stable preinitiation complexes. These studies of NF-Y suggest that although found in many different promoters, its mode of function may depend upon the local environment of that specific promoter. In this report we now describe the in vivo characterization of the elements and factors involved at the proximal promoter of the human Ii gene. Through the use of in vivo genomic footprinting, two adjacent binding sites with homology to a GC box and an imperfect CCAAT box are identified. The GC and CCAAT elements act synergistically to promote Ii transcription and are bound by the transcription factors Sp1 and NF-Y, respectively. NF-Y and Sp1 bind cooperatively at the Ii promoter to mediate, at least in part, the observed functional synergy. Thus, maximal Ii transcription requires the action of two NF-Y factors; one in the distal S/X/Y motif and one described here in a cooperative binding complex with Sp1 in the proximal promoter. These findings describe a mechanism of transcriptional activation by the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-Y and define a new promoter region regulating Ii expression. The invariant chain promoter, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene construct, 790IiCAT, contains the human Ii promoter sequences from +1 to −790 base pairs relative to the transcription initiation site(49Brown A.M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26328-26333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant constructs were derived by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis as described previously(50Kunkel T. Roberts J. Zakour T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). The construct 790IimtGC changed the sequence at −74 to −65 bp from 5′-TGGGCGGAGT-3′ to 5′-TGtttGGAGT-3′. The construct 790IimtYprox changed the sequence at −50 to −42 bp from 5′-CGAATCAGAT-3′ to 5′-CGAcgCtcAT-3′. The double mutant construct, 790IimtGC/Yprox, contained the changes in both sites as described for the single mutants. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Raji is a human Epstein-Barr virus-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cell line that expresses high levels of Ii gene and MHC class II antigens. H9 (HuT78) was derived from a human T cell lymphoma and also expresses high levels of Ii gene and MHC class II antigens. Jurkat is a T lymphoblastoid cell line which does not express Ii or MHC class II genes. These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine. The human glioblastoma multiform cell line, U105-MG, which was previously referred to as U373-MG in this laboratory was grown in McCoy's 5A supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine. Interferon-γ induction of U105-MG cells used 500 units/ml and was generously provided by Biogen (Cambridge, MA). Transient transfections of the Raji cells were performed by electroporation as described previously(51Sherman P.A. Basta P.V. Moore T.L. Brown A.M. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The transfectants were harvested 24 h following electroporation. Expression of the transiently transfected reporter genes was assayed by quantitating chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in cell extracts as described previously (51Sherman P.A. Basta P.V. Moore T.L. Brown A.M. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CAT activity was resolved on thin layer chromatography plates and quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). In vivo methylation of cells and DNA preparation were as described by Pfeifer et al.(52Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The ligation-mediated, polymerase chain reaction amplified in vivo genomic footprinting was as originally described by Mueller and Wold (53Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) and modified by Wright and Ting (54Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7601-7605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The primer set utilized to reveal the Ii proximal promoter, upper strand is: UPP1, 5′-ATTGTTGGAGATAAGGTCG-3′; UPP2, 5′-ATGACTGGCTTCTGATCTTCCCGACAGC; UPP3, 5′-ACTGGCTTCTGATCTTCCCGACAGCTCCTG-3′. The primer set utilized to reveal the Ii proximal promoter, lower strand is: LPP1, 5′-GCCCAGAAACAAGTGATGAG-3′; LPP2, 5′-GGATCGTGCTGGCCTTTCTACCTGC-3′; LPP3, 5′-GGATCGTGCTGGCCTTTCTACCTGCCTG-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al.(55Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) from Raji cells grown in suspension to a density of 8 × 105 cells/ml. Gel shift analysis was performed as described previously (56Wright K.L. Dell'Orco R.T. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2812-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The wild type Ii oligonucleotide, IiGC/Yprox, spanned from −82 to −32 bp of the promoter relative to the transcription initiation site. The sequence is shown in Fig. 1C. The IiYprox oligonucleotide contains a mutation of the GC box and is 5′-CATCTACCAAGTGtttGGAGTGGCCTTCTGTGGACGAATCAGATTCCTCTCCAG-3′. The Ii GC oligonucleotide contains a mutation in the Y-proximal site and is 5′-CATCTACCAAGTGGGCGGAGTGGCCTTCTGTGGACGAcgCtcATTCCTCTCCAG-3′. The DRA Y box oligonucleotide is 5′-ATTTTTCTGATTGGCCAAAGATTT-3′. The consensus Sp1-binding site oligonucleotide is 5′-GTCACCGGGGCGGGGCGGTCAC-3′. The DRA octa oligonucleotide is 5′-AGAGTAATTGATTTGCATTTTAATGGTCAG-3′. The TAATGARAT consensus OTF-1-binding site oligonucleotide was derived from the HSV IE45 promoter and is 5′-TTCACGCGGTAATGAGATGGGTT-3′. Antibody supershift experiments were performed by preincubating 1 μg of antibody for 2 h on ice with each binding reaction prior to the addition of the DNA probe. The NF-YA and NF-YB antibodies have been reported previously (47Wright K.L. Vilen B.J. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Moore T.L. Li G. Criscitiello M. Cogswell P. Badley Clark J. Ting J.P.-Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4042-4053Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The Sp1 and NF-κB-p50 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The relative DNA binding affinity constants of the Sp1•NF-Y complex compared to either Sp1 or NF-Y alone was calculated from EMSA competition gels as described previously in detail(57Delvoye N.L. Destroismaisons N.M. Wall L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6969-6983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, gel shift binding reactions with increasing amounts of specific competitor DNA (0-500-fold molar excess) were allowed to come to equilibrium and then separated by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. The amount of complexed and free probe was measured by PhosphorImage analysis. Assuming, where P is the DNA-binding protein and C is the protein•DNA complex, [DNA] ≫ [P] then [DNA] =[DNA]t = at all times and the affinity constant of the DNA binding reaction can be described by 1/Kaff = [C]/[P]*[DNA]. Rearranging the formula reveals that a plot of 1/[C] versus 1/[DNA] will define - 1/Kaff as the x intercept. Using the crude nuclear extract conditions described in this report the Kaff will be affected, however, since the conditions are the same for each assay and do not vary the Kaff should be valid relative to each other. Half-lives of the DNA binding activities were calculated as described previously (58) except the same specific oligonucleotides described for gel shift analysis were used as the competitors as indicated in the figure legend. Briefly, a 5-fold scale up of the standard EMSA reaction was allowed to come to equilibrium. A greater than 1000-fold molar excess of the competitor contained in a volume of less than 4% of the binding reaction was added to the binding reaction. Aliquots of the binding reaction were then loaded onto a continuously electrophoresing EMSA gel at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 25 min after addition of the competitor. The free and all shifted complexes were quantitated by PhosphorImage analysis. Half-lives were determined from a plot of the fraction of total probe in the specific complex at times during the competition divided by the fraction of total probe in the specific complex at time 0 min versus time. The formula is [C1]t=x/[C1+C2+Cn+F]t=x divided by [C1]t= 0/[C1+C2+Cn+F]t = 0, where C is the complex concentration, F is the free probe concentration, and t is the time of competition. The half-life of either factor alone was determined from EMSA reactions with the IimtGC or IimtYprox probes which only bind one of the factors to simplify the calculations. Several studies by our laboratory and others have characterized transcriptional elements present in the distal promoter region of the Ii gene. However, little is known about the identity or requirement for proximal elements. We directly addressed this question by mapping the DNA sequences occupied in intact cells by in vivo genomic footprinting. In vivo footprinting allows the visualization of protein-DNA interactions on endogenous genes in the more physiologically relevant intact cell. Fig. 1displays the footprints for the first 90 base pairs of the Ii promoter in cell lines consitutively positive for Ii expression, Raji and H9 and an Ii-negative cell line, Jurkat. Two very clear domains of contacts were detected in the B lymphoblastoma cell line, Raji and the T lymphoblastoid cell line H9 (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1-4 and summarized in Fig. 1C). The contacts in both of these cell lines and in another Ii-expressing B cell line, Namalwa (data not shown) were identical. Five protections and two enhancements on the upper strand were clustered over a sequence with high homology to a consensus GC box. The single guanine residue on the lower strand of this GC box was also protected (Fig. 1B). In addition, two guanine residues flanking the GC box were weakly protected. Downstream of the GC box region a second, weaker clusters of contacts are visible. There is a weak protection at position −56 and a strong protection at −50 on the upper strand. On the lower strand there is a strong protection at −51 and a second weak protection at −39. These contacts partially overlap with a imperfect NF-Y/CCAAT box-binding site. A consensus NF-Y/CCAAT box has previously been characterized in the distal region of the Ii promoter and is referred to as the Y box. Thus we named the imperfect, proximal NF-Y/CCAAT homology, Y-proximal (Y-prox). The weak degree of in vivo protection of the Y-proximal site is consistent with previous in vivo footprint analysis of other consensus NF-Y-binding sites(49Brown A.M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26328-26333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7601-7605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, protection of the Y-proximal adenine residues at position −45, −48, and −49 was detectable in Raji cells by a modified in vivo footprinting protocol (data not shown, 59). Analysis of the Ii-negative, T lymphoblastoid cell line Jurkat did not detect any protein-DNA interactions at the GC box and Y-proximal elements on the lower strand and only a single weak protection on the upper strand (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 5 and 6). Our previous in vivo analysis of the distal portion of the Ii promoter also revealed it to be unoccupied in Jurkat cells. The single protection in Jurkat cells could indicate an extremely weak interaction at the Y-proximal site or more likely reflect an alteration of the DNA structure in that area, since the rest of the promoter is unoccupied. A similar bare promoter was observed for the MHC class II promoter DRA in Jurkat cells even though the transcription factors are available in the nucleus(54Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7601-7605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results suggest that class II and Ii-negative cells may prevent transcription of these genes by blocking the accessibility of transcription factors to the promoters. Furthermore, the class II and Ii genes may use a common mechanism to block accessibility despite their location on different chromosomes. Ii gene transcription is strongly induced by IFN-γ in a number of non-lymphoid cell types. In the glioblastoma cell line U105-MG, the induction is mediated through a 5-6-fold increase in the rate of Ii gene transcription(34Brown A.M. Linhoff M.W. Stein B. Wright K.L. Baldwin A.S.J. Basta P.V. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2926-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo footprint analysis of the Ii proximal promoter in U105-MG cells revealed no protein-DNA interactions prior to IFN-γ induction (Fig. 2). Four h after the addition of IFN-γ, protections are clearly visible at the GC box and Y-proximal site. The contacts are identical to those observed in the Raji and H9 cells. A similar pattern of interaction was observed at 18 and 48 h post-induction. This region of the Ii promoter has not been implicated in the IFN-γ response; rather two upstream elements, the ISRE and S/X/Y domain, appear to mediate the induction (27Brown A.M. Barr C.L. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3183-3189PubMed Google Scholar, 29Eades A.M. Litfin M. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4399-4409PubMed Google Scholar, 60Barr C.L. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3475-3481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of those IFN-γ-responsive elements as well as the two NF-κB sites displayed in vivo occupancy only after IFN-γ treatment(34Brown A.M. Linhoff M.W. Stein B. Wright K.L. Baldwin A.S.J. Basta P.V. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2926-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Brown A.M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26328-26333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, protection at these distal elements did not become maximal until 24 or 48 h post-induction (see “Discussion”). This indicates that the entire Ii promoter is shielded from transcription factor binding in the uninduced state, and IFN-γ treatment relieves this repression. We addressed the functional importance of the newly identified in vivo binding sites by preparing site-specific mutants of the recognition sequences and assaying the effect on transcription from the Ii promoter. The GC box was altered by changing the core sequence to three successive T residues. This mutation blocks Sp1 binding to GC boxes as shown previously (61Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and below. Four residues were altered in the Y-proximal site which eliminated all potential homology to CCAAT boxes. Each of the mutations were assayed in the context of the 790-base pair Ii promoter fused to the CAT reporter gene. These constructs were first transfected into the constitutively high expressing Raji B cell line. Transcription from the Ii promoter with a mutated GC box is dramatically lowered to 24% of wild type (Fig. 3). A similar loss in activity is detected from the Ii promoter with a mutated Y-proximal site. Significantly, no further reduction in transcription is observed when the both the GC box and Y-proximal site are mutated in one construct (mtGC/Yprox). This finding suggests these elements can not activate independently of each other in the Ii promoter, since neith"

https://openalex.org/W1976121619,"Profilin is a small 12-15-kDa actin-binding protein, which in eukaryotic organisms is ubiquitous and necessary for normal cell growth and function. Although profilin's interactions with its three known ligands (actin monomers, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and poly-L-proline (PLP)) have been well characterized in vitro, its precise role in cells remains largely unknown. By binding to clusters of PIP2, profilin is able to inhibit the hydrolysis of PIP2 by phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1). This ability is the result of profilin's affinity for PIP2, but the specific residues of profilin's amino acid sequence involved in the binding of PIP2 are not known. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we sought to localize regions of profilin important for this interaction by generating the following mutants of human profilin (named according to the wild-type amino acid altered, its position, and the amino acid substituted in its place): Y6F, D8A, L10R, K25Q, K53I, R74L, R88L, R88L/K90E, H119D, G121D, and K125Q. With the exception of L10R, all of the mutants were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on PLP-Sepharose. Only Y6F and K25Q demonstrated moderately less stringent binding to PLP, indicating that most of the mutations did not induce marked alterations of profilin's structure. When tested for their relative abilities to inhibit the hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLCγ1, most of the mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type profilin. Exceptions included D8A, which demonstrated increased inhibition of PLCγ1, and R88L, which demonstrated decreased inhibition of PLCγ1. To assess the importance of the region surrounding residue 88 of human profilin, three synthetic decapeptides selected to correspond to non-overlapping stretches of the human profilin sequence were tested for their abilities to inhibit PLCγ1. We found that only the decapeptide that matched the peptide stretch centered around residue 88 was able to inhibit PLCγ1 activity substantially and was able to do so at nearly wild-type profilin levels. Taken together with the finding that mutating residue 88 resulted in decreased inhibition of PLCγ1 activity, these data provide strong evidence that this region of human profilin represents an important binding site for PIP2.

Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)). For example, by binding to actin monomers in a 1:1 complex, profilin decreases the critical concentration of monomeric actin in the presence of thymosin β4(3Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), inhibits the spontaneous nucleation of actin filaments(4Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A.

Nature. 1985; 314: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), profilin prevents PLCγ1 from hydrolyzing PIP2(7Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, when PLCγ1 is phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues, such as it occurs when extracellular growth factors bind to and activate receptor tyrosine kinases, it is able to overcome the protective effects of profilin and hydrolyze PIP2(8Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

Since PIP2 binding to profilin precludes the formation of profilin-actin complexes, one can conjecture that in resting cells, PIP2 sequesters profilin from actin and that upon growth factor-induced cell activation, profilin is released from PIP2 by the hydrolytic actions of phosphorylated PLCγ1 and diffuses freely to the actin cytoskeleton, where it then exerts effects as a regulator of actin polymerization. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate poly-L-proline phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate phospholipase C dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis globular filamentous 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate. How PIP2 is able to displace actin so effectively remains unclear, and indeed, efforts to localize a binding site for PIP2 on profilin have been supplanted until only recently by the more extensive efforts to identify the binding site for actin. The quest for the latter began as early as 1982 with biochemical studies involving peptidases applied to actin(9Malm B. Larsson H. Lindberg U. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 569-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas the first mention of a putative binding site for PIP2 on profilin did not occur until 1991 when Pollard and Rimm (10Pollard T.D. Rimm D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) noted that the charge differences between Acanthamoeba profilin-I and -II occur between residues 24 and 66 (corresponding to residues 25-69 of human profilin) and that a polylysine region exists between residues 80 and 115 (corresponding to residues 88-126 of human profilin). These regions were suspected to be involved in PIP2 binding because first, positively charged residues are assumed to be involved in the binding of acidic head groups of PIP2 and second, the more positively charged isoform, profilin-II, has ~100 times greater affinity for PIP2(11Machesky L.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Pollard T.D. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A year later, Yu et al.(12Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implicated the region spanning residues 126-136 of human profilin as a binding site for PIP2 by proposing the sequence KXXXXXXHXRR to be a modification of the KXXXKXKK and KXXXXKXRR motifs of gelsolin, which by themselves bind to PIP2(12Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These motifs are also found in CapG, villin, cofilin, and the PLC family(12Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all of which bind PIP2. Another region was implicated by Raghunathan et al.(13Raghunathan V. Mowery P. Rozycki M. Lindberg U. Schutt C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), who used fluorescence spectroscopy to show that binding of profilin to PIP2 resulted in marked fluorescence quenching of Tyr-3 and Tyr-31. However, they also showed through circular dichroism spectroscopy that upon binding to PIP2, profilin undergoes a significant conformational change involving an increase in α-helical content from a base line of 5% to one as high as 35%. This being true, it is difficult to know whether the changes in the fluorescence of Tyr-3 and Tyr-31 are due simply to the proximity of a binding site or due to local conformational changes transmitted from a distant binding site. Finally, Vinson et al.(14Vinson V.K. Archer S.J. Lattman E.E. Pollard T.D. Torchia D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in elucidating the three-dimensional structure for Acanthamoeba profilin-I, proposed a PIP2-binding site consisting of the loop between β-strands 1 and 2, the loop between β-strands 6 and 7, and the region immediately after α-helix 2 (see Fig. 1B). However, Fedorov et al.(15Fedorov A.A. Magnus K.A. Graupe M.H. Lattman E.E. Pollard T.D. Almo S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8636-8640Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) recently showed through calculations of electrostatic surface potentials that a second distinct region of positive potential present on Acanthamoeba profilin-II but markedly less so on profilin-I is located on the opposite side of the protein. The positively charged residues here include Arg-66, Arg-71, Lys-80, Lys-81, and Lys-115, which are analogous to the residues Lys-69, Arg-74, Arg-88, Lys-90, and Lys-125 of human profilin(16Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C.W. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). To further define the importance of the residues proposed to be involved in PIP2 binding, we mutated single base pairs distributed across the human profilin cDNA sequence, corresponding to the substitution of several conserved residues on both terminal α-helices (Tyr-6, Asp-8, Leu-10, His-119, Gly-121, Lys-125), basic residues implicated by Vinson et al.(14Vinson V.K. Archer S.J. Lattman E.E. Pollard T.D. Torchia D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Lys-25, Lys-53), and basic residues located on the second region of positive potential identified by Fedorov et al.(15Fedorov A.A. Magnus K.A. Graupe M.H. Lattman E.E. Pollard T.D. Almo S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8636-8640Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Arg-74, Arg-88, Lys-90). Here, we report the results of our testing these mutations for the effects they have on profilin's ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLCγ1, an effect that has been shown previously to correlate precisely with profilin's affinity for PIP2(11Machesky L.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Pollard T.D. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We found that most of the mutations did not significantly alter profilin's ability to inhibit PLCγ1 activity. However, the mutation D8A caused a marked increase of PLCγ1 inhibition, and R88L resulted in a marked decrease of PLCγ1 inhibition. Based on our work, we propose that a crucial binding site for PIP2 on human profilin is contained within five amino acids of residue 88 since this stretch, by itself, inhibits PLCγ1 activity as well as the entire molecule of profilin. The cDNA for human profilin was obtained from David J. Kwiatkowski (17Kwiatkowski D.J. Bruns G.A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5910-5915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into pTrc99A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), a prokaryotic expression vector. To generate mutant profilins, single amino acid substitutions were introduced through single base pair changes using a previously described method for site-directed mutagenesis involving mutagenic primers, T4 DNA polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase(18Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Identities of the resultant mutants were then confirmed by sequence analysis using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit. Before expressing the profilins in bacteria, the cDNAs were first sublcloned into pMW172 (constructed by Michael Way) to allow higher levels of expression. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with plasmids containing the appropriate cDNAs were grown in 1-liter cultures to an optical density (at λ = 600 nm) of 0.6-0.7, at which point expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside. The cells were incubated for an additional 4 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Subsequent steps were performed at 0-4°C. To each cell pellet, 100 ml of lysing buffer (6 M urea, 145 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 15 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 30 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride) was added, and the cells were resuspended by sonication (Sonifier 450, Branson). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min and dialyzed (Spectra/Por membrane; molecular weight cutoff, 6-8,000) for 72 h against three changes of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.1, supplemented with 0.5 mM DTT. The dialysates were then filtered through glass wool and applied separately to a 20-ml column of PLP-linked Sepharose, to which profilins are known to bind with high specificity(19Tanaka M. Shibata H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For each profilin mutant, the column was washed with 200 ml of PLP buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M glycine, 0.01 mM DTT), followed by 100 ml of PLP buffer containing 3.5 M urea. Each profilin was then eluted with 100 ml of PLP buffer containing 7.5 M urea(20Kaiser D.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Levine B.A. Pollard T.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 14: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fractions of 3.2 ml each were tested for protein content using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Kinetics Reader EL312e, Bio-Tek Instruments), and the purity of profilins was checked by SDS-PAGE(21Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The appropriate fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 72 h against three changes of 2 mM Tris, pH 8.5, supplemented with 0.5 mM DTT. Final profilin concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay after calibration to wild-type human profilin standards determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of A0.015μM-1 cm-1(22Tseng P.C.-H. Runge M.S. Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle(23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-actin was separated from residual F-actin by size-exclusion chromatography on a Bio-Gel P60 gel column after dialysis against G buffer (2 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM CaCl2) and used within 7 days. Some of the actin was labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide (24Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and stored in G buffer. Recombinant phosphoinositide-specific rat brain PLCγ1 was purified from bacterial cell extracts using a three-amino acid C-terminal tag (Glu-Glu-Phe) engineered into the PLCγ1 cDNA(25Koblan K.S. Schaber M.D. Edwards G. Gibbs J.B. Pompliano D.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The recombinant PLCγ1 displayed calcium dependence, pH sensitivity, and substrate specificity indistinguishable from that of wild-type bovine PLCγ1. Synthetic decapeptides cross-linked to an octabranched matrix core were obtained from Research Genetics(26Finkel T. Theriot J.A. Dise K.R. Tomaselli G.F. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1510-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The anti-human profilin antibody (JH44) was a generous gift from Donald A. Kaiser and Thomas D. Pollard(26Finkel T. Theriot J.A. Dise K.R. Tomaselli G.F. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1510-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Unilamellar vesicles containing 7 μM PIP2, trace [3H]PIP2, and 50 μM phosphatidylethanolamine were prepared by sonication in deionized water as described(7Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The unilamellar character of vesicles was confirmed by incubating the vesicles with PLCγ1 for extended periods of time (24-48 h) to show that ~50% of the total cpm translocated from the lipid phase to the aqueous phase (see below). To measure hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLCγ1, IP3 production was measured after incubating PIP2 vesicles with 25 nM recombinant PLCγ1 and varying concentrations of profilin for 15 min at 22°C in 100 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 1.4 mM Tris, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 70 mM KCl, 0.4 mM EGTA, and 0.35 mM DTT. IP3 produced in the absence of profilin was measured in triplicate and defined as 100% activity. The relative PLCγ1 activity obtained in the presence of various profilin concentrations was equal to IP3 production in the presence of profilin, expressed as a percentage of the mean IP3 production in the absence of profilin, for each profilin concentration(7Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Since the Michaelis constant, Km, for PLCγ1 is much greater (by at least 50-fold) than the substrate concentration, [S], of PIP2(7Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 27Baldassare J.J. Henderson P.A. Fisher G.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6010-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the Michaelis-Menten equation V = Vmax[S]/([S] + Km) simplifies to V = k[S], where k is a proportionality constant. Thus, the relative PLCγ1 activity in the presence of profilin is simply S/ST, where S is the concentration of PIP2 pentamers not bound to profilin and ST is the total PIP2 pentamer concentration. By substituting in the equation S = (1/2)([(PT - ST+ Kd)2+ 4PTST]1/2 - (PT - ST+ Kd)), where PT is the total profilin concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant for the profilin-PIP2 complex, a value for Kd can be calculated for each data point by solving the simplified equation Kd = A(PT/(1 - A) - ST), where A is the relative PLCγ1 activity expressed as a fraction of unity. The concentration of F-actin was determined from the fluorescence of 10% pyrenyliodoacetamide-labeled actin using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 407 nm(28Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To measure the steady-state concentrations of F-actin, labeled actin was polymerized, diluted, and allowed to depolymerize overnight at 22°C in the absence or presence of profilins(29Tobacman L.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before measuring fluorescence, the samples were degassed for 1 h. Steady-state experiments were performed in G buffer containing 50 mM KCl and 1 mM MgCl2. To initiate polymerization for the time course experiments, 2 mM MgCl2 was added to G buffer containing 10 μM labeled G-actin. The concentration of G-actin complexed with eATP was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometry using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 410 nm(30Waechter F. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Nishida E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1160-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in G buffer containing 1.5 μM G-actin, 3 μM CaCl2, and 3 μM ATP. Time 0 corresponds to the addition of 75 μM eATP. Profilin is known not to alter the fluorescence of eATP(21Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of wild-type profilin and R88L were made in 2 mM Tris, pH 8.5, supplemented with 0.5 mM DTT, and added to 80 μl of PLP-linked Sepharose for a total volume of 160 μl, with and without 7.5 M urea. After incubation with mixing for 30 min at 4°C, the concentration of unbound profilin was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay as the protein concentration in the supernatant after centrifugation. To assess the sensitivity of proteins to trypsin, 50 μl of either 12 μM wild-type profilin or R88L was added to 5.5 μl of washed insoluble trypsin attached to beaded agarose (Sigma) and was incubated in a shaker at room temperature. Samples of 10 μl each were removed at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 min and centrifuged. The supernatants (5 μl of each) were tested by SDS-PAGE using both Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis. By designing mutagenic primers to induce single base pair changes in the cDNA sequence for human profilin, we generated 11 mutant clones of profilin to which we assigned the names Y6F, D8A, L10R, K25Q, K53I, R74L, R88L, R88L/K90E, H119D, G121D, and K125Q, according to the amino acid altered (17Kwiatkowski D.J. Bruns G.A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5910-5915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its position in the wild-type sequence, and the amino acid substituted in its place. The locations of these mutations in the primary amino acid sequence as well as on the three-dimensional map for human profilin are shown in Fig. 1, along with excerpts of sequencing gels verifying their identities. Milligram amounts of highly pure wild-type and mutant profilins were eluted from the PLP-Sepharose column with 7.5 M urea, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Only in the case of L10R did the column fail to bind a 14.5-kDa protein. Western blot analysis in this case revealed the presence of a high molecular mass protein (~120 kDa) in the bacterial extract that was not retained by the column but which cross-hybridized with a polyclonal antibody specific for human profilin (data not shown). These findings suggested that the L10R mutation may have induced the aggregation of profilin into large, high affinity complexes that were unable to bind PLP. The fact that the remaining mutants were able to bind normally to PLP indicates that the mutations did not induce marked alterations of profilin's structure. Interestingly, the mutants Y6F and K25Q eluted from the column under less stringent conditions (3.5 M urea) (data not shown) than with either the wild-type profilin or any of the other mutant profilins (all of which required 7.5 M urea for elution). These same residues are known to localize to the PLP-binding site on human profilin(32Björkegren C. Rozycki M. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Metzler W.J. Bell A.J. Ernst E. Lavoie T.B. Mueller L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4620-4625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of profilins to inhibit PLCγ1 activity has been previously shown to be directly proportional to the affinity of profilins for PIP2(11Machesky L.M. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Pollard T.D. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 937-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine which of the residues in question are important for the profilin-PIP2 interaction, we tested the mutants Y6F, D8A, K25Q, K53I, R74L, R88L, H119D, and G121D for their relative abilities to inhibit PLCγ1 activity. All except two mutants exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition that was indistinguishable from that of wild-type human profilin (Fig. 3A), corresponding to a best-fit dissociation constant, Kd, of ~0.21 μM between profilin and PIP2, assuming a stochiometric ratio of 1:5(7Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D. Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The mutants that showed altered interactions with PLCγ1 were D8A and R88L (Table 1). The mutant D8A demonstrated increased inhibition of PLCγ1 activity, corresponding to a best-fit Kd of ~25 nM, and the mutant R88L showed lessened inhibition of PLCγ1 activity, corresponding to a best-fit Kd of ~0.60 μM (Fig. 3A). The reason for the increased affinity demonstrated by D8A is unclear but is presumably charge-related and may suggest involvement of α-helix 1 in profilin's binding to PIP2. To rule out the possibility that a separate direct interaction between PLCγ1 and the profilins accounts for these alterations in activity, we have shown that PLCγ1 and profilin do not coprecipitate under a variety of conditions (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In light of the work by Fedorov et al.(15Fedorov A.A. Magnus K.A. Graupe M.H. Lattman E.E. Pollard T.D. Almo S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8636-8640Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we were particularly interested in the reduction of profilin's affinity for PIP2 caused by mutating residue 88 since this result suggests that a region near the loop between β-strands 5 and 6 may be involved in the binding of PIP2. To assess the importance of this region, we tested three different synthetic decapeptides containing sequences that matched that of three non-overlapping 10-amino acid stretches in the wild-type human profilin sequence for their abilities to inhibit PLCγ1 activity. Besides selecting the peptide segment surrounding residue 88, we also selected segments implicated by Vinson et al.(14Vinson V.K. Archer S.J. Lattman E.E. Pollard T.D. Torchia D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and Yu et al.(12Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as being involved in PIP2 binding. The only decapeptide that had a significant effect on PLCγ1 activity was that which corresponded to the segment centered around residue 88, spanning residues 83-92 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the degree of inhibition observed was comparable to that of wild-type profilin (Kd~0.63 ± 0.13 μM, calculated from peptide concentrations greater than 1 μM). Thus, it appears that this 10-amino acid segment, by itself, could account for much of profilin's ability to inhibit PLCγ1 activity. These data implicate this region of human profilin (residues 83-92) as a key binding site for PIP2. Since residue 88 also lies in the binding site for actin(9Malm B. Larsson H. Lindberg U. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 569-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C.W. Lindberg U.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7864-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether mutating residue 88 also induced changes in profilin's interactions with actin. We measured the effects of R88L on the critical concentration of actin, the rate of actin polymerization, and the rate of actin monomer nucleotide exchange. While wild-type profilin decreased the steady-state concentration of F-actin, no difference between steady-state concentrations of F-actin in the absence and presence of R88L was detectable by our assay at the concentrations tested (Fig. 4A). Correlated with this observation was the fact that R88L inhibited the time course of actin polymerization by much less than wild-type profilin (Fig. 4B). When we tested the effect of R88L on the rate of actin monomer adenosine nucleotide exchange, we found its effect to be greatly diminished compared to that of wild-type profilin, such that at least 25 times higher concentrations o"

Sequence analysis demonstrates that both known (e.g. peripherin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, myelin P0) and novel identifiable transcripts (e.g. C-protein-like, synuclein-like, villin-like) are present in the library. Half of the transcripts (23Ninkina N.N. Stevens G.E. Wood J.N. Richardson W.D.

Of the DRG-specific transcripts, 12 contain putative open reading frames that show no identity with known proteins. The construction of such a subtractive library thus provides us with both known and novel markers, and identifies new predicted DRG-specific proteins.

Sequence analysis demonstrates that both known (e.g. peripherin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, myelin P0) and novel identifiable transcripts (e.g. C-protein-like, synuclein-like, villin-like) are present in the library. Half of the transcripts (23Ninkina N.N. Stevens G.E. Wood J.N. Richardson W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3175-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) are undetectable in liver, kidney, heart, spleen, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. Of the DRG-specific transcripts, 12 contain putative open reading frames that show no identity with known proteins. The construction of such a subtractive library thus provides us with both known and novel markers, and identifies new predicted DRG-specific proteins. In addition, the DRG-specific clones provide probes to define the regulatory elements that specify peripheral nervous-system-specific gene expression."

Cell surface receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcγR) are expressed on most hematopoietic cells, and through the binding of IgG they play a key role in homeostasis of the immune system and host protection against infection. Three structurally related but functionally distinct classes of FcγR have been defined: FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII(1Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv.

The two Ig-like domain extracellular region of FcγRII is structurally conserved in all of the Ig superfamily leukocyte FcRs (including FcγRI, FcγRIII, Fc∊RI, and FcαRI) and presumably represents an Ig-interactive motif(13Allen J.M.

The elucidation of the molecular basis of FcR-Ig interactions is fundamental for understanding the mechanisms by which these receptors mediate biological functions such as activation of inflammatory cells, induction of cytokine release, and destruction of pathogens. In previous studies we utilized chimeric Fc receptors to identify the IgG binding region of human FcγRII(18Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J.

Rev. 1992; 125: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Chimeric FcγRII/Fc∊RI α chain receptors were used to demonstrate that the second extracellular domain of FcγRII was responsible for the binding of IgG, with a single direct binding region located between residues Asn154 and Ser161. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Asn154-Ser161 region identified 5 residues as playing crucial roles in the binding of human and mouse IgG1 by FcγRII: Ile155, Gly156, Leu159, Phe160, and Ser161(20Hulett M.D. Witort E.

However, despite the direct demonstration of only a single region involved in the binding of IgG, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other regions of FcγRII contribute to binding. A genetic polymorphism of human FcγRIIa, the so called “responder/non-responder” system, results in an amino acid substitution in domain 2 at residue 131 (Arg → His), which has been shown to influence the binding of mouse IgG1 and human IgG2(21Tax W.J.M.

Our previous molecular modeling studies of FcγRII domain 2 (wherein the Asn154-Ser161 binding region was located to an exposed loop region; the F/G loop) suggest that these functionally important amino acid changes are situated in the B/C and C‘/E loops (containing residues 116 and 131, respectively), which are juxtaposed to the F/G loop (contains residue 161) at or near the interface with domain 1(20Hulett M.D. Witort E.

Furthermore, the studies using chimeric FcγRII/Fc∊RI receptors have identified three regions in the structurally homologous receptor, Fc∊RI, capable of directly binding IgE: residues 87-128, 130-135, and 154-161, which encompass the B/C, C‘/E, and F/G loops respectively(1Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M.

Taken together, these findings suggest that the B/C and C‘/E loops of FcγRII may in addition to the F/G loop also play a role in the binding of IgG by FcγRII. Also of interest is that while the role of domain 2 of FcγRII in Ig binding has been clearly defined, a role for domain 1 of FcγRII has not been determined. However, domain 1 of Fc∊RI, although demonstrated to not have a direct role in IgE binding, has been shown to play an important role in high affinity binding (18Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C.

The possibility that domain 1 and the B/C or C‘/E loop regions of domain 2 also contribute to the binding of IgG1 by FcγRII is addressed herein, using both chimeric receptor and site-directed mutagenesis strategies. Chimeric FcγRII/Fc∊RI α chain or mutant FcγRII cDNAs were constructed by splice overlap extension (SOE) PCR (27Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullin J.K. Pearse L.R.

Two PCRs were used to amplify the FcγRII-Fc∊RI or FcγRII fragments to be spliced together. The reactions were performed on 100 ng of the FcγRIIaNR cDNA in the presence of 500 ng of each oligonucleotide primer, 1.25 mM dNTPs, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, and 1.5 mM MgCl2 using 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Amplitaq, Perkin-Elmer) for 25 amplification cycles. A third PCR reaction was performed to splice the two fragments and amplify the spliced product and included 100 ng of each fragment (purified by size fractionation through an agarose gel) (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The chimeric FcγRII/Fc∊RI α chain receptors were generated as follows. For chimera γ109-116∊, oligonucleotide pairs NR1 + CHM10 and CHM09 + EG5 were used to produce two fragments, which were spliced together using oligonucleotides NR1 and EG5. For chimera γ130-135∊, oligonucleotide pairs NR1 + PM12 and PM11 + EG5 followed by NR1 and EG5.

Each cDNA was engineered in the PCRs to have an EcoRI site at its 5′ end (the 5′-flanking oligonucleotide primer NR1 containing an EcoRI recognition site) and a SalI site at the 3′ end (the 3′-flanking oligonucleotide primer EG5, containing a SalI recognition site), which enabled the cDNAs to be cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pKC3. The nucleotide sequence integrities of the chimeric cDNAs were determined by dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 1794-1803PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse IgE anti-TNBS mAb (TIB142) was produced from a hybridoma cell line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD); the mouse IgG1 anti-TNBS mAb (A3) was produced from a hybridoma cell line, which was a gift of Dr. A. Lopez(33Lopez A.F. Strath M. Sanderson C.J. Immunology. 1983; 48: 503-509PubMed Google Scholar). Human IgG1 myeloma protein was purified from the serum of a myeloma patient as described(34Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkins C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Human IgG1 oligomers were prepared by chemical cross-linking using S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride (Sigma) and N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) (Pierce) as follows: hIgG1 myeloma protein (5 mg at 10 mg/ml) in phosphate buffer (0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl) was treated with a 5-fold molar excess of SPDP in dioxine for 30 min. Excess reagents were removed by dialysis into phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, 2 mM EDTA. The S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride-modified hIgG1 was treated with 200 μl of hydroxylamine (1 mM in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0) for 30 min and then mixed with SPDP-modified hIgG1 (1:1 molar ratio) and incubated for a further hour. The reaction was terminated with N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) added to a final concentration of 6.6 mM(35Pietersz, G. A., Kanellos, J., McKenzie, I. F. C., Cancer Res., 48, 4469–4476.Google Scholar). All reactions were performed at room temperature. Dimeric hIgG1 was purified from monomeric and oligomeric hIgG1 by size fractionation chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 HR (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Transfections were performed using a transient expression system. COS-7 cells (30-50% confluent per 5 cm2 Petri dish) were transfected with FcR cDNA expression constructs by the DEAE-dextran method(36Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with a transfection mixture (1 ml/5 cm2 dish) consisting of 5-10 mg/ml DNA, 0.4 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Pharmacia), and 1 mM chloroquine (Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories, Australia) containing 10% (v/v) Nuserum (Flow Laboratories), for 4 h. The transfection mixture was then removed, and cells were treated with 10% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline (7.6 mM Na2HPO4, 3.25 mM NaH2PO4, 145 mN NaCl) pH 7.4 for 2 min, washed, and returned to fully supplemented culture medium for 48-72 h before use in assays. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Australia), and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Koch Light Ltd., United Kingdom). The binding of immune complexes by COS-7 cells following transfection with chimeric or mutant receptor cDNAs was determined using two approaches: erythrocyte-antibody rosetting or direct binding of dimeric hIgG1. For erythrocyte-antibody rosetting, COS-7 cell monolayers transfected with FcR expression constructs were incubated with antibody-sensitized erythrocytes (EA complexes), prepared by coating sheep red blood cells with trinitrobenzene sulfonate (Fluka Chemika, Switzerland) and then sensitizing these cells with mouse IgG1 or IgE anti-trinitrobenzene sulfonate mAb(37Parish C.R. Hayward J.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1974; 187: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two ml of 2% EAs (v/v) were added per 5-cm2 dish of transfected cells and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. Plates were then centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min and placed on ice for 30 min. Unbound EAs were removed by washing with L-15 medium modified with glutamine (Flow Laboratories) and containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. For direct binding of dimeric hIgG1, COS-7 cells transfected with FcR expression constructs were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in L-15 medium, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells in 50-μl aliquots were incubated with 50-μl serial dilutions of 125I-dimeric hIgG1 for 120 min at 4°C. 125I-Dimeric Ig was prepared by the chloramine-T method as described (38Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 328Google Scholar) and shown to compete equally with unlabeled dimeric Ig in binding to Fc receptor expressing COS-7 cells. Cell bound 125I-dimeric IgG1 was determined following centrifugation of cells through a 3:2 (v/v) mixture of dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate oils (Fluka Chemika), and cell bound 125I-dimer was determined. Nonspecific dimer binding was determined by assaying on mock transfected cells and subtracted from total binding to give specific dimeric IgG1 bound. Levels of cell surface FcγRII expression were determined using the anti-FcγRII mAb 8.2, shown to bind distantly to the binding site (32Ierino F.L. Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1794-1803PubMed Google Scholar) and used to correct for variable cell surface receptor expression between the mutant FcγRII COS-7 cell transfectants. The binding of mAb 8.2 was determined in a direct binding assay as described for the human IgG1 dimer binding assays. Molecular modeling of the extracellular region of hFcγRIIa (domains 1 and 2) was performed using the Homology and Discover modules of the InsightII software package of Biosym Technologies, using the crystal structure of domains 1 and 2 of CD4 (Brookhaven protein data base file pdb2cd4.ent) essentially as described previously for domain 2(20Hulett M.D. Witort E. Brinkworth R.I. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15287-15293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were used to determine the location of β-sheets, with other regions defined as loops. Since the N-terminal A-strand of FcγRII-D1 is longer than that of CD4-1, the Bence-Jones protein REI (pdb2rei.ent) V domain was chosen as a template for the first 7 residues after superimposition of REI on CD4-1. A search of the Brookhaven protein crystallographic data base was then carried out using the Loop Search command to find suitable loop templates for the remaining pieces (see below). In some cases, this required a re-evaluation of the structurally conserved residues of β-sheets. In two cases, the A/B loop of domain 1 and the E/F loop of domain 2, the coordinates were assigned directly from the equivalent loops in the CD4 template and hence are called “designated loops.” After construction of the two disulfide bonds and elimination of severe atomic overlaps (“bumps”), the structure was minimized using the Discover module to a maximum r.m.s. derivative of 0.0001 using 2000 steepest descents and up to 25,000 conjugate gradients, with the backbone atoms of structurally conserved regions fixed. The operation was repeated with no fixed atoms. The final structure was checked for poor φ, ψ, and ω angles and residues of high energy. The loops used in the model are detailed as follows. Domain 1: A/B, (EDS) modeled to GDT from 2cd4 (designated loop); B/C loop (SPESD) modeled to PGTSN of 2mev, starting at residue I169 (including the previous structurally conserved region), deviation 1.25, r.m.s. deviation 2.75; C/C‘ (NGN) modeled to DDT of 2hla, starting at residue A63, deviation 0.34 r.m.s. deviation 0.83; C‘/E (THTQP) modeled to KKTKL of 1fcb, starting at residue B337, deviation 0.59 r.m.s. deviation 1.76; E/F (NNNDS) modeled to FTDTF of 3cla, starting at 159, deviation 0.97, r.m.s. deviation 1.26; F/G (GQTSLS) modeled to VIHGKE of 1bbp, starting at residue B55, deviation 0.49, r.m.s. deviation 1.25. For domain 2: A/B (QTPNLEFQEG) modeled to NSDTHLLQGQ of 2cd4 starting at residue 89, deviation 2.06, r.m.s. deviation 2.26; B/C (SWKDK) modeled to NEHDE of 2rr1, starting at residue I222, deviation 0.73, r.m.s. deviation 1.16; C/C‘ (NGKSQ) modeled to AATVNV of 2tln, starting at residue A162, deviation 0.22, r.m.s. deviation 0.766; C‘/E (RLDOP) modeled to 2mev, starting at residue 12, deviation 0.96, r.m.s. deviation 1.98; E/F (ANHSHS) modeled to LELQDS of 2cd4, (designated loop); F/G (NIGYTLF) modeled to AVSDHEA of 2hla, starting at residue A186, deviation 0.67, r.m.s. deviation 1.91; sequence AVSDHEA. In order to determine the roles of domain 1 (residues 1-86) and the B/C (residues 109-116) or C‘/E (residues 130-135) loop regions of domain 2 in the binding of IgG by FcγRII, chimeric receptors were generated whereby each of these regions in FcγRII were replaced with the equivalent regions of the Fc∊RI α chain. Chimeric receptor cDNAs were constructed by SOE PCR, subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pKC3, and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. The binding of IgG immune complexes to the chimeric receptors was determined by both EA rosetting and the binding of dimeric hIgG1. The distinction between the two assays lies in the nature of the immune complexes; EAs comprise large multivalent immune complexes capable of binding with high avidity to FcγRII and were used to qualitatively assess Ig binding of the chimeric receptors, whereas dimeric Igs represent the smallest complexes able to bind FcγRII with readily detectable affinity and were used in the quantitation of Ig binding. The substitution of the FcγRII domain 1 with that of the Fc∊RI α chain produced a receptor (designated D1∊D2γ), which as expected retained the capacity to bind the multivalent IgG-EA complexes, as did the wild-type FcγRII (Fig. 1a). However, in contrast to the wild-type receptor the D1∊D2γ chimeric FcR did not bind dimeric-hIgG1 at any concentration (Fig. 2). This suggests that domain 1 is necessary for optimal Ig binding as demonstrated by the binding of highly substituted but not small dimeric complexes.Figure 2:Human IgG1 dimer binding of chimeric Fc receptors. Radiolabeled dimeric human IgG1 was titrated on COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type FcγRII (▪), an expressible form of the Fc∊RI α chain (□), or the following chimeric receptor cDNAs: D1∊D2γ (•), γ109-116∊ (Ε), γ130-135∊ ( ).

It has been shown in these systems that the mammary gland factor (MGF) is implicated in the activation of the β-casein gene promoter. In the present study, we determined the relationship between known agents that affect casein gene expression and MGF activity using the properties of rabbit primary mammary epithelial cells to respond to PRL alone, when cultured in chemically defined medium. We demonstrate that MGF is rapidly activated by PRL alone or by human growth hormone, a natural ligand of many PRL receptors (PRL-Rs), in the cytoplasm and accumulated in the nucleus. The MGF activation by PRL occurred in the absence of endogenous extracellular matrix, a condition where casein synthesis is known to be markedly reduced. Different inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases, which have been shown to reduce casein mRNA synthesis, but not of protein kinase C, decrease the MGF activity. A tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium pervanadate, induced two GAS-binding complexes related to MGF and STAT1.

The affinity for Ca2+ is too low to be determined by direct methods (KCa > 10 mM). Ca2+- and Zn2+-binding can be followed by optical methods: the Trp-45 fluorescence is high in the metal-free form and addition of Zn2+ and Ca2+, but not of Mg2+, leads to a 4-fold quenching. Ca2+ and Zn2+ promote also quite similar conformational changes in the Tyr and Trp environment as monitored by difference spectrophotometry. Fluorescence titrations with Zn2+ confirmed that there is one set of high affinity binding sites with a [Zn2+]0.5 of 8 μM and a Hill coefficient of 1.3. Binding of Zn2+ to a second set of low affinity sites induces protein precipitation. Fluorescence titrations with Ca2+ confirmed the very low affinity of S100A3 for this ion with a [Ca2+]0.5 of 30 mM and slight negative cooperativity. Mg2+ has no effect on this binding curve. Of the 10 Cys residues in S100A3, 5 only are free thiols, and accessible to 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); they display a high reactivity in the metal-free and Ca2+ form, but a 20-fold lowered reactivity in the Zn2+ form of S100A3. Ca2+-binding promotes the formation of a solvent-accessible hydrophobic surface as monitored by the 60-fold fluorescence increase of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate, whereas Zn2+ has no noticeable influence.

https://openalex.org/W2049140233,"3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) is widely used to generate nitric oxide (NOx˙) and superoxide radical (O). The effect of SOD on the toxicity of SIN-1 is complex, depending on what is the ultimate species responsible for toxicity. SIN-1 (<1 mM) was only slightly toxic to HepG2 cells. Copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) or manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) increased the toxicity of SIN-1. Catalase abolished, while sodium azide potentiated, this toxicity, suggesting a key role for H2O2 in the overall mechanism. Depletion of GSH from the HepG2 cells also potentiated the toxicity of SIN-1 plus SOD. Although Me2SO, sodium formate, and mannitol had no protective effect, iron chelators, thiourea and urate protected the cells against the SIN-1 plus Cu,Zn-SOD-mediated cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic effect of Cu,Zn-SOD but not Mn-SOD, showed a biphasic dose response being most pronounced at lower concentrations (10-100 units/ml). In the presence of SIN-1, Mn-SOD increased accumulation of H2O2 in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, Cu,Zn-SOD increased H2O2 accumulation from SIN-1 at low but not high concentrations of the enzyme, suggesting that high concentrations of the Cu,Zn-SOD interacted with the H2O2. EPR spin trapping studies demonstrated the formation of hydroxyl radical from the decomposition of H2O2 by high concentrations of the Cu,Zn-SOD. The cytotoxic effect of the NO donors SNAP and DEA/NO was only slightly enhanced by SOD; catalase had no effect. Thus, the oxidants responsible for the toxicity of SIN-1 and SNAP or DEA/NO to HepG2 cells under these conditions are different, with H2O2 derived from O dismutation playing a major role with SIN-1. These results suggest that the potentiation of SIN-1 toxicity by SOD is due to enhanced production of H2O2, followed by site-specific damage of critical cellular sites by a transition metal-catalyzed reaction. These results also emphasize that the role of SOD as a protectant against oxidant damage is complex and dependent, in part, on the subsequent fate and reactivity of the generated H2O2. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) is widely used to generate nitric oxide (NOx˙) and superoxide radical (O).

However, in some studies a bell-shaped dose-response curve for the protective effect of SOD was observed. At low concentrations, SOD was usually protective, but at very high concentrations, its protective effect decreased or was reversed such that SOD potentiated toxicity(16Omar B.A. Gad N.M. Jordan M.C.

J. 1994; 299: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic effects of SIN-1 have been demonstrated in a variety of cell lines(26Lafon-Cazal M. Culcasi M. Gaven F. Pietri S. Bockaert J. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Kröncke K.-D. Brenner H.-H. Rodriguez M.-L. Etzkorn K. Noack E.A. Kolb H. Kolb-Backhofen V. Biochim.

For example, the LD50 for SIN-1 cytotoxicity against Escherichia coli was 0.5 mM(29Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and 1 mM SIN-1 was very toxic to neurons(30Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z.-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.-S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalso J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). SOD had a protective effect against SIN-1 toxicity to cultured neurons (30Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z.-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.-S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalso J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) and to E. coli(29Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), but had no protective effect with rat hepatoma cells(28Ioannidis T. DeGroot H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and SOD actually increased SIN-1 toxicity to Leishmania major(31Assreuy T. Cunha F.Q. Epperlein M. Noronha-Dutra A. O'Donnell C.A. Liew F.Y. Moncada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The effect of SOD on the toxicity of SIN-1 is complex, e.g. if ONOO3 is the cause of toxicity, SOD will be protective since dismutation of O will prevent formation of ONOO3. However, if NO itself is the toxic agent, SOD can potentiate NO toxicity by preventing its reaction with O, thereby elevating steady state concentrations of NO. The role of H2O2, the product of O dismutation by SOD, has generally not been considered as important as nitrogenous metabolites in SIN-1 toxicity. It was of interest that the Cu,Zn-SOD did not provide more than 50% protection against SIN-1 toxicity to E. coli even when added in excess(29Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), perhaps due to the toxicity of H2O2 produced from O dismutation. In the current report, the effect of SOD on SIN-1 cytotoxicity in a human hepatoma liver cell line (HepG2) was determined. It was observed that Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD enhanced SIN-1-mediated cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells, and that this potentiation was due to an increase in H2O2 formation caused by SOD-catalyzed dismutation of the O released from SIN-1. The toxicity of SIN-1 under these reaction conditions and concentrations appeared to be independent of NO or NOx.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSIN-1 and SNAP were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). DEA/NO was from Research Biochemical (Natic, MA). Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes and catalase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Mn-superoxide dismutase from E. coli, benzoate, Me2SO, formate, thiourea, BSO, deferoxamine mesylate, 2,2′-dipyridyl, H2O2, EDTA, and DTPA were from Sigma. Sodium azide was from Aldrich. 5,5-Dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was from Sigma and was purified before use by charcoal treatment to remove paramagnetic impurities.Cell CulturesThe human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (American Type Culture Collection, HB8065) was used for these studies. Cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% PSN antibiotic mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.), and, 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) in 25-cm2 plastic flasks (Corning) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For cytotoxicity experiments, cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/well/0.5 ml of tissue culture medium on 24-well tissue culture plates. After 2 h of incubation and attachment, SIN-1, SOD, as well as other compounds were added and the cells were incubated for the indicated time periods at 37°C. Stock solutions of all compounds were prepared in MEM medium immediately before use. The preparation of solutions and incubation with the HepG2 cells were carried out under protection from light. Cell viability (cytotoxicity) was determined using the Cell Titer 96 non-radioactive cell proliferation/cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega), which is based on the cellular conversion of a tetrazolium salt into a formazan product that can be detected spectrophotometrically(32Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (45530) Google Scholar). GSH levels were determined using the GSH-400 kit assay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI).Determination of H2O2H2O2 generation at different concentrations of SIN-1, in the absence or presence of SOD, was determined by two techniques after a 24-h incubation in tissue culture medium at 37°C in 95% air and 5% CO2 in the absence of cells. In the first method, the H2O2 content was measured by formation of formaldehyde from the oxidation of methanol by the catalase-H2O2 compound I complex(33Hildebrandt A.G. Roots I. Tjoe M. Heinemeyer G. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Incubations contained 100 mM methanol, 1200 units/ml catalase, SIN-1, and tissue culture medium. Reactions were terminated after a 1-h incubation at 37°C by the addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The generation of formaldehyde was determined by the Nash reaction(34Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4090) Google Scholar), and calculation of H2O2 concentration was carried out as described previously(35Kukie E. Cederbaum A.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the second method, the formation of H2O2 was determined by the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed reaction of H2O2 with 4-amino-antipyrine plus 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid. After a 1-h incubation of SIN-1 with the above compounds in tissue culture medium at 37°C, the resulting product was measured spectrophotometrically at 546 nm (28Ioannidis T. DeGroot H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 36Fossati P. Prencipe L. Berti G. Clin. Chem. 1980; 26: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar).EPR MeasurementsThe production of OH from the SOD-catalyzed decomposition of H2O2 was determined by spin trapping with DMPO. MEM containing 100 or 1000 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD or Mn-SOD and 100 mM DMPO was incubated with 80 μM H2O2. The samples were filled in a Varian flat cell and measured within 1 min after addition of H2O2, using a Varian EPR 200 spectrometer operating in the X-band mode. Instrument parameters are indicated in the legends to figures.In separate experiments evaluating iron-catalyzed decomposition of H2O2, 1 mM SIN-1 was co-incubated with either Cu,Zn-SOD (100 or 1000 units/ml) or Mn-SOD (100 or 1000 units/ml) for 24 h at 37°C in the absence of cells. At the end of the incubation period, 100 mM DMPO and 600 mM Me2SO were added and decomposition of H2O2 was initiated by the addition of 40 μM FeSO4. In the presence of Me2SO, OH radicals are converted to CH3 radicals, which were spin-trapped with DMPO (DMPO/CH3 adducts), thus providing a characteristic OH radical fingerprint(37Britigan B.E. Cohen M.S. Rosen G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1987; 41: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The samples were transferred to a EPR flat cell and measured immediately after the addition of the last compound.RESULTSCytotoxicity of SIN-1 to HepG2 CellsThe cytotoxic effect of SIN-1 in the absence or presence of Cu,Zn-SOD to the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line was studied at different SIN-1 and Cu,Zn-SOD concentrations over a 24-h time period (Fig. 1). SIN-1 alone at concentrations of 0.1 or 0.316 mM was not toxic over this time course; some toxicity was observed at 1 mM SIN-1. At the very high concentration of 3 mM, SIN-1 toxicity was pronounced and increased during incubation. The addition of Cu,Zn-SOD potentiated the cytotoxic effect of SIN-1; this is most notable at SIN-1 concentrations of 0.316 and 1 mM (Fig. 1, B and C). Pronounced cytotoxicity was found in the presence of Cu,Zn-SOD plus SIN-1 at concentrations where SIN-1 alone had no effect (0.316 mM) or only a minor effect (1 mM). The potentiation of the cytotoxic effect of SIN-1 by Cu,Zn-SOD increased during incubation. A surprising observation was the finding that in the presence of 0.316 mM SIN-1, the potentiating cytotoxic effect of Cu,Zn-SOD was pronounced at 10 and 100 units of SOD per ml, but decreased as the units of added Cu,Zn-SOD were elevated to 1000 units/ml. In other experiments, 0.316 or 1 mM SIN-1 in the absence and presence of 100 units of Cu,Zn-SOD was preincubated in culture medium in the absence of HepG2 cells for 3 h. The HepG2 cells were added, and cell viability was compared to that of a system in which SIN-1, SOD, and cells were added together at the same time. At all time points tested (2-18 h), the medium “conditioned” by preincubating SIN-1 and Cu,Zn-SOD was considerably more toxic, which suggests accumulation of a stable toxic metabolite produced from the incubation of SIN-1 in the presence of SOD.A more detailed study of the concentration dependence of the cytotoxic effect of Cu,Zn-SOD in the presence of 0.316 mM SIN-1 is shown in Fig. 2. The potentiation of SIN-1 cytotoxicity by Cu,Zn-SOD was biphasic; toxicity increased in a concentration-dependent manner up to 100 units of Cu,Zn-SOD/ml but decreased at higher concentrations (Fig. 2A). Boiled Cu,Zn-SOD did not potentiate the cytotoxicity of SIN-1, and Cu,Zn-SOD in the absence of SIN-1 had no cytotoxic effect (Fig. 2A). Another type of superoxide dismutase, Mn-SOD, also potentiated the cytotoxicity of SIN-1, but in contrast to the Cu,Zn-SOD, the potentiation of SIN-1 cytotoxicity by the Mn-SOD did not decrease at higher concentrations of this isoform (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Effect of SOD on the cytotoxicity of SIN-1 to HepG2 cells. Panel A, effect of catalase and azide on the potentiation of SIN-1 cytotoxicity by Cu,Zn-SOD. Viability of the HepG2 cells was determined after a 24-h incubation with 0.316 mM SIN-1 in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Cu,Zn-SOD. Additions were as follows: SIN-1 (•), SIN-1 plus 0.316 mM azide (▴), SIN-1 plus catalase (200 units/ml) (f), SIN-1 plus boiled Cu,Zn-SOD (▴), Cu,Zn-SOD in the absence of SIN-1 (□).

Results are mean ± S.E. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since SOD increases the rate of production of H2O2 by catalyzing O dismutation, the effect of catalase on the SIN-1 plus SOD toxicity was determined. Catalase (200 units/ml) abolished the SOD-mediated cytotoxic effect of SIN-1 at all Cu,Zn-SOD concentrations tested (Fig. 2A). The possible involvement of intracellular H2O2 and catalase in the cytotoxic effect of SOD plus SIN-1 was studied using sodium azide, an inhibitor of the intracellular catalase. Sodium azide slightly increased the toxicity of SIN-1 in the absence of SOD and further potentiated the cytotoxic effect produced by the combination of SIN-1 plus Cu,Zn-SOD (Fig. 2A).Since H2O2 can be a precursor for formation of OH, the possible involvement of OH-like species in the SOD-mediated cytotoxic effect of SIN-1 was evaluated using OH scavengers. Viability of the HepG2 cells was lowered by 10% by 0.632 mM SIN-1 and by 90% in the presence of SIN-1 plus 100 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD (Fig. 3). Thiourea and uric acid were very effective in protecting the HepG2 cells against this SOD-mediated cytotoxicity. However, other OH scavengers tested, including Me2SO, sodium formate, and mannitol, had no protective effect (Fig. 3). Similarly, ethanol (10-100 mM) and benzoic acid (0.5-10 mM) also had no protective effect (data not shown).Figure 3:Effect of hydroxyl radical scavengers on the potentiation of SIN-1 cytotoxicity by Cu,Zn-SOD. Viability of the HepG2 cells was determined after a 24-h incubation without SIN-1 (C), with 0.632 mM SIN-1 (S), or with 0.632 mM SIN-1 plus 100 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD (SS). All the other incubations contained SIN-1 plus Cu,Zn-SOD plus the indicated antioxidants at the following concentrations: thiourea, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 5 mM, respectively; urate, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mM, respectively; Me2SO, 0.1, 0.316, 1, and 3.16 mM, respectively; formate, 0.1, 0.316, 1, and 3.16 mM, respectively; mannitol, 1, 3.16, and 10 mM, respectively.

The role of transition metals in the SOD plus SIN-1 cytotoxicity was studied using the iron chelators deferoxamine and 2,2′-dipyridyl. As shown in Fig. 4, the cytotoxicity of SOD plus SIN-1 was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by co-incubation of the samples with these two iron chelators. In contrast, EDTA and DTPA had only a small protective effect; the viability of the cells exposed to the SIN-1 plus SOD combination increased from 20% in the absence of chelator to 34 and 39% in the presence of 1 mM EDTA or 1 mM DTPA, respectively (data not shown).Figure 4:Effect of iron chelators on the potentiation of SIN-1 cytotoxicity by Cu,Zn-SOD. Experiments were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 3: control (no SIN-1 added) (C), 0.632 mM SIN-1 (S), and 0.632 mM SIN-1 plus 100 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD, (SS). All the other incubations contained SIN-1 plus Cu,Zn-SOD plus the indicated chelators at the following concentrations: deferoxamine, 0.01, 0.0316, 0.1, and 0.316 mM, respectively; 2,2′-dipyridyl, 0.01, 0.0316, 0.1, and 0.316 mM, respectively. Results are mean ± S.E. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The role of intracellular glutathione in the protection of HepG2 cells against the toxicity of SIN-1 itself or the potentiation of SIN-1 toxicity by SOD was studied using BSO, which inhibits GSH synthesis (38Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSH functions to help remove H2O2 via glutathione peroxidase activity; GSH can also scavenge peroxynitrite (29Brunelli L. Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). BSO at a concentration (0.1 mM) that depleted cellular GSH by 85 to 90% increased the cytotoxic effect of SIN-1 itself from about 5% loss of viability in the absence of BSO treatment to about 50% loss of viability after BSO treatment (Fig. 5). In addition, the BSO treatment also increased the potentiation of SIN-1 cytotoxicity produced by Cu,Zn-SOD (Fig. 5), analogous to the potentiation produced by azide (Fig. 2A).Figure 5:Effect of BSO on SIN-1/SOD cytotoxicity. HepG2 cells were treated without (open bars) or with 0.1 mM BSO (hatched bars) for 2 h, prior to the addition of 0.316 mM SIN-1 plus the indicated concentrations of Cu,Zn-SOD. Viability was determined after a 24-h incubation. Results are mean ± S.E. from three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Production of H2O2The protective effects of catalase and GSH against SIN-1 and especially SIN-1 plus SOD toxicity suggests that H2O2 was involved in the overall mechanism leading to toxicity. The increase in SIN-1 toxicity produced by addition of Cu,Zn-SOD or Mn-SOD could reflect elevated production of H2O2 in the presence of these enzymes. Accumulation of H2O2 from SIN-1 was therefore determined. Measurement of H2O2 by two independent methods showed agreement between the concentrations of accumulated H2O2 by the various reaction systems and the cytotoxicity to the HepG2 cells. For example, the concentration of H2O2 in the SIN-1-containing system increased in the presence of 100 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD as well as in the presence of both 100 and 1000 units/ml Mn-SOD (Fig. 6); this accumulation of H2O2 is consistent with the enhancement of SIN-1 toxicity produced in the presence of these concentrations of SOD. Of interest was the observation that levels of H2O2 produced from SIN-1 were actually lower in the presence of higher concentrations of the Cu,Zn-SOD, but not the Mn-SOD (Fig. 6). The Cu,Zn-SOD potentiation of SIN-1 toxicity was also lower at elevated concentrations of the Cu,Zn-SOD (Fig. 2B). The possibility that catalase was present as a contaminant in the Cu,Zn-SOD preparation, thereby decreasing H2O2 accumulation and SIN-1 toxicity was ruled out by demonstrating that very high concentrations of azide (5 mM), which should completely inhibit any catalase that could be present, did not affect the accumulation of H2O2 produced from SIN-1 in the presence of low and high concentrations of the Cu,Zn-SOD (data not shown).Figure 6:Accumulation of H2O2 from the decomposition of SIN-1. The formation of H2O2 from 0.316 mM SIN-1 was determined by assaying for the oxidation of methanol by the catalase-H2O2 compound I complex as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Experiments were carried out in the absence (blackbar) or presence of either 100 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD or Mn-SOD (empty bars) or 1000 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD or Mn-SOD (hatched bars).

The products of the Fenton reaction (OH radical or Fe(IV) species) were converted by reaction with Me2SO to methyl radicals which were then spin-trapped with DMPO. Only low levels of OH radicals (DMPO/CH3 adducts; aN = 16.24 G; aH = 23.19 G) could be detected (Fig. 7) upon addition of Fe(II) to the samples which were incubated with either SIN-1 alone (traceE) or SIN-1 plus 1000 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD (traceB). Formation of OH was significantly higher in the samples incubated with SIN-1 plus 100 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD, 100 units/ml Mn-SOD, or 1000 units/ml Mn-SOD (Fig. 7, tracesA, C, and D). Production of OH (DMPO/CH3 adduct) therefore paralleled accumulation of H2O2 (Fig. 6).Figure 7:T"
https://openalex.org/W1987910138,"Binding sites for the tissue-specific transcription factor, Pit-1, are required for basal and hormonally induced prolactin gene transcription. Although Pit-1 is phosphorylated in response to several signaling pathways, the mechanism by which Pit-1 contributes to hormonal induction of gene transcription has not been defined. Recent reports suggest that phosphorylation of Pit-1 may not be required for hormonal regulation of the prolactin promoter. Analysis of the contribution of individual Pit-1 binding sites has been complicated due to the fact that some of the elements appear to be redundant. To better understand the role of Pit-1 sites in mediating hormonal regulation of the prolactin gene, we have performed enhancer tests using the three most proximal Pit-1 binding sites of the rat prolactin gene which are designated the 1P, 2P, and 3P sites. The results demonstrate that multimers of the 3P Pit-1 binding site are much more responsive to several hormonal and intracellular signaling pathways than multimers of the 1P or 2P sites. The 3P DNA element was found to contain a consensus binding site for the Ets family of proteins. Mutation of the Ets binding site greatly decreased the ability of epidermal growth factor, phorbol esters, Ras, or the Raf kinase to induce reporter gene activity. Mutation of the Ets site had little effect on basal enhancer activity. In contrast, mutation of the consensus Pit-1 binding site in the 3P element essentially abolished all basal enhancer activity. Overexpression of Ets-1 in GH<sub>3</sub> pituitary cells enhanced both basal and Ras induced activity from the 3P enhancer. These data describe a composite element in the prolactin gene containing binding sites for two different factors and the studies suggest a mechanism by which Ets proteins and Pit-1 functionally cooperate to permit transcriptional regulation by different signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1970336017,"The spectrin-actin-binding domain of protein 4.1 is encoded by a 21-amino acid alternative exon and a 59-amino acid constitutive exon. To characterize the minimal domain active for interactions with spectrin and actin, we functionally characterized recombinant 4.1 peptides containing the 21-amino acid cassette plus varying portions of the 59-amino acid cassette (designated 21.10 to 21.59). Peptide 21.43 was shown fully functional in binary interactions with spectrin (by cosedimentation and coimmunoprecipitation experiments) and in ternary complex formation with spectrin and actin (by an in vitro gelation assay). Further truncation produced peptides incapable of binary interactions but fully competent for ternary complex formation (peptides 21.36 and 21.31), shorter peptides with reduced ternary complex activity and altered kinetics (21.26 and 0.59), and inactive peptides (21.20 and 21.10). Binding studies and circular dichroism experiments suggested that residues 37-43 of the constitutive domain were directly involved in spectrin binding. These data indicate that 4.1-spectrin binary interaction requires the 21amino acid alternative cassette plus the 43 N-terminal residues of the constitutive domain. Moreover, the existence of two possible ternary complex assembly pathways is suggested: one initiated by 4.1-spectrin interactions, and a second by 4.1-actin interactions. The latter may require a putative actin binding motif within the 26 N-terminal residues of the constitutive domain. The spectrin-actin-binding domain of protein 4.1 is encoded by a 21-amino acid alternative exon and a 59-amino acid constitutive exon. To characterize the minimal domain active for interactions with spectrin and actin, we functionally characterized recombinant 4.1 peptides containing the 21-amino acid cassette plus varying portions of the 59-amino acid cassette (designated 21.10 to 21.59). Peptide 21.43 was shown fully functional in binary interactions with spectrin (by cosedimentation and coimmunoprecipitation experiments) and in ternary complex formation with spectrin and actin (by an in vitro gelation assay). Further truncation produced peptides incapable of binary interactions but fully competent for ternary complex formation (peptides 21.36 and 21.31), shorter peptides with reduced ternary complex activity and altered kinetics (21.26 and 0.59), and inactive peptides (21.20 and 21.10). Binding studies and circular dichroism experiments suggested that residues 37-43 of the constitutive domain were directly involved in spectrin binding. These data indicate that 4.1-spectrin binary interaction requires the 21amino acid alternative cassette plus the 43 N-terminal residues of the constitutive domain. Moreover, the existence of two possible ternary complex assembly pathways is suggested: one initiated by 4.1-spectrin interactions, and a second by 4.1-actin interactions. The latter may require a putative actin binding motif within the 26 N-terminal residues of the constitutive domain. INTRODUCTIONThe erythrocyte membrane mechanical properties are determined by a protein skeletal network underlying the lipid bilayer composed mainly of spectrin, actin, protein 4.1, protein 4.9, and adducin(1Liu S.-C. Derick L.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 231-243PubMed Google Scholar). The ternary interaction between spectrin tetramer, actin protofilament, and protein 4.1 forms a highly stable complex (Ka~ 10-12M-2) which imparts mechanical integrity to the membrane(2Ungewickell E. Bennett P.M. Calvert R. Ohanian V. Gratzer W.B. Nature. 1979; 280: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3Ohanian V. Wolfe L.C. John K.M. Pinder J.C. Lux S.E. Gratzer W.B.

Invest. 1986; 78: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). While the different binary interactions between spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1 have been extensively studied, little is known about the mechanism of the ternary complex formation. Binary interaction between spectrin and actin is characterized by a weak binding (Ka~ 5 × 103M-1)(3Ohanian V. Wolfe L.C. John K.M. Pinder J.C. Lux S.E. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4416-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Cohen C.M. Foley S.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6091-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). While the interaction between protein 4.1 and F-actin was initially found to be weak(5Cohen C.M. Foley S.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6091-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), more recent studies suggest a cooperative mechanism for this interaction(6Becker P.S. Schwartz M.A. Morrow J.S. Lux S.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 1Morris, M. B. and Lux, S. E.(1995) Eur. J. Biochem., in press. In contrast, protein 4.1 binds strongly to spectrin (Karanging from ~0.5 to 86 × 106M-1)(7Tyler J.M. Reinhardt B.N. Branton D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7871-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although both subunits of spectrin are required to form a ternary complex with protein 4.1 and actin, only β-spectrin determines the sensitivity of the spectrin-actin interaction with protein 4.1(11Cohen C.M. Langley Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4488-4495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Coleman T.R. Harris A.S. Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Alternative pre-mRNA splicing generates a number of protein 4.1 isoforms in a tissue- and development-specific manner(13Conboy J.G.

Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3310-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This domain is encoded by an alternatively spliced exon (encoding the N-terminal 21-amino acid (aa)) 2The abbreviations used are: aaamino acidDFPdiisopropylfluorophosphatePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideGSTglutathione S-transferaseSABspectrin-actin binding domainPCRpolymerase chain reactionIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyTFEtrifluoroethanol. and a constitutive exon (encoding the C-terminal 59 aa)(17Conboy J.G. Chan J. Mohandas N. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9062-9065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Expression of the 21-aa alternative exon occurs late in erythroid development and is concomitant with major changes in red cell membrane properties(18Chasis J.A. Coulombel L. Conboy J. McGee S. Andrews K. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Chasis J.A. Prenant M. Leung A. Mohandas N. Blood. 1989; 74: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 21-aa cassette is required for binding of protein 4.1 to spectrin, for stabilization of spectrin-actin complex, and for imparting mechanical strength to the membrane(20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Horne W.C. Huang S.-C. Becker P.S. Tang T.K. Benz Jr., E.J. Blood. 1993; 82: 2558-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The aim of the present study is to determine if the 21-aa cassette by itself constitutes the minimal functional domain required for spectrin-actin interactions. To achieve this objective, we have expressed, characterized, and functionally assayed a nested set of truncated peptides designated 21.10 to 21.59, containing the 21-aa plus variable portions of the C terminus of the spectrin-actin-binding domain. Using both cosedimentation and immunoprecipitation methods, we have shown that binding of recombinant peptides to spectrin requires the 21-aa cassette plus at least 43 residues of the 59-aa domain; no interaction with spectrin was detected using shorter peptides. This minimum sequence of 64 aa was also required for the formation of a ternary complex manifested by gelation at physiologically relevant conditions. However, peptides further truncated from the N terminus (e.g. 0.59) or from the C terminus (21.26) could promote gelation of spectrin-actin mixtures at much higher concentrations. These truncated peptides may initiate ternary complex formation via an interaction with actin mediated by a motif within the first 26 residues of the 59-aa domain. The peptides 21.20 and 21.10 had no function whatsoever, suggesting that the alternative 21-aa cassette in itself is inactive. We have thus characterized the sequences in protein 4.1 involved in its interactions with spectrin and actin.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and EquipmentPlasmid expression vector pGEX-KG was provided by Dr. J. Dixon (Purdue University). [35S]Methionine and protein standards for electrophoresis were purchased from Amersham Corp. Polyclonal antibodies anti 21 and anti 10b were provided, respectively, by Drs. J. Chasis (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory) and S. Marchesi (Yale University). Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), dithiothreitol, glutathione-agarose beads, formalin-treated insoluble protein A, Sepharose G-50, myoglobin, cytochrome c, aprotinin, blue dextran, trifluoroacetic acid, acetonitrile, acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle, and 100-μl capillary tubes were obtained from Sigma. Red cell proteins were purified from blood obtained from healthy volunteer donors.Plasmid Constructs with Progressive C-terminal Deletion of the Spectrin-Actin-Binding DomainThe GST fusion constructs were designated GST-YY.XX (YY refers to the alternatively spliced cassette of the construct, XX indicates the number of aa from the N terminus of the constitutive cassette). Construction of peptides GST-21.59, GST-0.59, and GST-19.59 (noted, respectively, 10k21, 10k0, and 10k19 in our earlier report) was described previously(20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated constructs GST-21.26, GST-21.31, and GST-21.36 were prepared by PCR amplification of a cDNA clone encoding the human erythroid SAB of protein 4.1 (residues 407-487) as a template. To generate the desired deletions, the sense primer (5′-GCGAATTCCCATGGAGCCCACAGAAGCTTGGAAG-3′) was used in combination with three antisense primers with the following sequences: 1) GST-21.36, 5′-GGGCGGCCGCTAATCCCATTCACTAGG-3′; 2) GST-21.31, 5′-GGGCGGCCGCTACCGTGGTTCTGGTAC-3′; and 3) GST-21.26, 5′-GGGCGGCCGCTAAGACTCCATGAAGTT-3′. The amplification reaction conditions were: denaturation, 94°C, 30 s; annealing, 50°C, 30 s; extension, 72°C, 1 min; for 35 cycles. The antisense primers incorporated a C-terminal stop-codon. Amplified fragments were cloned into a modified pGEX-KG vector at EcoRI and EagI restriction sites. The constructs GST-21.43, GST-21.20, and GST-21.10 were generated by unidirectional deletion of the GST-21.59 plasmid linearized at the 3′ end of the insert (ExoIII, Mung Bean Nuclease Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).Bacterial ExpressionThe deletion constructs were overexpressed by IPTG induction in Escherichia coli. Recombinant peptides were purified from bacterial lysate supernatant by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography(22Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar, 23Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors DFP (1 mM) and PMSF (1 mM) were used in all peptides preparations. Metabolic labeling of GST constructs was achieved by growing transformant E. coli in the presence of [35S]methionine. For some experiments the GST carrier was removed from the fusion peptides using thrombin(24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Thrombin-cleaved peptides were designated YY.XX. GST constructs and cleaved peptides preparations were subjected, respectively, to 12 and 20% SDS-PAGE(25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205922) Google Scholar), visualized by either Coomassie Blue staining or transferred to nitrocellulose for antibody probing using two polyclonal antisera: 1) an anti 21 raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 21-aa cassette, and 2) an anti 10b recognizing the amino acid sequence MESVPEPRPSEWDK in the 59-aa cassette(26Correas I. Speicher D. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13362-13366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion proteins concentrations were quantified using the 280-nm absorptivity of GST (1.0 cm2/mg). Thrombin-cleaved peptides 280-nm absorptivities were calculated according to their composition in tryptophan and tyrosine residues(27Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar).Reversed-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)Analytical chromatography was performed with a 4.6 × 250-mm, C-4, Vydac 214 TP 54 reversed-phase column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.0(26Correas I. Speicher D. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13362-13366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elution of the peptides was achieved using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.0: 0-25% from 10 to 20 min, and 25 to 45% from 20 to 90 min, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 214 nm. HPLC-purified peptides were either directly analyzed for structural composition by mass spectrometry, or immediately neutralized, partially dried by Speed-Vac, and finally dialyzed against appropriate buffer prior to the analysis of their functional properties.Amino Acid Sequence AnalysisAutomated Edman degradation of HPLC-purified 21.43 and detection of the phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were performed on an automatic sequenator (model 477 A, Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, CA) at the Microchemical Facility at the University of California at Berkeley.Mass Spectrometry Analysis of HPLC Purified FractionsHPLC-purified peptides were analyzed at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute Facility using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a VG Bio-Q quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Biotech/Fisons, Altrincham, United Kingdom). The instrument was controlled, and data were analyzed using a MassLynx® software (VG Biotech/Fisons, Altrincham, U.K.). The extraction cone voltage was 55-65 V, and the source temperature was 60°C. 10-μl aliquots of HPLC fractions were injected into a stream of solvent (50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 4 μl/min. The instrument was scanned from m/z 600 to 1600, and several scans were summed to obtain the final spectrum. Mass scale calibration employed the multiply charged ions from a separate introduction of horse heart myoglobin (average molecular mass 16,952 Da).Purification of Spectrin, Actin, and Protein 4.1Spectrin and protein 4.1 were purified from normal human red blood cells, and actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were stored at 4°C and used within 4 weeks after purification. Protein purity was assessed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Ultrafiltration with Centriprep (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) was used to concentrate proteins or to dialyze proteins against appropriate buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry using published specific absorptivities, i.e. 1.07 cm2/mg at 280 nm for spectrin(28Kam Z. Josephs R. Eisenberg H. Gratzer W.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), 0.64 cm2/mg for F-actin at 290 nm(29Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1670-1676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 0.80 cm2/mg at 280 nm for protein 4.1(7Tyler J.M. Reinhardt B.N. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7034-7039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molar concentrations were calculated using following molecular masses, 526 kDa for spectrin dimer(30Winkelmann J.C. Chang J.-G. Tse W.T. Scarpa A.L. Marchesi V.T. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11827-11832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 66 kDa for protein 4.1(31Conboy J.G. Kan Y.W. Shohet S.B. Mohandas N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9512-9516Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and 42 kDa for actin(32Elzinger M. Collins J.H. Kuehl W.M. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 70: 2687-2691Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar).Analysis of Peptide Interaction with Spectrin by Sucrose Gradient Sedimentation[35S]Methionine metabolically labeled GST constructs or thrombin-cleaved peptides (3-48 μM) were mixed with or without purified spectrin (6 μM) in buffer A (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM DFP, 0.05 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium azide, pH 7.5) to a final volume of 50 μl. The mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 4°C. The reaction products were then layered on top of 10-25% sucrose gradients, separated, and quantified as described previously (20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the ultracentrifugation was performed at 4°C, for 12 h, at 36,000 revolutions/min in a SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA). The data were analyzed using a spectrin binding model previously described(20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled GST-21.43, GST-21.26, and a synthetic 21-aa peptide were added to the mixture of [35S]GST-21.43 (3 μM) and spectrin (6 μM) to study the ability of these peptides to inhibit the interaction of the 21.43 peptide with spectrin.Analysis of Peptide Interaction with Spectrin by CoimmunoprecipitationPurified spectrin was labeled with N-[3H]ethylmaleimide (DuPont-NEN) as described previously(5Cohen C.M. Foley S.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6091-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The [3H]spectrin (2 μM) was mixed in 50-μl volume reactions with various GST fusion peptides (0-1.6 μM) in buffer A for 60 min at 4°C. The anti-GST antibody solution was subsequently added (final concentration: 6.1 or 15 μM) and the incubation continued for 30 min at 4°C. Formalin-treated insoluble protein A was then added (10% v/v), and after 15 min of incubation at 4°C, the reaction tubes were spun for ~15 s in a microfuge at room temperature. The pellets were washed three times with cold buffer A to remove any unbound [3H]spectrin. Pellet and supernatant fractions were counted for radioactivity. For the inhibition studies, [3H]spectrin (2 μM) was preincubated during 60 min, at 4°C, in buffer A, with excess of either full-length protein 4.1, thrombin-cleaved peptides 21.43, 21.26, 0.59, or an anti-21 antibody, prior to the addition of GST-21.43 (1.6 μM) followed by the immunoprecipitation procedure.Low Shear ViscometryThe effect of protein 4.1 and recombinant peptides on the gelation of spectrin-actin mixtures was assayed using a falling ball viscometry method(20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fowler V. Taylor D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 361-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, spectrin samples were preincubated at 27°C for 30 min to form spectrin tetramer. F-actin (14 μM) and spectrin tetramer (1.8 μM) were mixed first, the fusion peptides or cleaved peptides were then added to obtain a final peptide concentration ranging from 0.05 to 350 μM in either 50 or 100 μl total volume of buffer A. The mixture was quickly drawn up into a 100-μl microcapillary tube for a 60-min incubation at 4°C. Subsequently, the tubes were mounted on a ramp (60° incline), and a small steel ball was placed below the meniscus. If the ball did not move under gravity, or if the ball fell a specified distance in a time greater than 100 times the base-line control of spectrin-actin alone, then the state of the mixture was termed a gel. Experiments were repeated twice. The activity of thrombin-cleaved 21.43 and 21.37 was also measured in buffer B used for circular dichroism experiments. For the kinetic study, the time necessary to obtain a sol/gel transition phase was measured as a function of the concentration of thrombin-cleaved peptides. This experiment was conducted in duplicate and repeated twice. Composition of the gelation mixture was analyzed as follows. The gel was centrifuged at 80,000 revolutions/min for 7 min, at 4°C, in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman), and the pellet and supernatant were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The amount of free and bound spectrin and actin species were determined by densitometry using a IS-1000 Digital Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA).Gel FiltrationThe thrombin-cleaved peptide 21.43 preparation (containing both 21.43 and 21.37 species, see Table 1) was analyzed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 100 cm) equilibrated with buffer A at 4°C. The column was calibrated with the standard proteins myoglobin (Mr = 16,900), cytochrome c (Mr = 12,400), and aprotinin (Mr = 6,500). The void volume (Vo) of the column was determined with blue dextran.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Circular Dichroism ExperimentsCD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter, in buffer B (100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), at room temperature, in a 1-mm path length cell, at a scan rate of 10 nm/min (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD). Each spectrum was the average of five consecutive measurements. The concentrations of the HPLC-purified peptides 21.37 and 21.43 in buffer B were 4.5 and 12.5 μM, respectively. The effect of 40% (v/v) TFE, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (v/v) Tween 20 on the secondary structure of the peptides was also studied on a preparation of cleaved 21.43 purified by gel filtration (with buffer B) and a preparation containing a mixture of 21.43 and 21.37. Analysis of the data was performed by the LINCOMB program after subtraction of the corresponding baseline data(34Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression of the Recombinant Protein 4.1 PeptidesRecombinant peptides corresponding to the spectrin-actin-binding domain of erythroid protein 4.1 were designed to contain the 21-aa alternatively spliced exon and various lengths of the 59-aa constitutive exon (Fig. 1). Additional peptides corresponding to non-erythroid isoforms of protein 4.1 either lacked the 21-aa exon (0.59) or had another alternatively spliced exon of 19 aa inserted along with the entire 59-aa cassette (19.59) (Fig. 1). Both SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis revealed one or more bands for the majority of assayed constructs (Fig. 2 and Table 1). As expected from the amino acid sequence, all peptides containing the 21-aa cassette were recognized by the anti 21 antibody, while only constructs containing 31 aa or more were strongly reactive with the anti 10b antibody (Table 1). Reversed-phase HPLC purification of thrombin-cleaved peptides allowed the separation and the quantification of the different species contained in each fusion protein preparation. N-terminal sequencing of HPLC-purified 21.43 indicated that the thrombin cleavage occurred at the expected site. Mass spectrometric characterization of major HPLC-purified species confirmed that expression of the constructs typically yielded a couple of major peptide species: one of the expected length and one with a C-terminal truncation ranging from 10 to 20 residues. The identification of the major peptides by mass spectrometry was precise (±2 Da), indicating that post-translational modifications, e.g. phosphorylation or methylation, had not occurred. Note that peptides 21.43 and 21.20 generated by unidirectional deletion contained additional C-terminal aa derived from the vector sequence (Table 1).Figure 2:Bacterially expressed spectrin actin-binding domain peptides of protein 4.1. 10 μg of reverse phase HPLC-purified thrombin-cleaved peptides were subjected to 20% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Minimal Sequence Required for Binary Interaction with SpectrinThe ability of metabolically labeled GST-4.1 fusion proteins to bind purified spectrin was first assayed using a sucrose gradient cosedimentation assay (Fig. 3). The [35S]GST-21.43 showed a moderate affinity for spectrin (Ka~ 0.2 × 106M-1). Consistent with previous results [35S]GST-0.59 did not bind to spectrin indicating that the 21-aa cassette is necessary for this interaction(20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides [35S]GST-21.26 and [35S]GST-21.10 also did not bind to spectrin. Note that the shift toward the spectrin region observed with the peptide [35S]GST-21.26 is due to experimental variation in collecting fractions. Similar data were also obtained when the incubations were done at 37°C, indicating that the equilibrium was reached at 4°C (data not shown). Also, the thrombin-cleaved HPLC-purified peptides gave similar results, suggesting that failure to bind spectrin was not due to steric effects arising from the GST moiety.Figure 3:Cosedimentation of 35S-labeled GST peptides with spectrin. The binary interaction of 35S-labeled GST constructs at indicated concentrations with spectrin (6 μM) was assayed by cosedimentation as described under “Materials and Methods.” Sedimentation of spectrin dimer is represented by a horizontal line in these panels. A, sedimentation profile of [35S]GST-(21.43, 21.26, 21.10) with spectrin; B, sedimentation profile of [35S]GST-0.59; C, sedimentation profile of [35S]GST-21.43 at 3 and 30 μM. The control corresponded to the typical sedimentation profile of peptide [35S]GST-21.43 (3 μM) without spectrin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate the specificity of the binary interaction between the fusion peptides and spectrin, the cosedimentation of [35S]GST-21.43 (3 μM) with spectrin (6 μM) was assayed in the presence of excess of unlabeled fusion proteins (Fig. 4). Only GST-21.43 inhibited sedimentation of the [35S]GST-21.43 with spectrin; 25 μM of GST-21.43 induced a ~75% inhibition. Neither GST-21.26 at 45 μM, nor the chemically synthesized 21-aa peptide at 55 μM induced any inhibition. These results suggest that the interaction between [35S]GST-21.43 and spectrin was specific. Both binding and inhibition data suggest that while the 21-aa cassette is necessary for binding to spectrin, it is not sufficient. Additional 43 residues of the constitutive domain along with the 21-aa cassette are required for spectrin binding in this binary assay.Figure 4:Inhibition of cosedimentation of 35S-labeled GST constructs with spectrin. The spectrin (6 μM) was incubated with excess of thrombin-cleaved peptides 21.43, 21.26, and a synthetic 21-aa peptide, prior to perform cosedimentation experiment in the presence of [35S]GST-21.43 (3 μM), as described under “Materials and Methods.” The control corresponded to the amount of bound [35S]GST-21.43 in the absence of inhibitor. The error bars indicate the variability of the method determined during the course of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine more labile interactions between peptides and spectrin that might not be detected by the slow sucrose gradient separation of bound and free species (≥12 h), we used a rapid coimmunoprecipitation assay (separation 15 min) (Fig. 5). An antibody directed against the GST moiety was used to immunoprecipitate GST-4.1 fusion proteins, and the amount of cosedimenting [3H]spectrin was quantified to estimate binding affinity. Consistent with above results, only peptide GST-21.43 had a moderate affinity for [3H]spectrin (Ka~ 0.5 × 106M-1). GST-21.36 and GST-21.31 bound very weakly to [3H]spectrin while shorter peptides and GST-0.59 did not bind to [3H]spectrin (Fig. 5A). Equivalent results were obtained using 15 μM of anti-GST antibody (data not shown).Figure 5:Coimmunoprecipitation of [3H]spectrin with recombinant 4.1 pe"

Its identity is demonstrated by amino-terminal sequencing of the homogeneous protein and by its localization to a mitochondrial protein fraction. The mitochondrial protein is immunologically and biochemically distinct from the previously characterized nuclear replication protein A from Drosophila (Mitsis, P. G., Kowalczykowski, S. C., and Lehman, I. R.(1993) Biochemistry 32, 5257-5266; Marton, R. F., Thömmes, P., and Cotterill, S.(1994) FEBS Lett. 342, 139-144). It consists of a single polypeptide of 18 kDa, which is responsible for the DNA binding activity. Sedimentation analysis suggests that D. melanogaster mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein exists as a homo-oligomer, possibly a tetramer, in solution. The protein binds to DNA in its single-stranded form with a strong preference over double-stranded DNA or RNA, and binds to polypyrimidines preferentially over polypurines. Drosophila mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein exhibits a greater affinity for long oligonucleotides as compared to short ones, yet does not show high cooperativity. Its binding site size, determined by competition studies and by fluorescence quenching, is approximately 17 nucleotides under low salt conditions, and increases in the presence of greater than 150 mM NaCl. The homogeneous protein stimulates the activity of mitochondrial DNA polymerase from D. melanogaster embryos, increasing dramatically the rate of initiation of DNA synthesis on a singly primed DNA template.

Many of the processes involved in DNA metabolism including DNA replication, recombination, and repair, generate intermediates containing single-stranded regions of DNA. These regions are stabilized and kept accessible for the various catalytic processes by the binding of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs). 1The abbreviations used are: SSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding proteinEco SSBEscherichia coli SSBssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNApol γDNA polymerase γmtSSBmitochondrial SSBDm mtSSBDrosophila melanogaster mtSSBntnucleotide(s)MSmass spectrometryRP-Areplication protein A. Prokaryotic SSBs (e.g.Escherichia coli (Eco) SSB and bacteriophage T4 gene 32 protein) are generally small proteins which bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high affinity. They show high specificity for ssDNA over double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and RNA, but display little sequence specificity (reviewed in (1Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev.

Mitochondrial DNA replication is independent from chromosomal DNA replication and is carried out largely with specific mitochondrial replication proteins including the mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol γ) and an SSB (mtSSB) distinct from the nuclear SSB, replication protein A (RP-A). mtSSB appears to serve an important function during mtDNA replication, by stabilizing the displaced ssDNA that is the template for lagging DNA strand synthesis(4Van Tuyle G.C. Pavco P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). mtSSBs have been isolated from several species including rat(4Van Tuyle G.C. Pavco P.A. J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These proteins consist of a single small (13-16 kDa) polypeptide, which shows a high degree of similarity to Eco SSB in its primary structure(7Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Ghrir R. Lecaer J.-P. Dufresne C. Gueride M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although all the functions of mtSSB in mtDNA metabolism have not been defined, it is critical for replication, because deletion of the yeast protein (RIM1) causes loss of mitochondrial DNA(7Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in mtDNA replication, interactions between mtSSB and other mitochondrial replication proteins have been observed. In vitro studies indicate that under some conditions, the rat and X. laevis mtSSBs stimulate partially purified forms of mitochondrial DNA polymerase(9Hoke G.D. Pavco P.A. Ledwith B.J. Van Tuyle G.C.

Res. 1993; 39: 625-634PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, genetic evidence from yeast suggests an interaction between RIM1 and the mtDNA helicase, PIF1(7Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We have purified a single-stranded DNA-binding protein from Drosophila embryos (hereafter called Dm mtSSB) to near homogeneity. Its physical and biochemical properties demonstrate that it is distinct from the nuclear SSB, dRP-A, but has a high degree of similarity to Eco SSB and to eukaryotic mtSSBs. Further, its functional interaction with the near-homogeneous mitochondrial DNA polymerase from Drosophila melanogaster embryos (12Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that it serves an important role in Drosophila mtDNA replication. Ultrapure deoxy- and ribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates, and Mono Q, Mono S, and nick columns were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. DNase I (RNase-free) was from Boehringer Mannheim. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were from Amersham Corp.; [3H]dTTP was from ICN Biochemicals. Pepstatin, leupeptin, and ssDNA cellulose were from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases were from Northumbria Biologicals Ltd. Recombinant and wild-type M13 DNAs were prepared by standard laboratory methods(13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides complementary to the M13 viral DNAs and those indicated below were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems oligonucleotide synthesizer, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Homo-oligomeric sequences were (dA)32, (dC)32, (dG)32, and (dT)32. Hetero-oligomeric sequences were: 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT (17 nucleotides (nt)) 5′-GGCCCGTCTTCCGGTGCTTCAATCG (25 nt), 5′-GGCCTCCTACAATTGAAGCCAGCAGTTTTCGC (32 nt), 5′-TATCGTAGCTCTGTTATCGATATGTTCTCGGCATT (35 nt), 5′-GCCAAGCTTGGCTGCAGGTCGACGGATCCCCGGGAATT (38 nt), 5′-AACAGCTATGACCATGAACAAAATAGATCGATCTAAACTATGACTGGCCGTCGTTTTAC (58 nt), and 5′AAGCTTGGCTGCAGGTCGACGGATCCCCGGGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAG CTGTTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTA (75 nt). D. melanogaster DNA polymerase γ (Fraction VI) was prepared as described by Wernette and Kaguni(12Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). D. melanogaster RP-A was prepared as described by Marton et al.(14Marton R.F. Thömmes P. Cotterill S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Eco SSB was prepared as described by Cox and Lehman(15Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 230-base pair fragment of the common region of the tomato golden mosaic virus was labeled as described elsewhere(14Marton R.F. Thömmes P. Cotterill S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reaction product of the polymerase chain reaction was radioactively labeled and made amenable to ultraviolet cross-linking to protein by inclusion of [α-32P]dCTP and bromo-dUTP, respectively, in the reaction. To produce a ssDNA substrate, the DNA was heated to 100°C for 5 min and then cooled rapidly in an ice bath. Oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′-ends as previously described(13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using 5 pmol of DNA and 10-25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Enzyme fractions containing Dm mtSSB, dRP-A, or Eco SSB were incubated at 20°C for 30 min in reactions (25 μl) containing 50 fmol of 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% sucrose, 8 mM dithiothreitol, and 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were brought to a final concentration of 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.03% (w/v) xylene cyanol FF, loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE (89 mM Tris borate, 89 mM boric acid and 2 mM EDTA), and electrophoresed at 100 V. The gels were dried onto Whatman No. 3MM paper prior to autoradiography. The amount of shifted and unshifted oligonucleotide was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in Ecoscint (National Diagnostics). Alternatively, the dried gels were analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and the relative amount of oligonucleotides quantitated using ImageQuant software. To assess the affinity of binding of the proteins to various oligo- and polynucleotides, a competitive gel mobility shift assay was used. Here, the labeled oligonucleotide and the unlabeled competitor were mixed prior to addition of the protein. The amount of competitor added was calculated as mol of nucleotide. The enzyme fractions to be tested were incubated on ice with the 230-base pair DNA (1.25 ng, radiolabeled and prepared as described above) in a total volume of 20 μl containing 25 mM imidazole hydrochloride (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Brij 58, 2.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM sodium metabisulfite, and 50 mM NaCl. After 30 min, the reactions were subjected to 2 J of ultraviolet radiation at 254 nm in a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Reactions were adjusted to a final concentration of 10 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and were incubated with 10 units of DNase I at 37°C for 30 min. The mixtures were then boiled in the presence of gel loading buffer and loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R250, before drying onto Whatman No. 3MM paper for autoradiography. Reaction mixtures (0.05 ml) contained 50 mM Tris•HCl (pH 8.5), 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 30 or 120 mM KCl, 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μM dATP, 20 μM dCTP, 20 μM dGTP, 20 μM [3H]dTTP (1000 cpm/pmol), 10 μM (as nucleotides) singly primed recombinant M13 DNA, and 0.1 unit of Fraction VI enzyme (7-fold excess of primer ends over pol γ molecules). Incubation was at 30°C for 30 min. Specific modifications are described in the figure legends. One unit of activity is that amount that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate into acid-insoluble material in 60 min at 30°C using DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA as the substrate. In the analysis of pol γ processivity, reactions were as described above, except that reaction mixtures contained 30 μM dATP, 30 μM dCTP, 30 μM dGTP, 10 μM [α-32P]dTTP (2 × 104 cpm/pmol), 20 μM (as nucleotides) singly primed wild-type M13 DNA, and 0.02 unit of Fraction VI enzyme (100-fold excess of primer ends over pol γ molecules). Reaction products were isolated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described(16Williams A.J. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the analysis of limited primer extension by pol γ, reaction mixtures (0.05 ml) contained 50 mM Tris•HCl (pH 8.5), 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 30 mM KCl, 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 μM dATP, 30 μM dGTP, 30 μM dTTP, 20 μM (as nucleotides) 5′-end-labeled, singly primed recombinant M13 DNA, and 0.4 unit of Fraction VI enzyme (3-fold excess of primer ends over pol γ molecules). Incubation was at 30°C for 5 min. Reaction products were isolated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as previously described(16Williams A.J. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 860-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Dm mtSSB was used at concentrations of 1-5 × 10-7M. Samples were diluted in buffer B containing the indicated amount of NaCl. Fluorescence spectra resulting from excitation at 284 nm were recorded from 300-400 nm with a scan speed of 1 nm/s on a Baird-Atomic spectrophotometer. For the determination of fluorescence quenching, excitation was at 284 nm with 2-nm slit width, and emission was monitored at 348 nm with 20-nm slit width. Binding site size was calculated as described elsewhere(17Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. J. Biol Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli(19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar); protein determination was performed using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as standard (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 142: 79-83Google Scholar). Silver staining of SDS-gels was performed using the Bio-Rad silver stain plus kit. Amino-terminal sequencing was performed by automated sequential Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems model 494 pulse liquid peptide sequenator. MALDI-MS analysis was performed using a Vestec Lasertech Research MALDI mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). The initial steps of the purification of Dm mtSSB followed those used in the isolation of dRP-A(14Marton R.F. Thömmes P. Cotterill S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 g of 0-6 h D. melanogaster embryos (wild type, Oregon R) were dechorionated and homogenized at 0°C in 2.5 volumes of homogenization buffer (50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 2.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM sodium metabisulfite, and 10 mM benzamidine) in a dounce homogenizer using a Teflon pestle. The lysate was cleared by threefold centrifugation at 42,000 rpm in a Sorvall TST50 rotor for 30 min at 3°C. After filtration through a double layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem) it was loaded onto a ssDNA cellulose column (2.5 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) Brij 58, 2.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM sodium metabisulfite) containing 0.5 M NaCl. The column was washed sequentially with 4 volumes of buffer A containing 0.5 M NaCl and 3 volumes of buffer A containing 0.75 M NaCl. Protein was eluted with buffer A containing 1.5 M NaCl and 50% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Fractions that contained protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (25 mM imidazole hydrochloride (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Brij 58, 2.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mM sodium metabisulfite) containing 50 mM NaCl. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation of the dialysate in a bench-top centrifuge. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column which had been equilibrated with buffer B containing 50 mM NaCl. Dm mtSSB did not bind to the column under these conditions. The flow-through of the Mono Q column was loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column equilibrated in buffer B containing 50 mM NaCl. Again the bulk of Dm mtSSB did not bind to the column. At this stage the protein was >95% pure as visualized by silver staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A 15-30% glycerol gradient (4 ml) was formed in buffer B containing 10% sucrose and 100 mM NaCl. The Mono S fraction of Dm mtSSB (1 μg) was loaded onto the gradient and sedimented at 3°C for 21 h at 50,000 rpm in a Sorvall TST60 rotor. Fractions (120 μl) were collected from the bottom and analyzed for DNA-binding activity. Marker proteins (Sigma) were: bovine liver catalase (11.3 S), rabbit muscle aldolase (7.35 S), bovine serum albumin (4.7 S), ovalbumin (3.66 S) and bovine pancreas ribonuclease A (2.2 S). For DNase treatment, samples were adjusted to a final concentration of 10 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated with DNase I at 37°C for 30 min (100 units) prior to loading onto the gradient. Control samples were treated in the same way with omission of DNase I. We followed single-stranded DNA-binding activities during the fractionation of a Drosophila embryonic extract. Two binding activities were recovered from a single-stranded DNA cellulose column that was run under stringent binding conditions (750 mM NaCl) and eluted with 50% ethylene glycol, 1.5 M NaCl; the activities differed in the extent a 55-mer oligonucleotide was shifted in a gel mobility shift assay. The protein causing the larger shift in migration was identified as the Drosophila homolog of the nuclear SSB, RP-A(14Marton R.F. Thömmes P. Cotterill S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The two SSBs could be separated by fractionation on a Mono Q column, where dRP-A was retained by the resin but the second SSB was not (Fig. 1). At this stage, the second DNA-binding activity still contained several polypeptides, and also contained a DNA helicase activity. 2P. Thömmes, R. F. Marton, and S. Cotterill, manuscript in preparation. The impurities were removed by Mono S chromatography, where the SSB again flowed through the column while the contaminating proteins were bound. The final preparation was nearly homogeneous as judged by silver staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, that indicated a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ~18 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 5). The typical yield from a preparation of 60 g embryos was 30-60 μg of purified SSB. Alternatively, the corresponding protein derived from partially purified mitochondria (12Wernette C.M. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14764-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is nearly homogeneous after fractionation on ssDNA cellulose followed by glycerol-gradient centrifugation, yielding ~0.4 μg per g of embryos (data not shown). That the 18-kDa polypeptide is responsible for DNA binding activity was demonstrated by sedimentation analysis on a glycerol gradient (Fig. 2). When the fractions displaying ssDNA binding were analyzed by silver staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 18-kDa polypeptide was found to cosediment with the activity (Fig. 2, upper and middle panels). In addition, if these fractions were cross-linked to ssDNA by UV irradiation, a single radiolabeled band was observed upon autoradiography (Fig. 2, lower panel). The radiolabeled band has an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa, which is slightly larger than the protein itself, a condition which is most likely caused by the addition of oligonucleotides to the polypeptide upon cross-linking. Similar size shifts were observed for other DNA binding proteins, including the large subunit of dRP-A (14Marton R.F. Thömmes P. Cotterill S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the tomato golden mosaic virus protein AL1(21Thömmes P. Osman T.A.M. Hayes R.J. Buck K.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequence of the purified SSB was determined by automated sequential Edman degradation. Using the resulting 29-mer ATTTTAAAPAKVEKTVNTVTILGRVXADP as query sequence in a data base search, we found 96% identity to a sequence that had been assigned as the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein from D. melanogaster(22Stroumbakis N.D. Li Z. Tolias P.P. Gene. 1994; 143: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar): the amino-terminal sequence of the 18-kDa polypeptide is identical to that deduced from a recently reported cDNA sequence, beginning at residue 17 in the latter, indicating a leader peptide of 16 amino acids. Further, analysis of the 18-kDa SSB by MALDI-MS yields a mass of 13,845 ± 14 Da, in agreement with the predicted size of 124 amino acids for the mature protein, with a mass of 13,832 Da. Also consistent with this assignment, we found that the 18-kDa SSB is enriched ~15-fold in extracts of partially purified mitochondria, as compared to those of whole embryos (data not shown). Other proteins with high scores of similarity in the data base search were the mitochondrial SSBs from rat(23Tiranti V. Rocchi M. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Gene. 1993; 126: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), X. laevis(8Ghrir R. Lecaer J.-P. Dufresne C. Gueride M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Tiranti V. Barat-Gueride M. Bijl J. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and human(23Tiranti V. Rocchi M. DiDonato S. Zeviani M. Gene. 1993; 126: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On glycerol gradients, Dm mtSSB displays a sedimentation coefficient of 4.04 ± 0.34 S, consistent with a molecular mass of 46 kDa. Because the protein migrates on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa and has a calculated mass of ~14 kDa, this suggests that the protein is a homo-oligomer in solution, most likely a tetramer, under low salt (100 mM NaCl) conditions. The sedimentation coefficient does not change in the presence of 1 M NaCl (data not shown). The larger sedimentation coefficient is not due to the presence of contaminating ssDNA, which might hold several molecules together, because if the purified Dm mtSSB is treated with DNase I prior to sedimentation analysis, its apparent molecular mass is unchanged (data not shown). SSBs were incubated at increasing temperatures for 10 min, cooled to room temperature and analyzed for their DNA binding ability in a gel mobility shift assay (data not shown). Dm mtSSB was found to be very heat stable, showing no change in DNA binding activity upon heating to 90°C. Under the same conditions, E. coli SSB retains ~75% of its DNA binding activity. In contrast, dRP-A is heat labile and exhibits decreased binding activity after incubation at temperatures above 20°C, with 50% activity loss upon heating to 40°C. Observations made during the course of purification showed that Dm mtSSB could bind to a 32-mer but not to a 17-mer oligonucleotide substrate (data not shown), suggesting that the binding site size is larger than 17 nucleotides. To define further the effects of length on DNA binding, a 32-mer oligonucleotide was used as a labeled substrate in gel mobility shift analyses, and unlabeled oligonucleotides of increasing length were added as competitors (Fig. 3). We found that the 17-mer was unable to compete with the 32-mer oligonucleotide, even in 200-fold molar excess. In fact, only oligomers larger than 32 nt could compete efficiently for mtSSB binding, although a 25-mer oligonucleotide competed partially in 100- and 200-fold molar excess. The efficiency of binding increased with the length of the oligonucleotide. By comparison, in similar experiments with dRP-A, binding is less dependent on the length of the oligonucleotide and a 25-mer can compete efficiently, although the 17-mer still is a weak competitor (data not shown)(14Marton R.F. Thömmes P. Cotterill S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Further evaluation of the binding site size was performed by fluorescence quenching. Analysis of emission spectra showed that excitation of Dm mtSSB at 284 nm caused maximum emission at 348 nm (data not shown). Fluorescence is quenched up to 60% upon addition of ssDNA, indicating interaction of the protein with DNA. The binding site size was determined from fluorescence titration curves in which increasing amounts of oligo- or polynucleotides were added sequentially to fixed amounts of protein. Using Dm mtSSB at concentrations of 1-5 × 10-7M, ssM13DNA or 75 mer oligonucleotide were added stepwise to the solution. Under low salt conditions complex formation was rapid, and equilibrium was attained within the mixing time. Because under high salt conditions the rate of binding was slower, readings were taken when the fluorescence had stabilized after addition of the DNA. Linear approximations were fitted to the initial and final slopes of the curves and the intersection of the two lines taken as the apparent binding site size. Under low salt conditions (50 mM) the calculated binding site size was 17 ± 3 nt (Fig. 4A). This size did not change significantly at lower protein concentrations or with different DNAs. However, under higher salt conditions a significant increase in the binding site size was observed. Binding site sizes of 28 ± 2 nt and 34 ± 2 nt were determined at 320 mM and 480 mM NaCl, respectively (Fig. 4A). The salt stability of DNA binding under these conditions was monitored by increasing the NaCl concentration once maximum quenching had been achieved (Fig. 4B). There was no reduction in the quenching observed up to 500 mM NaCl. At 800 mM NaCl, 50% of the initial complex was disrupted, and only 20% of the initial quenching was retained above 1 M NaCl. The residual quenching most likely is due to some tight form of DNA-protein complex, which is not disrupted at this salt concentration. The cooperativity of DNA binding by Dm mtSSB was evaluated in gel mobility shift assays using heat-denatured radiolabeled 230 mer DNA as substrate (data not shown). At low protein concentrations, a single diffuse band was observed at both 50 mM and 300 mM KCl that migrates with lower mobility than the free DNA, suggesting low cooperativity of binding(18Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. Datta S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). At 300 mM KCl, the cooperativity appears to be higher, because at higher protein concentrations a distinct band of unbound DNA is observed in addition to that corresponding to a mtSSB•DNA complex. To assess whether or not Dm mtSSB shows nucleotide preferences in DNA binding, homopolymeric oligonucleotides were examined in a competitive gel mobility shift assay (Table 1). Adding unlabeled oligonucleotides to reactions containing radiolabeled 32-mer oligonucleotide, we found that both poly(dT) and poly(dC) were efficient competitors, while poly(dA) and poly(dG) were not. This suggests preferential binding of Dm mtSSB to pyrimidine nucleotide-containing DNAs. A similar result was obtained with Eco SSB. In contrast, dRP-A showed less pronounced base preferences, discriminating only slightly against (dA)32 (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The same assay was used to examine the ability of Dm mtSSB to bind to dsDNA and RNA (Table 1). While heat-denatured plasmid DNA competed efficiently for binding of the oligonucleotide, the same DNA in its double-stranded form did not. Similarly, tRN"

Anti-CNA3 specifically immunoprecipitated high affinity receptor sites for ω-conotoxin MVIIC (Kd∼100 pM), but not receptor sites for the dihydropyridine isradipine or for ω-conotoxin GVIA. In immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments, anti-CNA3 recognized at least two distinct immunoreactive α1A polypeptides, a major form with an apparent molecular mass of 190 kDa and a minor, full-length form with an apparent molecular mass of 220 kDa. The 220- and 190-kDa α1A polypeptides were also specifically recognized by both anti-BI-Nt and anti-BI-1-Ct antibodies, which are directed against the NH2- and COOH-terminal ends of α1A predicted from cDNA sequence, respectively. These data indicate that the predicted NH2 and COOH termini are present in both size forms and therefore that these isoforms of α1A are created by alternative RNA splicing rather than post-translational proteolytic processing of the NH2 or COOH termini. The 220-kDa form was phosphorylated preferentially by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, whereas protein kinase C and cGMP-dependent protein kinase preferentially phosphorylated the 190-kDa form.

Because NADH is an essential activator of isomerase (Kact = 2.4 μM, Vmax = 0.6 μmol/min/mg), the affinity alkylating nucleotide, 8-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]adenosine 5′-diphosphate (8-BDB-TADP), was synthesized. 8-BDB-TADP activates isomerase (Kact = 338 μM, Vmax = 2.1 μmol/min/mg) prior to inactivating the enzyme. The inactivation kinetics for isomerase fit the Kitz and Wilson model for time-dependent, irreversible inhibition by 8-BDB-TADP (KI = 314 μM, first order maximal rate constant kobs = 7.8 × 10−3 s−1). NADH (50 μM) significantly protects isomerase from inactivation by 8-BDB-TADP (100 μM). The isomerase activity is inactivated more rapidly by 8-BDB-TADP as the concentration of the affinity alkylator increases from 67 μM (t1/2 = 8.4 min) to 500 μM (t1/2 = 2.4 min). In sharp contrast, the 3β-HSD activity is inactivated more slowly as the concentration of 8-BDB-TADP increases from 67 μM (t1/2 = 4.8 min) to 500 μM (t1/2 = 60.0 min). We hypothesized that the paradoxical kinetics of 3β-HSD inactivation is a consequence of the activation of isomerase by 8-BDB-TADP via a nucleotide-induced shift in enzyme conformation. Biophysical support for an NADH-induced conformational change was obtained using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy.

With pregnenolone shown as a representative 3β-hydroxy-5-ene substrate, the enzyme reactions are as follows: 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-steroid dehydrogenase 8-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)-thio]adenosine 5′-diphosphate 5′-[p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl]adenosine 2α-bromoacetoxy-4-pregnene-3,20-dione 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. This reaction scheme shows the reduction of NAD+ to NADH by the 3β-HSD activity and the requirement of coenzyme (without further conversion) for the activation of isomerase(1Thomas J.L. Berko E.A. Faustino A. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because 3β-HSD and isomerase were inactivated at different rates by 2α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone (5Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Rosik L.O. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and exhibited different types of inhibition by N,N-diethyl-4-methyl-3-oxo-4-aza-5α-androstene-17β-carboxamide (6Luu-The V. Takahashi M. de Launoit Y. Dumont M. Lachance Y. Labrie F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it appeared that the two activities were catalyzed at separate sites on the same enzyme. Our studies of purified human placental 3β-HSD/isomerase have suggested that NADH mediates a shift in enzyme activity from dehydrogenase to isomerase by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme protein. NADH is the coenzyme product of the 3β-HSD reaction and is a potent, essential activator of isomerase activity(7Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NADH, but not NAD+, completely protects both the 3β-HSD and isomerase activities from inactivation by the substrate-site affinity alkylators, 2α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone (5Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Rosik L.O. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and 5,10-secoestr-4-yne-3,10,17-trione(8Thomas J.L. Strickler R.C. Myers R.P. Covey D.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, the isomerase-site-directed secosteroid, 5,10-secoestr-4-yne-3,10,17-trione, inactivated the isomerase activity with the expected first-order kinetics but inactivated the 3β-HSD activity in an unexpected manner. As the concentration of the alkylating secosteroid increased, the rate of 3β-HSD inactivation paradoxically decreased (8Thomas J.L. Strickler R.C. Myers R.P. Covey D.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) instead of increasing in accordance with the Kitz and Wilson model of irreversible enzyme inhibition(9Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, the interaction of 3β-HSD/isomerase with coenzyme is studied using the cofactor-site affinity alkylator, 8-[(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio]adenosine 5′-diphosphate (8-BDB-TADP). In addition, the time-dependent effects of NADH binding on the intrinsic enzyme fluorescence and on isomerase activation are measured. 8-BDB-TADP, as well as the 6- and 2-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)thio-derivatives of ADP, have been employed previously to study nucleotide binding by pyruvate kinase (10DeCamp D.L. Lim S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7651-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and isocitrate dehydrogenase(11Colman R.F. Huang Y.-C. King M.M. Erb M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3281-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Bailey J.M. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12620-12626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Demonstration that the binding of substrate triggered a time-dependent quenching of protein fluorescence (13Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4413-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or stimulation of enzyme activity (14Penner M.H. Frieden C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5366-5369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence for a ligand-induced conformational change in Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. The unprecendented use of both kinetic data from affinity labeling and spectroscopic measurements of coenzyme binding furnishes a definitive test of our hypothesis that NADH induces a conformational change that is critical to the sequential reaction mechanism of 3β-HSD/isomerase. Steroid hormones, pyridine nucleotides, ADP, and DEAE-Sephadex were purchased from Sigma; 5-pregnene-3,20-dione and 5-androstene-3,17-dione were from Steraloids Inc. (Wilton, NH); reagent grade salts and analytical grade solvents were from Fisher; 1,4-dibromo-2,3-butanedione was from Aldrich; AG50W-X4(H+) ion exchange gel was from Bio-Rad. Glass-distilled, deionized water was used in all aqueous solutions. 3β-HSD/isomerase was purified from human placental microsomes by our previously described method(1Thomas J.L. Berko E.A. Faustino A. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme, which expresses both 3β-HSD and isomerase activities, is a homogeneous protein according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the NH2-terminal sequence of amino acids, and fractionation of each activity during gel filtration chromatography(1Thomas J.L. Berko E.A. Faustino A. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The “UV-invisible” nonionic detergent, Genapol C-100 (0.2% w/v), was substituted for UV-absorbing nonionic detergent, Emulgen 913 (0.2% w/v), as the eluting reagent during the DEAE chromatography to provide purified enzyme suitable for fluorescence spectroscopy. The enzyme purified using the Genapol C-100 was identical to enzyme purified using Emulgen 913 according to the 3β-HSD and isomerase specific activities as well as the mobility of the single protein band during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The affinity alkylating nucleotide was synthesized as previously described by DeCamp et al.(10DeCamp D.L. Lim S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7651-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The identity of each product in the three-step synthesis was verified by thin layer chromatography on cellulose sheets developed with isobutyric acid:concentrated NH4OH:H2O (66:1:33) and by ultraviolet spectra. The identity and purity of the 8-BDB-TADP were verified by the thin layer chromatography system (single spot, Rf = 0.63), ultraviolet spectrophotometry (λmax = 278 nm), and determination (11Colman R.F. Huang Y.-C. King M.M. Erb M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3281-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) of bromide content (1.1:1.0 molar ratio of hydrolyzable bromide to 8-BDB-TADP). These values agree with those previously reported for 8-BDB-TADP(10DeCamp D.L. Lim S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7651-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The decomposition rate of 8-BDB-TADP in 0.03 M MES buffer, pH 7.0, was determined by the loss of bromide at 22°C as previously described(11Colman R.F. Huang Y.-C. King M.M. Erb M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3281-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The half-time for bromide loss was 56 min, in agreement with the reported half-life of 50 min under similar conditions(10DeCamp D.L. Lim S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7651-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the pure enzyme (1.0 μM) was carried out in experimental incubations that contained 8-BDB-TADP (67.0-500.0 μM, added in 0.03 M MES buffer, pH 6.0, at a 4% final concentration) dissolved in 0.05 M PIPES buffer, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, at 22°C. Identical control incubations contained ADP in place of the 8-BDB-TADP. The inactivation of each activity was plotted as time versus log % of the initial (zero time) enzyme activity in the experimental mixture. In protection studies, the control and experimental mixtures contained the same concentration of the potentially protecting steroid or cofactor with no increase in final solvent content compared to incubations without protector. The concentrations of these ligands were at least three times the Km or KImeasured for 3β-HSD or isomerase activity to facilitate competition with a subsaturating concentration of 8-BDB-TADP (100.0 μM). In mixed nucleotide-activator analysis(7Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the stimulation of isomerase activity was measured at 241 nm using 5-pregnene-3,20-dione (12.0 μM) as substrate and kinetically equivalent concentrations (0.5 × Kact) of NADH alone (1.2 μM), 8-BDB-TADP alone (170 μM), or a mixture of the two activators (each at 0.5 × Kact). Nonspecific alkylation by 8-BDB-TADP was evaluated by preincubating the enzyme with ethyl bromoacetate (100.0 μM) for 30 min followed by the addition of 8-BDB-TADP (100.0 μM) using the conditions described above for enzyme inactivation. The rates of isomerase inactivation by 8-BDB-TADP were compared with or without preincubation with ethyl bromoacetate. Assays that monitored the loss of 3β-HSD or isomerase activity during enzyme inactivation were performed on aliquots taken from the incubation mixtures at appropriate time intervals in duplicate according to our published conditions(5Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Rosik L.O. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The slope of the initial linear increase in absorbance at 340 nm (due to NADH production during the oxidation of pregnenolone) per unit time was used to determine 3β-HSD activity. Isomerase activity was measured by the initial absorbance increase at 241 nm (due to progesterone formation from 5-pregnene-3,20-dione) as a function of time. Changes in absorbance were measured with a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) Cary 219 recording spectrophotometer. Nonspecific and spontaneous enzyme activity were determined using blanks that contained either no steroid substrate or no enzyme, respectively. The incubation conditions cited in this report minimized spontaneous activity in the enzyme assays, and all measurements of enzyme activity were corrected for any observable nonspecific conversion of substrate. Purified 3β-HSD/isomerase (5.0 μg) was dissolved in 0.02 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, under three different preincubation conditions. 1) Isomerase substrate (5-pregnene-3,20-dione, at Km = 10.0 μM) was preincubated with the enzyme for 2.0 min, and NADH (at Kact = 2.4 μM) was added to start the reaction at zero time. 2) The enzyme was preincubated in buffer alone, and the reaction was started by adding a mixture of the isomerase substrate and NADH. 3) The enzyme was preincubated in buffer plus NADH, and the isomerase substrate was added to start the reaction. In the spectrophotometric assay (241 nm) for isomerase activity(5Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Rosik L.O. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the substrate or NADH was quickly mixed (<5 s) in the cuvette at zero time (after the 2.0-min preincubation) so that the nmol progesterone formed could be measured from the Varian Cary 219 recorder tracing. The time-dependent change in enzyme fluorescence due to the binding of NADH was measured using an Applied Photophysics (Surrey, UK) stopped-flow spectrophotometer. To measure the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein, the excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and fluorescence was observed using a 305-nm cutoff filter. The fluorescence data were collected as 1000 data points over 200 s and fitted to an exponential curve using software provided with the Applied Photophysics instrument. The stoichiometry and dissociation constant for the binding of NADH to the enzyme were determined using a Proton Technology International (South Brunswick, NJ) Alpha Scan 4000 spectrofluorometer. The decrease in intrinsic enzyme fluorescence produced by titration with NADH yielded a value for maximal fluorescence change at site saturation (ΔFmax). After correction with a blank tryptophan titration, each NADH concentration yielded a ΔF value used to obtain θ = ΔF/ΔFmax. The data was plotted as 1/(1-θ) versus [NADH]/θ according to Stinson and Holbrook (17Stinson R.A. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) to yield a stoichiometry and dissociation constant for NADH binding. For the stoichiometry study, the actual concentration of enzyme protein was determined by ultraviolet spectral measurements in 6.0 N guanidine (34 Tyr plus 16 Trp residues/enzyme dimer yielded a molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.346 × 105/dimer). Like NADH, 8-BDB-TADP activated isomerase according to Michaelis-Menton kinetics (Table 1). The Kact and Vmax values reported for 8-BDB-TADP were calculated from initial velocities (<1.0 min) because isomerase was measurably inactivated within 1-3 min by the higher concentrations of the affinity alkylator. Although 8-BDB-TADP exhibited much lower affinity (higher Kact) for the enzyme compared to NADH, 8-BDB-TADP activated isomerase to a 3.5-fold higher maximal velocity than did NADH. In mixed activator analysis, isomerase activity was measured with NADH alone, 8-BDB-TADP alone, or a mixture of the two nucleotides (each at 0.5 × Kact). The mixture of activators yielded an isomerase activity of 789 nmol/min/mg. Because this value was substantially less than the sum of the isomerase activities (910 nmol/min/mg) produced by NADH alone (144 nmol/min/mg) and 8-BDB-TADP alone (766 nmol/min/mg), competition between the NADH and 8-BDB-TADP for the same activator site of isomerase is strongly supported.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The non-site-directed alkylator, ethyl bromoacetate (100.0 μM, 100/1 alkylator to enzyme molar ratio) was preincubated with the enzyme for 30 min (with less than 10% inactivation), and then 8-BDB-TADP (100.0 μM) was added to the same incubation mixture. Isomerase activity was rapidly inactivated (t1/2 = 5.0 min) by 8-BDB-TADP at the same rate measured for 8-BDB-TADP (100.0 μM) without preincubation with ethyl bromoacetate (data not shown). These observations are evidence that 8-BDB-TADP inactivates isomerase with good specificity. The affinity alkylating ADP derivative inactivated both the 3β-HSD and isomerase activities in an irreversible manner over time. The rate of 3β-HSD inactivation paradoxically decreased as the 8-BDB-TADP concentration increased from 67.0 to 500.0 μM (Fig. 1A). Conversely, isomerase was inactivated, as expected, at progressively faster rates when 8-BDB-TADP was increased over the same range of concentrations (Fig. 1B). The Kitz and Wilson analysis (9Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined an inhibition constant (KI = 314 μM) and a first-order maximal rate constant (kobs = 7.8 × 10−3 s−1) for the inactivation of isomerase by 8-BDB-TADP. In contrast to the first-order kinetics of isomerase inactivation, the inactivation of 3β-HSD by 8-BDB-TADP exhibited an intriguing reversal of the expected kinetics that could not be analyzed by the Kitz and Wilson model. The presence of 8-BDB-TADP in the experimental incubation mixtures stimulated the 3β-HSD activity at zero time relative to the 3β-HSD activity in control mixtures that contained ADP in place of 8-BDB-TADP (Fig. 1A). This indirect effect followed a concentration dependence that was consistent with the Kact (338 μM) measured for isomerase activation by 8-BDB-TADP. Because the inactivation data are plotted as percent of zero time activity, the controls appear to decrease as the ADP concentration increases. In fact, the control 3β-HSD activity was quite similar at all of the ADP concentrations (mean ± S.D. = 67.1 ± 4.7 nmol/min/mg), and the 3β-HSD activity in the experimental mixtures increased as the 8-BDB-TADP concentration increased (values given in Fig. 1legend). In contrast, the isomerase controls are plotted at 100% activity in Fig. 1B because aliquots of the control and experimental mixtures are diluted 20-fold into the isomerase assay mixture where saturating levels of isomerase substrate steroid and activating nucleotide (NAD+) induce the isomerase conformation. These assay conditions reverse the stimulation of isomerase by 8-BDB-TADP in the enzyme inactivation mixture. Stimulation by 8-BDB-TADP is evident in Fig. 1A because the 3β-HSD assay conditions do not promote the isomerase conformation to obscure the effect of 8-BDB-TADP on the enzyme protein. NADH significantly slowed the rate of inactivation of both 3β-HSD (Fig. 2A) and isomerase (Fig. 2B) by 8-BDB-TADP. NAD+ only marginally protected 3β-HSD from inactivation (Fig. 2A) and failed to protect isomerase (Fig. 2B). The appropriate substrate steroid moderately slowed the inactivation of 3β-HSD (Fig. 2A) or isomerase (Fig. 2B) by 8-BDB-TADP. When the enzyme was preincubated with isomerase substrate steroid, the addition of NADH activated isomerase gradually over 1 min (t1/2 = 20 s). A time-dependent increase in isomerase activity was also measured when NADH and isomerase substrate were added simultaneously to enzyme preincubated in buffer alone (t1/2 = 18 s). In contrast, isomerase immediately exhibited maximal activity without the time-dependent lag when the substrate steroid was added to enzyme that had been preincubated with NADH (Fig. 3). The spectrophotometric measurement of the activation of isomerase by 8-BDB-TADP did not reveal a time lag, suggesting that 8-BDB-TADP induces the conformational change in the enzyme more rapidly than NADH (data not shown). The change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme protein induced by the binding of NADH was measured by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 4). The initial binding event was visible as the very rapid voltage change during the first second (Fig. 4, inset). The subsequent gradual change in voltage over 200 s characterized the NADH-induced conformational change in the enzyme protein (kapp = 8.1 × 10−3 s−1, t1/2 = 85 s) and is represented by the best-fitting curve in Fig. 4. The stoichiometry and dissociation constant (Km) of the binding of NADH were determined by measuring the stepwise decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme (3.0 μM) during titration with NADH (0.5-17.2 μM). From the Stinson and Holbrook plot (17Stinson R.A. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) in Fig. 5, the stoichiometry of 1.04 mol of NADH bound/mol of enzyme dimer was calculated from ([NADH]/θ intercept)/3.0 uM enzyme dimer. The Km of 4.9 μM NADH was calculated from 1/slope of the best-fitting straight line plot. It was not possible to use 8-BDB-TADP in similar studies of stopped-flow or intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy because of the strong ultraviolet absorbance of 8-BDB-TADP (extinction coefficient = 19,000 M−1 cm−1 at λmax = 278 nm) and the high 8-BDB-TADP concentrations (Kact = 338 μM) needed to perform the experiments. As our studies of purified human placental 3β-HSD/isomerase with affinity alkylators have progressed(5Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Rosik L.O. Strickler R.C. J.

In addition to the NADH/NAD+ protection(5Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Rosik L.O. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Thomas J.L. Strickler R.C.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) studies discussed above, NADH (20Thomas J.L. Nash W.E. Crankshaw M.W. Strickler R.C. J. Soc. Gynecol. Invest. 1994; 1: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and pregnenolone (19Thomas J.L. Nash W.E. Myers R.P. Crankshaw M.W. Strickler R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18507-18512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) protected the same tryptic peptides (Arg-250, Lys-175) in the enzyme from affinity radioalkylation by 2α-bromo[2′-14C]acetoxyprogesterone (2α-[14C]BAP). Moreover, NADH shifted the binding of 2α-[14C]BAP to radiolabel a histidine in the Lys-135 peptide, while pregnenolone simply competed with 2α-[14C]BAP for access to the Arg-250 and Lys-175 peptides(19Thomas J.L.

Gynecol. Invest. 1994; 1: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This shift in affinity radiolabeling that was produced by NADH protection, but not by pregnenolone protection, provided further support for our hypothesis: NADH formed by the 3β-HSD reaction induces a conformational change in the enzyme protein that activates isomerase. The hypothesis has now been definitively tested by measuring the inactivation of 3β-HSD and isomerase with the NADH site-directed, affinity alkylating nucleotide, 8-BDB-TADP, as well as by obtaining direct spectroscopic measurements of the time-dependent activation of isomerase by NADH. The mixed activator analysis and protection studies are consistent with 8-BDB-TADP binding at the NADH site on the enzyme. NADH completely protected against the inactivation of both 3β-HSD and isomerase by all other affinity alkylators we have studied (2α-BAP(5Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Rosik L.O. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), FSBA(7Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and secosteroid(8Thomas J.L. Strickler R.C. Myers R.P. Covey D.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). Complete protection against inactivation is an unusual observation and suggests that NADH protected in these cases by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme rather than by simple competition. The significant, but less than complete, protection seen with 8-BDB-TADP plus the mixed activator results suggest that NADH directly competes with this affinity alkylator. NAD+ failed to protect either activity from 8-BDB-TADP. There has been no significant protection by NAD+ against any alkylator we have studied thus far, with the notable exception of the inactivation of 3β-HSD by FSBA(7Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NAD+ slowed the FSBA inactivation of 3β-HSD by 3-fold but did not significantly protect isomerase from inactivation by FSBA. Although both FSBA and 8-BDB-TADP are alkylating analogs of adenosine, the respective alkylating groups are located at “opposite” ends of the adenosine molecule (8-position of adenine in 8-BDB-TADP versus the 5′-position of ribose in FSBA). FSBA is the weakest activator of isomerase in the group of nucleotide-analogs studied (Table 1). Finally, FSBA inactivates 3β-HSD by the expected first-order kinetics (not “reverse” kinetics) because FSBA does not significantly activate isomerase. The current study with 8-BDB-TADP indicates that FSBA binds at the NAD+ site when the enzyme is in the 3β-HSD conformation, whereas 8-BDB-TADP binds at the NADH site after the 8-substituted nucleotide induces the enzyme to assume the isomerase conformation. Because 8-BDB-TADP is a highly efficacious activator of isomerase, a definitive model has been developed to explain the “reverse” kinetics of 3β-HSD inactivation by the affinity alkylating nucleotide. According to this model, the concentration-dependent activation of isomerase by increasing levels of 8-BDB-TADP (I) converts progressively more molecules of enzyme from the 3β-HSD conformation (E) into the isomerase form (E‘•I). Enzyme alkylated in the isomerase form (E‘ - I) retains significant dehydrogenase activity when an aliquot from the alkylator/enzyme mixture is diluted 10-fold in the 3β-HSD assay cuvette, where the dehydrogenase conformation is favored at pH 9.7 (3β-HSD optimum) with pregnenolone as substrate. However, enzyme alkylated in the isomerase conformation has no activity during the isomerase assay because the conformation is not shifted to the dehydrogenase form under these incubation conditions (at the isomerase optimal pH 7.5 with 5-pregnene-3,20-dione as substrate). This model is illustrated by the following reaction scheme: As the concentration of 8-BDB-TADP is increased, more alkylated enzyme exists in the active E‘ - I form during the assay used to measure 3β-HSD inactivation. Thus, the induction of the isomerase conformation (E‘•I) by the reversible binding of 8-BDB-TADP to the enzyme is directly responsible for the decrease in the rate of 3β-HSD inactivation as the concentration of 8-BDB-TADP increases. At each of the 8-BDB-TADP concentrations used (67-500 μM), a portion of the enzyme molecules remains in the dehydrogenase form (E) during the inactivation. Because formation of the reversible enzyme-alkylator complex induces the isomerase conformation (E‘•I), the enzyme in the dehydrogenase form is inactivated by 8-BDB-TADP via a bimolecular mechanism (E + I → E - I). Based on the measurements of 3β-HSD inactivation, enzyme alkylated by 8-BDB-TADP while in the dehydrogenase conformation (E - I) has no activity in the 3β-HSD assay and partial activity in the isomerase assay. The inactivation of isomerase by 8-BDB-TADP fits the equation for biphasic enzyme inactivation(10DeCamp D.L. Lim S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7651-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), E/E0=(1-F)e-kfast(t)+(F)e-kslow(t)(Eq. 1) where kfast and kslow represent the values of kobs = 0.693/t1/2 that were measured for the inactivation of isomerase and 3β-HSD, respectively, at each concentration of 8-BDB-TADP (determined from Fig. 1, A and B). The variable F represents the fractional residual activity of isomerase. The calculated curves fit the data points measured for the inactivation of isomerase (Fig. 6B) until less than 20% of the initial activity remains. At this point, the observed data points are higher than the predicted curves because all available enzyme in the isomerase form (E‘•I) has been inactivated as E‘ - I, leaving a mixture of E and E - I. Because the biphasic inactivation equation assumes that the alkylated enzyme (E‘ - I or E - I) has no activity, the observed data points exceed the values of the calculated points due to the partial isomerase activity of enzyme alkylated in the 3β-HSD form (E - I). The equation for biphasic enzyme inactivation overestimates the observed rate of 3β-HSD inactivation. However, the data fits the equation for single-phase enzyme inactivation (Fig. 6A), E/E0=(1-P)e-kobs(t)+P(Eq. 2) where kobs represents the value of kobs = 0.693/t1/2 that was measured for 3β-HSD inactivation at each 8-BDB-TADP concentration (determined from Fig. 1A). The variable P represents the fractional residual 3β-HSD activity when an inactivation plateau is reached. Because 8-BDB-TADP decomposes relatively slowly (t1/2 = 56 min) compared to the rates of inactivation measured for 3β-HSD, reagent decomposition causes the observed data points to exceed the predicted values only at the lower 8-BDB-TADP concentrations (67 and 100 μM) after 20 min of inactivation. The need to switch from a two-phase to single-phase equation to fit the data obtained for the inactivation of 3β-HSD supports the concept that enzyme alkylated in the isomerase conformation has full activity in the 3β-HSD assay. Because a greater proportion of enzyme molecules are in the isomerase conformation as the 8-BDB-TADP concentration increases (Table 1), higher concentrations of 8-BDB-TADP inactivate 3β-HSD more slowly than lower concentrations to yield the “reverse” kinetics of 3β-HSD inactivation. Our hypothesis that NADH activates isomerase by inducing a conformational change in the enzyme protein is indirectly supported by this affinity labeling study: 8-BDB-TADP binds at the NADH site, activates isomerase, and produces the reverse kinetics of 3β-HSD inactivation. Moreover, direct evidence for the NADH-induced conformational change has been obtained by observing the time dependence of both the activation of isomerase (Fig. 3) and the quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence by NADH (Fig. 4). The fact that the time frame for the fluorescence change (t1/2 = 85 s) is longer than for the activation of isomerase by NADH (t1/2 = 20 s) suggests that a point is reached during the conformational change where the isomerase substrate is brought into proper juxtaposition with the amino acid residues that catalyze the reaction. Once that threshold is reached, isomerization proceeds at the maximal rate. The stoichiometry of 1 mol of NADH bound/mol of enzyme dimer can be interpreted in two ways: 1) NADH induces the isomerase conformation in just one of the two subunits or 2) both subunits form a single NADH site when the enzyme is in the isomerase form. Whether one or both subunits participate in the isomerase activity will require studies of tertiary and quaternary structure by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or x-ray crystallography. The inactivation data obtained with the NADH site-directed affinity alkylator, 8-BDB-TADP, complement the direct measurements of the NADH-induced activation of isomerase to validate our proposed mechanism for the sequential 3β-HSD/isomerase activity. As the 3β-HSD activity oxidizes the 3β-hydroxy-5-ene steroid (pregnenolone or dehydroepiandrosterone) to the 3-oxo-5-ene intermediate, NAD+ is reduced to form NADH. This NADH induces a conformational change in the enzyme protein that activates isomerase to produce the 3-oxo-4-ene steroid (progesterone or androstenedione). After the product steroid and NADH dissociate, the enzyme converts back to the dehydrogenase form and can again catalyze the reaction sequence. Understanding how the enzyme shifts from the first to the second reaction in the sequence will help us evaluate the relationship between the individual reaction mechanisms for 3β-HSD and isomerase, which are currently being studied in our laboratory.

Biol. 1975; 97: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we documented that expression and phosphorylation of protein B23 started to decline at a modest rate in the first 24 h after androgen withdrawal (26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar) and that by 48 h post-castration, B23 was undetectable despite the presence of B23 mRNA up to 7 days of androgen withdrawal(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). These changes in expression coincided with the decline in ribosome synthesis and the morphological alterations associated with apoptosis, suggesting that protein B23 might be involved in these processes(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have explored the mechanisms by which the prostatic glandular epithelium controls the expression of protein B23 during apoptosis. Our data indicate that regulation of protein B23 expression after androgen withdrawal is not at the transcriptional level. There appears to be no new cis-acting element that would hinder B23 mRNA translation in vitro. This mRNA shows a differential pattern of association with prostatic polysomes in response to androgen deprivation, but this effect alone might not explain the specific and abrupt decline in protein B23 expression observed after 48 h of androgen deprivation. It appears that the primary means of regulation of protein B23 expression after androgen withdrawal is its proteolytic degradation and that the decline in protein B23 phosphorylation as well as the expression (or release of inhibition) of a specific protease(s) after androgen withdrawal may be the prerequisites for protein B23 degradation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 295-325 g (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were used as the source of ventral prostate tissue. The animals were maintained under standard conditions and were orchiectomized via the scrotal route under Metofane anesthesia as described previously(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, poly(Glu,Tyr) (4:1), potato acid phosphatase, agarose-bound alkaline phosphatase, and actin were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-B23 antibody was the same as described previously(15Dumbar T.S. Gentry G.A. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9495-9510Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). DNase I (RNase-free) and RNase A were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (nuclease-free) were purchased from Promega. Proteinase K was purchased from International Biotechnologies, Inc. (New Haven, CT). Microcystin-LR was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other common reagents and chemicals were of the highest purity available. Prostatic nuclei were isolated from rat ventral prostate glands excised either from intact animals or at different times after castration as described earlier(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of nuclei, as assessed by DNA assay(29Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10840) Google Scholar), were utilized for each time point examined. Nuclei were suspended in 40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; shock-frozen; and stored at −80°C. The run-on transcription assay was performed as described previously(30Ahmed K. Davis A. Hanten J. Lambert D. McIvor R.S. Goueli S.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 451-462PubMed Google Scholar). Before hybridization, transcripts (in 100 μl) were partially hydrolyzed with 4 μl of 10 N NaOH for 10 min on ice, followed by neutralization with 20 μl of 2 M NaH2PO4. The alkali treatment reduces the length of transcripts to ~50-600 nucleotides, the majority of chains being 200-300 nucleotides in length, and leads to more uniformly labeled molecules by removing unlabeled 5′-regions from transcripts that had already been initiated in vivo and then elongated in vitro(31Gellersen B. Kempf R. Hartung S. Bonhoff A. DiMattia G.E. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Excess amounts of denatured B23 cDNA (5 μg) as well β-actin cDNA were immobilized on nylon filters with a dot-blot apparatus. Filters were prehybridized for 30 min at 60°C in prehybridization buffer, followed by hybridization in hybridization buffer containing 1.5 × 107 cpm run-on transcripts for 2 days at 60°C as described previously(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). The density of different signals was assessed using a two-dimensional Bio-Rad densitometer. Total RNA from 3 g of rat ventral prostates was prepared as described previously(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg) was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon filters(30Ahmed K. Davis A. Hanten J. Lambert D. McIvor R.S. Goueli S.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 451-462PubMed Google Scholar). The B23 probe was isolated as described previously (26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Prehybridization, hybridization, and autoradiography were as described before(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). The autoradiograms were quantitated by using the two-dimensional Bio-Rad densitometer. The size of the mRNAs was estimated by comparison with ethidium bromide-stained 28 S and 18 S rRNAs. Prostatic poly(A) RNA was isolated from total RNA using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system from Promega. Translation was carried out using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system at 30°C for 60 min. The reaction containing between 5 and 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) was stopped by adding RNase A (50 μg/ml) in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM β-glycerophosphate. The mixture was incubated with B23-specific antibody bound to activated Sepharose 4B beads using cyanogen bromide as described previously(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar, 32Yung B.Y.-M. Chan P.-K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The bound protein was washed four times with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 50 mM β-glycerophosphate and then eluted with buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 M MgCl2, and 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, followed by two washes with the same solution. Bovine serum albumin (500 μg) was added to the eluted material as a carrier, and the mixture was precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, washed with absolute ethanol, and dried. The dried sample was dissolved in β-mercaptoethanol/SDS buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCK2protein kinase CK2 or casein kinase 2. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 4 days at −80°C. The density of the bands was quantitated using the two-dimensional Bio-Rad densitometer. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein kinase CK2 or casein kinase 2. Excised prostate glands were immediately sliced and lysed in ice-cold extraction buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 1000 units/ml RNasin, 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mg/ml heparin. Mitochondria and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Separation of polysomes from the post-mitochondrial supernatant was carried out on linear 15-40% sucrose gradients in extraction buffer centrifuged at 4°C for 2 h at 38,000 × g as described previously(33Knofler M. Waltner C. Wintersberger E. Mullner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11409-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, gradients were separated into fractions and extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the integrity of the electrophoretically separated RNA in each fraction was assessed by ethidium bromide staining. Subsequently, serial dilutions of each fraction were applied to nylon filters using a slot-blot apparatus, immobilized by heating at 80°C for 2 h, and then hybridized with randomly labeled B23.1 cDNA probe, β-actin probe, or 28 S probe as described above. As a control, an aliquot of each fraction was treated with RNase A before application to the nylon filter to ensure that any observed signal was attributable to RNA in the polysome fraction. Prostatic nucleoli were prepared from the isolated nuclei as described previously(34Chan P.K. Aldrich M. Busch H. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 161: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All preparative solutions contained 50 mM β-glycerophosphate as phosphatase inhibitor. Protein B23 was purified from nucleoli using anti-B23 antibody coupled to Sepharose 4B as described previously(32Yung B.Y.-M. Chan P.-K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Yung B.Y.-M. Hui E.K.-W. Chan P.-K. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Iodination of purified protein B23 (from tissue or recombinant source) was performed using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) and Na125I(36Markwell M.A.K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled protein B23 was dialyzed in a 2000-fold volume of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to get rid of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin prior to the degradation assay. The homogeneity of the protein was assessed using a silver stain of SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Rat prostate glands were excised either from intact animals or at different times after castration and were immediately homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 20 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. The homogenate was used within 15 min of excision of the gland. Dialyzed radiolabeled protein B23 was incubated for different times with homogenates obtained from intact and castrated animals. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film overnight. Protease inhibitors such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), aprotinin (25 μg/ml), and iodoacetamide (10 mM) were added as a control. When indicated, purified protein B23 was treated with potato acid phosphatase bound to Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 37°C in buffer containing 0.18 M (NH4)2SO4 and 1 mM MgCl2, pH 5.5, followed by dialysis in 3 μM triethanolamine, 0.3 M NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 0.01 mM ZnCl2, pH 7.6, and incubation with agarose-bound alkaline phosphatase for 2 h at 37°C prior to the degradation assay(37Reifel-Miller A.E. Calnek D.S. Grinnell B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23861-23864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the continued high level of B23 mRNA after androgen deprivation was attributable to ongoing transcription or to enhanced stability of the mRNA, the prostatic nuclei obtained from intact and castrated rats were examined for their ability to transcribe B23 mRNA in vitro. As determined by the nuclear run-on assay, the nuclei retained the ability to transcribe B23 mRNA even at 7 days after androgen withdrawal (Fig. 1). The decline in the ability to transcribe B23 mRNA observed after 7 days was comparable to the decline observed in the cellular steady-state level of B23 mRNA examined either by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2) or by slot-blot analysis (26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of decline in the ability of prostatic nuclei to transcribe β-actin after androgen withdrawal was comparable to that observed for protein B23 (Fig. 1).Figure 2:Effect of androgen deprivation on steady-state level of B23 mRNA using Northern blot analysis. Total prostatic RNA was electrophoresed, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with randomly labeled B23 cDNA as described under “Methods.” Lanesa-c correspond to prostatic total RNA from intact normal and 4- and 7-day castrated rats, respectively. Relative densitometric values were 1, 0.8, and 0.4, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using a 15-40% sucrose gradient, a different distribution of cytosolic B23 mRNA was observed in prostate glands obtained from castrated animals than in prostates obtained from intact animals (Fig. 3A). After androgen withdrawal, the majority of the B23 mRNA existed in association either with free ribosomes or with short stretches of polysomes (Fig. 3, A and B). The β-actin mRNA displayed a pattern similar to that of B23 mRNA (Fig. 3C), and this differential distribution of both mRNAs was secondary to the general decline in 28 S RNA-containing ribosomal subunits, as evidenced by the decrease in the area under the curve after androgen withdrawal in Fig. 3D. To confirm that the signal obtained by the radiolabeled probe is due to the interaction with RNA in the polysome fractions, a sample of the various polysome fractions was preincubated with RNase A. This treatment abolished the signals, indicating that the probes are indeed recognizing the B23-specific mRNA in the polysome fraction (Fig. 3A). Steroid hormones can alter the mRNA initiation sites of many genes(38Yamamoto K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1985; 19: 209-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility of the development of cis-acting elements in B23 mRNA that would hinder its translation upon androgen deprivation, an in vitro translation assay was performed. Even at 6 days of androgen withdrawal, B23 mRNA was capable of being translated in vitro (Fig. 4). Incubation of purified radioiodinated protein B23 with prostatic cellular homogenates from normal and castrated rats did not indicate a significant differential degradation of the protein (Fig. 5, compare toppanel with bottompanel). However, we have previously shown that protein B23 phosphorylation in vivo declines dramatically after 2 days of androgen deprivation, suggesting that the extent of phosphorylation may influence B23 degradation(26Tawfic S. Goueli S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, purified radiolabeled protein B23 was incubated first with acid phosphatase followed by alkaline phosphatase and then with prostatic homogenate in the presence of 20 μg/ml heparin and 2 mg/ml poly(Glu,Tyr) as protein kinase CK2 inhibitors. Under these conditions, a significant appearance of degradation products was observed only when dephosphorylated protein B23 was incubated with prostatic homogenate obtained from 4-day castrated rats (Fig. 6A, compare bottompanel with top and middlepanels). The appearance of the degradation products could be minimized by the addition of the protease inhibitors described under “Methods.” A Ca2+-dependent protease is known to be associated with the nuclear matrix, where it might be involved in the degradation of certain nuclear matrix proteins(39Tokes Z.A. Clawson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15059-15065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Oberhammer F.A. Hochegger K. Froschl G. Tiefenbacher R. Pavelka M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In accord with this, an addition of 5 mM CaCl2 to the medium markedly enhanced the appearance of degradation products (data not shown).Figure 6:Effects of protein B23 phosphorylation status on its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation. A, effect of dephosphorylation of protein B23 on its proteolytic degradation. Purified radioiodinated protein B23 was treated with potato acid phosphatase followed by alkaline phosphatase prior to incubation with prostatic cellular homogenate prepared from intact or 4-day castrated rats as described for Fig. 5. In all panels, heparin and poly(Glu,Tyr) (poly GT) were added as inhibitors of protein kinase CK2. After incubation for the indicated periods of time, the reaction was stopped by the addition of gel electrophoresis sample buffer. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed to Kodak X-Omat film overnight at −70°C. The toppanel represents dephosphorylated protein B23 incubated with prostatic homogenate obtained from intact rats. The middlepanel shows phosphorylated protein B23 incubated with prostatic homogenate prepared from 4-day castrated rats. The bottompanel depicts dephosphorylated protein B23 incubated with prostatic homogenate prepared from 4-day castrated rats. The control lane in all panels included the addition of the protease inhibitors listed under “Methods.” B, effects of various conditions on proteolytic degradation of protein B23 and actin by prostatic homogenate from castrated rats. Lane a, 125I-labeled protein B23 (recombinant, nonphosphorylated; 5 μg) was incubated for 60 min at room temperature in medium consisting of 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.45, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM ATP, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 2 μM Microcystin-LR, and 350 ng of CK2 in a final volume of 50 μl (phosphorylation medium). Subsequently, 50 μl of control buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) were added, and incubation was continued for 4 h at room temperature (control). Lane b, the conditions were the same as described for lane a, except that phosphatase inhibitors (ATP, β-glycerophosphate, and Microcystin-LR) were omitted, and 0.1 mM Na2HPO4 was included (to provide nonphosphorylation conditions). Instead of the control buffer, 50 μl of 50% prostatic homogenate (from 4-day castrated rats) prepared in the control buffer were added, along with inhibitors of CK2 (50 μg/ml heparin, 1 mg/ml poly(Glu,Tyr)), to prevent any phosphorylation of protein B23 catalyzed by CK2 during incubation with the homogenate. Lane c, the conditions were the same as described for lane a, except that prostatic homogenate was added as described for lane b, but without inhibitors of CK2 to promote phosphorylation conditions for CK2. Lane d, 4.5 μg of 125I-labeled actin were incubated under nonphosphorylating conditions as described above for 60 min in medium consisting of 50 mM imidazole HCl, pH 6.3, 2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 units of alkaline phosphatase, and 2.5 units of acid phosphatase, followed by the addition of control buffer plus CK2 inhibitors and 2.5 mM CaCl2, and incubation was continued for 4 h as described above. Lane e, the conditions were the same as described for lane d, except that the second incubation (4 h) was carried out following the addition of prostatic homogenate as described above. C, effect of treatment with CK2 on degradation of protein B23 at 30 min by prostatic homogenate from 4-day castrated rats. Lane a, 5 μg of 125I-labeled B23 were incubated under nonphosphorylating conditions as described for B (lane b), except that the second phase of incubation was reduced from 4 h to 30 min. Lane b, the conditions were the same as described for B (lane c), except that the second incubation was for 30 min only as described above. In all panels, arrowheads indicate the position of protein B23. In addition, the position of a 24-kDa marker is shown in B and C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nature of the role of phosphorylation of protein B23 in its proteolytic degradation in prostate tissue from castrated rats was further examined. The result in Fig. 6B (lane b), employing recombinant protein B23.1, shows that dephosphorylated protein B23 under conditions that favor dephosphorylation (i.e. presence of excess Pi, CK2 inhibitors, phosphatases) was almost completely degraded after 4 h of incubation with prostatic homogenate from 4-day castrated rats. On the other hand, prior incubation of protein B23 with CK2 under conditions that favor phosphorylation (presence of excess ATP, phosphatase inhibitors) protected a 22-kDa segment of protein B23 from being degraded under the same conditions (Fig. 6B,"
https://openalex.org/W2056344762,"CD45, a leukocyte-specific transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase, is required for critical signal transduction pathways in immune responses. To elucidate the molecular interactions of CD45 with other proteins involved in CD45-mediated signal transduction pathways, we have recently cloned a 30-kDa phosphorylated protein, CD45-AP, which specifically associates with CD45. Binding analysis employing several deleted or chimeric forms of CD45-AP and CD45 demonstrated that the potential transmembrane segment of CD45-AP bound to the transmembrane portion of CD45. CD45-AP was found in particulate fractions of lymphocytes along with CD45, indicating that it is likely to be a transmembrane protein. In addition, CD45-AP was resistant to proteolysis by tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin applied to intact cells. This is consistent with the most likely membrane orientation of CD45-AP predicted from the amino acid sequence, that is, only a short amino-terminal segment of CD45-AP is extracellular. We propose that CD45-AP interacts with CD45 at the plasma membrane and that the bulk of CD45-AP located in the cytoplasm act as an adapter which directs the interaction between CD45 and other molecules involved in CD45-mediated signal transduction pathways.

It is not clear how specifically these proteins interact with CD45 and what their binding sites are. A cytoskeletal protein, fodrin, has been reported to interact with the cytoplasmic portion of CD45 and stimulate its protein tyrosine phosphatase activity(18Lokeshwar V.B. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21551-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CD45 has been reported to be one of surface glycoproteins to which CD22, the B lineage-specific cell surface glycoprotein and a sialic acid-binding lectin, binds(19Sgroi D. Varki A. Braesch-Andersen S. Stamenkovic I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7011-7018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported the molecular cloning of a novel 30-kDa phosphorylated protein, CD45-AP, which is specifically associated with CD45(20Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD45-AP shares no homology with previously known sequences and appears to be expressed specifically in leukocytes. The association of CD45-AP with CD45 has been observed in various types of lymphocytes (21Takeda A. Wu J.J. Maizel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16651-16659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the association involves the isotypically invariant portion of CD45. No tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45-AP has been detected either in vivo or in vitro, and the predicted sequence contains no consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sites (20Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it is not a substrate for protein tyrosine kinases. In addition, the predicted sequence of CD45-AP does not contain conserved sequences of GTP-binding proteins. Given the importance and complexity of CD45-mediated signal transduction, it is essential to determine how this novel protein, CD45-AP, interacts with CD45. In the present study, we characterize the interaction between CD45 and CD45-AP and summarize our findings in a model. Antisera against CD45-AP were raised by immunizing rabbits with CD45-AP (20Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated from YAC-1 cells, a murine T cell line(22Cikes M. Friberg Jr., S. Klein G. J. Natl.

Marth. glutathione S-transferase polyoxyethylene 10 oleyl ether CD45-associated protein monoclonal antibody polymerase chain reaction phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. YAC-1 cells were cultured as described before(20Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling with amino acids, cells were cultured overnight at 1.2 × 106 cells/ml with 2 μCi/ml of an L-14C-labeled amino acid mixture (52 mCi/mmol of carbon, Amersham Corp.) as described(20Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD45-AP cDNA was subcloned into pGEM-3Z plasmid (Promega) downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter using the EcoRI site, and two deleted forms, “N” and “C”, of the cDNA were derived from it. The N form contains a termination codon at amino acid position 75 and the region 3′ to the new termination codon is eliminated. The C form starts from amino acid position 47, and the region 5′ to the new initiation codon is eliminated. For construction of the pN1 form, the sequence from nucleotide positions 67 to 158 was amplified from the full-length CD45-AP cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was cloned in pGEM-3Z. Therefore, the pN1 form contains a segment which corresponds to amino acid positions 1-24. Likewise, the pN2 form was constructed by amplifying the sequence from nucleotide positions 67 to 241 which corresponds to amino acid positions 1-52. A schematic drawing of each construct is shown in Fig. 1. In vitro transcription and translation were carried out with the TNT™ T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system lacking cysteine (Promega) with the addition of Tran35S-label™ (1076 Ci/mmol, ICN Biochemicals). CD45 immunocomplex was formed by incubating a YAC-1 cell lysate in 0.8% polyoxyethylene 10 oleyl ether (BRIJ 96) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM thioglycolic acid, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) with the anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (25Springer T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LFA-1 and transferrin receptor immunocomplexes were formed in the same manner by employing anti-LFA 1 (27Lesley J. Hyman R. Schulte R. Trotter J. Cell Immunol. 1984; 83: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and anti-transferrin receptor (28Sarmiento M. Dialynas D.P. Lancki D.W. Wall K.A. Lorber M.I. Loken M.R. Fitch F.W. Immunol. Rev. 1982; 68: 135-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) mAbs, respectively. In vitro translated products and immunocomplexes were incubated at 37°C for 1 h for binding, followed by extensive washing in lysis buffer containing 0.4% BRIJ 96 in order to remove unbound material prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. The full-length CD45-AP cDNA or its deleted forms, N and C, described above were subcloned into pGEX-1λT expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) downstream from GST using the EcoRI site. The pN1 and pN2 forms described above were subcloned likewise using the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli was transformed by each of these constructs, and plasmids obtained from the transformants were sequenced in the region of the fusion sites in order to confirm that the ligation occurred in frame. Recombinant proteins fused to the carboxyl terminus of GST and a control GST protein were produced in BL21(DE3) by isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside induction with various efficiencies. Proteins were purified from equal volumes of bacterial culture by affinity chromatography using equal amounts of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for the binding assay. The amount of GST fusion proteins obtained, as assessed from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels, varied among different recombinants 2A. Takeda, unpublished results. and was in the decreasing order of GST control > C > N = pN1 = pN2 > F. Recombinant cytoplasmic CD45 was constructed, expressed, and purified as described before(29Ng D.H.W. Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding amino acid residues 564-1268 of the cytoplasmic domain of mouse CD45 (numbered according to (30Thomas M.L. Reynolds P.J. Chain A. Ben-Neriah Y. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5360-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) was subcloned into the pET-three-dimensional vector (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 6-89Google Scholar) with an additional six histidine residues and a factor Xa cleavable site at the amino terminus. This construct was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli and purified using nickel affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. A truncated version lacking the majority of the cytoplasmic domain (amino acid positions 574-1268) was constructed from the mouse CD45RABC cDNA (30Thomas M.L. Reynolds P.J. Chain A. Ben-Neriah Y. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5360-5363Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in pBluescript (Stratagene) by site-directed mutagenesis(32Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). The truncated and full-length forms of CD45RABC cDNA were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pHβapr-1-neo (33Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kebes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and were transfected into L cell fibroblasts using calcium phosphate precipitation. Stable, G418-resistant clones (L106A6 and L12B5) expressing surface CD45 were selected for further study. A stable G418-resistant L cell clone that expresses transfected CD44.TM2 on the surface was a generous gift from Dr. J. Lesley(34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Hyman R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD44.TM2 is a CD44 mutant consisting of the extracellular and intracellular domains of CD44 and the transmembrane segment (ALIIFLVFLIIVTSIALLVVLY) of CD45 (34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Hyman R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control L cells (L40B7) and their transfectants were cultured in the media described above for YAC-1 cells but containing supplements of 0.35-0.5 mg/ml of active G418 for the transfectants. CD45 was purified from YAC-1 cells by forming CD45 immunocomplex as described above and eluting in 50 mM diethanolamine containing 0.4% BRIJ 96, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM thioglycolic acid, and 0.2 mM PMSF(21Takeda A. Wu J.J. Maizel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16651-16659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and EDTA were added to the eluate to final concentrations of 25 and 5 mM, respectively, and the pH of the eluate was adjusted to 7.4. Recombinant GST fusion proteins bound to equal amounts of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in 0.4% BRIJ 96, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM thioglycolic acid, 1 mM PMSF, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor were incubated with various cell lysates, CD45 purified from YAC-1 cells, or purified recombinant cytoplasmic CD45 at 37°C for 1 h for binding. After extensive washing, material bound to the beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western blotting. Western blotting was carried out with a combination of rabbit antisera and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A or a combination of rat mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat Ig antibody using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Corp.). YAC-1 cells were suspended at 4 × 107 cells/ml in cold hypotonic buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM thioglycolic acid, and 1 mM PMSF and were disrupted with a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the 200 × g pellet (nuclear fraction) was resuspended in the hypotonic buffer supplemented with 0.8% BRIJ 96 and 150 mM NaCl. Insoluble material was removed by a brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and the final volume of the fraction was adjusted to be equal to the volume of the original cell suspension. The 200 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and 0.8% BRIJ 96 and 150 mM NaCl were added to the 100,000 × g supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction). The 100,000 × g pellet (microsomal fraction) was resuspended in gradient buffer consisting of 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM thioglycolic acid, and 1 mM PMSF and was overlaid on a discontinuous sucrose gradient of 20, 35, 40, and 50% sucrose in gradient buffer. After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C (40,000 rpm in an SW40 swinging bucket rotor), material at the interfaces was collected into three fractions, i.e. M1 (the pooled interfaces of 0%/20% and 20%/35%), M2 (the 35%/40% interface), and M3 (the 40%/50% interface)(35Radke K. Carter V.C. Moss P. Dehazya P. Schliwa M. Martin G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1601-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Each fraction was diluted in gradient buffer without sucrose and was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4°C. Each pellet was then resuspended in the same manner as described above for the nuclear fraction. A portion of each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE for Western blotting with antiserum against CD45-AP and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A. Another portion of the same fraction was immunoprecipitated by anti-CD45 mAb(25Springer T. Gafre G. Secher D.S. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1978; 8: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. YAC-1 cell lysates (10 × 106 cell/ml lysis buffer) prepared in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 0.8% BRIJ 96, 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 2.5 mM thioglycolic acid or intact cells (10 × 106 cells/ml) suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, and 1 mM EDTA were treated without or with TPCK-treated trypsin (10 μg/ml, specific activity 12,200 units/mg of protein) at 37°C for 1 h. After the incubation, PMSF and trypsin inhibitor were added to the lysate samples to final concentrations of 2 mM and 20 μg/ml, respectively. The cell samples were washed once in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum and 20 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor followed by lysis in 0.8% BRIJ 96 containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM thioglycolic acid, 1 mM PMSF, and 20 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. A portion of each sample derived from an equal number of cells was subjected to SDS-PAGE for Western blotting with antiserum against either CD45-AP or the extracellular domain of CD45 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A(24Chui D. Ong C.J. Johnson P. Teh H.-S. Marth J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Intact cells radiolabeled by incorporation of 14C-labeled amino acid mixture were treated without or with TPCK-treated trypsin as described above, and immunoprecipitates obtained with mAb against LFA-1 (27Lesley J. Hyman R. Schulte R. Trotter J. Cell Immunol. 1984; 83: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or the transferrin receptor (28Sarmiento M. Dialynas D.P. Lancki D.W. Wall K.A. Lorber M.I. Loken M.R. Fitch F.W. Immunol. Rev. 1982; 68: 135-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In a previous report, we have shown that in vitro translated CD45-AP bound specifically to CD45(20Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the segment of CD45-AP that is responsible for the interaction with CD45 was determined by constructing deleted forms of CD45-AP cDNA and examining the ability of their in vitro translated products to bind to CD45. The in vitro translated full-length (F) or the deleted forms (N or C) of CD45-AP cDNA (Fig. 1) were either analyzed directly in SDS-PAGE or were examined for their ability to bind specifically to CD45 (Fig. 2). As expected, the in vitro translated full-length CD45-AP exhibited specific binding to the CD45 immunocomplex but not to the immunocomplexes of LFA-1 and the transferrin receptor. The in vitro translated products of the N and C forms migrated at 14 and 22 kDa, respectively. The N form exhibited specific binding to CD45 whereas the C form failed to bind to CD45. These results indicate that interaction between CD45-AP and CD45 requires only a small NH2-terminal segment of CD45-AP, and the rest of CD45-AP, including most of the consensus phosphorylation sites, is not directly involved in the interaction. In order to further define the segment of CD45-AP required for binding to CD45, two additional deleted forms of CD45-AP cDNA, designated pN1 and pN2, were prepared by PCR (Fig. 1). The full-length and the various deleted forms of CD45-AP cDNA were then ligated to pGEX-1λT expression vector downstream from GST, and recombinant GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli. The recombinant proteins bound to equal amounts of glutathione-Sepharose 4B were incubated with lysates of YAC-1 cells metabolically labeled by 14C-labeled amino acid incorporation. Material bound to the beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). As expected, a prominent band of 180 kDa which comigrates with CD45 immunoprecipitated from YAC-1 cells bound to the beads containing the GST fusion protein of full-length CD45-AP. The 180-kDa protein also bound to the GST fusion proteins of the N and pN2 forms but not to the GST fusion proteins of the C and pN1 forms. These results demonstrate that the potential transmembrane segment of CD45-AP is required for binding to CD45. Next we sought to determine what portion of CD45 interacts with CD45-AP. First, a recombinant cytoplasmic CD45 which lacks the entire extracellular domain and the transmembrane segment was produced in E. coli with six histidine residues fused to its amino terminus and purified as described previously(29Ng D.H.W. Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins of the full-length (F) or the deleted forms (N or C) of CD45-AP bound to glutathione Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with either CD45 isolated from YAC-1 cells or the purified recombinant cytoplasmic CD45 protein. Material bound to the recombinant CD45-AP beads was subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antiserum against the cytoplasmic portion of CD45 (23Johnson P. Ostergaard H.O. Wasden C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8035-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). CD45 isolated from YAC-1 cells (YAC-1 CD45) bound to the full-length and the N form of CD45-AP, but not to the C form, in agreement with the results described above (Fig. 4A). The recombinant cytoplasmic form of CD45 (Cyto-CD45), however, failed to exhibit any significant amount of binding to any of the recombinant CD45-AP (Fig. 4B). The minute amount of the cytoplasmic CD45 bound to the N and C forms probably reflects nonspecific binding, since a similar amount of binding was also detected with control glutathione beads that did not contain any protein.2 In order to examine whether the noncytoplasmic portion of CD45 binds to CD45-AP, recombinant forms of CD45 were expressed in L cells. When an anti-CD45 immunoprecipitate was obtained from L106A6 cells which were transfected with the full-length CD45RABC and was analyzed by Western blotting, a 220-kDa protein was detected, as expected, by antiserum which recognizes a common segment in the extracellular domain of all CD45 isoforms (24Chui D. Ong C.J. Johnson P. Teh H.-S. Marth J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). A minor band of 200 kDa observed in this sample probably represents a degradation product of the full-length CD45RABC. 3A. Maiti and P. Johnson, unpublished results. When a similar analysis was carried out for L12B5 cells transfected with the noncytoplasmic form of CD45 which consists of the entire extracellular domain of CD45RABC and the transmembrane segment but lacks most of the cytoplasmic portion, 160-, 125-, and 95-kDa proteins were detected. The 160- and 125-kDa proteins appear to be derived from a single precursor protein,3 and they comigrate as a 115-kDa protein after N-glycanase treatment.2 The 95-kDa protein may represent an incompletely translated product or a degradation product of the recombinant noncytoplasmic CD45. For binding analysis, GST fusion proteins of the full-length (F) or the deleted forms (N or C) of CD45-AP bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with a cell lysate of untransfected control L cells (L40B7), L106A6, L12B5, or YAC-1 cells. Material bound to the recombinant CD45-AP beads was subjected to SDS-PAGE and was analyzed by Western blotting with antiserum against the extracellular portion of CD45 (Fig. 5B). The full-length as well as the noncytoplasmic form of CD45RABC bound to the full-length and N forms of CD45-AP. This indicates that CD45-AP interacts with the noncytoplasmic portion of CD45. As described above, the potential transmembrane segment of CD45-AP is required for binding to CD45 (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Therefore, if CD45-AP is indeed a transmembrane protein, it is most likely that the transmembrane segment of CD45 is directly involved in the interaction with CD45-AP. In order to examine whether the transmembrane portion of CD45 alone is capable of binding to CD45-AP, we utilized an L cell transfectant expressing recombinant chimeric CD44 (CD44.TM2) in which the transmembrane segment of CD45 replaces that of CD44(34Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Hyman R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were obtained from untransfected control L cells (L40B7) and the CD44.TM2 transfectant with an anti-CD44 mAb, KM201(36Miyake K. Medina K.L. Hayashi S. Ono S. Hamaoka T. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and were analyzed by Western blotting with the same antibody (Fig. 6A). L cells express endogenous CD44(37Nottenburg C. Rees G. John St., T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and this was detected as a broad 85-kDa band in the control L cells. A similar band in the transfectant represents both endogenous CD44 and the transfected chimera, since they cannot be discriminated by size. For binding analysis, GST-fusion proteins of the full-length (F) or the deleted forms (N or C) of CD45-AP bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with a cell lysate of the control L cells or the L cells transfected with CD44.TM2. Material bound to the recombinant CD45-AP beads was subjected to SDS-PAGE and was analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-CD44 mAb (36Miyake K. Medina K.L. Hayashi S. Ono S. Hamaoka T.

https://openalex.org/W2059237401,"Human erythroid anion exchanger AE1 (Band 3) was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the constitutive promoter and transcriptional terminator of the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase gene. AE1 expression in stable yeast transformants was estimated to be approximately 0.7 mg AE1 per liter. Density gradient sedimentation analysis indicated that the AE1 protein was associated with a membrane fraction distinct from plasma membrane, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum. AE1 protein was solubilized from yeast membranes with lysophosphatidyl choline, and the protein, tagged with six histidines at its amino terminus, was purified to 35% homogeneity by metal chelation affinity chromatography. Size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether indicated that the solubilized yeast-expressed AE1, like endogenous erythroid AE1, eluted at a stokes radius of 77 Å, consistent with a dimeric oligomeric state. Binding of partially purified yeast-expressed AE1 to 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanostilbene2,2′-disulfonate resin was competitive with the transportable substrate chloride but not the nontransported anion citrate, suggesting that the structure of the anion binding site is preserved. The specific activity of sulfate transport by partially purified yeast AE1 was determined in proteoliposomes to be similar to that of authentic AE1 purified from erythrocyte membranes. These data show that this expression system has the capacity to produce functional mammalian plasma membrane anion exchangers at levels sufficient for biochemical and biophysical analysis.

Size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether indicated that the solubilized yeast-expressed AE1, like endogenous erythroid AE1, eluted at a stokes radius of 77 Å, consistent with a dimeric oligomeric state. Binding of partially purified yeast-expressed AE1 to 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanostilbene2,2′-disulfonate resin was competitive with the transportable substrate chloride but not the nontransported anion citrate, suggesting that the structure of the anion binding site is preserved. The specific activity of sulfate transport by partially purified yeast AE1 was determined in proteoliposomes to be similar to that of authentic AE1 purified from erythrocyte membranes. These data show that this expression system has the capacity to produce functional mammalian plasma membrane anion exchangers at levels sufficient for biochemical and biophysical analysis. AE1 (Band 3) belongs to a family of anion exchange proteins that facilitate the movement of Cl- and HCO3-, across the plasma membrane(1Kopito R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane anion-exchange proteins are widely expressed among mammalian tissues where they participate in the regulation of intracellular pH and volume(1Kopito R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 549-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Three anion-exchanger isoforms have been identified, cloned, and sequenced: AE1, found in erythrocytes and kidney(3Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1985; 316: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar); AE2, found in kidney, stomach, and lymphocytes(4Alper S.L. Kopito R.R. Libresco S.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17092-17099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); AE3, found in the brain, retina, and heart(5Kopito R.R. Lee B.S. Simmons D.M. Lindsey A.E. Morgans C.W. Schneider K. Cell. 1989; 59: 927-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). All of these anion-exchange proteins contain two domains. The highly conserved (70% identity) membrane domain of approximately 55 kDa spans the bilayer 12-14 times (6Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Op. Str. Biol. 1993; 3: 515-523Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and is responsible for anion-exchange activity (7Grinstein S. Ship S. Rothstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 507: 294-304Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of 45-110 kDa is more divergent. In erythrocyte AE1, the cytoplasmic domain anchors the cytoskeleton to the plasma membranes through interactions with ankyrin(8Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). AE1 has served as a model for understanding the structure and function of membrane proteins because of its high abundance in the erythrocyte membrane, where it constitutes nearly 50% of the total integral membrane protein(9Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochem. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6177) Google Scholar). This allowed the early identification of the protein's role in the erythrocyte(10Cabantchik Z.I. Rothstein A. J. Membr. Biol. 1974; 15: 207-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Subsequently the protein has been extensively studied using a wide range of methods including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy(11Falke J.J. Chan S.I. Biochem. 1986; 25: 7888-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), chemical modification of specific residues(12Okubo K. Kang D. Hamasaki N. Jennings M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1918-1926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and electron diffraction(13Wang D.N. Kuhlbrandt W. Sarabia V. Reithmeier R.A.F. Embo J. 1993; 12: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The ability to generate specific point mutant and chimeric proteins has provided important insight into the function of many proteins. However, to study recombinant proteins biochemically and biophysically requires protein expression systems that produce sufficient amounts of functional protein. The availability of suitable overexpression systems is a limiting factor for many mammalian membrane proteins, including AE1. Soluble proteins are readily expressed in bacterial cells, but eukaryotic membrane proteins are not functionally expressed in bacteria because bacteria do not usually target eukaryotic membrane proteins for insertion into the membrane. Eukaryotic membrane proteins expressed in bacteria are often toxic to the cell, resulting in low levels of expression(14Holzer K.P. Hammes G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14389-14395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ferreira G. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5460-5466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the thickness of the bacterial inner membrane (25 Å) (16Roth M. Lewit-Bentley A. Michel H. Diesenhofer J. Huber R. Osterhelt D. Nature. 1989; 340: 659-662Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) does not match the hydrophobic region of eukaryotic membrane proteins (30 Å)(17Lewis B.A. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar).

AE2, expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, yielded an undetermined amount of protein that had a low level of anion-exchange activity(22He X. Wu X. Knauf P.A. Tabak L.A. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1075-C1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insufficient amounts of protein are produced by these expression systems to permit protein purification and characterization. In this study, we report the establishment of a yeast expression system that produces high levels of human AE1 protein. The yeast-expressed AE1 protein was solubilized in detergent, partially purified, and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. The reconstituted protein is structurally and functionally indistinguishable from the native erythroid protein. A preliminary version of this work has been published as an abstract(23Casey J.R.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protease-deficient strain BJ1991 (αleu2 trp1 ura3-52 prb1-1122 pep4-3 gal2) (25Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) were used for transformation with the leu2 plasmid. Untransformed yeast cultures were grown on YPD medium: 1% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose(26Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Yeast transformed with leu2 plasmids were grown on synthetic medium containing 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) dextrose, 0.2 mM adenine, and an amino acid mixture lacking leucine (Bio 101, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The yeast expression construct was assembled from the vectors pMA230 (27Tuite M.F. Dobson M.J. Roberts N.A. King R.M. Burke D.C. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and pMA91(28Mellor M.J. Dobson M.J. Roberts N.A. Tuite M.F. Emtage J.S. White S. Lowe P.A. Patel T. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Gene. 1983; 24: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. S. Kingsman (Oxford University). pMA230 contains the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase 5′-untranslated region followed by the first 11 codons of phosphoglycerate kinase coding sequence and a BamHI site. A synthetic linker (5′ GAT CGC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATC ATC CGC GG 3′/5′ GAT CCC GCG GAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GAT GC 3′) was ligated into the BamHI site. This linker was designed to destroy the 5′ BamHI site and to insert six histidine codons into the coding sequence, downstream of the phosphoglycerate kinase codons. The BamHI fragment of the cDNA for human AE1 (29Lux S.E. John K.M. Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1989; 86: 9089-9093Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was then inserted into the linker-modified pMA230, yielding pJRC15. pMA230 does not encode any of the 3′-untranslated region of the phosphoglycerate kinase gene; this region is essential for message stability. The vector pMA91 contains the phosphoglycerate kinase 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions surrounding a BglII site. Polymerase chain reaction, using pJRC15 as template and the synthetic oligomers 5′ GAA GAT CTA TGT CTT TAT CTT CAA AG 3′ (corresponding to the fusion protein coding sequence, with a BglII site at the 5′ end) and 5′ CTC TCT GAC ATG AGG GTG GC 3′ (from the human AE1 sequence) produced a DNA fragment with a 5′ BglII site, followed by the first 11 codons of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase, linker sequence, and human AE1. The PCR product was cut at the BglII site at the 5′ end and at a ClaI site at the 3′ end, within the region of human AE1. This BglII/ClaI-digested PCR product was then mixed with the ClaI/BamHI fragment of AE1 cDNA, containing the remaining coding sequence of AE1 and ligated into the BglII site of pMA91 to yield pJRC16. DNA sequences generated with polymerase chain reaction were sequenced in their entirety to ensure that no sequence errors were introduced. Yeast were transformed in the presence of lithium acetate and polyethylene glycol, based on previous protocols (30Schiestl R.H. Gietz D. Current Genetics. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar, 31Gietz R.H. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar, 32Eble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of YPH499 or BJ1991 (1 ml) were centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 rpm. Cells were washed in water and then with LiTE buffer (0.1 M lithium acetate, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). The cell pellet was then resuspended in 50 μl of LiTE buffer. 10 μl of freshly boiled sheared salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml) and 1 μg of plasmid DNA were then added, and the sample was mixed. LiTE buffer (0.3 ml) containing 35% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 was then added. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 30°C and then heat shocked by incubation for 15 min at 42°C. Cells were pelleted as above and resuspended in 0.5 ml of water. Cells were plated on Leu--selective plates, and colonies took 5-7 days to appear. When several independent colonies of BJ1991(pJRC16) yeast were picked and membrane preparations were prepared from each, it was found that the slowest growing cultures expressed the highest levels of AE1. Some rapidly growing cultures did not express AE1 at all. Therefore, it was essential to monitor the growth rate and not to use any starter cultures that had a doubling time shorter than 4 h. Yeast cultures grown to A600 = 1-1.5 were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min and washed once with water. Cell pellets were resuspended in four pellet volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4). Cells were disrupted by vigorous vortexing in the presence of glass beads for 15 min at 4°C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. Membranes were resuspended in 40 ml of homogenization buffer and centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor. Membranes were resuspended to approximately 10 pellet volumes in homogenization buffer. Membranes were isolated as described above and made to 10% (w/v) sucrose. A 0.3-ml sample of membranes was layered onto 11 ml of a 20-53% (w/v) sucrose gradient made up in 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The sample was centrifuged 18 h at 4°C, 30,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Fractions (0.5 ml) were removed from the top of the gradient. To remove EDTA and Tris, membranes were washed in 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor. Membranes were resuspended in 5 pellet volumes of nickel column buffer (10% glycerol, 100 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM imidazole, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0). Membranes were solubilized by the addition of LPC to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). After incubation for 20 min on ice, the solution was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (20-40 mg of protein/ml of resin) was applied at 0.25 ml/min to a His-Bind resin column. The column was washed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with nickel column buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) C12E8 until the A280 of the eluent dropped below 0.02. Nickel chromatography was performed in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) LPC instead of C12E8, in samples prepared for reconstitution. Protein was eluted with nickel column buffer containing 0.1% detergent and 250 mM imidazole. In some cases, fractions containing AE1 were pooled and dialyzed for 2 h against nickel column buffer supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) LPC. Dialyzed AE1 was reapplied to a 1.5-ml nickel column. The column was washed with 3 volumes of nickel column buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) LPC, followed by the same buffer supplemented with 30 mM imidazole. AE1 was eluted with nickel column buffer, containing 0.1% (v/v) C12E8 and 250 mM imidazole. AE1 was purified from erythrocyte membranes that were stripped with 2 mM EDTA, pH 12, solubilized in LPC detergent and chromatographed using aminoethyl-Sepharose resin (33Casey J.R. Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 494-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography and immunodetection of the eluate were performed as described previously(34Casey J.R. Ding Y. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8521-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). AE1 purified by nickel-affinity chromatography was subjected to size exclusion HPLC on a 0.75 × 30-cm TSK 4000SW column, eluted with 0.1 M sodium chloride, 0.1% (v/v) C12E8, 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, as described previously(35Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, using a Beckman 114 M pump. The column was calibrated with protein standards (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that were shown not to bind detergent(36LeMaire M. Aggerbeck L.P. Monteilhet C. Andersen J.P.M.J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To assay the elution position of the anion-exchanger protein, 30-s fractions of column eluate were collected, made to 1% (w/v) SDS, dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and processed as immunoblots. SITS•Affi-Gel 102 was prepared as described previously(37Pimplikar S.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9770-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and binding of yeast AE1 to SITS•Affi-Gel was performed essentially as described previously(38Pimplikar S.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 942: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Purified yeast AE1 (50 μl of 0.3 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 0.1% (v/v) C12E8, containing either 200 mM sodium citrate, pH 8.0 or 100 mM sodium citrate, 100 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.0. This protein was incubated with 20 μl of SITS•Affi-Gel resin for 20 min at 4°C. The resin was sedimented by centrifugation for 10 s in a microcentrifuge and washed 3 times with 200 μl of dialysis buffer. The resin was then incubated for 20 min at 20°C with 50 μl of 1 mM DNDS in either of the above buffers. The resin was sedimented, and the supernatant was removed. The resin was then incubated with 50 μl of SDS gel sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) at 60°C for 3 min, and the supernatant was collected. Purified AE1 protein from erythrocytes and partially purified AE1 protein from BJ1991(pJRC16) yeast (2 μg) in 0.1% LPC were denatured by incubation with 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/w) 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 50°C. The samples were made to 0.5% (w/w) Nonidet P-40, and 13,000 units of N-glycosidase-F (New England Biolabs) or water (to negative control tubes) was added. Samples were incubated for 19 h at 37°C and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, as described below. Yeast membranes (200 μg of protein) were reconstituted with 10 mg of soybean asolectin phospholipid and assayed for anion-exchange activity as described previously for human embryonic kidney cell membranes(40Sekler I. Lo R.S. Mastrocola T. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11251-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The method for reconstitution of purified AE1 made use of a novel protocol in which the LPC detergent was not removed but rather was incorporated into the lipid vesicles. Experiments showed that proteoliposomes prepared by dilution of LPC into lipid were well sealed, as shown by a very small leak of sulfate, chloride, and nitrate, in final LPC concentrations of up to 0.2% in the reconstitution mixture. 2T. Mastrocola and I. Sekler, manuscript in preparation. Since we noted that many preparations of phosphatidylcholine contain up to 0.4% LPC (41Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. Catalog. 199. 3Google Scholar), we reasoned that moderate amounts of LPC would not compromise the integrity of the vesicles. The integrity of phospholipid vesicles resulting from reconstitution in the presence of LPC indicates that this is an effective protocol that may be useful for other proteins that bind to SM2 Bio-Beads. For purified AE1 in 0.1% (w/v) LPC solution, the protein (50-200 μg) was dialyzed against reaction buffer (40 mM Na2SO4, 4 mM MgSO4, 20 mM MES/Tris, pH 6.0) supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) LPC. Approximately 10 μg of the purified yeast AE1 and 5 μg of purified erythroid AE1 were made to 0.5 ml with reaction buffer. Reconstitution mixtures contained the diluted protein, 0.45 ml of soybean asolectin (22 mg/ml in water), [35S]SO42- (50 μCi) and for inhibition studies, H2DIDS to a final concentration of 200 μM. Samples were made to a total volume of 1.0 ml by addition of water. Reconstitution proceeded by freezing the mixture in liquid nitrogen followed by thawing at room temperature and sonication(40Sekler I. Lo R.S. Mastrocola T. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11251-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In anion-exchange assays, exchange of intravesicular [35S]SO42-, for extravesicular SO4- was initiated by warming the sample to 30°C. Extravesicular [35S]SO42- was removed, and sulfate efflux was determined as described previously (40Sekler I. Lo R.S. Mastrocola T. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11251-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously(42Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Western blots were blocked by incubation for 30 min in antibody buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6). Blots were incubated with anti-AE1 antibody 5-297, an anti-peptide antibody that was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of mouse band 3 protein(43Thomas H.A. Machen T.E. Smolka A. Baron R. Kopito R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 26: C537-C544Crossref Google Scholar). Conditions were 10 ml/blot of 1:2500-diluted antibody in antibody buffer, for 2 h at room temperature followed by 10 ml/blot of 1:2500-diluted donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.), incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were visualized using Renaissance chemiluminescent reagent (Dupont) and Hyperfilm (Amersham Corp.). Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma)(44Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar), in the presence of 0.1% final concentration of SDS. Immunoblots were quantified using a Scanjet Plus scanner (Hewlett Packard) and Image 1.44 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Initial attempts to express mammalian anion exchangers AE1 and AE2 in yeast using the vector pYES2, containing an inducible galactose promoter failed to produce detectable protein. Consequently, we constructed a new vector, pJRC16 (Fig. 1), which incorporates several features that have been previously shown to be important for high level protein expression in yeast(45Schneider J.C. Guarente L. Methods in Enzymol. 1991; 194: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 46Villalba J.M. Palmgren M.G. Berberian G.E. Ferguson C. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12341-12349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These include the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions from a highly expressed yeast gene, in this case yeast phosphoglycerate kinase, and the first 10 codons of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase. Codons 183-911 of human AE1 (on a BamHI fragment), preceded by a sequence of six histidine codons (an affinity purification tag) were inserted immediately downstream of the strong, constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. The AE1 protein encoded by this construct, therefore, lacks the NH2-terminal 182-amino-acid residues from the cytoplasmic domain but contains the entire membrane domain that is both necessary and sufficient (7Grinstein S. Ship S. Rothstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 507: 294-304Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 47Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to conduct anion exchange. The plasmid was used to transform protease-deficient S. cerevisiae strain, BJ1991. 3Yeast strain YPH499(pJRC16), which is not a protease-deficient strain, had a similar level of YAE1 expression to BJ1991(pJRC16). Individual colonies were assayed for expression by immunoblotting of membrane fractions. Several individual colonies expressing high amounts of AE1 were isolated for further analysis. The growth rate (10 h doubling time) of these colonies was up to 5 times slower than strains transformed with vector alone, suggesting that expression of YAE1 interferes with growth. No immunoreactive material was observed in membranes prepared from yeast transformed with vector pMA91 alone (Fig. 2, lane13). The AE1 protein encoded by pJRC16 migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa, which is in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 80 kDa. The expression level of AE1 in BJ1991(pJRC16) membranes was determined by densitometric comparison of immunoblots of AE1 from yeast and erythrocyte membranes (Fig. 2). From the known abundance of AE1 (25% of erythrocyte membrane protein)(9Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochem. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6177) Google Scholar), yeast-expressed protein (YAE1) constitutes approximately 1.5% of the membrane protein in the yeast. Since 1 liter of yeast grown to A600 = 1.0 yields approximately 44 mg of membrane protein, the expression level is about 0.7 mg of AE1/liter of culture. Erythrocyte AE1 is heterogeneously glycosylated with up to 10 kDa of carbohydrate(48Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8260-8273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, this carbohydrate is not required for anion-exchange activity of the protein(49Casey J.R. Pirraglia C.A. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11940-11948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some mammalian membrane proteins functionally expressed in yeast are not glycosylated(50Ealke K.A. Kim K.S. Kabalin M.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 89: 2834-2838Google Scholar, 51Ruetz S. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the yeast-expressed AE1 protein was glycosylated, BJ1991(pJRC16) membranes and human erythrocyte membranes were treated extensively with the enzyme N-glycosidase F, which cleaves the entire carbohydrate structure at the asparagine linkage of N-linked carbohydrates (52Tarentino A.L. Gomez Jr., C.M.T.H.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The electrophoretic mobility of YAE1 was unaltered by N-glycosidase F treatment under conditions that resulted in complete deglycosylation of a parallel sample of erythrocyte AE1, suggesting that AE1 expressed in yeast is not glycosylated. The subcellular location of yeast-expressed AE1 was analyzed by density gradient sedimentation analysis on linear 20-53% sucrose gradients. Fractions from the gradient were analyzed by immunoblotting for AE1 and the yeast plasma membrane marker PMA1, using specific antisera (Fig. 3). YAE1 and PMA1 were separated on the gradient into two distinct, well defined peaks at 48% sucrose and 51% sucrose, respectively. Although this analysis does not exclude the possibility that some AE1 may be present in the plasma membrane, the data suggest that mos"

It is also possible that the CTG repeat functions as a general silencer in many genes. Gene expression is regulated mainly at the transcription level. Many trans-acting factors, such as enhancer-binding proteins, participate in this regulation (see (1Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar) and (2Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) for review). For tissue-specific expression, tissue-specific enhancers are known to be involved. Recently, it was proposed that, as well as enhancer elements and enhancer-binding proteins, negative regulators are also involved. Mechanisms include competition, quenching, direct inhibition, and squelching (see (3Levine M. Manley J.L.

Both amino acid sequence analysis and cDNA cloning have revealed that GIF is a small protein, 68 amino acids long, and quite similar to metallothionein (MT) with insertions of 1 amino acid and 6 amino acids in the N-terminal and C-terminal portions, respectively(5Uchida Y.

Brain Res. 1993; 19: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, GIF is also termed MT-III, since MT-I and MT-II have been reported(6Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. Whitmore T.E. Durnam D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6333-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In addition, a new MT isoform, MT-IV was reported recently(9Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Erickson J.C. Froelick G.J. Kelly E.J. Zambrowicz B.P. Palmiter R.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). MTs are small, cysteine-rich, and metal-binding proteins, and MT-I and MT-II are thought contribute to detoxication of heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, and homeostasis of essential trace elements, such as zinc and copper (see (10Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (11Kägi J.H.R. Schäffer A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8509-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar) for review). Whereas MT-I and MT-II are expressed widely in almost all organs and are strongly induced by heavy metals, GIF/MT-III is expressed strictly in the brain and not induced by heavy metals(6Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. Whitmore T.E. Durnam D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6333-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). GIF/MT-III is also known to be deficient in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients(5Uchida Y. Takio K. Titani K. Ihara Y. Tomonaga M.

In this report, we characterized the promoter region of the mouse GIF/MT-III gene and found that a CTG repeat in this region functions as a silencer-like element and contributes to negative regulation. The mGIF/MT-III gene was a kind gift from Dr. R. Palmiter(6Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. Whitmore T.E. Durnam D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6333-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The fragment from base pairs −807 to +57 in the promoter region of the GIF/MT-III gene was made by polymerase chain reaction techniques (PCR) (15Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and ligated to the multicloning site in the promoter-less luciferase vector, PGV-P (Nippon Gene) according to standard protocol(16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Various deletion mutants were constructed from this construct by deletion at the 5′ end by exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease digestions. Internal deletions and the 25 × CTG fragment for insertion within various promoters were constructed by PCR. All constructs used here were checked by sequencing with the dideoxy method using denatured plasmid templates(17Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The HepG2 cells, human hepatoma cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation techniques described by Chen and Okayama(18Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). All the transfection experiments were performed at least three times by using two or three different preparations of DNA, and the mean values are shown under “Results.” Transfection efficiency was checked by co-transfection with pRSVGAL, a eukaryotic expression vector containing the Escherichia coli-β-galactosidase structural gene controlled by a Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat as an internal or an external standard. Luciferase activity was assayed by Pikka Gene (Toyo Ink Mfg. Co., Ltd.) and a lumiphotometer, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described(19Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The GIF/MT-III gene is not expressed in any organs except the brain. To investigate the repression mechanisms of this gene, various deletion mutants with the luciferase gene as a reporter were transfected into human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the −257GIF construct revealed the highest activity among the constructs tested. All other constructs showed lower activity. This result indicates that there is a repressive element between −477 and −257. The nucleotide sequence of this region is shown in Fig. 2. A data base search for trans-acting factors revealed some typical cis-elements for LBP-1, LF-A1, and ADR-1 (data not shown). More interestingly, we have found that CTG is repeated 25 times in this region. To elucidate the function of this 25 × CTG repeat on trans-activation activity, we next transfected the internal deletion mutant lacking the CTG repeat. Compared with the native −807GIF construct, the construct with deleted CTG repeats revealed higher luciferase activity (Fig. 3A). When 25 × CTG repeats were joined to the CTG-less −257GIF construct, lower activity was observed (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the CTG repeat has repressive activity on the GIF/MT-III gene promoter.Figure 2:Nucleotide sequence of the negative regulatory region in the mGIF gene promoter. 25 × CTG repeats are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Effect of the CTG repeat on transcriptional activity of the mGIF gene promoter. A, effect of an internal deletion of the CTG repeat. 25 × CTG repeats (75 bases) were deleted exactly as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, effect of the CTG repeat on a CTG repeat-less mGIF gene promoter. Both are indicated as relative luciferase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the CTG repeat has repressive activity on the GIF/MT-III gene promoter, we next examined whether this effect would occur in various gene promoters. When the CTG repeat was joined to their upstream regions, this repeat showed repressive activity in all promoters tested here (Fig. 4A). Moreover, when the CTG repeat was inserted in opposite orientation, the same results were obtained (data not shown). Even when the CTG repeat was joined downstream of the promoters of three genes, a similar tendency was observed (Fig. 4B). When transfected into 3Y1 cells, a rat fibroblast cell line, and NIH3T3 cells, a mouse embryo cell line, similar results were obtained (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the CTG repeat acts as a silencer. We next performed gel-shift analysis by using 25 × CTG repeats as a probe and nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells and rat liver. However, no binding protein was detected, although several other trans-acting factors including C/EBPα and Nuclear Factor 1 were detected by each specific probe using the same extract (data not shown). No protected region was detected by DNase footprint analysis by using the GIF promoter as a probe (data not shown). It seems that specific proteins do not bind to the CTG repeat, or that binding affinity is too weak to detect. In this report, we characterized the promoter region of the mouse GIF/MT-III gene and identified its CTG repeat as a silencer. Since this gene is not expressed in organs other than the brain(5Uchida Y. Takio K. Titani K. Ihara Y. Tomonaga M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 337-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 6Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. Whitmore T.E. Durnam D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6333-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), this function is quite important for negative regulation in the mouse. Recently, we cloned the human GIF/MT-III gene, including the promoter region up to −2 kilobases, using the coding region as a probe (kind gift from Dr. R. D. Palmiter). Unfortunately, we have not yet identified a CTG repeat in this region by Southern blotting. Therefore, it is possible that the CTG repeat in the GIF/MT-III gene is species-specific. Indeed, only 200-base pair region from the cap site showed high similarity between the mouse and human genes(6Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. Whitmore T.E. Durnam D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6333-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the CTG repeat contributes to brain-specific transcription of the GIF/MT-III gene, since suitable cell lines for the brain are not available now. Transfection experiments using primary culture and/or in vitro transcription assay may dissolve this question in the near future. Amplification of CTG or CAG repeats is known in several inherited neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxia, dentatorynural-pallidoluysian atrophy, and myotonic dystrophy(20Martin J.B. Science. 1993; 262: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Ross A.C. McInnis M.G. Margolis R.L. Li S.-H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 254-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the first four diseases, CAG repeats in the N-terminal portions of their related genes encode polyglutamine residues, and the expansion of a glutamine-rich segment is related to the diseases. Although there is no evidence that an expanded CAG repeat has negative activity on transcription, except that the presence of the polyglutamine tract is inhibitory to trans-activation on the androgen receptor gene (22Chamberlain N.L. Driver E.D. Miesfeld R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3181-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), it is possible that the CAG repeat functions as a silencer under normal conditions. In the case of the myotonic dystrophy gene, in which the CTG repeat is found in the 3′-untranslated region, decreased expression is observed(23Fu Y.-H. Friedman D.L. Richards S. Pearlman J.A. Gibbs R.A. Pizzuti A. Ashizawa T. Perryman M.B. Scarlato G. Fenwick Jr., R.G. Caskey T. Science. 1993; 260: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, an opposite effect has also been reported(24Sabouri L.A. Mahadevan M.S. Narang M. Lee D.S.C. Surh L.C. Korneluk R.G. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In Fragile X syndrome, hypermethylation of the CGG triplet repeat in the 5′-untranslated region represses the expression of the Fragile X mental retardation-1 gene(25Pieretti M. Zhang F. Fu Y.-H. Warren S.T. Oostra B.A. Caskey C.T. Nelson D.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 817-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). GIF/MT-III is the first example of a CTG triplet repeat located in the 5′ promoter region, and that has repression activity. We have tried to detect whether nuclear proteins bind to the CTG repeat. However, we could not observe binding, although the conditions used here could detect other transcription factors. These results strongly suggest that a specific binding protein is not necessary to this function. First, we thought that a conformational change caused by the CTG triplet repeat might cause an inhibition effect on protein-protein interaction between the promoter and basal machinery. However, using the method for the detection of DNA bending by native electrophoresis (26Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) in the absence of the protein, we failed to detect the conformational change. Moreover, even when the CTG repeat was in the downstream region of the luciferase gene, that is, very far from the promoter, the negative effect was also observed. Therefore, we prefer to consider the following mechanism; while a specific DNA-binding protein would not bind to the CTG repeat, the CTG repeat itself could interact with some proteins in the complexes of basal and specific transcription factors with weak affinity. If this is the case, it is also possible that the CTG repeat may function as an activator. So far as we tested, we observed only a negative effect. We also failed to detect CTG repeat binding activity in the brain nuclear extract, although we could detect the binding activity in other regions in the promoter. Therefore, it seems that the CTG repeat functions as a general silencer which is active in all organs including the brain, and some activator proteins overcome the silencer function in the brain. Further studies are required to clarify the effect of the CTG triplet repeat on gene expression. We are grateful to Dr. Richard D. Palmiter at the University of Washington for providing the mouse GIF/MT-III gene and Dr. John Goodier, NIH, for critical reading of the manuscript."

These studies reveal that CsA and substrate bind a common hydrophobic pocket and provide a foundation for mutagenic and biochemical studies to analyze cyclophilin functions in vivo. Previous studies employing genetic and biochemical analyses established the roles of specific cyclophilin residues in CsA binding, active site function, calcineurin inhibition, and in vivo function. E. coli periplasmic cyclophilin is distantly related to human cyclophilin A, sharing only 34% sequence identity and having prolyl isomerase activity relatively resistant to CsA(32Liu J. Walsh C.T.

In the x-ray and NMR structures of cyclophilin A, Trp121 lies in the middle of the Thr116-Gly130 loop in the CsA binding pocket, near CsA residue 11 and hydrogen-bonded with CsA residue 9(21Mikol V.

A potential role for cysteine residues in catalysis by cyclophilin A was excluded by isolating active mutants lacking each of four different cysteines(32Liu J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on the x-ray crystal structure of human cyclophilin A, active site residues (Arg55, Phe60, Phe113, and His126) were identified by site-directed mutagenesis(35Zydowsky L.D. Etzkorn F.A. Chang H.Y. Ferguson S.B. Stolz L.A. Ho S.I. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cyclophilin mutants lacking peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity retained the ability to bind CsA and inhibit calcineurin(35Zydowsky L.D. Etzkorn F.A. Chang H.Y. Ferguson S.B. Stolz L.A.

Here we report the isolation of cyclophilin A mutations that confer CsA-resistance in a CsA-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain. These mutations identify three residues, Gly70, His90, and Gly102, which participate in CsA binding to yeast cyclophilin A and are identical in human cyclophilin A (Gly72, His92, and Gly104). In the structure of human cyclophilin A, these residues all lie within the CsA binding pocket, and, based on molecular modeling, substitutions at these residues should perturb the cyclophilin A ligand binding pocket. In addition, modeling suggests that the H92Y mutation would most profoundly perturb the ligand binding pocket, and, in vitro, the H90Y cyclophilin A mutant protein has the most severe defect in CsA binding and prolyl isomerase activity. The isolation of spontaneous cyclophilin A mutations that confer CsA resistance in yeast has provided further insight into cyclophilin A structure and corroborates and extends our view based on structural analyses. Yeast media was prepared as described previously(43Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 44Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hiestand P.C. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl.

CsA was obtained from either Sandoz (crystalline) or from the bone marrow transplant unit at Duke University (dissolved at 50 mg/ml in 30% ethanol, 70% cremophor EL). Yeast strains were isogenic derivatives of the CsA-FK506 sensitive S. cerevisiae strain IL993/5c (5Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1989; 342: 953-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) with the following genotypes: IL993/5c (MATα ilv5 ρ°), TB24 (MATa ρ° ura3), TB26 (MATα ilv5 ura3 leu2::hisG cpr1::LEU2 ρ°), TB40 (MATa ura3 leu2::hisG cpr1::LEU2 ρ°), TOC6 (MATa ρ° ura3 CMP1-1), and TOC1 (MATa ρ° ura3 TOC1-1). Spontaneous independent CsA-resistant mutants of strain TB24 were isolated on YPD medium with 100 μg/ml CsA. Mutants resistant to CsA but not to FK506 were identified by streaking to YPD medium with 100 μg/ml CsA or 1 μg/ml FK506. The resulting mutants (MATa ura3 ILV+) were crossed to strain IL993/5c (MATα URA+ilv5), and prototrophic diploids selected on YNB minimal medium and scored for CsA resistance to determine if mutations were dominant or recessive. Each mutant strain was transformed with the control CEN URA3 plasmid pRS316 (47Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a derivative, pTB4, bearing the yeast CPR1 gene encoding cyclophilin A(5Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5372-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Transformants selected on synthetic medium lacking uracil were scored on medium containing 100 μg/ml CsA to determine if mutations were complemented by the cyclophilin A gene. The ρ° mitochondrial mutation and mutations conferring CsA-FK506 sensitivity prevent sporulation of diploid IL993/5c strains. Genomic DNA was prepared as described previously(48Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant alleles of the yeast gene encoding cyclophilin A, CPR1, were PCR amplified with primers JH123, 5′-CGCGGGATCCGATGTCCCAAGTCTATTTTGATG, and JH124, 5′-GGCCATGAATTCCAAGCCTGGCAACATACTCCG, which contain a BamHI and an EcoRI site, respectively. PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94°C, 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C, followed by 5 min at 72°C. Resulting PCR products (~700 bp) were gel purified, cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned between BamHI and EcoRI sites of the his6-pTrcHisB expression vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were introduced into E. coli strain Top 10. The sequences of the wild-type and CsA mutant alleles of the cyclophilin A CPR1 gene were determined using as templates PCR products amplified from genomic DNA (New England Biolabs, cycle sequencing kit) and denatured plasmid DNA of the cloned genes. Primers were as follows: JH45, 5′-GAATTCGGATCCCCGCTAATACTACCATGTCC, and JH46, 5′-AGATCTGGATCCTATTGTTCCAGGCAGAGCGG, and internal, JH111, 5′-CGGCGGTAAGTCTATCTACGG, and JH112, 5′-CTGTCGTGGTGCTTCTTGAAG. In some cases, flanking primers JH123 and JH124 described above were also used. Mutations were identified by comparison with the wild-type sequence, run in parallel, and comparison with the known gene sequence(49Haendler B. Keller R. Hiestand P.C. Kocher H.P. Wegmann G. Movva N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Wild-type yeast cyclophilin A was tagged with a stretch of six histidines at the amino terminus and overexpressed and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously(50Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The His6-cyclophilin A protein was further purified by excision and electroelution from KCl-stained SDS-PAGE gels. The resulting protein was emulsified in an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant and used to immunize a rabbit that was subsequently boosted with four additional injections in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 3-week intervals to yield a high affinity rabbit polyclonal antisera against yeast His6-cyclophilin A. This antisera specifically detects an ~18-kDa protein present in extracts from wild-type yeast strains and absent in extracts lacking cyclophilin A prepared from a cpr1 mutant strain (see “Results” and Fig. 1). CsA binding to the purified wild-type and CsA-resistant His6-cyclophilin A proteins was determined by LH-20 assay using [methyl-butenyl-methyl-threonine-β-3H]CsA (Amersham Corp., specific activity = 11.1 Ci/mmol) as described previously(45Heitman J. Koller A. Cardenas M.E. Hall M.N. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 176-187Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 51Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). Cyclophilin A and CsA were preincubated prior to LH-20 assay for 15-60 min to ensure equilibrium binding. cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase assays were performed by the chymotrypsin-coupled cleavage assay, using the synthetic substrate Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Sigma), as described previously(45Heitman J. Koller A. Cardenas M.E. Hall M.N. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 176-187Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 52Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1112PubMed Google Scholar). Release of p-nitroanilide was monitored at 395 nm and 10°C with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer coupled with a Peltier temperature controller, an automated sample mover, and a microcomputer and disc reader. Initial reaction rates were determined by assaying prolyl isomerase activity of 20 ng of enzyme in the absence and presence of increasing drug concentrations, from 0 to 1000 nm CsA, added from a 1 mM stock in methanol and preincubated with wild-type or mutant cyclophilin A for 30-60 min prior to the addition of substrate and chymotrypsin. The concentration of drug necessary for 50% enzyme inhibition or Ki was extrapolated from plots of initial velocity rates plotted versus the log of CsA concentration. The results presented were representative of at least three different determinations in which the wild-type and mutant enzymes were assayed in parallel. For cyclophilin A and cyclophilin A•CsA affinity chromatography, the purified wild-type and mutant His6-yeast cyclophilin A proteins were coupled to Affi-Gel 10 beads as described previously(50Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Preparation of yeast protein extracts from a cyclophilin A-deficient strain (MH250-2C), cyclophilin affinity chromatography, and Western blot with affinity purified antisera directed against the yeast calcineurin A catalytic subunit CMP1 were as described previously(50Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Calcineurin phosphatase activity was assayed as described previously (45Heitman J. Koller A. Cardenas M.E. Hall M.N. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 176-187Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 53Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Chad J. Wheal H. Molecular Neurobiology. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 135-157Google Scholar) with a synthetic peptide from the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE) phosphorylated with cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Reactions contained 2 μM phosphopeptide, 40 nM bovine calcineurin (Sigma), 80 nM bovine calmodulin (Sigma), and, where indicated, wild-type or mutant His6-cyclophilin A and CsA in a final reaction of 50 μl. Protein concentrations were determined by comparison of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel bands to standards of known concentration. Release of 32PO42- by calcineurin was quantitated by ion-exchange chromatography and scintillation counting. Previous studies identified an unusual strain of S. cerevisiae, IL993/5c, whose growth is inhibited by CsA (46Tropschug M. Barthelmess I.B. Neupert W. Nature. 1989; 342: 953-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and FK506 and in which mutations in cyclophilin A or FKBP12 confer resistance to CsA or to FK506, respectively(5Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5372-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our findings established that this strain is CsA-FK506-sensitive because calcineurin is essential for viability(5Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5372-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These studies provide the foundation for a genetic dissection of the interactions between cyclophilin A and CsA, and of the cyclophilin A•CsA complex with calcineurin. Here we isolated and characterized 200 spontaneous independent CsA-resistant mutants of the CsA-FK506-sensitive strain TB24. 193 mutants were resistant to both CsA and to FK506 and presumably result from mutations that render calcineurin resistant to both drugs or no longer essential. The remaining seven mutants were CsA-resistant but were as FK506-sensitive as the isogenic wild-type parental strain (Table 1). When each of these mutant strains was mated to an isogenic CsA-sensitive strain of opposite mating type (strain IL993/5C), CsA-sensitivity was restored in all of the resulting diploid strains, indicating that the mutations are recessive (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab As it had been previously established that cyclophilin A mutations confer recessive CsA resistance in yeast(5Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5372-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 46Tropschug M. Barthelmess I.B. Neupert W. Nature. 1989; 342: 953-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we tested if any of the seven CsA-resistant mutations were allelic with the cyclophilin A-encoding gene CPR1. For this purpose, each mutant strain was transformed with a centromeric low copy number plasmid expressing the cyclophilin A gene CPR1 (pTB4) or, as a control, lacking the CPR1 gene (pRS316)(5Breuder T. Hemenway C.S. Movva N.R. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5372-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 49Haendler B. Keller R. Hiestand P.C. Kocher H.P. Wegmann G. Movva N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Introduction of the cloned CPR1 gene complemented a cpr1::LEU2 disruption strain (TB40) and restored CsA sensitivity. In each of the CsA-resistant mutant strains, introduction of the cloned CPR1 gene restored CsA sensitivity, whereas introduction of the control plasmid did not. Thus, the mutations that confer CsA resistance are all alleles of the cyclophilin A-encoding gene CPR1 (Table 1). To determine the molecular nature of the cyclophilin A mutations that confer CsA resistance, the CPR1 gene was retrieved from wild-type and mutant genomic DNA by PCR with oligonucleotides flanking the CPR1 gene coding region. DNA sequence analysis of the resulting PCR products revealed that four of the mutations (7, 46, 141, and 47) are single-nucleotide changes that result in amino acid substitutions, G70S, G102A, H90Y, and A10P (Table 1). In one additional mutation (183), a single nucleotide substitution replaces His90 with arginine, but a single-base deletion in the adjacent codon renders the gene out of frame (H90RΔ). In two cases (48 and 50), no changes were identified in the coding portion of the cyclophilin A gene, even though these are clearly cyclophilin A mutations based on failure to complement a cyclophilin A mutation and complementation by the cloned cyclophilin A gene. Because only the coding region of the gene was amplified and sequenced, these two mutants may harbor promoter mutations. In accordance with this interpretation, cells bearing these mutations do not express any cyclophilin A protein (Table 1 and described below). As a first step to determine how these cyclophilin A mutations confer CsA resistance, extracts from wild-type and mutant strains were subjected to Western analysis with antisera specific for yeast cyclophilin A. As shown in Fig. 1, this antisera detects wild-type cyclophilin A, an 18-kDa protein, expressed in the wild-type CsA-sensitive strain (Fig. 1, lane1), and also in a mutant resistant to both CsA and to FK506 (Fig. 1, lane2) and a CsA-resistant calcineurin mutant (Fig. 1, lane3), which both express wild-type cyclophilin A. This protein is not present in extract from a cyclophilin A deletion strain (Δcpr1, Fig. 1, lane4). In extracts from the mutant strains, three express wild-type levels of cyclophilin A (G70S, H90Y, and A10P) (Fig. 1, lanes5, 6, and 7), one expresses about one-fourth the wild-type level (H90Y) (Fig. 1, lane10), and the remaining three do not express cyclophilin A (Fig. 1, lanes8, 9, and 11). Thus, cyclophilin A mutations that confer CsA resistance can result from a complete lack of protein expression or expression of normal levels of a mutant protein. Yeast and human cyclophilin A share 65% identity and many conservative amino acid substitutions. In Fig. 2, the sequences of human and yeast cyclophilin A were aligned, and the single-amino acid substitutions that confer CsA resistance (A10P, G70S, H90Y, and G102A) are indicated. Ala10 is conservatively replaced by valine in the human cyclophilin A, whereas Gly70, His90, and Gly102 are all conserved between yeast and man. Thus, yeast cyclophilin A mutations that confer CsA resistance occur in highly conserved or invariant amino acids. To assist with purification, wild-type cyclophilin A and three cyclophilin A mutant proteins that bear substitutions at residues conserved in human cyclophilin A and which are stably expressed in yeast (G70S, H90Y, and G102A) were fused to a stretch of six histidines at their amino termini, over-expressed in bacteria, and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography to near homogeneity (see “Materials and Methods”). To assess their ability to bind CsA, the purified cyclophilin A proteins were subjected to LH-20 ligand binding assays(51Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, wild-type yeast cyclophilin A and the G70S and G102A mutant cyclophilins bound CsA, whereas the affinity of the H90Y mutant protein for CsA was dramatically decreased. When LH-20 assays were performed with 5-fold lower amounts of cyclophilin A proteins, CsA binding to the G102A mutant cyclophilin A was reduced in comparison with wild-type cyclophilin A (Fig. 3B). Thus, the apparent affinity for CsA by the LH-20 assay was wild-type, G70S > G102A H90Y. Because both CsA and substrates associate with the same binding pocket on cyclophilin, as a second measure of CsA affinity we assayed cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of the purified wild-type and G70S, H90Y, and G102A mutant cyclophilin A proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, the G70S and G102A cyclophilin A mutant proteins had readily detectable prolyl isomerase activity that was comparable with that of wild-type cyclophilin A. This suggests that the G70S and G102A mutations do not dramatically alter the cyclophilin A active site. In contrast, the H90Y mutant protein did not exhibit prolyl isomerase activity (Fig. 4), indicating that this mutation may perturb the cyclophilin A active site such that neither CsA (Fig. 3) nor substrate binds with high affinity. We next assessed the ability of CsA to inhibit prolyl isomerase activity of the wild-type, G70S, and G102A cyclophilin A enzymes. Prolyl isomerase assays were conducted following preincubation of 20 ng of the different enzymes with CsA at a range of concentrations from 0 to 1000 nM, and the initial reaction velocities were calculated and used to determine the CsA concentration resulting in half-maximal reaction velocity (see “Materials and Methods”). By this analysis, the Ki for inhibition of wild-type cyclophilin A by CsA was approximately 10 nM, whereas for the G70S and G102A, the Ki was increased approximately 10-fold, to 100 nM. Thus, the G70S and G102A mutations result in a moderate reduction in cyclophilin A affinity for CsA. Because the CsA minimum inhibitory concentration in strain TB24 is approximately 25 μg/ml and these mutations confer resistance to 100 μg/ml CsA or 4-fold higher than the MIC, a small reduction in CsA affinity of cyclophilin A should suffice to render the cell drug-resistant. This appears to be the case for the G70S and G102A mutations. To determine if these mutations alter the ability of cyclophilin A to interact with calcineurin, purified wild-type cyclophilin A and the G70S, G102A, and H90Y mutant proteins were coupled to Affi-Gel 10 to produce four different affinity chromatography matrices (see “Materials and Methods”). Equal amounts of cell extract from a cyclophilin A-deficient strain (MH250-2C, cpr1::LEU2 mutant) were incubated with each affinity matrix and washed, and bound material was eluted, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The yeast calcineurin A catalytic subunit CMP1 was then detected by Western analysis with affinity-purified antisera raised against a β-galactosidase-CMP1 fusion protein(11Ye R.R. Bretscher A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 50Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J.

Calcineurin associated with the wild-type cyclophilin A•CsA complex and with the G70S•CsA and G102A•CsA mutant complexes; however, the binding to the mutant complexes was approximately 3-fold reduced compared with the wild-type complex (Fig. 5, lanes2, 4, and 6), suggesting that these mutations have a slight affect on the affinity of the cyclophilin A•CsA complex for calcineurin. In contrast, substantially less calcineurin associated with the H90Y cyclophilin A mutant•CsA affinity matrix (Fig. 5, lane8), which is consistent with the pronounced CsA binding defect of the H90Y mutant protein. Finally, we assessed the ability of the wild-type and mutant cyclophilins to inhibit calcineurin protein phosphatase activity in vitro. For this purpose, we used the assay described by Hubbard and Klee(53Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Chad J. Wheal H. Molecular Neurobiology. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 135-157Google Scholar). Bovine calcineurin was reconstituted with calmodulin and incubated with the DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE phosphopeptide and purified wild-type yeast cyclophilin A, or the G70S, G102A, or H90Y cyclophilin A mutant enzymes, either in the absence or the presence of CsA. As shown in Fig. 6, wild-type yeast cyclophilin A•CsA and the G70S•CsA and G102A•CsA complexes inhibited bovine calcineurin activity in vitro. However, in comparison with wild-type cyclophilin, calcineurin inhibition by the G70S and G102A mutant proteins required higher levels of cyclophilin, which is consistent with their decreased affinity for CsA. In addition, these mutations might also perturb nearby residues, such as Arg67 (Arg69 in human cyclophilin A), involved in calcineurin binding. In contrast, the H90Y cyclophilin A mutant protein only weakly inhibited calcineurin activity, which is consistent with its profound CsA binding defect. These observations underscore that, whereas the G70S and G102A mutations subtly alter cyclophilin A properties, the H90Y mutation more dramatically alters the cyclophilin A ligand binding pocket. The structures of human cyclophilin A, alone and in complex with either CsA or a peptide substrate, have been determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR(18Ke H. Zydowsky L.D. Liu J. Walsh C.T. Proc.

Residues that comprise the ligand binding pocket of human cyclophilin A (His54, Arg55, Gln63, Asn71, Thr73, Asn102, and Trp121) are conserved in yeast cyclophilin A (His52, Arg55, Gln63, Asn71, Thr73, Asn102, and Trp119). We therefore employed the human cyclophilin A structures as a guide to understand the mutations that render yeast cyclophilin A CsA-resistant. In Fig. 7, these mutations are indicated at the corresponding positions in the x-ray crystal structure of human cyclophilin A(22Kallen J. Spitzfaden C. Zurini M.G.M. Wider G. Widmer H. Wuthrich K. Walkinshaw M.D. Nature. 1991; 353: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The CsA and substrate binding pocket is indicated by the filled Cα-Cα bonds. All four of the mutations alter single amino acids that lie within the CsA binding site on cyclophilin A. Three mutations alter Gly70, His90, and Gly102 in yeast cyclophilin A, which correspond to Gly72, His92, and Gly104 in human cyclophilin A. By molecular modeling, 2Jörg Kallen, personal communication. a G72S substitution is predicted to perturb the conformation of the 70s loop of cyclophilin A in which Asn71 and Thr73 bind water molecules that pack against CsA. A G104A substitution would probably alter the conformation of adjacent residues Ala101, Asn102, Ala103, which form part of the hydrophobic pocket (Ala101, Ala103) or hydrogen bond the amino nitrogen of CsA residue Abu2 (Asn102). The G72S and G104A substitutions could also alter the conformation of residues required for cyclophilin A•CsA binding to calcineurin, given our finding that the yeast G70S and G102A cyclophilin A•CsA complexes bound to calcineurin 3-fold less well than wild-type (Figure 5:, Figure 6:). Finally, a H92Y substitution would change the conformation of His126 and possibly also Trp121, which, respectively, hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygens of CsA residues MeVal11 and MeLeu9. At present, it is not clear, based on molecular modeling, how an alteration of Val12 (corresponding to yeast A10P) would alter the CsA-binding pocket. Our studies identified yeast cyclophilin A mutant proteins with single-amino acid substitutions at residues conserved between yeast and human cyclophilin A. These mutant proteins were cloned, overexpressed, purified, and characterized in vitro. These analyses reveal that the G70S and G102A cyclophilin A mutant proteins have moderately reduced CsA binding affinity, whereas the H90Y mutant has a more profoundly perturbed ligand binding pocket and fails to bind CsA or catalyze prolyl isomerization. Based on the structure of human cyclophilin A, molecular modeling predicts that these mutations would perturb the ligand binding pocket. None of these residues were identified in earlier studies employing site-directed mutagenesis(32Liu J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4028-4032Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 34Liu J. Chen C.-M. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2306-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Zydowsky L.D.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2380-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and thus this random collection of mutations has revealed additional residues that participate in cyclophilin A-ligand interactions. One mutant of the Drosophila NinaA cyclophilin homolog, G96E, has a substitution at the residue corresponding to Gly70 in yeast cyclophilin A(39Ondek B. Hardy R.W. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Shieh B.-H. Zuker C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16460-16466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, two different studies converged to implicate this residue in cyclophilin interactions with CsA and a presumed in vivo substrate. Further studies in yeast should allow a more precise dissection of cyclophilin A interactions with substrates, ligands, and calcineurin."

In the present study, we have critically evaluated the proposed function of nodE by performing detailed structural analyses of CLOS species made by wild-type ANU843, an isogenic nodE::Tn5 mutant derivative ANU297, and a recombinant strain ANU845 pRtRF101 containing the cloned 14-kb HindIII pSym nod region of ANU843 on multiple copy plasmid pWB5a introduced into the pSym-cured derivative ANU845. Our experiments reveal that ANU843 makes a large diversity of major and minor CLOS species, which does not change with impairment of nodE function or increased nod copy number. This spectrum of CLOSs does not, however, include molecules containing tri- or tetraunsaturated fatty acids. This necessitated a reevaluation of results of a recent report (12Spaink H.P.

Squartini, Padova University) was constructed by triparental conjugation between the Escherichia coli donor strain HB101 pRtRF101 (from S. Long, Stanford University,(17Fisher R.F. Tu J.K. Long S.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1985; 49: 1432-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and the pSym-cured recipient ANU845(16Rolfe B. Gresshoff P. Shine J. Plant Sci. Lett. 1982; 19: 277-284Crossref Google Scholar), using as a helper plasmid pRK2013 hosted in E. coli JM109. E. coli strains were grown at 37°C in TY medium containing 10 μg/ml tetracycline for the donor and 30 μg/ml kanamycin for the helper. Rhizobium recipients were grown in TY medium at 28°C. 10 ml of mid-exponential phase cultures of each strain were pelleted. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of saline solution, and 50-μl aliquots were mixed on nitrocellulose 0.22-μm filters on TY plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells on filters were resuspended in 2 ml of saline solution, and aliquots were plated on defined BIII medium (19Dazzo F.B. Burns R.G. Slater J.H. Experimental Microbial Ecology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, United Kingdom1982: 431-446Google Scholar) containing 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Transconjugants were purified by restreaking, and their identity was confirmed by plasmid profile analysis using a modified Eckhardt gel technique(20Espuny M.R. Ollero F.J. Bellogin R.A. Ruiz-Sainz J.E. Perez-Silva J. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1987; 63: 13-20Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Axenic seedlings of Dutch white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were grown on slopes of nitrogen-free Fahraeus agar as described previously(19Dazzo F.B. Burns R.G. Slater J.H. Experimental Microbial Ecology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, United Kingdom1982: 431-446Google Scholar). Axenic seedlings of pea (Pisum sativum cv. Alcan) were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of Fahraeus agar(21Djordjevic M.A. Zurkowski W. Rolfe B.G. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 560-568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inocula were grown at 30°C for 5 days on BIII agar (plus 30 μg/ml kanamycin for ANU297 and 2 μg/ml tetracycline for ANU845 pRtRF101). For nodulation tests, cells were diluted in Fahraeus medium and applied at a dose of 5 × 107 cells/plant, with 12 plant replicates. Plants were incubated in a plant growth chamber (22Salzwedel J.L. Dazzo F.B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and examined periodically for emergence of root nodules with confirmation of their structure after root clearing(23Truchet G. Camut S. de Billy F. Odorico R. Vasse J. Protoplasma. 1989; 149: 82-88Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Uninoculated controls received sterile Fahraeus medium only. Cells were grown with constant shaking (150 rpm) at 30°C in 2-liter flasks containing 1 liter of BIII broth with 0.45 mM CaCl2(24McKay I.A. Djordjevic M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3385-3392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 4 μM 4′,7-dihydroxyflavone(2Redmond J. Batley M. Djordjevic M. Innes R. Kuempel P. Rolfe B. Nature. 1986; 323: 632-635Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). BIII medium was further supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin or 2 μg/ml tetracycline for ANU297 and ANU845 pRtRF101, respectively. Batch cultures were grown to post-exponential phase (9 × 108 cells/ml) just preceding stationary phase (25Dazzo F.B. Urbano M.R. Brill W.J. Curr. Microbiol. 1979; 2: 15-20Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Hrabak E.M. Urbano M.R. Dazzo F.B. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 697-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C, and further washed with deionized water. CLOSs were extracted from cells from 4 liters of broth culture using chloroform/1-propanol/methanol/water (1:2:2:3) and then fractionated by a series of reversed-phase chromatographies (14Orgambide G.G. Lee J. Hollingsworth R.I. Dazzo F.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3832-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to yield the isolated family of CLOSs. 500 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy (14Orgambide G.G. Lee J. Hollingsworth R.I. Dazzo F.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3832-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was performed on 6-mg samples at 25°C in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide with suppression of the water resonance. The chemical shifts were measured relative to an external trimethylsilane standard. UV absorption spectra were recorded in ethanol on a Varian DMS200 spectrophotometer. For compositional analyses, 3-mg samples were treated with 1 ml of 2% HCl in methanol at 80°C for 16 h and then evaporated to dryness and partitioned between 2 ml of water/chloroform (1:1). The fatty acid methyl esters extracted into the chloroform layer were identified by FID-GC and GC/MS analyses with comparison to authentic standards whenever possible. The aqueous layer containing the methyl glycosides was evaporated to dryness, peracetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine (1:1) at 25°C for 18 h, and analyzed by GC/MS. FID-GC analyses of the fatty acid methyl esters were performed on a Varian 3740 gas chromatograph using a J& Scientific DB-1 column (program: 150-300°C at 3°C/min with a 10-min hold at 300°C). Fatty acid methyl esters and peracetylated methyl glycosides were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 5995C GC/MS instrument using a J& Scientific DB225 column (program: 150-230°C at 3°C/min with a 20-min hold at 230°C). ESI-MS analyses were performed on a Fisons Platform instrument using an electrospray inlet in either negative or positive ion mode, a mobile phase of acetonitrile/water (1:1), and a flow rate of approximately 10 μl/min. The instrument was tuned for unit resolution, and the capillary voltage was set at approximately 3 kV. The supernatants from 2 liters of broth cultures of ANU843 and ANU297 were passed through C18 reverse phase silica beds (150 ml) followed by washing with 500 ml of water and then with 500 ml of 100% acetonitrile to release adsorbed lipophilic material. The acetonitrile eluate was concentrated to dryness and analyzed by HPLC using a Vydac C18 reverse phase column (linear gradient of 30-100% acetonitrile in water over 50 min, 1 ml/min, monitoring of the effluent at 303 nm). Methyl ester derivatives were prepared from equivalent cell pellets (27Osterhout G.J. Shull V.H. Dick J.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1991; 29: 1822-1830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by GC/MS. CLOS samples were dissolved in 20% acetonitrile in water and injected onto a Vydac C18 reverse phase analytical HPLC column (linear gradient of 20-100% acetonitrile in water over 60 min, 20-min hold at 100% acetonitrile, 0.6 ml/min). The effluent was monitored by a Waters 990 photodiode array detector, with acquisition of the full range UV spectrum of each 303-nm absorbing eluted peak. Wild-type ANU843 efficiently nodulated all of the white clover plants but neither nodulated nor induced cortical cell divisions on pea roots. In contrast, ANU297 took 6 days longer to induce the first emerging nodules on white clover and incited 80% fewer nodules/plant by 1 month. ANU297 reisolated from surface-sterilized nodules of white clover retained the Kanr marker. In addition, ANU297 induced foci of cortical cell divisions resembling root nodule primordia and/or root nodules on 83% of the pea plants. These results were consistent with previously reported symbiotic phenotypes for these strains(10Djordjevic M. Schofield P. Rolfe B. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 463-471Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In comparison with ANU843 on white clover, the recombinant strain ANU845 pRtRF101 was twice as efficient in early nodulation kinetics and induced 50% more nodules/plant by 1 month (figure not shown). 3Figures not shown can be provided upon request to the authors. The final yields of membrane CLOSs from pelleted cells of ANU297 (~2-3 mg/liter) and ANU845 pRtRF101 (~19 mg/liter) were 5-fold lower and slightly higher, respectively, than the previously reported yield from an equivalent culture of ANU843 grown identically(14Orgambide G.G. Lee J. Hollingsworth R.I. Dazzo F.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3832-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Apart from resonances due to residual traces of 1-propanol, the 1H-NMR spectra of CLOSs from ANU843 and ANU297 were the same (Fig. 1). These spectra contained resonances of methylene and methyl protons from the fatty acyl chain (1.2 and 0.8 ppm, respectively), N-acetyl and O-acetyl groups (1.8-2.0 ppm), the methylene group adjacent to vinyl and carbonyl groups (2.0 and 2.1 ppm, respectively), the carbohydrate ring protons (3.0-4.5 ppm), and the vinyl protons of an isolated double bond (5.3 ppm). A set of common downfield signals between 7.0 and 7.8 ppm were attributed to a combination of amide and conjugated vinyl protons since the former protons exchanged upon treatment with deuterium oxide, whereas the latter remained intact (Fig. 1, insets). GC/MS analyses of the peracetylated methyl glycosides indicated that glucosamine was the sole glycosyl component of CLOSs from ANU843 and ANU297 (figures not shown). The FID-GLC and GC/MS profiles of the fatty acid methyl esters from these same samples were also identical in every detail (Fig. 2). The major fatty acid component was cis-vaccenic acid (C18:1) with lesser amounts of C18:0, C16:0, and C16:1 fatty acids, consistent with previous results(14Orgambide G.G. Lee J. Hollingsworth R.I. Dazzo F.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3832-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Together these accounted for approximately 95% of the total fatty acids in the family of CLOSs from both strains. Additional fatty acids detected in both samples by FID-GC and GC/MS were C18:2 and C20:1. Selected ion chromatograms for the characteristic fragment at m/z 103 (28Hollingsworth R.I. Dazzo F.B. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1988; 7: 295-302Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) also revealed 3-hydroxy-C14:0, 3-hydroxy-C16:0, and 3-hydroxy-C18:0 fatty acids (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, nine different fatty acids are definitively identified in the family of CLOSs from ANU843 and ANU297. Heterogeneity of CLOS species from ANU843 and ANU297 was further analyzed by both negative and positive mode ESI-MS. Like all soft ionization methods, ESI-MS is quite sensitive to the exact purity of the sample (concentrations of metal ions, anions, etc.) over which very little control can be exerted. Although the masses and relative abundance of ions are reproducible in multiple analyses of the same sample, the absolute values of ion intensities from different preparations usually vary to some extent and therefore should not be used in quantitation. Evaluation of high mass ions in several runs of positive and negative mode ESI-MS analyses showed that ANU843 produced a very diverse family of CLOSs (Fig. 3, A and C), and this same diversity was detected in CLOSs from ANU297 (Fig. 3, B and D), in agreement with the above 1H-NMR and GC/MS analyses. This diversity of CLOS species found by these methods consists of non-O-acetylated, mono-O-acetylated, and di-O-acetylated chitotri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharides bearing a large variety of amide-linked fatty acids (Table 1). This list of CLOS species from ANU843 includes the diversity of a previously published list (14Orgambide G.G. Lee J. Hollingsworth R.I. Dazzo F.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3832-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) plus the di-O-acetylated CLOS species, III(C18:1, 2Ac) with M- at m/z 933, IV(C16:0, 2Ac) with M- at m/z 1110, and IV(C18:1, 2Ac) with M- at m/z 1136 found by negative mode ESI-MS (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The occurrence of the six high mass ions previously assigned to unique nodE-dependent CLOS species of R. trifolii(12Spaink H.P. Bloemberg G.V. van Brussel A.A.N. Lugtenberg B.J.J. van der Drift K.M.G.M. Haverkamp J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 155-164Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was further investigated by positive mode ESI-MS. All CLOS species from ANU843 and ANU297 identified in negative mode ESI-MS spectra were also found in positive mode ESI-MS spectra (Fig. 3, C and D), either as pseudomolecular ions [M+H]+ (i.e. M+1 u) or as their sodium adducts [M+Na]+ (i.e. M+23 u). An important feature of the positive mode ESI-MS spectra of isolated CLOSs from ANU843 and ANU297 was the occurrence of major additional ions at m/z 1075, 1091, 1117, 1119, 1320, 1322 (Fig. 3, C and D). These ions were assigned to sodium adducts of the major CLOS species found in both strains because they are not detected in the negative mode ESI-MS spectra of the same samples, and their masses are fully consistent with the [M+Na]+ pseudomolecular ions of major CLOS species, namely IV(C18:1) at m/z 1075, IV(C16:0,Ac) at m/z 1091, IV(C18:1,Ac) at m/z 1117, IV(C18:0,Ac) at m/z 1119, V(C18:1,Ac) at m/z 1320, and V(C18:0,Ac) at m/z 1322. These same sodium adducts occur in variable intensities in the positive mode FAB mass spectra of these same samples (figures not shown). A second major contribution of negative mode ESI-MS analyses of CLOS was the detection of fragment ions between m/z 220-360, which could be assigned to various long chain fatty acylamino groups. Each of the fatty acids identified above by GC/MS was also found by negative mode ESI-MS (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, the ESI-MS analyses in the low mass range revealed several other ions tentatively assigned to saturated, unsaturated, and hydroxylated fatty acids ranging in chain length from C14 to C22 (Fig. 4, A and B). Once again, no qualitative differences were found in this diverse family of definitively and tentatively identified CLOS fatty acids from ANU843 and ANU297 (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The possibility that nodE-dependent fatty acids containing conjugated polyunsaturations might be present in ANU843 CLOS was further addressed by UV absorption spectroscopy, since three or four double bonds in conjugation with the fatty acid carbonyl group would have characteristic absorption maxima with very high molar extinction coefficients (****, 50,000-100,000) in the region of 300-330 nm(29Williams D.H. Fleming I. Spectroscopic Methods in Organic Chemistry. McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Ltd., London1966: 6-39Google Scholar). A comparison of the UV absorption spectra of the CLOSs from ANU843 and ANU297 showed no differences in the region of 300-330 nm, indicating that they had the same degree and types of unsaturation (Fig. 5, A and B). The remote possibility that polyunsaturated nodE-dependent CLOSs might selectively accumulate in the extracellular milieu rather than in cell membranes was explored by reverse phase HPLC of the hydrophobic components isolated from the culture supernatants. These analyses indicated that every 303-nm adsorbing peak in the profile of the ANU843 supernatant extract was also found in the profile of the ANU297 supernatant (figures not shown). No 303-nm absorbing peaks eluted between 20-35 min, the region where CLOSs typically elute under these chromatographic conditions. We also evaluated the possibility that unique nodE-dependent fatty acids might have been excluded from our protocol to purify membrane CLOSs. GC/MS analyses detected no differences in total cellular fatty acids from ANU843 and ANU297 grown identically to express their nod genes (Fig. 6, A and B). Some of these cellular fatty acids are found in both CLOSs and phospholipids of ANU843 (C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C20:1), some in both CLOSs and lipopolysaccharide (3OH-C14:0, 3OH-C16:0 and 3OH-C18:0), and others only in phospholipids (C14:0, C17:0Δ, and C19:0Δ)(14Orgambide G.G. Lee J. Hollingsworth R.I. Dazzo F.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3832-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Hollingsworth R.I. Carlson R.W. J. Biol.

Other minor peaks were not characterized since they were found in samples from both ANU843 and ANU297 (Fig. 6, insets). Next, we tested the possibility that production of nodE-dependent CLOSs from R. trifolii might be increased to detectable levels by using recombinant strain ANU845 pRtRF101 containing a higher gene dosage of the entire 14-kb pSym nod region from ANU843 in its pSym-cured background. Positive mode ESI-MS analysis of membrane CLOSs from this strain (Fig. 3E) revealed the same spectrum of CLOS species represented by their pseudomolecular ions [M+H]+ and/or sodium adducts [M+Na]+ as found in ANU843 (Fig. 3C) and ANU297 (Fig. 3D) (see Table 1for ion assignments). Most importantly, no new molecular species of CLOS were found in this recombinant strain. Negative mode ESI-MS of the CLOS sample from the recombinant strain also did not reveal any new species in the high mass range (figure not shown). Furthermore, a careful examination of the fatty acyl amino ions in the low mass region of this negative mode ESI-MS spectrum indicated that its diversity of CLOS-associated fatty acids was identical to both ANU843 and ANU297 (compare Fig. 4C to Fig. 4, A and B). Finally, we investigated the chemical nature of the 303 nm-absorbing components present in membrane CLOS fractions from ANU843, ANU297, and ANU845 pRtRF101 using reverse-phase HPLC with photodiode array detection (Fig. 7). The proportion of these components in the various samples was insignificant (less than one ten-thousandth of a percent of the total mixture), since the peaks were nearly nonexistent despite extremely high molar extinction coefficients (ɛ, 50,000-100,000) for tri- and tetraunsaturated conjugated esters(29Williams D.H. Fleming I. Spectroscopic Methods in Organic Chemistry. McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Ltd., London1966: 6-39Google Scholar). Even if CLOS species containing such fatty acids constituted 1% of the total mixture, the peaks corresponding to them on the HPLC profile would be at least 1000-fold higher than the regular saturated and monounsaturated fatty acylated species. The converse was observed. The"

E., Roth, M. G., and Henis, Y. I.(1991) J. Cell Biol. 115, 1585-1594). To explore the dependence of these interactions on the internalization signal and the aggregation state of the protein, we have extended this approach to investigate the interactions between coated pits and several influenza hemagglutinin (HA) mutants, which differ in the internalization signals in their short cytoplasmic tails. The lack of internalization signals in the trimeric wild-type HA enables a direct comparison between specific internalization signals introduced singly in each mutant. We have selected for these studies HA mutants that showed different internalization rates and varied in their tendency to aggregate into complexes larger than trimers. Our results indicate that the mode of interaction with coated pits (transient association-dissociation versus stable entrapment) depends on the internalization signal and affects the internalization efficiency. Mutants that contain a strong internalization signal and undergo fast endocytosis were entrapped in coated pits for the entire duration of the lateral mobility measurement, suggesting stable association with (slow dissociation from) coated pits. A mutant with a suboptimal internalization signal, which was internalized 10-fold slower, exhibited transient interactions with coated pits. Both types of interactions disappeared or were significantly reduced upon disruption of the clathrin lattices under hypertonic conditions, and were modulated following the “freezing” of coated pits by cytosol acidification. Unlike the dependence on the cytoplasmic internalization signal, the interactions with coated pits did not depend on the aggregation state (measured by sucrose gradient centrifugation after solubilization in n-octylglucoside) of the mutants.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis plays important roles in the recycling of membrane proteins, receptor down-regulation, and signal termination(1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W.

There are also indications that aggregation of certain receptors may induce their endocytosis, as suggested by the need for dimerization to trigger the internalization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorHAinfluenza hemagglutininTMRtetramethylrhodamineSTIsoybean trypsin inhibitorHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFPRfluorescence photobleaching recoverywtwild typeKApotassium-amiloride. , or Neu receptors(2Ullrich A.

In order to characterize the interactions of membrane proteins with coated pits in intact cells, we have recently developed a method based on comparative studies of the lateral mobilities of native and specifically mutated membrane proteins and demonstrated that it can measure their interactions with coated pits at the surface of living cells(25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In studies conducted on several cell types and several different membrane proteins, we have demonstrated that two modes of interactions with coated pits can be encountered, dynamic interactions (several association/dissociation cycles during the measurement) (25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Katzir Z. Nardi N. Geffen I. Fuhrer C. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21568-21575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or stable association with coated pits(27Gilboa L. Ben-Levy R. Yarden Y. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7061-7067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In view of the large variety of internalization signals and the possible contribution of additional parameters, such as higher complex formation (aggregation) to the interactions with coated pits, it was desired to explore the relationships between the mode of these interactions (transient association/dissociation versus stable association) and internalization efficiency. To investigate this issue, we applied the lateral mobility-based approach to a series of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) mutants whose cytoplasmic domain contains different internalization signals. The absence of an internalization signal in wild-type HA (HA wt), which is excluded from coated pits(9Lazarovits J. Roth M.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), enables a direct comparison between specific internalization signals introduced one at a time in each mutant. We have focused on HA mutants that were internalized at different rates (28Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) and varied in their tendency to form higher complexes (larger than the trimeric HA wt). Our results indicate that, depending on the specific internalization signal, the HA mutants can shift all the way from no interactions to stable entrapment in coated pits, and that a shift from transient to stable entrapment correlates with significantly higher internalization rates. On the other hand, microaggregation (higher complex formation) per se does not have a major effect on the interactions with coated pits. Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) 5-isothiocyanate was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Restriction enzymes and T4-DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), n-octylglucoside, amiloride hydrochloride, Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma. 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine (Tran35S-label) were from ICN (Irvine, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum that recognized all forms of the Japan HA (A/Japan/305/57 strain) was employed throughout. Monovalent Fab‘ fragments were prepared from the IgG fraction as described elsewhere (29Henis Y.I. Gutman O. Loyter A. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 160: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and tagged with TMR 5-isothiocyanate using standard procedures (30Brandtzaeg P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1973; 2: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The Fab‘ preparation was free of contamination by F(ab‘)2 or IgG, as judged by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Several mutants were prepared from the cDNA encoding the A/Japan/305/57 HA and introduced into the SV40-based vector pkSVE(31Roth M.G. Doyle C. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mutants are depicted in Table 1. The derivation of the mutants HA+8 (containing a carboxyl-terminal extension of eight amino acids with four aromatic residues, generating a strong internalization signal), HA+4 (which is HA+8 minus the last four residues), and HA+8-S548,S554 (HA+8 with the tyrosines at positions 548 and 554 replaced by serines) is detailed elsewhere(28Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). HA-Y543, which is a point mutant of HA wt (cysteine 543 replaced by tyrosine), was described previously(9Lazarovits J. Roth M.G. Cell. 1988; 53: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recombinant SV40 virus stocks were prepared in CV-1 monkey fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) using the appropriate pkSVE vector together with the dl1055 helper virus as described earlier (32Doyle C. Roth M.G. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4831-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biological Industries, Beth Haemek, Israel) or Serum Plus (Hazleton, Lenexa, KS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For lateral mobility studies by fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR), CV-1 cells were infected with second passage recombinant virus stocks, and the experiments were performed 36-46 h postinfection (depending on the HA mutant; see below). For experiments on HA complex formation (aggregation), the incubation period post infection was 32 h.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Subconfluent CV-1 cells were infected with recombinant viruses as previously described(25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Naim H.Y. Roth M.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4831-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were grown postinfection for 36-38 h (for HA wt and HA+4) or 44-46 h (for HA+8 and HA+8-S548,S554). The longer incubations after infection used for the latter two mutants were selected to achieve surface density closer to that of HA wt, as the percentage of these mutants at the cell surface is significantly lower(28Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with cold HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES and 2% BSA (HBSS/HEPES/BSA, pH 7.2), and labeled with anti-HA TMR-Fab‘ (100 μg/ml, 30 min, 4°C). In cases where the cells were preincubated in specific buffers to alter coated pit structure (see below), the specific buffers employed for each treatment were used throughout all antibody-incubation and subsequent steps, including the FPR measurements (see following section). After three washes, the coverslips carrying the live cells were taken for FPR measurements. Lateral diffusion coefficients (D) and mobile fractions (RF) of the HA mutants were measured by FPR(34Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 35Koppel D.E. Axelrod D. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1315-1329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) using previously described instrumentation(36Henis Y.I. Gutman O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 762: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After labeling the infected cells as described above, the coverslip was placed (cells facing downward) over a serological slide with a depression filled with HBSS/HEPES/BSA (or with the buffers used to alter coated pit structure) and equilibrated at the desired temperature using a thermostated microscope stage. For untreated cells, whose coated pit-mediated internalization was not blocked, samples were replaced within 15 min at the measurement temperature (10 or 22°C) to minimize endocytosis of the mutants that undergo fast internalization (HA+8 and HA+8-S548,S554; Table 1) which could lead to their immobilization. For the same reason, such experiments were not conducted at 37°C. The similar values of D and RF at the beginning and end of this period demonstrated that the contribution of such effects to the measurements was negligible. The monitoring laser beam (Coherent Innova 70 argon ion laser; 529.5 nm, 1 microwatt) was focused through the microscope (Zeiss Universal) to a gaussian radius of 0.61 ± 0.02 μm, using 100× oil immersion objective. A brief pulse (5 milliwatts, 30-60 ms) bleached 50-70% of the fluorescence in the illuminated region. The time course of fluorescence recovery was followed by the attenuated monitoring beam. D and RF were extracted from the fluorescence recovery curves by nonlinear regression analysis(37Petersen N.O. Felder S. Elson E.L. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C.C. Herzenberg L.A. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd., Edinburgh1986: 24.1-24.23Google Scholar). Incomplete fluorescence recovery was interpreted to represent fluorescent-labeled molecules immobile on the FPR experimental time scale (D ≤ 5 × 10-12 cm2/s). The treatments employed were incubation in a hypertonic medium (38Daukas G. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 39Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W.

Hypertonic treatment, which blocks endocytosis via coated pits by dispersing the underlying clathrin lattices(39Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 40Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), was performed by 15-min incubation (37°C) in HBSS/HEPES/BSA supplemented with 0.45 M sucrose or 0.225 M NaCl. The cells were kept in hypertonic medium during labeling and FPR measurements. Cytosol acidification, which alters the coated pit structure and eliminates endocytosis by blocking the pinching-off of clathrin-coated vesicles, was performed as described earlier(25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 41Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Peterson O.W. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in HEPES-buffered DMEM (pH 7.2) containing 30 mM NH4Cl (30 min, 37°C), followed by 5 min (37°C) in potassium-amiloride (KA) buffer (0.14 M KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM amiloride HCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). This buffer was replaced by cold KA containing 2% BSA, which was also used throughout the TMR-Fab‘ labeling and the FPR experiments. Thirty-two h after infection with recombinant SV40 viruses, CV-1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min at 37°C in DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine. A pulse of radiolabeled protein was initiated by subsequent incubation in the presence of Tran35S-label (15 min, 0.6 mCi/ml) and ended by removal of the labeling medium and addition of complete DMEM. After chasing for 120 min, the cells were lysed in cold buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 1% n-octylglucoside, 10 μg/ml STI, and 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin. After removing nuclei and cell debris by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 12 min, 70% of the lysate was applied to a 5-30% sucrose gradient formed above a 700-μl cushion of 60% sucrose. The gradient was prepared in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml STI, 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, and 1% n-octylglucoside. The gradients were centrifuged in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 40,000 rpm for 17 h at 18°C or 22°C; 700-μl fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. The amount of HA present in each fraction was analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and densitometry as described elsewhere(43Lazarovits J. Shia S.P. Ktistakis N. Lee M.S. Bird C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4760-4767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions of membrane proteins with immobile structures are capable of immobilizing them or of retarding their lateral motion(44Elson E.L. Reidler J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1979; 12: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Henis Y.I. Katzir Z. Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane-coated pits are essentially immobile on the FPR experimental time scale (46Barak L.S. Webb W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and can therefore retard the lateral mobility of membrane proteins destined for endocytosis. This phenomenon can be employed to characterize the interactions between these proteins and coated pits in live cells. Using HA wt (which is excluded from coated pits) as a control, we have used this approach to demonstrate that the internalization-competent HA-Y543 point mutant exhibits dynamic interactions with coated pits(25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The HA system is ideal for the exploration of the dependence of the mode of interactions with coated pits and the internalization rate on the internalization signal of the membrane protein, since various internalization signals can be introduced at the HA cytoplasmic tail, keeping the rest of the protein (which is devoid of any other internalization signals) unaltered. We have therefore performed lateral mobility studies on cells expressing HA mutants that differ in their cytoplasmic internalization signal and are internalized at highly different rates (28Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) (see Table 1). To further substantiate the involvement of coated pits in the effects measured, the experimental design also involved treatment of cells to disperse or alter the coated pit structure. Following the expression of the various HA mutants (see Table 1) in CV-1 cells, the HA proteins at the cell surface were labeled in the cold by monovalent anti-HA TMR-Fab‘ (to eliminate IgG-mediated cross-linking that may affect the mobility). FPR studies were conducted at 10 and 22°C (see “Experimental Procedures”). Measurements at 37°C were avoided due to the fast internalization of some of the HA mutants employed. Fig. 1shows that, while the lateral diffusion coefficients (D) of the three mutants measured (HA+8, HA+8-S548,S554, and HA+4) were similar to each other and to HA wt (representing an HA protein that does not interact with coated pits), the mobile fractions (RF) of the mutants that undergo fast internalization (HA+8 and HA+8-S548,S554; Table 1) were significantly lower than that of HA wt. In contrast, RF of HA+4 (truncated HA+8, which is internalized very slowly) (28Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) was similar to the RF value of HA wt (Fig. 1). The reduction in RF with no effect on D which was observed for HA+8 and HA+8-S548,S554 indicates that a subpopulation of these mutant molecules is entrapped by stable interactions with immobile structures (presumably coated pits) for the entire duration of the FPR measurement (about 1 min). The remainder of the cell-surface population of these molecules diffuse freely in the plasma membrane and do not show dynamic interactions with the immobile structures, which would reduce the average lateral diffusion rate(25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Elson E.L. Reidler J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1979; 12: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Henis Y.I. Katzir Z. Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reduction in RF of HA+8 and HA+8-S548,S554 was somewhat more pronounced at 22°C than at 10°C, suggesting that the mobility-restricting interactions are elevated at higher temperatures. This is in line with former observations (25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) on HA-Y543, which demonstrated temperature-dependent dynamic interactions with coated pits. As for HA+4, whose internalization is extremely slow(28Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), this mutant did not show detectable reduction in its lateral mobility, and diffused in the membrane in an unrestricted manner, just like HA wt. To validate that the lower RF values of HA+8 and HA+8-S548,S554 relative to HA wt are due to interactions with coated pits, we have determined the effects of treatments known to alter coated pit structure on the lateral mobility of HA wt and the three HA mutant proteins. The treatments employed were hypertonic medium treatment, which disperses the clathrin lattices underlying coated pits as well as flat clathrin lattices(39Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 40Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and cytosol acidification, which alters the morphology of the clathrin lattices leaving the coated pits associated with the plasma membrane(40Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 41Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Peterson O.W. van Deurs B. J.

These treatments were highly effective in CV-1 cells, as they completely inhibited the internalization of HA-Y543 and the endogenous transferrin receptors of CV-1 cells(25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Analogous results were obtained for HA+8(28Zwart D.E. Brewer C.B. Lazarovits J. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). An added benefit of these treatments was that they enabled FPR measurements on cells expressing the fast-internalized HA mutants also at 37°C, where the interactions with coated pits may be further enhanced(25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), since they blocked the otherwise rapid internalization of these mutants. The effect of treatments with hypertonic medium (containing sucrose or high NaCl) on the lateral mobilities of the HA proteins is depicted in Fig. 2. The hypertonic conditions induced a marked increase in the RF values of HA+8 and HA+8-S548,S554, raising them very close to the RF values observed for HA wt and HA+4, essentially abolishing the differences between the RF values of the various HA mutants. Thus, this treatment released most of the mutant HAs formerly entrapped in coated pits, in accord with our former observation (25Fire E. Zwart D.E. Roth M.G. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that the dynamic interactions of HA-Y543 with coated pits are abolished under hypertonic conditions. Interestingly, at 37°C (where the interactions with coated pits are more pro"

Recently we reported that Protein X is a NADPH-specific flavoprotein that binds specifically to FdI (Isas, J. M., and Burgess, B. K.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 19404-19409). The gene encoding this protein has now been cloned and sequenced. Protein X is 33% identical and has an overall 53% similarity with the fpr gene product from Escherichia coli that encodes NADPH:ferredoxin reductase. On the basis of this similarity and the similarity of the physical properties of the two proteins, we now designate Protein X as A. vinelandii NADPH:ferredoxin reductase and its gene as the fpr gene. The protein has been overexpressed in its native background in A. vinelandii by using the broad host range multicopy plasmid, pKT230. In addition to being regulated by FdI, the fpr gene product is overexpressed when A. vinelandii is grown under N2-fixing conditions even though the fpr gene is not preceded by a nif specific promoter. By analogy to what is known about fpr expression in E. coli, we propose that FdI may exert its regulatory effect on fpr by interacting with the SoxRS regulon."

https://openalex.org/W1986865178,"We have previously analyzed the effects of site-specific N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) adducts on the efficiency and frameshift fidelity of SV40-based DNA replication in a human cell extract (Thomas, D. C., Veaute, X., Kunkel, T. A., and Fuchs, R. P. P.(1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91, 7752-7756). Here we use two sets of substrates to examine the probability of replication termination and error-free and error-prone bypass of AAF adducts. The substrates contained site-specific adducts at one of three guanines in a NarI sequence (5′-GGCGCC-3′) placed within the lacZα reporter gene and located on the template for either leading or lagging strand replication. The presence of the adduct at any position strongly reduces the efficiency of a single round of replication in a HeLa cell extract. Product analysis reveals preferential replication of the undamaged strand and termination of replication of the damaged strand occurring one nucleotide before incorporation opposite either a leading or lagging strand adduct. Products resistant to restriction endonuclease cleavage at the adducted site were generated in amounts consistent with 16-48% lesion bypass during replication. Most of this bypass was error-free. However, two-nucleotide deletion errors were detected in the replication products of DNA containing an AAF adduct in either the leading or lagging strand, but only when present at the third guanine position. Collectively, the data suggest that the replication apparatus in a HeLa cell extract generates a template-primer slippage error at an AAF adduct once for every 30-100 bypass events. We have previously analyzed the effects of site-specific N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) adducts on the efficiency and frameshift fidelity of SV40-based DNA replication in a human cell extract (Thomas, D.

Collectively, the data suggest that the replication apparatus in a HeLa cell extract generates a template-primer slippage error at an AAF adduct once for every 30-100 bypass events. DNA replication in eukaryotic cells requires multiple proteins that function in an asymmetric manner to coordinately synthesize the leading and lagging strands (Kornberg and Baker, 1992). Given the asymmetry of replication of duplex DNA, unrepaired DNA adducts may have different potentials for blocking replication or promoting replication infidelity depending on whether the adduct is located on the leading or lagging strand. To examine this, we have been using the SV40 origin-dependent replication system (for review, see Stillman(1994), and references therein) as a model for human chromosomal replication. With this system, replication of undamaged DNA in mammalian cell extracts is highly accurate (Roberts and Kunkel, 1988; Hauser et al., 1988; Thomas et al., 1991). However, replication of DNA containing randomly placed cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPDcyclobutane pyrimidine dimerAAFN-2-acetylaminofluoreneAAF adductthe major adduct N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluoreneSV40simian virus 40T antigenSV40 large tumor antigenRF I DNAcovalently closed, circular, double-stranded DNARF II DNAnicked, circular, double-stranded DNApolpolymerase. is highly mutagenic (Thomas and Kunkel, 1993; Carty et al., 1993). The assay system was adapted (Roberts et al., 1991) to determine whether, as a result of the asymmetry of replication, CPD-induced errors arise at different rates during leading and lagging strand synthesis. Overall average error rates were equal for the leading and lagging strand replication machinery, with strand-specific differences in fidelity observed at some nucleotide positions (Thomas et al., 1993). cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer N-2-acetylaminofluorene the major adduct N-(2′-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene simian virus 40 SV40 large tumor antigen covalently closed, circular, double-stranded DNA nicked, circular, double-stranded DNA polymerase. For several years, we have studied the effects of an encounter between the replication fork and the major adduct of a known carcinogen, N-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) located at one template position. Studies in Escherichia coli have revealed that AAF, which binds primarily at the C-8 position of guanine, is a strong mutagen for −1 and −2 frameshift mutations (Fuchs et al., 1981; Koffel-Schwartz et al., 1984; Schaaper et al., 1990), particularly within repetitive sequences that permit slippage to form misaligned intermediates (Burnouf et al., 1989; Lambert et al., 1992). Mutagenesis within these sequences is strongly dependent on adduct location. Template modification at the 3′ most base in a run of guanines or at the third guanine in the NarI recognition sequence 5′-GGCGCC-3′ is much more mutagenic than at the other guanine residues because stable intermediates can form during replication (Lambert et al., 1992; Garcia et al., 1993; Milhéet al., 1994). More recently, we have extended these studies in human cell extracts using the SV40-based replication system. We examined the efficiency and frameshift fidelity of replication of DNA containing a site-specific AAF adduct present at one of the three guanine positions in the NarI sequence, each on the leading strand template relative to the first fork to encounter the adduct (Thomas et al., 1994). The primary effect of the adduct was to inhibit replication. When replication of the damaged template did occur, evidence was obtained for error-free lesion bypass with all three substrates, and for error-prone lesion bypass with the substrate that carries the AAF adduct at the third guanine. When a ColE1-derived plasmid is replicated in E. coli, site-specific AAF adducts induced both −1 and −2 frameshift mutations at a 20-fold higher frequency when the adduct is located on the lagging strand as compared to the leading strand (Veaute and Fuchs, 1993). We hypothesized that the asymmetry of leading and lagging strand replication enzymology in human cells might also affect the frequency of mutations induced by AAF adducts. For this study we constructed two sets of four DNA substrates, each containing the SV40 replication origin and either no damage or a single, site-specific AAF adduct at one of the three guanines in a NarI sequence. In both sets of substrates, the adducts are located asymmetrically relative to the origin of replication, such that they will be encountered first by either the leading or lagging strand replication apparatus. After replication in a human cell extract, we performed product analyses to quantitatively compare the probabilities of replication termination, error-free bypass and sequence context-dependent, error-prone bypass. E. coli strains and construction of substrates containing site-specific AAF adducts have been described previously (Burnouf et al., 1989; Veaute and Fuchs, 1993). The substrates (Fig. 1A) are described below. Unmodified substrate (G0) was prepared by the same procedure as for AAF-containing DNAs, starting with mock treatment of the oligonucleotide used to insert the adduct. Radionuclides were from Amersham Corp.; T antigen was from Molecular Biology Resources. Enzymes were from New England Biolabs or U. S. Biochemical Corp. Extracts were prepared as described (Li and Kelly, 1985). Reactions (25 μl) containing [α-32P]dCTP, 100 μM dNTPs, 10-20 ng of DNA, and other components as described (Roberts and Kunkel, 1993) were incubated for 1 h (or for times indicated in Fig. 2) at 37°C. One-tenth of each reaction was collected on filters following precipitation with trichloroacetic acid to determine total incorporation. Following purification of the DNA (Roberts and Kunkel, 1993), an aliquot of each replication reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis (55 V) on a 1.1% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The dried gel was exposed to a phosphor screen for scanning and products quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Repair 2We refer to repair of AAF adducts as any process leading to loss of the adduct such that the NarI sequence is rendered sensitive to BsaHI restriction endonuclease. of adducts was measured by incubating 32P-radiolabeled substrate in a standard reaction mixture in the absence of T antigen for 1 h. Following purification of the DNA by the same procedure used for replication products, the samples were treated with 1 unit of restriction endonuclease BsaHI (an isoschizomer of NarI) for 1 h at 60°C. The samples were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the dried gel was quantitated as described above. Repair (expressed in percent) was calculated by dividing the sum of the two cleavage products (cut) by the sum of the intensities of the band resistant to cleavage (uncut) plus the two cleavage products, after subtracting background values for a blank region of the gel. Purified DNA samples were digested with 1 unit of AvaII for 1 h at 37°C to linearize the DNA and then with 1 unit of BsaHI for 1 h at 60°C. The samples were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the dried gel was quantitated as described above. Lesion bypass was calculated as described in the legend to Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Following purification, replicated DNA samples were digested with DpnI. The lacZ α-complementation reversion frequencies for control and replicated DNAs were determined by electroporation of E. coli strain JM103 to score blue and white colonies on LB indicator plates containing ampicillin, as described (Burnouf et al., 1989). The assay scores errors that restore the correct reading frame (lacZ+) from the +2 reading frame (lacZ-) of the starting DNA as blue colonies. White colonies represent the remaining total of replicated products. Replicated samples were processed as usual and digested with PvuII and EcoRI in a 30-μl reaction, using conditions optimal for PvuII. The samples were desalted, lyophilized, dissolved in 10 μl of formamide loading dye, and resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Bands on the dried gel were quantitated as above. Two sets of DNA substrates were prepared (Fig. 1, A and B). Each set consists of a control lacking an AAF adduct and substrates with an AAF adduct on one of the three different guanines in a NarI sequence G1G2CG3CC in the lacZα reporter gene of pUC8. All substrates contain the SV40 origin of replication to support T antigen-dependent DNA replication in a human cell extract. The two sets differ only in the relative orientation of the restriction fragment containing the reporter gene. When modified with AAF, the pMKBNar substrate contains the adduct on the leading strand template with respect to the closest replication fork emanating from the SV40 origin (Fig. 1C). When pMZBNar is used, the adduct will be located on the lagging strand template (Fig. 1D). The distances that the closest fork must travel from the SV40 origin to the first nucleotide of the NarI site are 520 and 585 nucleotides for the leading and lagging strand vectors, respectively, distances representing 19 and 21% of the total size of the plasmid. For simplicity, the substrates of each series are referred to as leading or lagging strand substrates and identified by the position of the adduct (G0, G1, G2, or G3). The lacZα gene coding sequence of all substrates is in the +2 reading frame, yielding white colonies on indicator plates. Mutations restoring the correct reading frame (e.g. two-nucleotide deletions) are detected as blue colonies. Previous replication reactions with substrates containing site-specific AAF adducts were performed for 4 h (Thomas et al., 1994), potentially allowing enough time for more than one round of replication. This could significantly alter the product distribution obtained with substrates in which only one of the two strands contains a bulky adduct. Therefore, we began the present study by analyzing the replication products obtained at different incubation times to measure the fraction of products representing more than one round of replication. Both strands of the input DNA are methylated at adenines in 5′-GATC-3′ sequences. A single round of replication generates hemimethylated DNA, whereas multiple rounds yield unmethylated DNA. The proportion of unmethylated, replicated DNA can be quantitated by digesting the radiolabeled reaction products with restriction endonuclease MboI. This enzyme cleaves only unmethylated DNA, leaving hemimethylated products intact. The results of a time course for T antigen-dependent replication of undamaged and damaged DNA are shown in Fig. 2. Radiolabeled replication products are detected after a 30-min reaction, and product yield significantly increased in incubations of 1 h or longer. No MboI cleavage products were detected in 30 min. As the incubation time is increased, substantially more MboI cleavage products were observed. In 1-h reactions with G0 DNA, these products comprise approximately 7% of the total. This increases to 29% at 2 h and 38% by 3 h. For G3 DNA, these values were about 5% at 1 h, 29% at 2 h, and 51% at 3 h. Based on these data, we chose to perform subsequent replication reactions for 1 h, because the products at this time point predominantly reflect one round of replication and the yield of replicated DNA was adequate for further analysis. To more accurately quantitate lesion bypass efficiency and replication fidelity, we next examined the extent of repair of AAF adducts by the same HeLa cell extract used for replication. We took advantage of an earlier observation that the AAF-modified NarI site is insensitive to cleavage by restriction endonuclease BsaHI (Thomas et al., 1994). Radiolabeled control and modified DNAs were incubated in the extract in the absence of T antigen. The products were purified, treated with BsaHI, and resolved on an agarose gel (Fig. 3). The undamaged G0 sample (lagging strand substrate) was completely cleaved. In contrast, while most of the G1 and G3 DNA products were insensitive to cleavage, some digestion was observed. Quantitative analysis of the results in Fig. 3suggests that after a 1-h incubation in the extract, 14% of the G1 and G3 modified substrates were rendered adduct-free. T antigen-dependent replication reactions were performed for 1 h in the same HeLa cell extract. In three separate experiments, all modified substrates were replicated ~30% less efficiently than was the unmodified control substrate when total T antigen-dependent nucleotide incorporation was considered. Following precipitation and extraction of the products, a portion of each sample was subjected to electrophoresis on an agarose gel (Fig. 4). The alternate lanes marked(-) for BsaHI + AvaII treatment represent the undigested products of reactions with G0, G1, and G3 DNAs. This product distribution is typical of the pattern obtained previously with damaged or undamaged DNA (Thomas and Kunkel, 1993; Thomas et al., 1994) and includes covalently closed monomer-length products (RF I), as well as relaxed and linear DNAs and some high molecular weight species. To avoid overexposure, the volume of material loaded in each lane varied, and product yields were calculated by extrapolation after quantitation with the PhosphorImager. The yields of covalently closed monomer replication products were reduced on average by about 55% for each of the damaged DNAs relative to the undamaged DNA controls. Similar results were obtained with both series of substrates. To determine if the replicated, damaged DNA retained the AAF adduct, replication products were digested first by MboI, to cleave products having undergone more than one round of replication, and then by AvaII and BsaHI. AvaII was included to achieve better resolution of fragments of interest, while BsaHI-resistant products are inferred to have retained the AAF adduct (or to have a sequence change at the NarI site; see below). The results are shown in Fig. 4, in the alternate lanes marked (+) for BsaHI + AvaII treatment. Digestion of the products of replication of the undamaged G0 substrates with AvaII and BsaHI yielded several bands as predicted from complete digestion and from the location of the known sites (Fig. 1 and legend to Fig. 4). The largest of these bands is shown in the autoradiogram (indicated as cut), while higher mobility bands are not shown. Bands at these same positions were observed with the G1 and G3 substrates in both orientations. However, a new band (indicated as uncut) was observed with the G1 and G3 substrates. For the lagging strand G1 and G3 substrates, the mobility of this band is as predicted by lack of incision at the NarI site containing the AAF adduct. The same is true for the leading strand vector, but here the mobility of the “uncut” band is slightly lower, as predicted by the different location of the adducted NarI site relative to its neighbors. The data are consistent with the interpretation that this band represents replicated DNA containing the AAF adduct. To estimate the amount of translesion replication inferred from this result, the uncut band intensities were determined after subtracting background values for minus-T antigen controls (not shown) and the G0 sample. This value was then used to calculate the percentage of BsaHI-resistant product, after correcting for the amount of adduct removed in a 1-h incubation in the extract (Fig. 3, and see legend to Table 1). Estimates ranged from 17 to 24% and were similar for all four substrates (Table 1). Following a replication reaction for 1 h in a HeLa cell extract, samples were purified, digested with PvuII and EcoRI, and then separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Staggered incision by EcoRI generates strands differing in length by four nucleotides. Fig. 5(A and B) depicts the expected lengths of the two strands for the fragment containing the adduct and for a flanking fragment. A PhosphorImager print of the gel is shown in Fig. 5C. Note the relative intensities of the two bands representing each full-length restriction fragment. For the undamaged substrates the relative band intensities are about equal. In contrast, for the damaged substrates one band is substantially less intense than the other. For both fragments and each damaged substrate in either orientation, the band of lesser intensity represents the replication product synthesized from the damage-containing template strand. Quantitative analysis of band intensities (not shown), including an adjustment for cytosine content (the radiolabeled nucleotide), shows that both strands of the undamaged substrates are replicated with equal efficiency. In contrast, with the AAF-modified substrates the undamaged strand is replicated preferentially over the damaged strand, by factors ranging from 2.2 to 3.3, during a 1-h incubation. Also observed in Fig. 5C are unique bands in each of the lanes containing products of replication of the modified substrates. The lengths and relative positions of these bands strongly suggest that they are the products of termination of replication of the adducted template strand, as suggested by our previous study (Thomas et al., 1994). The exact lengths of the bands in Fig. 5C were unequivocally determined by mixing an aliquot of each sample with the products of a chain termination sequencing reaction. The results (not shown) suggest that with the G1, G2, and G3 substrates in both orientations, replication terminated after incorporation opposite the template nucleotide immediately preceding the adducted guanine. The intensities of these bands were quantitated and compared to the values for the full-length strand (120 nucleotides) and the complementary strand (124 nucleotides) after adjusting for cytosine content and DNA repair (see above). For the products of replication of all six modified substrates, the sums of the pixel values for the termination bands and the 120-nucleotide product are similar to the values for the complementary 124-nucleotide fragment (Table 2). The relative values are not exactly 100%, perhaps reflecting low levels of second-round synthesis and/or some replication by the fork arriving from the other direction.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Values for the ratio of termination band intensity to the 124-nucleotide fragment intensity ranged from 69 to 95% (Table 2). We suggest that these represent the probability that replication terminates upon encountering an adduct. Correspondingly, the ratio of the 120-nucleotide fragment intensity to the 124-nucleotide fragment intensity may approximate the probability of lesion bypass, which is needed for synthesis of full-length restriction fragment. These probabilities ranged from 16 to 27%. We next compared frameshift replication error rates when the AAF adduct was present on the leading or lagging strand relative to the closest fork emanating from the SV40 origin. Reactions were performed as above, and replicated samples were digested with DpnI to remove unreplicated or incompletely replicated molecules. Controls included untreated substrates and those incubated in the extract but without T antigen. These controls were not subsequently treated with DpnI, as this would destroy the unreplicated (fully methylated) molecules. DNA samples were introduced by electroporation into an E. coli α-complementation host, and cells were plated to score white colonies as well as blue colonies resulting from restoration of the correct reading frame in the lacZ reporter gene. As noted previously, transfection of unreplicated G1 or G2 DNAs, or the same DNAs incubated with the extract in the absence of T antigen, yielded revertant frequencies only slightly above the background established with undamaged G0 DNA (Thomas et al., 1994). We have noted similar results with the G1 and G2 substrates in either orientation (Table 3). Control values obtained for the G3 DNAs were higher than the other DNAs, ranging from 4.0 to 6.6 × 10-4 (Table 3). These higher values are consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that the G3 adduct is mutagenic in E. coli (Burnouf et al., 1989; Veaute and Fuchs, 1993).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Only the products of replication of the G3 substrates yielded revertant frequencies above background levels (Table 3). For the leading strand vector the frequencies were about 6-fold above the minus-T antigen control, indicating that most of the blue colonies reflected errors generated during replication in the HeLa cell extract. Revertant frequency values for the lagging strand vector were roughly 3-fold higher than with the leading strand vector and ~20-fold above background reversion frequencies. Sequence analysis of revertants from the G3 reaction products demonstrated the deletion of a GC dinucleotide from the NarI site. The data showing preferential replication of the undamaged strand (Fig. 5C) led us to next examine whether multiple rounds of replication of the undamaged strand lead to an underestimate of AAF-dependent replication infidelity. To test this, we treated the G3 product DNA with MboI to digest second-round replication products. The effect on revertant frequencies was negligible with both G3-modified substrates (Table 3, values in parentheses). The appearance of BsaHI-resistant replication products consistent with lesion bypass (Fig. 4) suggests that AAF adduct blockage of replication (Fig. 5C) is not absolute. Therefore, we next examined whether longer incubation times influenced revertant frequencies. The effect on reversion frequencies for the substrate containing the lagging strand adduct were negligible (values of 94, 120, and 110 × 10-4, respectively, for incubations of 60, 90, and 120 min). However, the reversion frequencies for the substrate containing the leading strand adduct were increased (values of 33, 51, and 77 × 10-4, respectively, for incubations of 60, 90, and 120 min). Thus, the ~3-fold difference between leading and lagging strand values for a 1-h incubation was reduced to only a 1.4-fold difference after 2 h. We next attempted to determine whether the rate of AAF-induced deletion errors is affected by replication conditions that modulate proofreading. The contribution of proofreading to the fidelity of replication of undamaged DNA (reviewed by Roberts and Kunkel(1995)) has been assessed by increasing the dNTP concentration in the reaction. This selectively stimulates the rate of polymerization from a mispaired or misaligned intermediate, allowing less opportunity to edit the mistake. Alternatively, proofreading exonuclease activity can be inhibited by adding to the reaction a dNMP, the end product of exonuclease action. Both approaches were used in the present study for replication of the two G3-modified substrates (Table 4). With the leading strand substrate, the revertant frequency of replication products from reactions containing 1000 μM dNTPs was 12-fold higher than from reactions containing 10 μM dNTPs, while an intermediate revertant frequency was obtained for the 100 μM reaction. A similar effect was seen for the lagging strand substrate, but the maximum difference was 4.4-fold. Note that in a 1-h reaction containing 1000 μM dNTPs, the two substrates are copied with about equal fidelity (Table 4, compare 470 × 10-4 to 440 × 10-4). The addition of 2 mM dGMP to reactions containing 100 μM dNTPs had little effect on reversion frequencies with either G3-modified substrate.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The present investigation is an extension of our earlier study (Thomas et al., 1994) of the efficiency and fidelity of replication in human cell extracts of DNA containing unique AAF adducts located at defined template positions. The two main objectives here were to be as quantitative as possible and to compare the effects of adducts on replication by leading and lagging strand replication proteins. Thus, we first established conditions to obtain primarily one round of replication in vitro (1-h incubation, Fig. 2) and then determined the level of adduct repair activity in the extract (14%, Fig. 3) under these conditions. Subsequent analyses of the replication products (Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Tables II-IV) then permit a quantitative estimate of the probability of replication termination and error-free and error-prone translesion synthesis. The primary effect of an AAF adduct is termination of replication. The present study precisely maps the site of termination as occurring after incorporation opposite the template nucleotide immediately preceding the adduct, in all six site-specifically modified substrates examined (Fig. 5C). We did not observe detectable termination at any upstream template positions or after incorporation opposite the adduct itself. Thus, any incorporation that does occur opposite the adduct likely has one of three fates: (i) correct extension, (ii) misalignment followed by extension (see below), or (iii) excision by a nuclease. The termination pattern observed during synthesis by the human replication apparatus is much simpler than that observed with the replicative DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of E. coli (Belguise-Valladier et al., 1994). That multisubunit enzyme complex terminates synthesis at several upstream locations preceding site-specifically AAF-adducted guanines. The pattern observed in Fig. 5C is also simpler than that observed with exonuclease-deficient DNA pol α and pol β, which terminate synthesis both before and opposite AAF adducts (Rabkin and Strauss(1984), and references therein). Incorporation studies with AAF-adducted substrates using eukaryotic DNA polymerases having intrinsic 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activities have not been reported. The presence of BsaHI-resistant radiolabeled products (Fig. 4) suggests that AAF adducts are present in the replicated DNA and, thus, are not absolute blocks to replication. Quantitative analysis shows that approximately 17 to 24% of the products are BsaHI-resistant with all substrates examined. (Note that the ~1% mutagenesis for two-base deletions at the NarI site observed with the G3 vectors (Table 3) should not contribute significantly to the population of BsaHI-resistant products). Since these products are derived from replication of both the damaged and undamaged strand, the efficiency of bypass per encounter with an AAF adduct in the damaged strand is 2-fold higher than this value, i.e. 34-48%. Lesion bypass efficiencies estimated from quantitative analysis of full-length restriction fragments versus termination bands (Fig. 5C) are also high, ranging from 16 to 27% (Table 2). The data suggest that the human replication apparatus in a HeLa cell extract can bypass one-sixth to one-half of all AAF adducts encountered. This is remarkable given the evidence for high fidelity replication with undamaged substrates (Izuta et al.(1995), and references therein). It is also remarkable from a structural perspective. Although the structures of the major eukaryotic cellular replicative DNA polymerases are not yet known, some information does exist for Klenow DNA polymerase (Joyce and Steitz, 1994), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (Kohlstaedt et al., 1992; Jacobo-Molina et al., 1993), T7 RNA polymerase (Sousa et al., 1993), and pol β (Pelletier et al., 1994). These studies suggest numerous contacts between DNA polymerases and template-primers that might be severely perturbed by the presence of an adduct as bulky as the AAF adduct studied here. A bulky adduct might be expected to strongly reduce polymerase binding and/or translocation, as evidenced by the AAF-induced termination of synthesis observed with numerous DNA polymerases (e.g. see above). Thus, frequent bypass by the multiprotein replication complex implies a major role for replication accessory proteins in assisting lesion bypass. Logical candidates for modulating lesion bypass during eukaryotic chromosomal replication of damaged DNA are proteins that influence polymerase• template-primer binding and/or translocation, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which confers high processivity to pol δ (for review see Stillman(1994), and references therein). The data in Table 3demonstrate that replication of the G3-modified substrate is mutagenic, whereas replication of the other two modified substrates is not. This is consistent with a model wherein the replication apparatus first incorporates cytosine opposite the modified guanine (Lambert et al., 1992). The template-primer then slips such that the two terminal bases in the primer (3′-CpG-5′) hydrogen-bond with a repeated downstream complementary 5′-GpC-3′ dinucleotide in the template, thus forming a misaligned intermediate (Schaaper et al., 1990). Continued synthesis from this intermediate leads to a two-base deletion error. This model predicts that mutagenesis should result from adducts in the G3 but not the G1 or G2 positions, because, given the sequence at the NarI site, only the former allows formation of a misaligned intermediate stabilized by two terminal base pairs. This prediction was realized in E. coli (Burnouf et al., 1989; Veaute and Fuchs, 1993), in our previous study of T antigen-dependent replication in a HeLa cell extract (Thomas et al., 1994) and in this study. The revertant frequencies in Table 3are for G3 adduct-dependent replication errors among total replication products generated in a single round of replication and can therefore be used to estimate quantitatively the probability of error-free versus error-prone bypass. Given the average ~3-fold bias in replication of the undamaged strand (Fig. 5C), a revertant frequency of 1% for the lagging strand G3-modified substrate (Table 3) suggests that 3% of the products of replication of the damaged strand are mutagenic with this substrate in a 1-h incubation. A similar approach suggests that ~1% of bypass events is mutagenic in a 1-h reaction with the leading strand G3-modified substrate. These estimates are limited to errors that restore the correct reading frame, which in this and our previous study are two-base deletions. Two asymmetries are observed during T antigen-dependent replication of AAF adduct-modified DNAs in the extract. These are a 3-fold difference in AAF adduct-induced replication infidelity with the two opposite-orientation G3-modified substrates (Table 3) and preferential replication of the undamaged strand (Fig. 5C). The latter could reflect uncoupling of the first replication fork to encounter the adduct, such that replication of the undamaged strand continues while replication of the damaged strand is completely or transiently blocked. Evidence exists that uncoupling can occur under some circumstances in E. coli (Koffel-Schwartz et al., 1987) 3R. P. P. Fuchs, unpublished observations. and during SV40 replication in vivo (Burhans et al., 1991). Alternatively, the first fork may not replicate either strand beyond the lesion, with preferential replication of the undamaged strand accomplished by the fork arriving from the other direction in the circular substrate. By this same logic, the 3-fold difference in revertant frequencies can be explained in more than one way. If bypass is catalyzed by the first fork to encounter the adduct, then the difference suggests that the leading strand replication apparatus is 3-fold more accurate than the lagging strand apparatus. Alternatively, error-prone lesion bypass replication may be accomplished only by the fork arriving from the other direction. For example, it is formally possible that much or all of the error-prone lesion bypass synthesis with both G3-modified substrates is catalyzed by the lagging strand replication apparatus. Consistent with this idea, mutagenesis with the leading strand G3 vector increases with increasing incubation time, while that with the lagging strand substrate remains about the same. Given two replication forks and use of a circular substrate, several explanations are consistent with the existing data. It is also possible that the lesion bypass synthesis in the extract is catalyzed by proteins other than those normally comprising a replication fork. It may be possible to resolve these issues in the future using reactions reconstituted from purified proteins or using much larger replicons or substrates containing a replication termination signal. Several observations suggest that the misaligned intermediate believed to be responsible for the AAF-dependent deletion errors might be edited by proofreading during replication. First, the evidence presented here for substantial bypass implies that incorporation opposite an AAF adduct is possible, but the bands in Fig. 5C indicate termination of incorporation one base before the adduct but not opposite the adduct itself. This may be interpreted in light of the observation that proofreading-proficient Klenow polymerase generated a termination pattern similar to that seen here, while the exonuclease-deficient polymerase terminated synthesis after incorporation opposite the adduct (Belguise-Valladier et al., 1994). This indicates that a proofreading exonuclease can remove incorporations opposite the adduct. Moreover, the presumed premutational intermediate in this study contains two terminal base pairs and an unpaired modified GpC dinucleotide in the template strand. Several studies suggest that undamaged misaligned intermediates formed during synthesis by proofreading-proficient DNA polymerases (Bebenek et al., 1990; Bebenek and Kunkel, 1990; Thomas et al., 1991; Kunkel et al., 1994) and during T antigen-dependent replication in extracts (Roberts et al., 1993) are subject to editing by exonucleases. In this study, the rate of AAF-induced deletion errors was substantially increased by increasing the dNTP concentration in the reaction (Table 4). This observation is consistent with selective stimulation of polymerization from a misaligned intermediate, allowing less opportunity to proofread the error. The fact that the dNTP-dependent increase was greater with the substrate containing the adduct in the leading strand relative to the first fork to encounter the adduct is consistent with more active proofreading by the leading strand replication apparatus. As discussed above, other explanations are also possible. The second approach to modulate deletion error rates by modulating proofreading, inhibition of exonuclease activity by adding dGMP to the reaction, yielded very small effects (Table 4). Lack of a monophosphate effect on frameshift fidelity during T antigen-dependent replication was also observed with undamaged substrates in an earlier study (Roberts et al., 1993). The reason for this is unclear, especially since addition of dGMP to a replication reaction clearly reduces base substitution fidelity with normal substrates (Roberts et al., 1991; Izuta et al., 1995) and with a dNTP analog (Minnick et al., 1995). The estimates of termination and error-free and error-prone bypass presented here are for replication in a HeLa cell extract. It will be interesting to obtain similar estimates using extracts of normal human fibroblasts (Boyer et al., 1993) or cell lines having defects in mismatch repair or nucleotide excision repair We thank John D.

https://openalex.org/W2080625400,"Calspermin is a high affinity Ca2+/calmodulin binding protein that is found only in postmeiotic male germ cells. Our previous studies have shown that the calspermin transcript is produced by utilization of a testis-specific promoter located within an intron of the calmodulin kinase IV gene. This promoter contains two cAMP response element-like motifs that bind the testis-specific transcription factor CREMτ. This interaction is required for transcriptional activation. Here we describe a novel regulatory element, the 111-base pair first intron of the calspermin gene, which is also required for enhancement of transcription by CREMτ via the cAMP response element motifs. Deletion or inversion of this intron results in loss of CREMτ-mediated stimulation of transcription. However, CREMτ stimulates calspermin promoter activity when the intron is moved upstream of the promoter but only when inserted in the proper orientation. Footprint, linker scanning, and deletion analyses were used to identify regulatory elements in the intron. We suggest that the intron functions as an orientation-dependent but position-independent regulatory element to activate the calspermin promoter by facilitating the stimulatory effect of CREMτ on transcription.

During postnatal development of the rat testis, calspermin mRNA is first detected at day 24 and reaches the high levels characteristic of the adult at about day 35. Therefore, expression of the calspermin gene is both tissue-specific and developmentally regulated.

Primer extension assays have mapped the calspermin transcription initiation site within an intron of the CaM kinase IV gene, which is at least 35 kilobases downstream of the kinase transcription initiation site. 2Z. Sun, R. L. Means, B. LeMagueresse, and A. R. Means, submitted for publication. Our previous studies showed that the calspermin transcript is produced by utilization of a testis-specific promoter within the same intron of the CaM kinase IV gene that contains the initiation site of the calspermin transcript(6Sun Z.

Ca2+/calmodulindependent protein kinase IV base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction cAMP response element chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Multiple regulatory elements contribute to the testis-specific expression of the calspermin gene. Results from analysis of transgenic mice demonstrate that the −200 to +321 region of the calspermin promoter is sufficient to direct expression of a β-galactosidase reporter gene specifically to testis of postpubertal transgenic mice.2 We suggested that this region contained at least three regulatory elements. First, there are negative regulatory elements between nucleotides −200 and −80 that may contribute to silencing the calspermin gene in somatic cells. This is based on the finding that whereas a transgene containing the −80 to +361 region of the gene is transcriptionally active in NIH3T3 cells, the −200 to +361 region is inactive(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Second, there are two CRE-like motifs at −70 and −50 that bind the testis-specific transcription factor CREMτ. Interaction of CREMτ with the CRE sites is required for maximal transcription from the calspermin promoter in NIH3T3 cells(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of CREMτ is sufficient to restore activity to an otherwise inactive calspermin promoter in NIH3T3 cells and to a calspermin promoter-LacZ chimeric transgene in skin fibroblasts prepared from transgenic mice, which normally express the transgene only in testis (6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 2 From these data, we suggested that CREMτ is the transcription factor primarily responsible for activation of the calspermin gene in testis. Third, we postulated that the 111-bp intron from +130 to +241 might also serve a regulatory role since maximal promoter activity was obtained with constructs that included this region(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that this element is absolutely required for CREMτ to activate transcription from the calspermin promoter. We demonstrate that CREMτ stimulates transcription from a wild-type calspermin promoter in NIH3T3 cells but not from the promoter when the intron is deleted or inverted. By placing the intron in different positions and different orientations, we show that the intron serves as a regulatory element in an orientation-dependent but position-independent manner. A region within the intron is protected from DNase I digestion by nuclear extract from NIH3T3 cells. 5′, 3′, and internal deletions of the intron sequence were made to identify regulatory elements. Based on these data we conclude that the entire 111-bp intron is required to facilitate the effect of CREMτ. We suggest that multiple factors must bind to the intronic sequence to enable CREMτ interacting with the CREs to regulate transcription of the calspermin gene. Linker scan mutagenesis of the first intron of the calspermin gene was performed using PCR. The DNA fragment between −80 and +361 was divided into two segments from the site where the linker cassette was located. A novel restriction enzyme site was created in the linker cassette to replace the intron sequence. The restriction sites used were KpnI, BglI, and NotI to create 6-, 8-, and 11-nucleotide linker cassettes. Four oligonucleotides were synthesized for each linker scan construct. The first was a sense primer representing the sequence around −80 and contained a XbaI site. The second was an antisense primer representing the sequence around the linker cassette, which contained a new restriction site. The third was a sense primer complimentary to the second oligonucleotide. The fourth was an antisense primer representing sequence around +361 and contained a PstI site. Primer 1 and primer 2 were used to amplify the first DNA segment between −80 and the linker cassette. Primer 3 and primer 4 were used to amplify the second DNA segment between the linker cassette and +361. The two segments were digested with the restriction enzyme that cut the novel restriction site in the linker cassette. Then, the above two segments were ligated together, and the resulting DNA fragment was cloned between the XbaI and PstI sites of the pCAT basic vector. In all cases, the resulting DNA fragments were sequenced in their entirety. Different fragments of the calspermin promoter were amplified from the 6-kilobase genomic DNA fragment by PCR according to the conditions described by Boehringer Mannheim for its Taq DNA polymerase. In order to subclone the PCR fragments into the pCAT basic vector (Promega), the 5′ primers (synthesized using an Applied Biosystem 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer) were designed to contain a PstI site, and the 3′ primer was designed to contain a XbaI site. PCR products (amplified by a Perkin Elmer Cetus DNA thermal cycler), which were digested by PstI and XbaI, were then subcloned between the PstI and XbaI sites of the pCAT basic vector. In all cases, the PCR-derived fragments were sequenced to insure that no errors had been introduced. The oligonucleotide sequences used in the construction of the many different promoter fragments are available upon request. Transfection of DNA, CAT assays, preparation of NIH3T3 cell nuclear extract and DNase I footprinting were performed as described previously (6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The calspermin coding region is contained within the CaM kinase IV gene as shown schematically in Fig. 1. Exon I is a calspermin-specific exon. Exons II and III are common to both CaM kinase IV and calspermin. Previous experiments have shown that a DNA fragment around the transcription initiation site (position +1) for the calspermin transcript has strong promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Optimal promoter activity was obtained from a −80 to +361 DNA fragment, which included the 111-bp intron sequence extending from +130 to +241. In order to investigate the role of this intron in calspermin gene transcription, a series of deletion mutants was made from nucleotide +361 extending to +50, and the mutated promoters were linked to a CAT reporter gene as shown on the left side of Fig. 2. The constructs were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and CAT activity was assayed. The results are expressed in Fig. 2(blackbars) as -fold stimulation relative to the activity obtained from pCAT basic, a promoterless CAT construct. Deletion of sequences 3′ to the intron did not significantly affect expression of CAT(−80/+321 and −80/+300). However, CAT activity was markedly reduced by deletion of intron sequences (−80/+200, −80/+180). We postulated that since the acceptor sites for splicing in the −80/+200, −80/+180 constructs were deleted, the mRNA generated from both constructs might not be stable. Therefore, we made another four constructs containing no intron (−80/+50), an inverted intron (inversion), an internal deletion of the intron (deletion) or an internal deletion of 50 nucleotides of the intron (internal deletion). The inversion was designed so that the original donor and acceptor sites for splicing were kept intact. All four mutations resulted in markedly reduced CAT activity. The results suggested that the intron positively regulates calspermin promoter activity, but only when in the original orientation.Figure 2:Analysis of the intron by deletion mutagenesis. The structure of the parental plasmid is shown at the top. The 5′- and 3′-terminal nucleotides of each promoter construct are shown in the left side of the figure. CAT activity obtained from transfection with (whitebars) or without expression vectors encoding CREMτ and CaM kinase IV (blackbars) is shown. CAT activity is calculated as the ratio of the activity obtained for the construct to be tested to that obtained for pCAT basic, which is a promoterless CAT construct. The results are the mean values of at least three independent experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have shown that CREMτ or CREB binding to the two CRE motifs greatly stimulates activity of the wild-type calspermin promoter but not of a promoter in which both CREs were either mutated or deleted (6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since the CREs and the intron appear to be regulatory elements of the calspermin promoter, we studied the relationship between these elements. The constructs in Fig. 2were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with or without expression vectors for CREMτ and a constitutively active fragment of CaM kinase IV(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The blackbars indicate the amount of CAT activity generated following transfection of the promoter-CAT constructs alone, and the whitebars indicate the amount of CAT activity resulting from cotransfection with expression vectors for CREMτ and CaM kinase IV. When the intron was intact, CREMτ stimulated promoter activity (Fig. 2, constructs −80/+361, −80/+321, −80/+300, and −80/+242). By deleting part of the intron, CREMτ stimulation of promoter activity was abolished (Fig. 2 constructs −80/+200, −80/+180, and −80/+50). Deletion (−80/+50), inversion of the intron, internal deletion of the entire intron or of the central 50 nucleotides of the intron (Fig. 2, last two constructs) eliminated CREMτ stimulation of promoter activity. These results suggested that the intron was required for CREMτ activation of promoter activity. In order to study the requirements for regulation of the calspermin promoter by the intron, constructs in which the intron was inserted at different positions, orientations, or copy numbers were made as shown in Fig. 3. The intron is denoted by a rectangle containing an arrow, which indicates its orientation. Fig. 3(blackbars) shows the CAT activity from each of the constructs. The intron in the −80/+361 promoter was in the original position and orientation (+). Its presence resulted in a 4-fold increase in CAT activity relative to that produced by the −80/+50 promoter, which does not contain the intron (Fig. 3, compare constructs II and III), whereas the intron itself produced no promoter activity when placed upstream of CAT reporter gene (Fig. 3, construct I). If the intron was moved upstream of the −80/+50 promoter and placed in the plus orientation, activity was increased 3-fold relative to the intronless control (Fig. 3, construct IV). Switching the intron to the minus orientation abolished the −80/+50 promoter activity (Fig. 3, construct V). Two copies of the intron in the plus orientation upstream of the −80/+50 promoter had the same stimulatory effect as one copy (Fig. 3, construct VI), suggesting that the effect of the intron is not copy number-dependent. Constructs VII and VIII contained the −80 to +361 promoter region, which included an intron in the original position and the plus orientation. Both constructs also contained an additional copy of the intron placed upstream of the −80/+361 promoter. This upstream intron had no significant effect on CAT activity produced by the −80/+361 promoter regardless of its orientation. Constructs IX and X contained the −80/+361 promoter, which included a copy of the intron in the original position but in the minus orientation (acceptor and donor sites for splicing were kept intact) and one or two copies of the intron positioned upstream in the plus orientation, respectively. Neither of these latter constructs was transcriptionally active. Therefore, when the intron is in the proper position but in the minus orientation, transcription is strongly inhibited and cannot be overcome by additional properly oriented copies placed upstream of −80. The constructs in Fig. 3were also cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with expression vectors for CREMτ and CaM kinase IV. In Fig. 3, the blackbars indicate the amount of CAT activity generated following transfection of the promoter-CAT constructs alone, and the whitebars indicate the amount of CAT activity resulting from cotransfection with expression vectors for CREMτ and CaM kinase IV. Constructs II and III served as positive and negative controls, respectively. CREMτ stimulated CAT activity from the −80/+361 promoter, which contained a properly positioned and oriented intron (Fig. 3, construct III), but not from the −80/+50 promoter, which contained no intron (II). Placing an intron upstream of the −80/+50 promoter in the plus orientation rescued the stimulatory effect of CREMτ (Fig. 3, construct IV). Switching this upstream intron to the minus orientation resulted in a complete loss of the stimulatory effect (Fig. 3, construct V), suggesting an orientation-dependent requirement for the intron to facilitate the stimulatory effect of CREMτ. CREMτ-mediated enhancement of transcription was somewhat reduced when two copies rather than one copy of the intron were placed upstream of the −80/+50 promoter (Fig. 3, construct VI). An additional copy of the intron placed in either orientation upstream of the −80/+361 promoter containing an intron at the proper position and in the plus orientation had no effect on CREMτ stimulation of transcription (Fig. 3, constructs VII and VIII). If the intron in the −80/+361 promoter was in the correct position but in the minus orientation, CREMτ did not stimulate promoter activity even when one or two copies of the intron were positioned upstream of the promoter in the plus orientation (constructs IX and X). Therefore, one copy of the intron in the proper position was dominant and either stimulated or inhibited the ability of CREMτ to enhance activity from the calspermin promoter depending on its orientation. In order to test for the presence of regulatory sequences in the intron, we performed DNase I footprint assays. A 32P-end-labeled DNA probe containing sequences from −200 to +361 was subjected to DNase I digestion after addition of nuclear extract from NIH3T3 cells. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 4. One region protected from DNase I digestion mapped between nucleotides +170 and +200 of the intron (Fig. 4, laneC). This region was protected by presence of NIH3T3 cell nuclear extract but not by the bovine serum albumin control (Fig. 4, lanesA and B). In order to examine the specificity of this protection, a competition assay was performed. An unlabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide representing the +170 to +195 region of the intron was preincubated with nuclear extract for 20 min before adding the labeled probe. Addition of this oligonucleotide to the nuclear extract effectively competed for binding of the putative factor (Fig. 4, laneD), whereas a random sequence oligonucleotide did not (Fig. 4, laneE). Internal deletion of 50 nucleotides containing the protected region of the intron resulted in disruption of the stimulatory effect of CREMτ (Fig. 2, last construct). Computer-assisted analysis of the calspermin promoter region identified a potential binding site for glucocorticoid receptor (similar to one in the murine mammary tumor virus promoter) in the region protected in the DNase I footprint assay. To determine whether the glucocorticoid receptor could stimulate calspermin promoter activity, an expression vector encoding the glucocorticoid receptor was cotransfected with the CAT construct containing the −80/+361 region of the calspermin promoter, and dexamethasone was added to cells to serve as a receptor ligand. There was no stimulation of promoter activity (data not shown), suggesting that the factor binding to the intron region is not glucocorticoid receptor. Since a region in the calspermin intron between +170 and +200 appears to bind transacting factors and acts as a regulatory element for transcription, and an internal deletion of 50 nucleotides from +150 to +200 of the intron, which contained the region protected from DNase I digestion, resulted in the loss of the CREMτ stimulatory effect (Fig. 2, last construct), we attempted to identify the regulatory sequences functionally by linker scanning mutagenesis as shown in Fig. 5. Sequences indicated by rectangles were replaced with linker cassettes, which scanned from +143 to +213. None of these constructs resulted in a significant change in promoter activity relative to the wild-type promoter, and their transcriptional activity was similarly stimulated by cotransfection with expression vectors encoding CREMτ and CaM kinase IV. Therefore, the regulatory element may not be confined in an small contiguous DNA fragment or the regulatory element may not be disrupted by linker scan mutagenesis. The 3′ deletions of the intron sequences in Fig. 1that decreased transcription would interfere with the splicing machinery since the acceptor sites for splicing were deleted. Such results are difficult to interpret because it is possible that the intron would serve a structural role in transcript processing. To exclude this possibility, we made 5′ deletions from the intron inserted upstream of the −80/+50 construct (Fig. 3, construct III). Deletions were made every 20 nucleotides as shown in the left side of Fig. 6. All of these deletions resulted in significantly reduced promoter activity relative to the parent construct (blackbars), and their transcriptional activity was not stimulated by contransfection with expression vectors encoding CREMτ and CaM kinase IV (whitebars). Therefore, 5′, 3′, or internal deletions of the intron all resulted in disruption of the stimulatory effect of the intron in a position-independent manner. Collectively these results suggest that the shortest functional fragment that facilitates CREMτ to stimulate transcription is the entire 111 bp intron. The calspermin transcript is derived from a gene encoding the CaM kinase IV gene in postmeiotic male germ cells(2Means A.R. Cruzalegui F. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D. Slaughter G.S. Ono T. Mol. Cell.

Our earlier studies have shown that the calspermin transcript is produced by utilization of a promoter located within an intron of the CaM kinase IV gene(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).2 About 15 CAT constructs were made to analyze promoter activity from different DNA fragments of the calspermin promoter and, in each case, the intron was required for maximal promoter activity(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This result has been repeated in several cell lines including NIH3T3, HeLa, and NS20 cells. The −200 to +361 fragment of the calspermin promoter, which contains the 111-bp intron accurately initiates transcription in vitro in testis nuclear extracts. The same DNA fragment targets a LacZ reporter gene specifically to postmeiotic male germ cells of transgenic mice.2 Therefore, it seems likely that the intron is important for the function of the calspermin promoter in vitro as well as in vivo, although the latter has not been assessed experimentally. We demonstrate here that the intron is essential for stimulation of transcription from the calspermin promoter by the testis-specific transcription factor CREMτ. Introns have been shown to regulate the expression of many genes (7Betz A.G. Milstein C. Gonzalez-Fernandez A. Pannell R. Larson T. Neuberger M.S.

When a 200-bp DNA fragment contained in the first intron of the human DRA gene was linked to the 5′ or 3′ end of a CAT reporter gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter, it stimulated thymidine kinase promoter activity. The effect was independent of position, orientation, or distance(14Peterlin B.M. Res. Immunol. 1991; 142: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which are the characteristics of the classically defined enhancer. This enhancer is actively involved in the regulation of DRA gene transcription, since several DNase I hypersensitive sites were mapped to the element, and high level expression of the DRA gene depends on its presence. Similarly, transcription of several other genes has been shown to be influenced by a regulatory element within an intron including those for the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene(15Lefranc G. Lefranc M.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the renin gene(16Morris B.J. J. Hypertens. 1992; 10: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the type IV collagen gene(17Bornstein P. McKay J. Liska D.J. Apone S. Devarayalu S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4851-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation function of CREMτ is dependent on the presence of the entire 111-bp intron of the calspermin gene. Our previous studies have identified two CRE-like motifs at −70 and −50, which bind the testis-specific transcription factor CREMτ and stimulate transcription from the calspermin promoter(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that both the CRE motifs and the intron are required for the stimulation by CREMτ, since CREMτ no longer stimulates transcription from the calspermin promoter in which the intron has been deleted or placed in reverse orientation. When the intron is moved upstream of the promoter and correctly oriented, CREMτ stimulates promoter activity. However, CREMτ loses its effect when the orientation of the upstream intron sequence is reversed. In addition, 5′ deletions of even 20 nucleotides resulted in the loss of activity as did 3′ or internal deletions of the intron in the original or upstream (data not shown) position. Therefore, the effect of the intron on the function of CREMτ is position-independent but orientation-dependent. There are at least four theoretical ways that the intron could influence the stimulatory effect of CREMτ. First, the most obvious possibility is that the intron is necessary for stability of the primary transcript. Second, the intron could also contain CRE-like elements. Third, the intron could be required for the physical binding of CREMτ to the upstream CRE motifs. Fourth, there could be interactions between CREMτ binding at the CRE motifs and intron binding proteins that stabilize the transcription complex or are otherwise required for CREMτ function. Since the intron is position-independent but orientation-dependent, we do not favor the stability theory. Inversion of the intron while carefully maintaining the integrity of the splicing junctions or deletion of the central 50 bp of the intron both result in the loss of activity. On the other hand, the 111-bp intron sequence can be moved upstream of the CREs and maintains its regulatory role in this position. We also excluded the second possibility that the intron contains CRE-like elements, because no region in the intron is protected by purified CREMτ in a footprint analysis, whereas both CRE-like motifs are protected(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The effect of the intron is orientation-dependent. The CRE is an orientation-independent response element, because CRE is an inverted repeat sequence element. In addition, CREMτ does not stimulate transcription from the intron sequence when it is linked to an SV40 promoter (data not shown). We can excluded the third possibility, because our previous studies demonstrate that CREMτ physically binds to the CRE motifs of the calspermin promoter in the absence of the intron. The CRE motifs are protected from DNase I digestion by purified CREMτ or CREMτ in testis nuclear extract, even though the DNA probe (from −500 to +50) contained no intron(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Bandshift assays indicate that purified CREMτ or the CREMτ present in testis nuclear extract binds to double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the CREs but not the intron(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Collectively these results indicate that CREMτ binds to the CRE motifs, but in the absence of the intron it does not stimulate transcription from the calspermin promoter. Our results support the fourth possibility that there are interactions between CREMτ and the intron binding proteins. Since the interactions require both CREs and the intron, mutation of either CREs or the intron should have the same negative effect on the calspermin promoter. In support of this idea, the levels of CAT activity produced from the calspermin promoter with an internal deletion of the intron is the same as that from the calspermin promoter with both CREs mutated or deleted. Interactions between transcription factors are the basis for transcriptional regulation(18Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Interactions between CRE binding factors and other transcription factors have been postulated. Imai et al. (19Imai E. Miner J.N. Mitchell J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that optimal transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene in response to glucocorticoids required not only a glucocorticoid response element but also a CRE in the promoter region. Since a monoclonal antibody to the glucocorticoid receptor coprecipitated CREB, a protein-protein interaction between glucocorticoid receptor and CREB was proposed to account for the role of the CRE in the response of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene to glucocorticoids. Unfortunately, this type of interaction does not explain the calspermin promoter. While a region in the intron that is protected from DNase I digestion in nuclear extract corresponds in sequence to a glucocorticoid response element-like element, activity of the calspermin promoter was not stimulated in response to glucocorticoids, and the intron failed to bind glucocorticoid receptor (data not shown). In another study, Delegeane et al. (20Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) identified an enhancer in the promoter region of the human glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene. This enhancer had no independent activity but, in combination with the CRE found upstream of the enhancer, it significantly increased the tissue-specific activity of both the α-subunit promoter and a heterologeous promoter. In this case, the interactions between the CRE binding proteins and other transcription factors facilitated tissue specific expression of the gene. Whereas we cannot experimentally prove the reason for the orientation dependence of the intron, it might be explained in the following way. Interaction of the intron with the calspermin promoter likely involves several DNA-binding proteins. Productive interactions between a series of DNA-binding proteins that recognize elements in the 5′-flanking region of the calspermin promoter, such as the CRE motifs, and another series that binds the intron may require the correct spatial and directional orientation of these proteins. Reversal of the intron containing sequences crucial for these interactions might lead to disruption of the normal spatial geometry of the transcription complex. In other words, when the intron is in the plus orientation, the interactions between the intron and the promoter elements facilitate formation or stabilization of the transcription initiation complex. When the intron is in the minus orientation, the proteins bound to the intron may prevent the formation of the transcription initiation complex or at least render it sufficiently unstable to support transcription. Several CAT constructs that contain an inverted intron in its natural position have no transcriptional activity (Fig. 3). In these cases, the inverted intron is placed downstream of the transcription initiation site, thus the proteins bound to the inverted intron may not only prevent formation of the transcription initiation complex but also may physically block progression of RNA polymerase II. This may be why two additional plus orientation introns upstream of promoter containing the inverted intron do not rescue the promoter activity. Our studies suggest that one of the factors that binds to the 5′-flanking region of the promoter and interacts with the intron binding proteins is CREMτ. Three lines of evidence demonstrate a requirement for CREMτ in the regulation of testis-specific expression of the calspermin gene. 1) CREMτ restores activity to a normally inactive calspermin promoter in NIH3T3 cells(6Sun Z. Sassone-Corsi P. Means A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 2) Anti-CREMτ antibody inhibits in vitro transcription activity in testis nuclear extract from the calspermin promoter. 3) CREMτ restores transcription from a calspermin promoter-LacZ chimeric transgene in skin fibroblasts prepared from transgenic mice.2 The CREMτ transcript is generated exclusively in testis from an alternative splicing event(21Foulkes N.S. Mellstrom B. Benusiglio E. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1992; 355: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and CREMτ protein is accumulated to high levels in postmeiotic germ cells where the calspermin gene is activated(2Means A.R.

Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we suggested that appearance of abundant CREMτ in postmeiotic germ cells results in activation of the calspermin gene. The results reported here suggest that the intron may contribute to the regulation of testis-specific expression of the calspermin gene. We demonstrate that the intron serves as a position-independent but orientation-dependent regulatory element that may function to facilitate the stimulatory function of CREMτ We thank Dr. Paolo Sassone-Corsi (Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire des Eucaryotes, CNRS, Strasbourg, France) for generously providing expression vector for CREMτ.

(EC 3.1.3.9) within the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has led to consider that glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) hydrolysis in vivo should be associated with transport functions allowing both substrate and products to cross the ER membrane. In agreement with that idea, Glu-6-Pase activity was found to be increased in disrupted rat liver microsomes as compared with intact vesicles, and the enzyme activity has therefore been described as latent(1Burchell A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2978-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Nordlie R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 319-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The basis of Glu-6-Pase latency has led to much controversy in the literature, and two theories have emerged during the last 20 years. In the substrate transport model (1Burchell A.

Lindsay J.G. Burchell A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Glu-6-Pase latency has been interpreted as evidence for a rate-limiting step in Glu-6-P transport through T1. In contrast, the conformational model(8Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A.

The catalytic site is thus freely accessible from the cytoplasm, and Glu-6-Pase latency would result from changes in the membrane environment that modify the interactions of the enzyme with its substrates and products. glucose 6-phosphatase glucose 6-phosphate endoplasmic reticulum liver microsomal glucose 6-phosphate translocase liver microsomal phosphate translocase liver microsomal glucose translocase fast sampling, rapid filtration apparatus (U.

Our results demonstrate that the steady-state rate of Glu-6-P hydrolysis by intact microsomes exceeds by more than 10-fold the steady-state rate of glucose efflux from microsomes, thus ruling out the substrate transport model(1Burchell A.

It is further shown that the tracer taken up during the rapid phase of intravesicular accumulation is not the precursor for hydrolysis during the slow uptake phase but represents instead an exchangeable glucose pool. Accordingly, we propose a modified version of the combined flexibility-substrate transport model (9Schulze H.-U. Speth M. Eur. J.

Compiled in Table 1are the experimental and theoretical tracer concentrations corresponding to AMP1 and AMP2 at each of the Glu-6-P concentrations used in our studies. Interestingly, there is a marked difference between [AMP1] and [AMP2] in that tracer accumulation against a concentration gradient is apparent with [AMP2] only (values under brackets in Table 1), in agreement with the substrate transport model provided that glucose exit from microsomes is slower than both Glu-6-P transport and hydrolysis, and in agreement with our former conclusion (11Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that [14C]glucose is the major species to be found at the steady-state level of tracer uptake when using subsaturating Glu-6-P concentrations. Moreover, the apparent decreasing accumulation ratio observed with AMP1 at increasing Glu-6-P concentrations is compatible with a situation where the Vmax for Glu-6-P hydrolysis would be higher than the Vmax for transport while the Km of both processes would be similar(15Wohlhueter R.M. Plagemann P.G.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 64: 171-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), in agreement with the kinetic parameters shown in Table 2for VDOC and VSS. We thus have investigated directly the possibility that AMP1 might represent intramicrosomal steady-state Glu-6-P concentrations by plotting the initial rates of uptake during the slow phase of tracer accumulation (Va2) against the theoretical values of [AMP1] shown in Table 1. Indeed, the expectation here was to find a Michaelis-Menten relationship with kinetic parameters similar to those characterizing VSS. As shown in Fig. 1A, however, a linear relationship is observed over the accessible range of concentrations, thus ruling out that the tracer taken up during the rapid phase is the precursor for hydrolysis during the slow phase of uptake. It should be noted that the slope value of 113.5 ± 5.3 pmol/s•mg of protein•mM is equivalent in microsomes to a first order rate constant of 0.142 ± 0.024 s-1 (t = 4.9 ± 0.8 s).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab An important observation to be made in Table 1is that the AMP1/AMP2 ratio is quite constant over the whole range of Glu-6-P concentrations with mean values of 0.105 ± 0.018 and 0.101 ± 0.004 for experimental and theoretical values, respectively. Accordingly, we were led to consider the hypothesis that [AMP1] might represent glucose concentrations within a third compartment located in between the extra- and intravesicular spaces in which the sugar could accumulate rapidly and reach a steady-state concentration before being able to access the intramicrosomal volume to any significant extent. Compatible with that hypothesis are the results of Table 2showing that: 1) both AMP1 and Va2 follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to outside Glu-6-P concentrations with Km similar to that of Glu-6-P hydrolysis, and 2) the AMP1 max/AMP2 max ratio of 0.109 ± 0.032 is similar to the AMP1/AMP2 ratio determined from Table 1. Quite importantly too, the results of Table 2demonstrate that the Va2 max value represents 7.4% only of that for VSS max, thus showing that the amount of glucose produced from Glu-6-P hydrolysis and liberated into the intramicrosomal compartment represents a minor fraction only of glucose directly released into the incubation medium. Alternative explanations relating to the consideration that a major fraction of our membrane vesicles might be either leaky or “inside-out” oriented can be safely ruled out since the latency of glucose dehydrogenase activity is routinely 95-100% in our vesicle preparations(13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), in agreement with the former demonstration that mannose 6-phosphate is not hydrolyzed to any measurable extent during the first minute of incubation and that both uptake into microsomes and total glucose production by intact vesicles are fully inhibited by 5 mM phlorizin(11Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as discussed in the companion paper(13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), such results cannot be the consequence of damage to a major fraction of the vesicles when using the FSRFA. Finally, the observation that the bulk of glucose accumulation into microsomes occurs during the steady-state phase of Glu-6-P hydrolysis (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) cannot be the result of a slow vesicle equilibration with glucose released into the incubation medium. Indeed, by taking into account both the experimental conditions (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the kinetic parameters for Glu-6-P hydrolysis (Table 2), it can be evaluated that the glucose concentration in the extravesicular medium never exceeds 10-16 μM at 0.2 mM outside Glu-6-P over a 2-min incubation period. In fact, then, glucose can be accumulated under such conditions up to 15-20- or 160-270-fold relative to outside Glu-6-P or glucose concentrations, respectively. A final test of the substrate transport model (1Burchell A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2978-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Burchell A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) can be proposed on the rationale that, when a steady-state level of tracer accumulation into microsomes has been reached, the rate of tracer influx into microsomes (Glu-6-P transport and hydrolysis) is equal to the rate of tracer efflux from microsomes (glucose efflux). Accordingly, VSS should be equal to the initial rate of efflux from microsomes measured at the steady-state of intravesicular glucose concentration. That this prediction of the substrate transport model fails is shown in Fig. 1B where both VSS (opensymbols) and the initial steady-state rate of glucose efflux (closedsymbols) corresponding to the efflux data of Fig. 5B in (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have been plotted against the theoretical values of [AMP2] shown in Table 1. No saturation could be observed over the accessible range of concentrations, and the slope values of 154 ± 4 for VSS and 11.2 ± 0.6 pmol/s•mg of protein. mM for efflux are equivalent in microsomes to first order rate constant values of 0.193 ± 0.029 s-1 (t = 3.59 ± 0.54 s) and 0.0140 ± 0.0025 s-1 (t = 49.5 ± 8.8 s) that closely match those found in the companion paper (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for the rapid and slow phases of tracer uptake, respectively. Moreover, the slope ratio of 0.073 ± 0.006 between the steady-state glucose efflux and total glucose production rates confirms directly the conclusion above that glucose produced from Glu-6-P hydrolysis is mostly released into the incubation medium. The demonstration that most of glucose produced from Glu-6-P hydrolysis is released directly into the extramicrosomal space strongly argues against the current version of the substrate transport model(1Burchell A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2978-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Burchell A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). All of the kinetic evidence presented herein and in the companion paper (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) point out, however, to intimate relationships between glucose accumulation into microsomes and Glu-6-Pase activity, and between the rapid and slow phases of glucose uptake. Moreover, our results appear quite compatible with the hypothesis of an exchangeable glucose pool located in between the extra- and intravesicular spaces. Such a view fits nicely within the concept of the combined conformational flexibility-substrate transport model of Schulze et al.(10Schulze H.-U. Nolte B. Kannler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16571-16578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an updated version of which is shown in Fig. 2and justified below. According to Fig. 2, Glu-6-Pase is an intrinsic membrane protein that would span the entire microsomal membrane, in agreement with the cloned sequence of the enzyme catalytic subunit that predicts up to six membrane-spanning segments in the secondary structure of the protein (16Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Shelly L.L. Lei K.-J. Pan C.-J. Sakata S.F. Ruppert S. Schutz G. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21482-21485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic site would be embedded to some extent within the protein interior and would form a hydrophilic pocket in an otherwise hydrophobic environment. That pocket would be accessible directly from the external medium via a hydrophilic outer channel that is not, however, freely accessible to just any molecule. In that sense, there should be some gating mechanism that might account for the unidirectionality of glucose transport and allow for both substrate and inhibitor specificities (T1-like function). Glu-6-P would be hydrolyzed within the hydrophilic pocket, and glucose released at that site could be either exported to the external medium through the outer channel or transported into the intravesicular space via the inner channel (T3-like activities). The difference in the time scales needed to reach a steady-state rate of Glu-6-P hydrolysis and a steady-state level of glucose accumulation into microsomes can be explained in a three-compartment system like the one defined by the enzyme structure postulated in Fig. 2by assuming that Glu-6-P transport through the outer channel, Glu-6-P hydrolysis in the hydrophilic pocket, and glucose permeation through the outer channel (Fig. 2, upperpart of the cycle) are all faster than glucose transport through the inner channel. If, additionally, glucose efflux through the outer channel is slower than both Glu-6-P transport into and Glu-6-P hydrolysis within the pocket, then free glucose would accumulate into that compartment until a steady state is reached. At that point, the rate of glucose exit would be equal to the slower activity of either Glu-6-P transport or Glu-6-P hydrolysis. Since similar Km for hydrolysis are observed in deoxycholate-treated membranes and, in native membranes, during the burst and the steady-state phases of glucose production (Table 2), we would favor at this point the hypothesis that hydrolysis is slower than Glu-6-P transport. Alternatively, Glu-6-P access to the catalytic site and hydrolysis might be tightly coupled events(10Schulze H.-U. Nolte B. Kannler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16571-16578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, apply where VSS max and Km refer to the kinetic parameters of Glu-6-P hydrolysis during the steady-state phase of total glucose production (Table 2) while (Gm), (Go), and kD2 are defined in the legend to Fig. 2. d(Gm)dt=VSS-kD2[Gm]=0(Eq. 1) d(Go)dt=kD2[Gm]=VSS(Eq. 2) [Gm]=1kD2⋅VSSmax(Glu-6-Po)Km+[Glu-6-Po]=[AMP1](Eq. 3) Since a steady-state rate of Glu-6-P hydrolysis insures constant Gm within the hydrophilic pocket, the glucose pool can slowly equilibrate with the intravesicular space through the inner channel. Under these conditions, and apply where (Gi) and kD3 are defined in the legend to Fig. 2. d(G1)dt=kD3⋅([Gm]-[G1])(Eq. 4) [G1]=[Gm]⋅(1-e-kD3⋅t)=[AMP2]⋅(1-e-kD3⋅t)(Eq. 5) It should be stressed that the hypotheses that were made in deriving the above equations are indeed compatible with 1) the t values in the range of 2.5-5.0 s observed for the first exponential term in the glucose accumulation curves (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that would characterize the filling time of the hydrophilic pocket (rate constant kD2 in) and 2) the t values in the range of 30-50 s (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) observed for the slow phase of glucose uptake into microsomes that would characterize glucose equilibration between the hydrophilic pocket and the intramicrosomal space (rate constant kD3 in and). An important feature of the model depicted in Fig. 2is illustrated by and showing that [AMP1] and [AMP2] both represent [Gm]. Accordingly, the [AMP1]/[AMP2] ratio in Table 1, where the [AMP1] and [AMP2] values have been calculated relative to the intramicrosomal volume, would represent in fact the apparent fractional volume of the hydrophilic pocket relative to the intramicrosomal space, hence its constant value and independence on Glu-6-P concentrations. As shown in Table 2, however, both AMP1 and AMP2 should follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km typical of Glu-6-P hydrolysis. Indeed, the condition [AMP1] = [AMP2] calls for a reassessment of the plot shown in Fig. 1A, which should depict, according to with [Gi] = 0, the dependence of Va2 on [Gm]. Accordingly, the t value determined in that figure (4.9 ± 0.8 s), which should characterize kD3, is underestimated by a factor of 10. That correction thus agrees with the determination of kD3 from 1) the uptake time courses according to, which is equivalent to in (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (t in the range of 30-50 s), and 2) the efflux data shown in Fig. 1B (closedsymbols, t = 49.5 ± 8.8 s), where glucose permeation through the inner channel represents the overall rate-limiting step of the efflux process. The simple scheme depicted in Fig. 2is also compatible with the following results presented herein and in the companion paper(13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar): 1) the linearity of VSS relative to (Gi) with slope kD2 (and Fig. 1B, opensymbols), and its michaelian dependence on (Glu-6-Po) (and and Table 2); 2) the independence of the t of glucose equilibration into microsomes from the presence of varying concentrations of Glu-6-P or vanadate(13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); 3) the similar steady-state levels of intramicrosomal glucose achieved under symmetrical influx and efflux conditions of Glu-6-P and vanadate concentrations(13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); and 4) the direct correlation between the steady-state levels of intramicrosomal [14C]glucose accumulation and VSS measured at increasing cold Glu-6-P or vanadate concentrations(13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In that context, our recent studies with histone IIA-treated microsomes (18St-Denis J.-F. Annabi B. Khoury H. van de Werve G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) also agree with the model of Fig. 2in that higher uptake values were associated with higher Glu-6-Pase activities in treated as compared with normal microsomes. Moreover, the failure of histone IIA-treated microsomes to take up [14C]mannose from [14C]mannose 6-phosphate (18St-Denis J.-F. Annabi B. Khoury H. van de Werve G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) would suggest that the inner channel is quite specific for glucose and that histones mostly affect the gating mechanism of the upper channel. While the molecular arrangement within the transverse plane of the microsomal membrane proposed in Fig. 2for Glu-6-Pase does not exclude that the catalytic subunit be associated with one or several proteins (subunits), it is quite clear too that our studies ((11Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Vidal H. Berteloot A. Larue M.-J. St-Denis J.-F. van de Werve G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and 19 and this paper) failed to demonstrate the existence of both T1 and T3 (GLUT7) as entities fully separated from the catalytic process. Accordingly, the scheme of Fig. 2should be viewed as the minimum mechanistic model that is needed to explain the steady-state kinetics of Glu-6-P hydrolysis and glucose exchange through the ER membrane. That scheme, in its general principle at least, thus represents by now the only alternative to the more classic substrate transport hypothesis. The recent demonstration that the Glu-6-Pase gene of glycogen storage disease type 1b and 1c patients is normal (20Lei K.-J. Shelly L.L. Lin B. Sidbury J.B. Chen Y.-T. Nordlie R.C. Chou J.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 234-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) clearly indicates, however, that a major component of the Glu-6-Pase system is presently missing in the model of Fig. 2. It is thus reasonable to propose that an extra protein component(s) might be needed to account for other characteristics of the complete system, an obvious candidate(s) being a soluble or a membrane protein(s) that would modulate the transport functions through the outer and/or inner channels. Indeed, the characterization of such a component(s) should prove of paramount importance to the understanding of a number of questions that are not readily answered by the scheme of Fig. 2like the apparent unidirectionality of glucose transport (13St-Denis J.-F. Berteloot A. Vidal H. Annabi B. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21092-21097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the molecular mechanism responsible for the hystereric transition from a “detergent-like” to a “steady-state” form of the enzyme(11Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Independent of the complexity of the Glu-6-Pase system, however, the model of Fig. 2strongly suggests that the release of phosphate inside of the hydrophilic pocket might contribute to the hysteretic transition by a mechanism that has yet to be determined.

It is thought that this compound exerts its cytotoxic effects through damage to DNA by activating a programmed cell death(1Eastman A. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several experimental arguments suggest that the cis-DDP biological properties might result from the specific recognition, by high affinity proteins, of the DNA structural motif induced by intrastrand chelation. Such proteins have been isolated and characterized(3Toney J.H. Donahue B.A. Kellett P.J. Bruhn S.L. Essigman J.M. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was shown that HMG1 and several other cellular proteins like SSRP1 which contain the same sequence motif, called HMG box, were implied in such recognition. HMG1 or HMG2 proteins are implied in transcription processes(6Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 7Hughes E.N. Engelsberg B.N. Billings P.C.

This led the authors to suggest that intrastrand diadducts could induce a DNA structural motif which would mimic the natural binding site of such proteins. According to this hypothesis, cis-DDP activity would result from two nonmutually exclusive events due to the binding of HMG box containing proteins to the intrastrand diadducts: (i) the trapping of these proteins causing cell death by perturbating the transcription of critical genes, (ii) the inhibition of the binding of repair proteins preventing the excision of lesions. All these observations suggest that platinum derivatives able to form intrastrand diadducts should elicit pharmacological properties. cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) atomic absorption spectrometry trans-1,2 diaminocyclohexane; [GG]Pt and [AG]Pt are, respectively, the intrastrand N7G-N7G and N7A-N7G chelates of the cis-Pt[NH3]22+ moiety high mobility group polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis structure-specific recognition protein.

These compounds form only monoadducts with DNA. Among them, some elicited antitumor properties, although the monoadducts were not recognized by the cellular SSRP1 protein(6Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Since these monoadducts were shown to inhibit DNA replication, it was proposed that their cytotoxic effect was due to the inability of the DNA repair systems to eliminate the lethal lesions. These results suggest, that depending on the nature of the nonleaving ligands, monoadducts could exhibit antitumor properties.

These ligands were chosen in order to increase the affinity of the platinum compounds for the DNA major groove and also to decrease the chelation rate of the platinum monoadducts. Preliminary studies revealed that the rate of monoadducts formation from these complexes was higher than that observed for cis-DDP and that their chelation was indeed very slow. Several of these compounds, like the norbornyl derivative of Fig. 1(complex 1), were found to exhibit strong antitumor properties(10Segal-Bendirdjian E. Brehin P. Lambert B. Laoui A. Kozelka J.

Furthermore, these compounds were able to overcome cis-DDP resistance in L1210 cells. These observations suggest that their mechanism of action might be different from that of cis-DDP and might involve a biological processing of the monoadducts. Platinum mono and diadducts are repaired in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells(2Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 787-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Alazard R. Germanier M.

Recent studies on trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexanedichloroplatinum(II), which is also characterized by a bulky nonexchangeable ligand, revealed that monoadducts were more efficiently repaired than diadducts by UvrABC excinuclease(14Page J.D. Husain I. Sancar A. Chaney S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1016-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The recognition of monoadducts still bearing a labile ligand, chloro or aqua, could lead to its substitution by a protein nucleophilic group. Therefore, such monoadducts might become lethal lesions because of their ability to cross-link repair proteins to DNA. Such DNA-protein cross-linking was not observed with (DACH) dichloroplatinum complexes; however, the authors did not study the interaction of UvrABC excinuclease with monoadducts which still had a labile aqua or chloro ligand. In order to test this hypothesis, the UvrAB recognition (19Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Grossman L. Yeung A.T. Mutation Res. 1990; 236: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) of complex 1 and cis-DDP DNA adducts was studied using the filter binding assay. The determination of the rate constants of the first platination and chelation steps, together with the use of a technique which rapidly eliminates unbound platinum allowed us to discriminate between the recognition of chloro monoadducts and that of the final diadducts. The cross-linking of UvrAB proteins to DNA via chloroplatinum adducts was determined. The results for complex 1 and cis-DDP are discussed. cis-DDP was provided by Rhône-Poulenc Rorer. The platinum complex 1 (Fig. 1) was synthesized by Dr. M. Barreau and P. Mailliet (Rhône-Poulenc Rorer). The UvrA and UvrB proteins used in these studies were prepared and purified as described(21Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Oh E.Y. Yoakum G.H. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8535-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins (more than 95%) was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nonradiolabeled and 3H-labeled pSP65 DNA (3005 base pairs, from Promega) were prepared as described(22Lambert B. Jones B.K. Roques B.P. Le Pecq J.-B. Yeung A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6557-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). [3H]Thymidine (60 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. [14C]Thiourea (53 mCi/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. Nitrocellulose filters (BA85) were from Schleicher and Schuell. Membrane for microdialysis (VSWP 2500) was from Millipore. Sephadex G10 was from Pharmacia LKB. Stock solutions of platinum derivatives were prepared in dimethyl formamide, and dilutions were performed just prior to the experiments in NaClO4 10 mM adjusted to pH 5.5. Thiourea was from Sigma. The thiourea solution was made fresh in Tris-HCl 0.6 M, pH 7.5, and deionized on AG 501-X8 resin (Bio-Rad). Ultrogel AcA22 was from Biosepra. pSP65 plasmid DNA (6.9 μM nucleotide concentration) was incubated at 37°C with platinum derivatives (1.7 μM) in 100 ml of NaClO4 10 mM, pH 5.5. At the times indicated, 5- or 10-ml aliquots were taken, and the reaction was stopped by adding NaCl (0.5 M final concentration). Unbound platinum was eliminated by precipitation with ethanol. This technique allows the elimination of more than 95% of unbound platinum. After precipitation, aliquots were concentrated 10-20 times in perchloric acid (0.5 M final concentration). Then aliquots were incubated 2 h at 70°C. DNA content of aliquots was determined at 260 nm. The actual DNA concentration was calculated using a calibration curve established with DNA solutions of known concentration treated with perchloric acid under the same experimental conditions. Platinum content was determined using a furnace-equipped atomic absorption spectrometer Perkin-Elmer 5100. A calibration curve was made between 0 and 500 μg/liter. The method was described previously(14Page J.D. Husain I. Sancar A. Chaney S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1016-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA was incubated with cis-DDP (510 μM) and compound 1 (230 μM) in TEN buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM EDTA and 25 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37°C. These concentrations and the time of incubation were chosen in order to obtain 1.5 platinum adducts/100 bases. The reaction was stopped by increasing the NaCl concentration to 0.5 M and cooling at 0°C. Samples were dialyzed twice versus high-salt TEN buffer (TEN plus 0.5 M NaCl) at 0°C. The samples were precipitated with 0.8 volume of isopropanol, suspended at 1 mg/ml in high-salt TEN. Samples were then dialyzed versus two changes of NaClO4 10 mM, pH 5.5, for 2 h at 0°C in order to remove chloride. After aliquots were removed for determination of platinum content by AAS and of DNA concentration, the samples were divided into 200-μl aliquots and either left at 4°C (controls) or incubated at 37°C. The amount of monoadduct present at each time point was determined by adding 20 μl of 110 mM [14C]thiourea (specific radioactivity of 5.23 μCi/μmol) and incubating for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 ml of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and cooling to 4°C. In order to reduce the background, samples were pelleted, the supernatant was removed by aspiration, and the pellet was redissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.1 N NaOH. After reprecipitation of the DNA with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, the samples were collected by filtration on a glass fiber filter for further analysis. Since nonlabeled DNA and [3H]DNA were kept in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl and 2 mM EDTA), samples (10-50 μl) of these DNA were microdialyzed against NaClO4 10 mM, pH 5.5 at 0°C for 2 h prior to platinum treatment. [3H]DNA (nucleotide concentration of 6.9 μM) was treated with platinum compounds at a drug:nucleotide ratio of 1/4 and incubated in 10 mM NaClO4, pH 5.5, at 37°C. At the indicated time, the DNA platination was terminated by two consecutive 2-min centrifugations of 250-μl aliquots on 2.5-ml Sephadex G10 columns that had been equilibrated previously with 10 mM NaClO4, pH 5.5. Control experiments revealed that this technique allows the elimination of more than 99% of unbound platinum complex. In addition, it was verified that no significant platination occurred during the centrifugation (data not shown). The formation of stable nucleoprotein complexes between UvrAB and platinated DNA was measured by trapping the native protein-DNA complexes onto nitrocellulose filters as described(22Lambert B. Jones B.K. Roques B.P. Le Pecq J.-B. Yeung A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6557-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 140-μl reaction mixture consisted of 40 mM potassium morpholinopropane sulfonate buffer at pH 7.5, 85 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 15 mM MgSO4, 2 mM ATP (binding buffer), 200 fmol (each protein) of UvrA and UvrB, and 14 fmol of [3H]DNA treated or not treated with platinum compounds. After 10-min incubation at 37°C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 5 ml of cold 2 × SSC (0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M trisodium citrate). After 5 min in ice in order to eliminate nonspecific binding, the nucleoprotein complexes were collected by trapping onto a BA85 nitrocellulose filter. All the data were analyzed using nonlinear regression (GraphPAD program, San Diego, CA). In the text, the results of the binding assay (Fig. 4A and 5A) are expressed as t values which correspond to the incubation time between DNA and the platinum complex required to obtain half the fraction of DNA retained on the filter at infinite time. Since platinum derivatives interact preferentially with guanine that can be considered to be distributed at random, the location of platinum adducts results in a Poisson distribution. The UvrAB proteins binding reflects the amount of binding of platinum to DNA. Therefore, the number of proteins bound specifically to platinum adducts is also described by a Poisson distribution. The apparent average number of proteins bound to DNA (ɛu) can be expressed as follows, εu=-ln(1-f)(Eq. 1) where ɛ is the filter binding efficiency which is considered as the probability that a protein complexed to DNA at a particular site, is held on the filter, u is the average number of proteins bound to DNA, and f is the fraction of DNA retained on the filter(23Woodbury Jr., C.P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4730-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Mazur S.J. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An isotopic dilution of 3H-labeled pSP65 (10,000 cpm/μg) at a nucleotide concentration of 6.9 μM was treated with platinum derivatives at a 1/4 drug:nucleotide ratio. Incubation was performed in 10 mM NaClO4, pH 5.5, at 37°C for 30 and 70 min, respectively, for complex 1 and cis-DDP. Such incubation times were chosen in order to obtain 30 and 40 platinum adducts, respectively, of complex 1 and cis-DDP (see Fig. 2). Reactions were stopped by addition of NaCl (0.5 M final concentration). Unbound platinum was eliminated by DNA precipitation with ethanol. DNA pellets were suspended in NaClO4 10 mM, pH 5.5, and filtered through a Sephadex G50 column equilibrated with NaClO4. One part of the sample was used for the UvrAB binding, the other part was incubated 20 h at 37°C prior to the UvrAB binding, in order to allow the conversion of monoadducts into diadducts. The UvrAB binding and the isolation of DNA-protein complexes were performed using a method described previously (25Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after slight modifications. This method was as follows: 6.7 nM of 3H-labeled pSP65, treated as above, was incubated with UvrA and UvrB proteins, both 94 nM, at 37°C in 80 or 140 μl of binding buffer containing 20% glycerol. After 10 min of incubation at 37°C, samples were loaded onto an AcA22 gel exclusion column (1.0 × 13 cm) equilibrated in the same binding buffer with 300 mM KCl at 25°C. The column was run at 4 ml/h, and 700-μl fractions were collected. The DNA content of each fraction was quantified by scintillation counting of 50-μl aliquots. For protein determination, aliquots corresponding to the peak fraction and equivalent either to 90 or 120 ng of DNA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Plasmid DNA (6.9 μM) was treated with the platinum complexes (rb = 0.25, where rb = adducts per base ratio) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The quantification of platinum bound to DNA (i.e. DNA-platinum monoadducts and diadducts) was performed using AAS. The results presented in Fig. 2show that DNA platination involves at least two consecutive steps. They show that, in our experimental conditions, complex 1 reacts faster with DNA than cis-DDP. Further investigation of the kinetic scheme is underway. The chelation reaction was monitored by trapping the monoadducts with [14C]thiourea, as reported by Page et al.(14Page J.D. Husain I. Sancar A. Chaney S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1016-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, the kinetics of chelation of the monoadducts derived from complex 1 is compared with that of the monoadducts from cis-DDP. The chelation t values are, respectively, 8 h 20 min and 2 h 40 min for complex 1 and cis-DDP. DNA was treated with compound 1 and cis-DDP at a rb = 0.25. At the times indicated in Fig. 4, aliquots were taken, and the small molecules in them were removed by gel filtration in order to eliminate unbound platinum before incubation of the DNA fractions with the UvrAB proteins. The filter binding assay was then performed (see “Materials and Methods”). The DNA-UvrAB protein complex versus DNA-platination time relationship is a product of the platinum-adduct formation rate and the UvrAB binding efficiency to a given platinum-adduct. The results are presented in Fig. 4A. The amount of nucleoprotein complexes increases with the DNA-platination time. The formation of the nucleoprotein complexes is faster for complex 1 than for cis-DDP with respective t of 2.4 ± 0.11 min and 39 ± 0.9 min. Since in these experiments DNA was treated with the platinum complexes in the same experimental conditions as those used for the quantification of platinum bound to DNA, the apparent average number of proteins bound to platinated DNA (ɛu) as a function of the amount of platinum adducts can be derived (Fig. 4B). Linear regressions gave ɛu = 0.3 × platinum adducts per plasmid and 0.02 × platinum adducts per plasmid, respectively, for complex 1 and cis-DDP. One needs 15 times more adducts from cis-DDP than from complex 1 to obtain an identical apparent average number of proteins bound to DNA. The filter binding assay was performed with different levels of platination in the same experimental conditions for both platinum compounds (i.e. ɛ can be assumed to be the same). This allows us to compare the relative UvrAB recognition efficiencies on platinated DNA obtained with complex 1 and cis-DDP. Therefore, UvrAB proteins recognize complex 1 monoadducts with a better efficiency than those from cis-DDP. For the complexes used in this study, the chelation step of the monoadducts to form the diadducts is much slower than the first platination step (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Therefore, one can compare the interaction of UvrAB proteins with both the mono- and diadducts formed with complexes 1 and cis-DDP. For compound 1, the slow chelation observed in Fig. 3suggests that, in our conditions, even at a time of 120 min, the binding of the UvrAB proteins to the platinated DNA mainly corresponds to the formation of the nucleoprotein complexes with monoadducts. In order to determine the UvrAB binding efficiency on DNA diadducts, we allowed the monoadducts free of unbound platinum compounds to undergo the chelation step before addition of the UvrAB proteins. At various platination times, samples were filtered on G10 columns and incubated for 20 h at 37°C. This length of incubation was shown to produce more than 80 and 99% diadducts, respectively, from complex 1 and cis-DDP (data extrapolated from Fig. 3). The filter binding assay yielded the following t of incubation to obtain half the maximum protein binding: 1.9 ± 0.44 and 32.5 ± 1.4 min, respectively, for complex 1 and cis-DDP (Fig. 5A). The apparent number of proteins bound to DNA as a function of platinum per plasmid was analyzed. Linear regression gave ɛu = 0.3 × platinum adducts per plasmid and 0.03 × platinum adducts per plasmid, respectively, for complex 1 and cis-DDP. About 10 times more cis-DDP diadducts than complex 1 diadducts are needed to obtain a similar apparent average number of proteins bound to DNA (Fig. 5B). Since the experimental conditions were identical to those described for monoadducts (similar ɛ), UvrAB proteins recognize complex 1 diadducts with a better efficiency than those formed from cis-DDP. It has been shown that the UvrA protein delivers UvrB at the site of damage on DNA. However according to the UvrA-to-UvrB ratio in our reaction mixture, UvrA could also be involved in the nucleoprotein complex(25Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The filter binding assay does not allow for the determination of which UvrA and/or UvrB protein(s) is/are involved in the nucleoprotein complexes. In order to address this issue, UvrA and UvrB proteins were incubated with nonplatinated DNA or platinated DNA containing either mono- or diadducts from each platinum compound. The DNA-protein complexes were isolated using a size exclusion chromatography, and their protein content was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining according to Orren and Sancar(25Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 26Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Higher concentrations of pSP65 DNA and Uvr proteins than those used for the filter binding assay were required to allow the Uvr protein determination by silver staining. However, in order to allow a relevant comparison with the results obtained with the filter binding assay, the same UvrA-to-UvrB and Uvr protein-to-plasmid molecule ratios were kept identical in the reaction mixtures in both experiments. The results are presented in the Fig. 6. No UvrA and/or UvrB binding was observed with nonplatinated DNA. For platinated DNA, a major band corresponding to the UvrB protein was observed whatever the nature of the damage (mono- or diadducts) and whatever the platinum compound used (complex 1 or cis-DDP). According to the previous results, UvrAB binding to the platinum monoadducts occurs much faster than their chelation. Therefore, a reaction between these chloro monoadducts and a nucleophilic group of the UvrAB proteins might lead to covalent cross-linking. Such cross-linking cannot occur with diadducts. The UvrAB binding was performed on DNA mono- and diadducts. Protein-DNA cross-linking was evaluated using the resistance of the nucleoprotein complexes to a denaturing treatment by 0.2% SDS, 50 mM EDTA. EDTA was used to chelate the Mg2+ cation. Without ATP-Mg2+, the noncovalent UvrAB-DNA nucleoprotein complexes dissociate and cannot rebind(22Lambert B. Jones B.K. Roques B.P. Le Pecq J.-B. Yeung A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6557-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An incubation with SDS was added to the EDTA treatment in order to eliminate hydrophobic interactions between Uvr proteins and the DNA. In these conditions no nucleoprotein complexes were observed with a UV-treated DNA containing pyrimidine dimers (data not shown). The results are presented in Fig. 7. The amount of SDS/EDTA-resistant nucleoprotein complexes of platinated DNA with UvrAB increases with the amount of platinum adducts. Much more SDS/EDTA-resistant complexes are formed when the UvrAB proteins are added to the DNA immediately after the platination step than after the supplementary 20-h incubation period (Fig. 7A). When the apparent average number of proteins bound to DNA, obtained after the dissociating SDS/EDTA treatment, is expressed as a function of the number of platinum adducts per plasmid (Fig. 7B), the monoadducts formed from complex 1 appear to be more efficient than those formed from cis-DDP to induce cross-linking between the UvrAB proteins and platinated DNA. The isolation and analysis of nucleoprotein complexes by SDS-PAGE and silver staining allowed the detection of the bound but noncross-linked UvrB protein. In these conditions, Uvr proteins cross-linked to DNA stay in the well resulting from the nonmigration of the pSP65 plasmid DNA in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Such cross-linked Uvr proteins could only migrate in the gel after a cyanide or a thiourea treatment which are known to dissociate platinum adducts from DNA(27Bauer W. Gonias S.L. Kam S.K. Wu K.C.

Science. 1979; 204: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To identify the protein cross-linked to DNA, we used the following two steps procedure. First, nucleoprotein complexes were isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining before and after SDS/EDTA treatment. The results are shown in Fig. 8. First, the SD"
https://openalex.org/W1965198157,"Characterization of non-transferrin (non-Tf) iron transport by K562 cells has revealed unique properties relative to iron uptake mechanisms present in other cell types (Inman, R. S., and Wessling-Resnick, M.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 8521-8528). Since treatment of K562 cells with phorbol esters promotes stable megakaryocytic differentiation, we examined the uptake of non-Tf iron in response to protein kinase C activation. Treatment of K562 cells with phorbol esters increased the cellular uptake of 55Fe 4-6-fold compared with untreated cells. The phorbol ester-induced stimulation of 55Fe uptake was time- and dose-dependent, with significantly enhanced transport observed only after prolonged administration of 50 nM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (>8 h). These effects can be attributed to an increased Vmax of transport (14.0 ± 5 versus 0.6 ± 0.2 pmol/min/106 cells) as well as a 6-fold increase in the apparent Km (1.2 ± 0.4 versus 0.2 ± 0.06 μM). It is thought that the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is required as a first step in the uptake mechanism, and the associated ferrireductase activity of K562 cells is also enhanced with phorbol ester treatment by 5-10-fold (337 ± 53 versus 43 ± 3 pmol/min/106 cells). Bryostatin-1, a protein kinase C activator that fails to induce differentiation of K562 cells, did not promote this effect, indicating that the enhanced transport activity is dependent on the differentiation response. The idea that synthesis of a new class of transporters is responsible for this effect is supported by the observation that actinomycin D blocks up-regulation of non-Tf iron transport. The increased transport and ferrireductase activity induced upon differentiation also correlate with the appearance of saturable iron-binding sites on the surface of K562 cells with Kd ~ 0.4 μM. These results indicate that non-Tf iron transport activity and the expression of cell-surface iron-binding proteins can be controlled by environmental factors that promote megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. Characterization of non-transferrin (non-Tf) iron transport by K562 cells has revealed unique properties relative to iron uptake mechanisms present in other cell types (Inman, R.

Although the major pathway for the cellular delivery of iron is via receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin (Tf), 1The abbreviations used are: TftransferrinNTAnitrilotriacetic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salinePDBuphorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. considerable evidence for alternative pathways of non-Tf iron uptake has been established.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that environmental factors can influence iron assimilation through Tf-independent mechanisms. In contrast, modulation of Tf receptor activity is well documented and, in particular, has been found to be associated with cancer cell differentiation in Friend, M1, HL-60, and K562 cell leukemias(9Hu H.Y.Y.

Among other chemical inducing agents, administration of tumor-promoting phorbol esters is known to promote a rapid down-regulation of surface Tf receptors, with an associated decline in receptor synthesis upon prolonged exposure (>12 h)(16Ho P.T.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3698-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For K562 cells, such alterations are accompanied by morphological and functional changes due to megakaryocytic differentiation, including the expression of glycoprotein IIIa (a platelet-specific antigen), the loss of glycophorin A (an erythrocyte-specific lineage antigen), increased platelet peroxidase activity, and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-6(18Tetteroo P.A.T. Massaro F. Mulder A. Gelder R.S. Borne A.E.G. Leuk. Res. 1984; 8: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this report, we examine whether or not phorbol esters can also influence the properties of the non-Tf iron transport system of K562 erythroleukemia cells under these conditions. Our results indicate that while Tf-mediated delivery is down-regulated when K562 cells are induced to differentiate, non-Tf iron delivery is up-regulated. Thus, these two different iron uptake mechanisms may be coordinately regulated. transferrin nitrilotriacetic acid phosphate-buffered saline phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Iron was complexed to nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) with a solution of 5.73 mM 55FeCl3 prepared in the presence of 4-fold molar excess of NTA in 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM Tris, pH 6.0, 100 mM NaCl and brought to neutral pH by titration with 10 N NaOH. K562 cells (grown in α-minimal essential medium with 7% fetal bovine serum) were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in uptake buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml dextrose). Transport assays were performed in triplicate with 1-10 × 106 cells/ml. Iron uptake was initiated by adding 55FeNTA (75 nM to 1 μM) to K562 cells in uptake buffer with a total volume of 300 μl. After a 5-min incubation at 4 or 37°C, 250-μl aliquots were removed, added to 750 μl of ice-cold quench buffer (1 mM FeNTA, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl), and left on ice for 20 min. 950 μl of the quenched assay mixture was then filtered onto nitrocellulose discs and washed twice with 3 ml of 150 mM NaCl. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by dissolving the filters in 10 ml of scintillation fluid in borosilicate glass vials and liquid scintillation counting. The cell-associated radioactivity measured at 4°C was subtracted from that measured at 37°C to obtain the specific transport of 55Fe. Results of experiments are reported ± S.E., and presented data are representative of results obtained on at least three separate occasions. K562 cell-mediated reduction of ferricyanide to ferrocyanide was measured using the method of Avron and Shavit (19Avron M. Shavit N. Anal. Biochem. 1963; 6: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) to detect the reduced product. PBS-washed K562 cells were resuspended in Hanks' buffer (2-4 × 106 cells/ml). The ferrireductase assay was carried out upon the addition of potassium ferricyanide (50 μM final concentration, 1-ml total volume) with incubation for 30 min at 37 or 4°C. The reaction was stopped by chilling the cells on ice and immediate centrifugation. A 700-μl aliquot of supernatant was transferred into a spectrophotometer cuvette to which the following were added: 100 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 6.4, 100 μl of 0.2 M citric acid, 50 μl of 3.34 mg/ml bathophenanthroline sulfonate, and 50 μl of 3.3 mM FeCl3. The samples were mixed well, and the absorbance at 535 nm was measured after color development (10-60 min). The difference in measurements at 37 and 4°C was taken as the specific activity of the cell-associated ferrireductase. K562 cells were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Binding assays (250 μl) were prepared with 0.5-1 × 106 cells and 0.1-5 μM 55FeNTA in the presence or absence of unlabeled ligand (5 mM). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl; and cell-associated radioactivity was measured. The amount of nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of unlabeled FeNTA and subtracted from each point. The Kd for binding and the number of binding sites were determined by Scatchard analysis(20Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of phorbol esters on non-Tf iron uptake, K562 cells were treated with the concentrations of PDBu indicated in Fig. 1for 16 h. The ability of the cells to transport non-Tf iron was then measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 1, the rate of 55Fe uptake was significantly increased upon exposure to 25 nM PDBu, with the maximum increase in non-Tf transport activity induced by 50 nM PDBu. Treatment with PDBu promoted a maximal stimulation of transport 3-5-fold over that observed for control (untreated) K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Effects of protein kinase C activation by phorbol esters can be manifested within several minutes after administration; however, treatment of K562 cells with phorbol esters is known to induce cellular differentiation, which requires several hours to days before observable changes occur(18Tetteroo P.A.T. Massaro F. Mulder A. Gelder R.S. Borne A.E.G. Leuk. Res. 1984; 8: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To establish the earliest time point for induction of the increase in non-Tf iron uptake, K562 cells were treated with 50 nM PDBu for up to 16 h and then assayed for 55Fe transport activity. The results presented in Fig. 2demonstrate that increased transport rates are not observed until after exposure to PDBu for >8 h. The increase in 55Fe uptake could result from changes in the Vmax of uptake, the apparent Km, or both of these kinetic parameters. We therefore determined these values for treated and control K562 cells as described previously(8Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double-reciprocal plots of initial transport rate as a function of [FeNTA] were employed to establish the Vmax and apparent Km. As shown by data presented in Fig. 3, both kinetic parameters were altered upon overnight treatment with PDBu. Table 1presents a summary of the results from these experiments. While control cells display a Vmax comparable to previously reported activity(8Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PDBu-treated cells have a Vmax that is ~20-fold greater (Table 1). The Km of transport was also increased 4-6-fold compared with control K562 cells.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In contrast to the observed changes induced by phorbol esters, treatment of K562 cells with bryostatin-1 fails to induce any significant alteration in the properties of non-Tf iron uptake (Table 1). Like phorbol esters, bryostatin-1 is an activator of protein kinase C; however, the latter agent does not induce megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells(21Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M. Tykocinski M.L. Fields A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 671-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our observations suggest that up-regulation of non-Tf iron transport activity is specifically associated with phorbol ester-mediated differentiation of K562 cells and the concomitant expression of phenotypic markers of megakaryocytic lineage. Since actinomycin D, an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis, blocks phorbol ester-stimulated transport activity (Fig. 4), we conclude that transcriptional activation associated with megakaryocytic differentiation must be involved in the observed increase in the Vmax and Km of non-Tf iron transport. The simplest interpretation of these results is that synthesis of a new class of transporters is induced under these conditions, although it is not possible to rule out other post-translational effects that may regulate the activity of the existing iron uptake system. It is interesting to note that the higher Km of iron transport by phorbol ester-treated K562 cells correlates well with apparent Km values reported for several other cell types. This may suggest that upon differentiation, K562 cells express an uptake mechanism akin to that observed for hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary and HeLa cells(1Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3139-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kaplan J. Jordan I. Sturrock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Barisani D. Berg C.L. Wessling-Resnick M. Gollan J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter studies, supraphysiological concentrations of calcium have been shown to promote significant increases in non-Tf iron uptake. Moreover, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ also correlates with decreased transport activity. To establish whether the changes in transport induced by PDBu may reflect an altered response of non-Tf iron uptake to intra- or extracellular Ca2+ levels, treated and control K562 cells were washed with 1 mM EGTA to deplete intracellular Ca2+ or exposed to extracellular Ca2+ (1 mM). As shown by the results presented in Table 2, neither treatment had a significant effect on the transport activity measured for PDBu-treated or control cells. These observations are consistent with previous data from our laboratory indicating that the non-Tf iron uptake system in K562 cells is calcium-independent(8Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); most important, the results demonstrate that stimulation of transport activity by PDBu does not reflect an altered Ca2+ response of the non-Tf iron uptake mechanism. The specificity of the non-Tf iron transporter in K562 cells with respect to other transition metals is also distinct from other uptake systems that have been characterized. Whereas the transporter in K562 cells may be specific only for iron and cadmium(8Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the non-Tf iron transporter in HeLa cells may be able to transport cadmium, manganese, copper, and zinc as well(1Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3139-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kaplan J. Jordan I. Sturrock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the evidence presented above indicates fundamental changes in transport characteristics, we further examined the effects of 200 μM Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Mn2+ in the uptake assay. As shown by the results presented in Table 2, only Cd2+ and Cu2+ significantly inhibited non-Tf iron uptake by control K562 cells, consistent with previous observations(8Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of the other cations were potent inhibitors of transport, unlike observations made for non-Tf iron uptake by HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and fibroblasts(1Sturrock A. Alexander J. Lamb J. Craven C.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3139-3145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulated transport activity of PDBu-treated K562 cells was also resistant to inhibitory effects of these metals; moreover, the efficacy of Cd2+ and Cu2+ to inhibit uptake was reduced (Table 2). This result may reflect the increase in apparent Km of transport upon phorbol ester treatment. Thus, the specificity of non-Tf iron transport by K562 cells does not appear to be altered upon differentiation.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A cell-surface ferrireductase activity has been associated with non-Tf iron uptake by K562 cells(8Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is thought to be the first step in the uptake mechanism, and inhibition of the ferrireductase activity corresponds to a block in non-Tf iron uptake(22Inman R.S. Coughlan M.M. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11850-11857Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, the observed increase in non-Tf iron uptake could be associated with a parallel stimulation of the ferrireductase activity. To test this hypothesis, cell-surface ferrireductase activity was measured in PDBu-treated and control K562 cells, with the results shown in Fig. 5. Extracellular reduction of ferricyanide by PDBu-treated cells was stimulated 5-10-fold compared with control K562 cells, with measured activities of 337 ± 53 and 43 ± 3 pmol/min/106 cells, respectively (n = 4). The enhanced ferrireductase activity correlates well with the observed increase in non-Tf iron uptake after overnight PDBu treatment and is compatible with the idea that this function is closely associated with the uptake system. Since reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is presumably a prerequisite for non-Tf iron transport(22Inman R.S. Coughlan M.M. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11850-11857Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Jordan I. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), it is possible that the observed stimulation of uptake is a functional consequence of enhanced ferrireductase activity, although direct evidence that the latter step is rate-limiting for transport is lacking. To identify proteins potentially involved in the phorbol ester-induced transport activity, iron binding studies were performed. As indicated by the results of Fig. 6, K562 cells do not display a significant number of 55Fe-binding sites under basal conditions. However, upon megakaryocytic differentiation, saturable binding of 55Fe to the surface of phorbol ester-treated K562 cells can be measured. Scatchard analysis of binding data reveals a Kd for 55Fe binding of 0.37 ± 0.06 nM, with a single class of ~5.4 × 107 binding sites/cell. Although the functional relationship with the observed stimulation of non-Tf iron uptake remains unknown, it is possible that the iron-binding proteins are components of a new class of transporters expressed by K562 cells upon megakaryocytic differentiation. Tf-mediated iron delivery is known to be modulated by iron-induced changes in the half-life of receptor mRNA, as well as by regulation of the rate of transcription(24O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In contrast, non-Tf iron uptake does not appear to be influenced by intracellular iron levels(8Inman R.S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8521-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating fundamental differences in the regulation of these two pathways for iron assimilation. Regulation of Tf receptor activity has also been correlated with leukemia cell differentiation and the cessation of cellular proliferation(9Hu H.Y.Y. Gardner J. Aisen P. Skoultchi A.I.

Rochant H. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 140: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When human erythroleukemia K562 cells are exposed to phorbol esters, a rapid down-regulation of surface Tf receptors to intracellular compartments is observed(14Klausner R.D. Harford J. van Renswoude J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Testa U. Thomopoulos P. Vinci G. Titeux M. Brettaieb A. Vainchenkar W. Rochant H. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 140: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and prolonged exposure will diminish receptor synthesis(17Schonhorn J.E. Akompong T. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3698-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results show that the non-Tf iron transport system is up-regulated by phorbol esters. Combined, these observations suggest that the cellular expression of these two different iron uptake mechanisms may be coordinately regulated. It is interesting to note that despite the down-regulation of the K562 cell Tf receptors under these conditions, the Tf-mediated iron delivery is only slightly suppressed(14Klausner R.D. Harford J. van Renswoude J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Testa U. Titeux M. Louache F. Thomopoulos P. Rochant H. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 4981-4986PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the idea that the coordinate regulation between Tf-dependent and -independent pathways does not reflect changes in intracellular iron content. Phorbol esters promote other changes in the phenotype of K562 cells as they cease to divide and begin to differentiate, expressing megakaryocytic markers(18Tetteroo P.A.T. Massaro F. Mulder A. Gelder R.S. Borne A.E.G. Leuk. Res. 1984; 8: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The fact that actinomycin D blocks the PDBu-induced stimulation of Tf-independent transport indicates that mRNA and most likely protein synthesis are both required for this effect. Thus, altered transport activity appears to be the consequence of changes in cellular function due to the differentiation program. In fact, bryostatin-1, which activates protein kinase C but does not induce K562 cell differentiation(21Hocevar B.A. Morrow D.M. Tykocinski M.L. Fields A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 671-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fails to stimulate non-Tf iron transport activity. Two potential explanations can account for stimulation of non-Tf iron transport. 1) Expression of regulatory factors may modify the activity of existing plasma membrane iron transporters, and/or 2) synthesis of a new class of non-Tf transporters is induced to increase iron uptake. We favor the latter hypothesis due to the appearance of cell-surface iron-binding sites upon phorbol ester treatment of K562 cells; this activity may reflect properties of the new class of transport molecules. Conrad et al.(26Conrad M.E. Umbreit J.N. Moore E.G. Uzel C. Berry M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7169-7173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed that β3-integrin is involved in non-Tf iron transport by K562 cells, although stringent functional criteria to support a role for this extracellular matrix adhesion factor in iron uptake are lacking. Since, upon megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, expression of glycoprotein IIIa or β3-integrin is up-regulated(18Tetteroo P.A.T. Massaro F. Mulder A. Gelder R.S. Borne A.E.G. Leuk. Res. 1984; 8: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), it is possible that the binding activity we observe is due to association of 55Fe with β3-integrin. The latter does indeed bind cations; in fact, bound cation is displaced upon the binding of β3-integrin by its ligand, typically fibrinogen or another adhesion molecule that contains the RGD amino acid motif(27D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have examined the ability of RGD-containing peptides to block both non-Tf iron transport and cell-surface iron binding in basal and stimulated K562 cells. Since the RGD peptides do not compete for uptake or binding, we conclude that neither of these activities involves the ligand-displaceable cation-binding site of β3-integrin. 2T. Akompong, J. Gutierrez, and M. Wessling-Resnick, unpublished observations. Clearly, further investigation is necessary to define the function of the cell-surface iron-binding proteins that are induced by phorbol esters. As indicated above, we speculate that these binding sites are functionally related to the enhanced non-Tf iron system observed in K562 cells upon megakaryocytic differentiation. Future efforts will not only help to identify the molecules involved in iron assimilation, but may also explain why the Tf-independent transport system is up-regulated during megakaryocytopoiesis."

Therefore, the biological activity of EF-2/EF-G is regulated by the alternate binding of GDP and GTP(1Moldave K. Annu. Rev.

In a previous study we have reported that the primary structure of the elongation factor 2 in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsEF-2, formerly aEF-2) possesses the consensus sequences typical of the GTP-binding proteins(4De Vendittis E. Amatruda M.R. Masullo M. Bocchini V. Gene (Amst). 1993; 136: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present report we show that SsEF-2 is able to bind guanosine nucleotides and to promote the hydrolysis of GTP in the presence of ribosomes as well. These findings support the hypothesis that the translocation step in the elongation of the polypeptide chain in archaeal systems involves similar mechanisms as those described for eukarya and eubacteria(1Moldave K.

[3H]GDP and [γ-32P]GTP were purchased from Amersham Corp.; unlabeled nucleotides and Gpp(NH)p were from Boehringer Mannheim. Diphtheria toxin was obtained from Calbiochem. All of the reagents were of analytical grade. The following buffers were used: buffer A, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM Mg(CH3COO)2; buffer B, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol; buffer C, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 0.4 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 0.05 mg/ml poly(U), 1 mM spermine, 1 mM ATP. SsEF-2 was purified from S. solfataricus (ATCC 49255) as previously described (8Raimo G. Masullo M. Dello Russo A. Parente A. Gambacorta A. Bocchini V. Ital. J. Biochem. 1993; 42: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar) and stored at −20°C in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl2, 50% (v/v) glycerol. The purity of isolated SsEF-2 was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or by reverse phase chromatography on a C4 column (Vydac) connected to a high performance liquid chromatography apparatus (Kontron). Ribosomes were prepared according to the procedure described elsewhere (10Cammarano P. Teichner A. Londei P. Acca M. Nicolaus B. Sanz J. Amilis R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with an additional ultracentrifugation step at 100,000 × g at 20°C in buffer A supplemented with 18% sucrose and 500 mM NH4Cl. The pellet was then suspended in buffer A containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C. One A260 unit was taken to correspond to 25 pmol of ribosomes. Poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis was performed as described previously(6Masullo M. Raimo G. Parente A. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Bocchini V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The amount of the SsEF-2•[3H]GDP complex, formed upon incubation of [3H]GDP with SsEF-2 in buffer B, was estimated by counting the radioactivity sticking on nitrocellulose filters(11Mizumoto K. Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 76: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), using a Packard Tri-Carb 1500 liquid scintillation analyzer. The apparent dissociation equilibrium constant, K‘d, of the SsEF-2•GDP complex was determined by titrating SsEF-2 with [3H]GDP; the results were plotted according to the Scatchard equation(12Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar), and both the K‘d of the complex and the number of binding sites for [3H]GDP on SsEF-2 were derived. The values of K‘d of the SsEF-2•GTP and SsEF-2•Gpp(NH)p complexes were determined by competitive binding experiments between [3H]GDP and GTP or Gpp(NH)p following the procedure described previously for SsEF-1α(6Masullo M. Raimo G. Parente A. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Bocchini V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); other experimental details are given in the legend to Fig. 1. The ribosome-stimulated GTPase activity of SsEF-2 was measured in buffer C; ATP was maintained throughout even though it was essential only when the GTPase was tested in the presence of partially purified ribosomes. The [γ-32P]GTP hydrolyzed was estimated from the amount of 32Pi released, measured by the charcoal method(13Masullo M. De Vendittis E. Bocchini V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20376-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the reaction was followed kinetically at 60°C. Blanks run in the absence of SsEF-2 were subtracted. The rate of [γ-32P]GTP breakdown was calculated from the slope of the linear kinetics of the hydrolytic reaction. The values of Km and K‘m for [γ-32P]GTP, kcat and K‘i of GDP and Gpp(NH)p for GTPaser were determined as reported previously (13Masullo M. De Vendittis E. Bocchini V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20376-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ADP-ribosylation of SsEF-2 was performed as previously described (8Raimo G. Masullo M. Dello Russo A. Parente A. Gambacorta A. Bocchini V. Ital. J. Biochem. 1993; 42: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar) using 12 μMSsEF-2, 100 μM NAD+, and 1 μM diphtheria toxin. The ADP-R-F2 was freed of diphtheria toxin, nonmodified SsEF-2, and NAD+ excess by chromatography on a Mono Q column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted by a linear 0-150 mM KCl gradient in the same buffer. ADP-R-F2 was collected at about 60 mM KCl, whereas the residual SsEF-2 was eluted at about 100 mM KCl. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The rate of [3H]GDP binding to SsEF-2 was very high, even at 0°C (Fig. 1A), and it did not change appreciably in the pH range 5-9. Since SsEF-2•GTP is not retained on nitrocellulose filters, the binding of GTP to SsEF-2 was measured by competitive binding experiments in which the amount of the SsEF-2•[3H]GDP complex formed decreased at increasing concentrations of GTP (Fig. 1B). The nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p was less efficient, whereas ATP added up to 1000-fold molar excess over [3H]GDP was ineffective. The Scatchard plot shows that 1 mol of SsEF-2 binds 1 mol of [3H]GDP (Fig. 1C). At 60°C the affinity of SsEF-2 for [3H]GDP (K‘d = 1 μM) is 10-fold higher than that for GTP and 51-fold higher than that for Gpp(NH)p, thus resembling the behavior of EF-G/EF-2 from other sources(3Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 35: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Arai N. Arai K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Nurten R. Bermek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ribosomes isolated from S. solfataricus possess a tightly associated GTPase activity(17Beauclerk A.A.D. Hummel H. Holmes D.J. Böck A. Cundliffe E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An additional ultracentrifugation step (see “Methods”) reduced the ribosomal GTPase activity by 5-10-fold without affecting the ability of the ribosomes to support the in vitro poly(Phe) synthesis. When assayed in buffer C, purified SsEF-2 showed an intrinsic hardly detectable GTPase activity (less than 0.5 mol of [γ-32P]GTP hydrolyzed by 1 mol of SsEF-2 in 30 min at 60°C). The addition of ribosomes stimulated a turnover SsEF-2 GTPase (Fig. 2A); its extent was maximum at 0.5 μM ribosome, which at higher concentrations produced inhibition (Fig. 2B), as already reported for the E. coli EF-G GTPaser(18Rohrbach M.S. Bodley J.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4565-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The enzymatic [γ-32P]GTP breakdown followed linear kinetics and depended on the amount of SsEF-2 added. The possibility that SsEF-2 GTPaser was due to a triphosphatase contaminant was ruled out by the following observations: (i) the sample of SsEF-2 used appeared homogenous when analyzed by either SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or by reverse phase chromatography on a C4 column; (ii) the typical properties of SsEF-2 (ability to be ADP-ribosylated by diphtheria toxin, GDP binding, and GTPaser) co-purified with SsEF-2; (iii) the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of ATP over [γ-32P]GTP did not have any effect on the amount of 32Pi released. At 60°C the pH optimum for the GTPaser was in a narrow range, centered around pH 7.8, that was not substantially affected by the buffer used (Fig. 3). In order to evaluate the effect of temperature on the rate and on the affinity of GTPaser for [γ-32P]GTP, Km and kcat were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots that in the temperature range 50-91°C were all linear. The data reported in Table 1show that at increasing temperatures both kcat and Km increased; the catalytic efficiency, expressed by the ratio kcat/Km, reached a maximum at 80°C. The possibility that the increase with temperature of Km of SsEF-2 GTPaser for [γ-32P]GTP could also be due to a competitive inhibition by the GDP produced upon hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP was ruled out since such an amount was negligible compared to that required to get a significant increase of Km (see below). A linear Arrhenius plot gave a value for the energy of activation equal to 85 kJ/mol; at 87°C the calculated values for ΔH∗, ΔS∗, and ΔG∗ were 82 kJ•mol-1, −3 J•mol-1•K-1, and 83 kJ•mol-1, respectively. These energetic data were quite close to those reported for Escherichia coli EF-G GTPaser at 30°C(19Masullo M. Parlato G. De Vendittis E. Bocchini V. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), thus indicating that the two enzymatic systems have similar energetic requirements.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab It is remarkable that at the growth temperature of the respective source organisms, the affinity for GTP of GTPaser is very similar between S. solfataricus SsEF-2 (KM = 32 μM) and E. coli EF-G (KM = 41 μM) (20De Vendittis E. Masullo M. Bocchini V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4445-4450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPaser was competitively inhibited by both GDP and Gpp(NH)p, the latter being a stronger inhibitor (Fig. 4). At increasing concentrations of both inhibitors the value of v remained unchanged, whereas KMfor [γ-32P]GTP, that was 9 μM in the absence of inhibitors, increased to 18, 29, 47, and 93 μM in the presence of 5, 10, 30, and 60 μM GDP, and to 48 μM and 312 μM in the presence of 2 μM and 32 μM Gpp(NH)p. Values of 7 and 1 μM were calculated for the inhibition constant, K‘I, in the presence of GDP and Gpp(NH)p, respectively; they represent also the values of K‘D of SsEF-2•GDP and SsEF-2•Gpp(NH)p in the presence of ribosomes. In fact, the instability during filtration on nitrocellulose of the SsEF-2•GDP and SsEF-2•Gpp(NH)p complexes with ribosomes did not allow the directed determination of the respective K‘d values. The data reported in Table 2show that ribosomes reverse the relative affinity of SsEF-2 for GDP and Gpp(NH)p; in fact, the affinity for GDP, that in the absence of ribosomes was 51-fold higher compared to that for Gpp(NH)p, in the presence of ribosomes became 7-fold lower. A similar behavior has been described for E. coli EF-G(3Parmeggiani A. Sander G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 35: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Arai N. Arai K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 82: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and rat liver EF-2(16Nurten R. Bermek E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The increased affinity of SsEF-2 for GTP might explain the stimulatory effect by the ribosome on the SsEF-2 GTPase; in addition, the decreased affinity for GDP should reduce the inhibitory effect by the GDP formed upon the hydrolysis of GTP.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Since the ADP-ribosylation of SsEF-2 inhibits poly(Phe) synthesis(7Klink F. Woese C.R. Wolfe R.S. The Bacteria. Vol. VIII. Academic Press, London1985: 379-410Google Scholar, 21Raimo G. Masullo M. Parente A. Dello Russo A. Bocchini V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), its effect on the SsEF-2 GTPaser was investigated. The ADP-R-F2 was still able to sustain the GTPaser whose kinetics was not greatly affected. In fact, at 60°C the values of kcat and Km for [γ-32P]GTP are 0.6 s-1 and 12 μM, respectively (for a comparison with nonmodified SsEF-2, see Table 1). ADP-R-F2 GTPaser was competitively inhibited by GDP, and the value of K‘i was identical to that determined with not ADP-ribosylated SsEF-2. Therefore, the ADP-ribosylation of SsEF-2 does not affect the binding of GDP and GTP to SsEF-2; a similar finding has been reported for rat liver EF-2(22Nygard O. Nilsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6030-6034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the characterization of an archaeal hyperthermophilic EF-2 regarding either its affinity for GDP and GTP or its ribosome-stimulated GTPase activity. Our recent report that the elongation factor SsEF-1α binds GDP and GTP (6Masullo M. Raimo G. Parente A. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Bocchini V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and elicits an intrinsic GTPase (13Masullo M. De Vendittis E. Bocchini V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20376-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the data reported in the present work prove that the S. solfataricus elongation factors are functionally similar to the corresponding bacterial and eukaryal counterparts (1Moldave K.

The peptides were further modified by inclusion of an N-terminal phenylalanine and constrained by formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond. While no mitogenic response was observed in the parental NR6 cell line, the peptides stimulated DNA synthesis in NR6/HER cells (NR6 fibroblasts transfected with the human epidermal growth factor receptor). Induction of DNA synthesis was dose dependent, with EC<sub>50</sub> values in the range 130-330 μM; in the presence of low doses of TGF-α, the mitogenic effect of the peptides was additive, up to the plateau response achieved by maximal doses of TGF-α alone. These effects are consistent with the peptides acting via the same mechanism as TGF-α. Analysis of the structure of the peptides by NMR indicated that the presence of the mimetics significantly increased the propensity of the peptidyl-proline bond to adopt the <i>cis</i> conformation. These data confirm the role of the β-sheet in receptor activation, and emphasize the importance of presentation of peptides in an appropriate conformation for recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2044440169,"Two inhibitors of cynomolgus monkey cholesteryl ester transfer protein were evaluated. One, a monoclonal antibody made against purified cynomolgus monkey cholesteryl ester transfer protein, was capable of severely inhibiting triglyceride transfer, but had a variable effect on cholesteryl ester transfer. At low antibody to antigen ratios, there was what appeared to be a stoichiometric inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer, but at high antibody to antigen ratios the inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer was completely relieved, even though triglyceride transfer remained blocked. Fab fragments of the antibody had no effect whatsoever on cholesteryl ester transfer, but were capable of completely blocking triglyceride transfer. The other inhibitor, 6-chloromecuric cholesterol, severely inhibited cholesteryl ester transfer with minimal inhibition of triglyceride transfer. When both inhibitors were added to the assay, both cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer were inhibited; an indication that the inhibitors did not compete for the same binding site on cholesteryl ester transfer protein.When the antibody was given subcutaneously to cynomolgus monkeys at a dose which inhibited triglyceride transfer in the plasma by more than 90%, there was no detectable effect on the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, but the HDL triglyceride levels decreased from 13 ± 2 to 1 ± 0 mol/mol of HDL (mean ± S.D.); an indication that the antibody uncoupled cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer in vivo. The 6-chloromecuric cholesterol could not be evaluated in vivo because it is a potent lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor. The fact that cholesteryl ester transfer can be inhibited without effect on triglyceride transfer and, conversely, that triglyceride transfer can be inhibited without effect on cholesteryl ester transfer indicates that these two lipids are not transferred by a single, non-discriminatory process.

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein is a plasma protein that catalyzes the redistribution of neutral lipids, triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, retinyl esters, and possibly other lipophilic compounds, among lipoproteins(1Rye K-A. Barter P.J. Rosseneu M. Structure and Function of Apolipoproteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 401-426Google Scholar). In its absence, neutral-lipid transfer between lipoproteins is essentially nonexistent. The mechanism by which CETP 1The abbreviations used are: CETPcholesteryl ester transfer proteinLPDPlipoprotein deficient plasmaLDLlow density lipoproteinsHDLhigh density lipoproteins. catalyzes the redistribution of neutral lipids is not entirely understood. Two models have been proposed: the shuttle model (2Barter P.J. Jones M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 238-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which CETP acts as a carrier, transporting neutral lipids back and forth between donor and acceptor; and the ternary complex model (3Ihm J. Quinn D.M. Busch S.J. Chataing B. Harmony J.A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 361-367Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) in which donor, acceptor, and transfer protein come together in a single complex for neutral-lipid exchange. The shuttle model has the transfer process divided into 7 steps: association (or docking) of CETP with the donor lipoprotein; transfer of the neutral lipid from the donor to CETP; dissociation of CETP-lipid complex from the donor; diffusion of the complex through the surrounding medium; docking of the CETP-lipid complex with the acceptor; transfer of the CETP-associated lipid to the acceptor; and finally, desorption of CETP from the acceptor. If the donor and acceptor are identical, then there are only 4 elementary steps: association, exchange, dissociation, and diffusion. With the exceptions of the dissociation and diffusion components, the same processes are required in the ternary model, although not necessarily in the same order. Finally, it is not known whether CETP dissociates from donors or acceptors without neutral lipid; the inability to do so would categorize it as an “exchange” protein rather than a “transfer” protein. cholesteryl ester transfer protein lipoprotein deficient plasma low density lipoproteins high density lipoproteins. CETP activity has been detected in the plasma of several species (4Chajek T. Fielding C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3445-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 5Ha Y.C.

Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are just 20 amino acids out of 476 which are different between the two proteins and all but two of these substitutions are conservative. Most noteworthy, however, is the observation that the carboxyl-terminal 38 amino acids of the two proteins are identical, for that is the region of CETP thought to be essential for lipid transfer(11Hesler C.B.

This high degree of homology between the human and cynomolgus monkey proteins implies that observations made using the monkey protein are germane to our understanding of human CETP structure and function. An unanswered question regarding human CETP is whether it has more than one neutral lipid binding site. Early studies with both crude and purified CETP preparations indicated that some mercury-containing compounds were capable of inhibiting triglyceride transfer without inhibiting cholesteryl ester transfer(16Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1058-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); an observation compatible with the premise that two neutral lipid binding sites were present. The present paper addresses that question using cynomolgus monkey CETP as the transfer protein, and shows that, in vitro, not only can triglyceride transfer can be inhibited without effect on cholesteryl ester transfer, but also that cholesteryl ester transfer can be inhibited without effect on triglyceride transfer. In addition, we present evidence that cholesteryl ester transfer can be uncoupled from triglyceride transfer in vivo. HDL was isolated from cynomolgus monkey plasma by ultracentrifugation (d 1.063-1.225 g/ml;(9Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and then passed over a 2.6 × 100-cm column of agarose beads (A-0.5M; Bio-Rad) to remove residual LDL and Lp(a). Lipoprotein-deficient plasma (LPDP) was prepared by adjusting the density of fresh plasma from cynomolgus monkeys to 1.225 g/ml with solid KBr and centrifuging at 285,000 × g for 48 h. The top one-third of the tubes' contents was removed by slicing. The bottom fraction was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4°C. Human LDL containing [4-14C]cholesteryl oleate and [9,10-3H]triolein (Amersham) was prepared as described previously(9Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant cynomolgus monkey CETP was purified from the culture media of Chinese hamster ovary cells that had been transfected with cynomolgus monkey CETP cDNA exactly as described previously(18Sarcich J.L. Fischer H.D. Babcock M.S. Leone J.W. Tomasselli A.G. J. Protein Sci. 1994; 14: 81-88Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal sequence analysis indicated that the CETP isolated by this method was >97% pure. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared using the purified, recombinant CETP essentially as described previously(11Hesler C.B. Tall A.R. Swenson T.L. Weech P.K. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5020-5023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies were designated CMTP-1 and CMTP-2. CMTP-1 had no effect on either cholesteryl ester or triglyceride transfer when evaluated in the radioactivity-based assay described here or a fluorescence-based assay described previously(19Epps D.E. Harris J.S. Greenlee K.A. Fisher J.F. Marschke C.K. Castle C.K. Ulrich R.G. Moll T.S. Melchior G.W. Kezdy F.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). At certain concentrations (see “Results”) CMTP-2 inhibited both cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer in both assays. CMTP-2 antigen binding fragments were prepared and purified exactly as described by Margulies(20Margulies D.H. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 2.0.1-2.11.12Google Scholar), except that the IgG was purified from the ascites using a commercially available kit (E-Z-SEP for ascites, Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Analysis of the Fab preparation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a major band of approximately 50 kDa and no detectable IgG. The compound 6-chloromecuric cholesterol (U-617) was synthesized and purified by chemists at the Upjohn Co. The CETP assay used here has been described in detail previously (9Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a modification of that originally described by Pattnaik et al.(21Pattnaik N.M. Montes A. Hughes L.B. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 530: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and modified by Morton and Zilversmit(17Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1058-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled lipids are incorporated into a “donor” lipoprotein and that donor is then incubated with an “acceptor” lipoprotein in the presence of a source of CETP. In the present study, cynomolgus monkey LPDP or purified recombinant cynomolgus monkey CETP was used as CETP source; human LDL labeled with [4-14C]cholesteryl oleate and [9,10-3H]triolein was used as the donor; and cynomolgus monkey HDL was used as the acceptor. Each incubation tube contained LDL, HDL, a source of CETP and incubation buffer (Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing bovine albumin (1%), NaCl (150 mM), and NaN3 (3 mM)). The amount of LDL- or HDL-associated lipid contained in the assay tube is shown in Table 1. The final volume in the assay tube was 700 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of CETP and the redistribution of radioactivity was followed by taking samples at various times, removing the LDL by precipitation, and quantifying the radioactivity in the supernatant (9Pape M.E. Rehberg E.F. Marotti K.R. Melchior G.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In the absence of transfer protein, redistribution of radioactivity was essentially zero. In the presence of CETP, the distribution of the radioactive lipids between the LDL and HDL approached equal specific activity. This occurred regardless of whether the radioactive lipid was initially in LDL or HDL. The redistribution kinetics were those of a simple, two-pool, closed system, in which there was no appreciable net mass transfer. Fig. 1shows a typical radioactivity redistribution pattern when LDL was the donor and HDL the acceptor. The HDL radioactivity is expressed as a fraction of the expected equilibrium value, where equilibrium is defined as the point at which the specific activity of a given lipid is the same in the donor and acceptor. Note that both the triglyceride and the cholesteryl ester radioactivity content of HDL were approaching a plateau by 8 h (Fig. 1), even though their mass ratios were different (Table 1). That was taken as indication that the CETP-mediated redistribution of the radioactivity was behaving as predicted. To evaluate CETP inhibition, that inhibitor was added at the indicated concentration and the assay mixture incubated for 3 h. The CMTP-2 and the CMTP-2 Fab fragments were contained in saline. The U-617 was contained in Me2SO. The final Me2SO concentration in the reaction mixture was 1% (v/v); a concentration that had no detectable effect on the assay. The plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and the HDL composition and Stokes' radius were determined as described previously (22Melchior G.W. Castle C.K. Murray R.W. Blake W.L. Dinh D.M. Marotti K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8044-8051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adult, male cynomolgus monkeys obtained from the Upjohn Colony were used for these studies. In study 1, four monkeys received CMTP-2 and 4 others received CMTP-1. In study 2, three monkeys received CMTP-2. In each instance the antibody was dissolved in sterile saline and passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter prior to injection. Thirty mg of protein in a final volume of 12 ml was injected into each monkey subcutaneously, between the shoulder blades. In study 1, 7-ml blood samples were taken just prior to administration of the antibody (t = 0) and at 0.25, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 11 days after antibody administration. In study 2, a 24-ml blood sample was taken from each monkey 7 days prior to antibody administration and a second 24-ml blood sample was taken 48 h after antibody administration. All blood samples contained EDTA at 1 mg/ml and azide at 0.02% and were kept at 4°C until analyzed. The effects of subcutaneous administration of CMTP-2 on the plasma lipids of the cynomolgus monkey (Table 2) were evaluated using a one-way, repeated measures analysis of variance and Dunnett's test for multiple comparisons(23Glantz S.A. Primer of Biostatistics. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1992: 67-104Google Scholar). The effects of CMTP-2 treatment on the size and composition of HDL were evaluated using the paired t test(23Glantz S.A. Primer of Biostatistics. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1992: 67-104Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2A shows the effect of increasing CMTP-2 concentration on the redistribution of radioactivity between LDL and HDL, as measured with cynomolgus monkey LPDP as the source of CETP. Triglyceride transfer was progressively inhibited with increasing amounts of the antibody, whereas cholesteryl ester transfer was progressively inhibited only at antibody concentrations ≤16 nM. Beyond this point, the inhibition decreased with increasing antibody concentration until at concentrations near 100 nM, cholesteryl ester transfer was almost normal. Subsequent studies (not shown) demonstrated that at CMTP-2 concentrations above 1 μM, cholesteryl ester transfer was not inhibited whatsoever. The icons in the lower portion of the graphs are intended to show the theoretical relationship between antigen (depicted as the gray globular structure) and antibody (depicted as the black y-shaped structure) at various antibody concentrations. If the affinity of the antibody for CETP is high, then at antibody concentrations below stoichiometry the antibody should be saturated with CETP, i.e. both antigen binding sites should be occupied. This form is depicted by the icon (a) in the lower left of Fig. 2A. As the antibody concentration increases, the degree of saturation decreases, such that at antibody concentrations well above stoichiometry only one of the antigen binding sites should be occupied. That form of the antibody-CETP complex is depicted by the icon (b) in the lower right portion of Fig. 2A. We hypothesized that only the saturated form of the antibody (Fig. 2A, icon a) is capable of inhibiting cholesteryl ester transfer, and the loss of inhibition evident at high antibody concentrations (>16 nM) coincides with the accumulation of the hemisaturated form of the antibody (Fig. 2A, icon b). To test this premise, we produced antibody binding (Fab) fragments of CMTP-2 and evaluated the effects of those Fab fragments on cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer. The results of those experiments are shown in Fig. 2B. The CMTP-2 Fab fragments, like the intact antibody, were capable of completely inhibiting triglyceride transfer, but no inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer was detectable, even at Fab concentrations near 1 μM. These experiments not only support the hypothesis that both antigen binding sites on CMTP-2 must be occupied for cholesteryl ester transfer to be inhibited, but also demonstrate that CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester transfer can be uncoupled from triglyceride transfer. To eliminate the possibility that a distinct protein was responsible for each type of neutral lipid transfer, the Fab studies were repeated using recombinant cynomolgus monkey CETP that had been purified from the media of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the protein. Fig. 3shows the results of those experiments. Note that, as with LPDP, there was a selective inhibition of triglyceride transfer by the Fab fragments and no inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer whatsoever. Thus, triglyceride transfer could be selectively inhibited regardless of whether LPDP, or purified, recombinant CETP was used as the source of transfer activity. The question then arose as to whether the converse condition could be created, i.e. whether cholesteryl ester transfer could be inhibited without affecting triglyceride transfer. Fig. 4shows the effects of the compound 6-chloromecuric cholesterol (U-617) on neutral lipid transfer mediated by cynomolgus monkey LPDP. Those data show that selective inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer is indeed possible. Separate studies of U-617 inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer using purified, recombinant cynomolgus monkey CETP and synthetic donors and acceptors(19Epps D.E. Harris J.S. Greenlee K.A. Fisher J.F. Marschke C.K. Castle C.K. Ulrich R.G. Moll T.S. Melchior G.W. Kezdy F.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), indicated that U-617 was a competitive inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer that had no detectable effect on triglyceride transfer. 2Epps, D. E., Greenlee, K. A., Harris, J. S., Thomas, E. W., Castle, C. K., Fisher, J. F., Hozak, R. R., Marschke, C. K., Melchior, G. W., and Kezdy, F. J. (1995) Biochemistry, in press. To determine whether the CMTP-2 Fab binding site on cynomolgus monkey CETP overlapped the U-617 binding site, monkey LPDP was preincubated with high concentrations of the Fab fragments after which the effects of U-617 on lipid transfer were measured. As expected, triglyceride transfer was inhibited greater than 95%; the effects on cholesteryl ester transfer are shown in Fig. 5. Note that the Fab fragments did not block the ability of the compound to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer and, in fact, appeared to increase the potency of U-617 somewhat. That indicates that the site on CETP at which U-617 binds is different from that which binds the Fab. Given the observations that the transfer of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride could be selectively inhibited in vitro, the question arose whether the same would occur in vivo. Previous studies (25Whitlock M.E. Swenson T.L. Ramakrishnan R. Leonard M.T. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Gaynor B.J. Sand T. Clark R.W. Aiello R.J. Bamberger M.J. Moberly J.B.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1634-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer resulted in an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels, but it has not been firmly established what effect selective inhibition of triglyceride transfer would have on plasma lipoprotein levels. To see whether triglyceride transfer could be inhibited in vivo to a significantly greater extent than cholesteryl ester transfer, 30 mg of purified CMTP-2 were administered to each of four cynomolgus monkeys subcutaneously. Analysis of plasma samples taken from those monkeys at various times after antibody administration indicated that triglyceride transfer was inhibited approximately 90% from 24 to 96 h and that it was inhibited to a much larger extent than cholesteryl ester transfer (Fig. 6). Table 2shows the effects of antibody administration on the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in those monkeys. Note that there was not a significant effect of the antibody on either total or HDL cholesterol levels; however, there was a clear decrease in total plasma triglyceride concentrations as a result of antibody treatment, and that decrease appeared to be due largely to the decrease in the HDL fraction. In separate studies run in parallel with these, four other monkeys were injected each with 30 mg of CMTP-1, a monoclonal antibody to cynomolgus monkey CETP which had no detectable effect on either triglyceride or cholesteryl ester transfer in vitro, and in these studies no effect on total or HDL triglyceride or cholesterol concentrations was detected. That indicates that the change in HDL triglycerides evident in Table 2was due to inhibition of CETP-mediated triglyceride transfer by CMTP-2. To evaluate more carefully the effects of CMTP-2 administration on the structure of the HDL, three different monkeys were given 30 mg each of the antibody subcutaneously, and a blood sample taken 48 h later for HDL composition analysis. The results of those analyses are contained in Table 3and show that treatment with the antibody for 48 h resulted in an HDL that was virtually devoid of triglyceride, but was otherwise unaffected. That was taken as evidence that triglyceride transfer was inhibited well out of proportion to cholesteryl ester transfer, and therefore, that the antibody also uncoupled cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer in vivo. It also indicated that essentially all of the triglyceride in the HDL of the cynomolgus monkey was transferred there from other triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (e.g. very low density lipoprotein and chylomicrons) by CETP.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The studies reported here demonstrate that the CETP-mediated transfer of cholesteryl ester can be inhibited without effect on triglyceride transfer and, conversely, triglyceride transfer can be inhibited without effect on cholesteryl ester transfer. From this we conclude that the two lipids are not transferred by a single, non-discriminatory process. Given that the same protein is responsible for the transfer of both types of neutral lipid, the question becomes, how is that discrimination possible? We would propose, based on currently accepted models of the transfer process(2Barter P.J. Jones M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 238-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ihm J. Quinn D.M. Busch S.J. Chataing B. Harmony J.A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 361-367Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), that two specific, nonoverlapping binding sites are involved in the transfer of the two classes of lipid. An underlying assumption here is that both of the inhibitors presented in this paper block transfer by interacting directly with CETP, and not by altering the donor or acceptor. In the case of U-617, we base that deduction on previous studies2 which showed that U-617 is a competitive inhibitor which probably reacts with an unpaired cysteine in CETP. In the case of CMTP-2, we know that the antibody recognizes an epitope on CETP, since it was obtained by screening hybridomas using a direct binding assay. Finally, if either or both of the current models of the transfer process (2Barter P.J. Jones M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 238-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ihm J. Quinn D.M. Busch S.J. Chataing B. Harmony J.A.K. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 361-367Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) are correct, then the inhibitors must be interacting directly with the protein, for it would not be possible to selectively inhibit transfer of one or the other lipid by blocking the docking, dissociation, or diffusion steps. To confirm that the selective inhibition detected using the in vitro assay was, in fact, real, and not an artifact of the assay, we evaluated the effect of the inhibitor of triglyceride transfer in vivo. The reasoning was that if selective inhibition is occurring, it should manifest itself as a selective change in the lipoprotein composition. For example, previous studies(25Whitlock M.E. Swenson T.L.

Exp. 1991; 40: 756-763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown that inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer causes an increase in the plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. If, as indicated by the in vitro assay, CMTP-2 at high concentrations inhibits triglyceride transfer but not cholesteryl ester transfer, in vivo administration of the antibody should change the HDL triglyceride content with no effect on the HDL cholesterol levels. That is precisely what occurred: the triglyceride content of HDL was reduced more than 10-fold by antibody treatment while the cholesterol content of HDL remained essentially unchanged. Thus, CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer can be uncoupled in vivo, in full agreement with the two-site hypothesis. Others (16Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1058-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fukasawa M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 696-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have reported that CETP-mediated triglyceride transfer could be selectively inhibited, but it has been argued (32Swenson T.L. Hesler C.B. Brown M.L. Quinet E. Trotta P.P. Haslanger M.F. Gaeta F.C.A. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14318-14326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that, because triglycerides have a larger molecular volume (1600 Å3) than cholesteryl esters (1090 Å3), a given inhibitor could partially obstruct access to a single binding site such that the cholesteryl esters could exchange but not the triglycerides. However, in these and previous studies,2 U-617 was found to inhibit transfer of the smaller molecule but not that of the larger. Therefore, that explanation is not adequate in this instance. On the other hand, by postulating the existence of two neutral lipid binding sites, one can invoke the same principle to explain the selectivity of U-617 for cholesteryl esters; i.e. that a second, but smaller, neutral lipid binding site exists on CETP which is accessible to cholesteryl esters, but not triglycerides, and with which U-617 interacts specifically. If discrete binding sites exist, and each of the inhibitors used here is, in fact, selective for a distinct site, then the binding of one inhibitor should not reduce the effectiveness of the other. Incubation of CETP with CMTP-2 Fab fragments completely blocks triglyceride transfer, but does not interfere with the ability of U-617 to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer. Thus, the binding sites of the two inhibitors do not overlap; a conclusion in full agreement with the two binding site hypothesis. Finally, the two-binding site hypothesis is entirely compatible with the observation that CMTP-2 inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer was reversible beyond a certain antibody concentration, but triglyceride transfer was not. We would propose that the site principally responsible for triglyceride transfer is the epitope recognized by the antibody (i.e. blocked by attachment of the antigen binding region of the antibody) and that the cholesteryl ester binding site is a separate site which does not react with the antibody, but is located such that access to it is hindered by a second CETP molecule bound to the same antibody (Fig. 2A, icon a). Thus, at low antibody concentration (below 16 nM; Fig. 2A), both antigen binding sites are occupied and cholesteryl ester transfer is inhibited; however, as the antibody concentration increases beyond 16 nM and the unsaturated form of the antibody (Fig. 2A, icon b) becomes the predominant species, access to the cholesteryl ester transfer site is restored and inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer is relieved. The fact that CMTP-2 Fab fragments had no observable effect on cholesteryl ester transfer is taken as support for this explanation of the reversible transfer, and therefore, for the premise that topologically distinct, neutral lipid binding sites exist on cynomolgus monkey CETP. If CETP does, in fact, contain a distinct binding site for each of the two substrates, then there would be the possibility that genetic drift could alter the protein such that the ratio of the specificities toward the two substrates would be different for different species. Such species to species differences should be less evident in the case of a single, non-discriminatory binding site. Comparing CETP activity from three species and using identical assay conditions for measuring those activities, we do, indeed, find substantial species-dependent differences in the substrate specificities. As shown in Table 4, the ratio of transfer rates, VCE/VTG, ranges from 0.76 for hamster CETP to 7.5 for the human CETP. Thus, substrate specificity is an intrinsic property of the protein and that specificity can vary considerably among species, suggesting divergent adaptation of the two sites.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab There is abundant precedent for the existence of multiple lipid binding sites on a single protein. Probably the best example of this is plasma albumin, which has two major binding domains (designated subdomains IIA and IIIA(33Min X. Carter D.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3492) Google Scholar)), and possibly multiple lipid binding sites within a subdomain(34Hamilton J.A. Era S. Bhamidipati S.P. Reed R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The experiments described here suggest that two or more neutral lipid binding sites may also exist on cynomolgus monkey CETP, but offer no information as to whether these represent distinct structural domains, or separate binding sites within a single domain. They do, however, suggest that the binding sites are dissimilar, since one appears to have a higher affinity for triglycerides and the other a higher affinity for cholesteryl esters. Morton and Zilversmit (16Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have argued against the two-site hypothesis, based largely on the observation that increasing the cholesteryl ester concentration in the donor particle decreased the rate of transfer of triglycerides ((16Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Table 2) which they interpreted as indication that the two lipids were competing for a single site. However, since increasing the fraction of cholesteryl esters in the lipid core automatically decreased that of the triglycerides, these observations may simply reflect the fact that the transfer rate of each substrate depends on the concentration of that substrate in the donor, i.e. the triglyceride transfer rate may have decreased, not because of competition for the binding site, but simply because the triglyceride concentration in the donor was reduced. Thus, these data do not prove that these two lipids compete with each other for a single binding site. Nonetheless, we would agree with Morton and Zilversmit (16Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11751-11757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the two lipids are probably mutually exclusive (binding at one site precludes binding at the other), for otherwise it is difficult to explain the “net mass transfer” phenomenon. Mutual exclusivity could occur as a result of conformational changes induced in one site when the other is occupied; or, because of their spatial relationship, CETP may simply be unable to present both sites to the lipid donor simultaneously. In the latter case, one would have to hypothesize that, once either site becomes occupied, CETP dissociates, so that only 1 mol of a given lipid would be transferred at a time, otherwise net mass transfer could not occur. The single most compelling evidence that two sites exist is the observation that exchange of either lipid can continue, even though transfer of the other is blocked. Several studies(16Morton R.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28206-28213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for example, produced a monoclonal antibody against rabbit CETP that had an inhibitory pattern which was very similar to that observed with CMTP-2, i.e. at high antibody concentrations triglyceride transfer was completely blocked, but cholesteryl esters continued to exchange. Despite these results, those authors proposed that there was but one lipid binding site, and invoked the steric hindrance hypothesis (discussed above) to explain their observations. However, this seems unlikely given the observations that compounds such as U-617 and PD 140195 (37Bisgaier C.L. Essenburg A.D. Minton L.L. Homan R. Blankley C.J. White A. Lipids. 1994; 29: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) can selectively inhibit transfer of the smaller of the two lipids. Ko et al.(24Ko K.W.S. Ohnishi T. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28206-28213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also observed that, even though cholesteryl ester exchange continued after triglyceride exchange was blocked, net mass transfer of cholesteryl ester appeared to have been blocked. Thus, by blocking one site, one apparently renders CETP incapable of net mass transfer. Although no direct evidence exists for the one or two lipid binding sites on CETP, many of the observations reported to date are difficult to reconcile with a single binding site, whereas all observations are consistent with the two-site hypothesis. The question of one or two sites is more than academic and leads to the physiologically important question of whether cholesteryl ester and triglyceride binding and transfer are mutually exclusive, or can a ternary CETP-CE-triglyceride complex be formed? We feel that the mutual exculsion of the two lipids from CETP is probably real but is due to the fact that CETP is unable to present both binding sites simultaneously to the lipid donor."
