https://openalex.org/W2254906934,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates multiple steps in glucose metabolism and also cytoskeletal functions, such as cell movement and attachment. Here, we show that PI3K directly coordinates glycolysis with cytoskeletal dynamics in an AKT-independent manner. Growth factors or insulin stimulate the PI3K-dependent activation of Rac, leading to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, release of filamentous actin-bound aldolase A, and an increase in aldolase activity. Consistently, PI3K inhibitors, but not AKT, SGK, or mTOR inhibitors, cause a significant decrease in glycolysis at the step catalyzed by aldolase, while activating PIK3CA mutations have the opposite effect. These results point toward a master regulatory function of PI3K that integrates an epithelial cell's metabolism and its form, shape, and function, coordinating glycolysis with the energy-intensive dynamics of actin remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2261380995,"Abiotic stresses such as drought, heat or salinity are a major cause of yield loss worldwide. Recent studies revealed that the acclimation of plants to a combination of different environmental stresses is unique and cannot be directly deduced from studying the response of plants to each of the different stresses applied individually. Here we report on the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to a combination of salt and heat stress using transcriptome analysis, physiological measurements and mutants deficient in abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid or ethylene signaling. Arabidopsis plants were found to be more susceptible to a combination of salt and heat stress compared to each of the different stresses applied individually. The stress combination resulted in a higher ratio of Na+/K+ in leaves and caused the enhanced expression of 699 transcripts unique to the stress combination. Interestingly, many of the transcripts that specifically accumulated in plants in response to the salt and heat stress combination were associated with the plant hormone abscisic acid. In accordance with this finding, mutants deficient in abscisic acid metabolism and signaling were found to be more susceptible to a combination of salt and heat stress than wild type plants. Our study highlights the important role abscisic acid plays in the acclimation of plants to a combination of two different abiotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2254647278,"The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is activated when a cell swells, and it plays a central role in maintaining cell volume in response to osmotic challenges. SWELL1 (LRRC8A) was recently identified as an essential component of VRAC. However, the identity of the pore-forming subunits of VRAC and how the channel is gated by cell swelling are unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 and up to four other LRRC8 subunits assemble into heterogeneous complexes of ∼800 kDa. When reconstituted into bilayers, LRRC8 complexes are sufficient to form anion channels activated by osmolality gradients. In bilayers, as well as in cells, the single-channel conductance of the complexes depends on the LRRC8 composition. Finally, low ionic strength (Γ) in the absence of an osmotic gradient activates the complexes in bilayers. These data demonstrate that LRRC8 proteins together constitute the VRAC pore and that hypotonic stress can activate VRAC through a decrease in cytoplasmic Γ."
https://openalex.org/W2266822253,"The Hippo signaling pathway functions through Yorkie to control tissue growth and homeostasis. How this pathway regulates non-developmental processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we report an essential role for Hippo signaling in innate immunity whereby Yorkie directly regulates the transcription of the Drosophila IκB homolog, Cactus, in Toll receptor-mediated antimicrobial response. Loss of Hippo pathway tumor suppressors or activation of Yorkie in fat bodies, the Drosophila immune organ, leads to elevated cactus mRNA levels, decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides, and vulnerability to infection by Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, Gram-positive bacteria acutely activate Hippo-Yorkie signaling in fat bodies via the Toll-Myd88-Pelle cascade through Pelle-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of the Cka subunit of the Hippo-inhibitory STRIPAK PP2A complex. Our studies elucidate a Toll-mediated Hippo signaling pathway in antimicrobial response, highlight the importance of regulating IκB/Cactus transcription in innate immunity, and identify Gram-positive bacteria as extracellular stimuli of Hippo signaling under physiological settings."
https://openalex.org/W2254116509,"More than one-half billion people are obese, and despite progress in genetic research, much of the heritability of obesity remains enigmatic. Here, we identify a Trim28-dependent network capable of triggering obesity in a non-Mendelian, ""on/off"" manner. Trim28(+/D9) mutant mice exhibit a bi-modal body-weight distribution, with isogenic animals randomly emerging as either normal or obese and few intermediates. We find that the obese-""on"" state is characterized by reduced expression of an imprinted gene network including Nnat, Peg3, Cdkn1c, and Plagl1 and that independent targeting of these alleles recapitulates the stochastic bi-stable disease phenotype. Adipose tissue transcriptome analyses in children indicate that humans too cluster into distinct sub-populations, stratifying according to Trim28 expression, transcriptome organization, and obesity-associated imprinted gene dysregulation. These data provide evidence of discrete polyphenism in mouse and man and thus carry important implications for complex trait genetics, evolution, and medicine."

Many common reproductive disorders in humans are associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We characterized the metabolic mechanisms that support oogenesis and found that mitochondria in mature Drosophila oocytes enter a low-activity state of respiratory quiescence by remodeling the electron transport chain (ETC). This shift in mitochondrial function leads to extensive glycogen accumulation late in oogenesis and is required for the developmental competence of the oocyte. Decreased insulin signaling initiates ETC remodeling and mitochondrial respiratory quiescence through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3).

Our studies reveal an important link between metabolism and oocyte maturation. Reproduction is intimately associated with nutrition and the metabolic state of the organism. Moreover, reproduction imposes tremendous demands on female metabolism to provide the nutrients and building blocks required for embryogenesis. Women suffering from metabolic syndrome and diabetes frequently suffer from infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and elevated rates of ovarian cancer (Ben-Shlomo and Younis, 2014Ben-Shlomo I.

Intriguingly, PCOS, the most common cause of female infertility, blocks both oocyte maturation and ovulation, suggesting a link between metabolic regulation and oocyte development (Mayer et al., 2015Mayer S.B.

Furthermore, metabolic disruptions may be associated with cases of impaired developmental competence of oocytes of women undergoing in vitro fertilization (Van Blerkom, 2011Van Blerkom J. Mitochondrial function in the human oocyte and embryo and their role in developmental competence.Mitochondrion. 2011; 11: 797-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Despite these links, the precise metabolic mechanisms that support normal oocyte development and maturation remain unknown. Drosophila oocyte development provides an ideal system to characterize the links between metabolic regulation and oocyte development. During Drosophila oogenesis, germline and somatic stem cells continuously generate new follicles comprising an oocyte and 15 associated nurse cells surrounded by somatic follicle cells (Spradling, 1993Spradling A.C. Germline cysts: communes that work.Cell. 1993; 72: 649-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Follicles develop through 14 morphologically distinct stages over 7 days. During the final stages of oogenesis, yolk proteins and lipids normally accumulate in a process called vitellogenesis (Buszczak et al., 2002Buszczak M. Lu X. Segraves W.A. Chang T.Y. Cooley L.

At the end of vitellogenesis, carbohydrates accumulate within the oocyte (Gutzeit et al., 1994Gutzeit H.O. Zissler D. Grau V. Liphardt M. Heinrich U.R.

The egg’s stored lipids and carbohydrates function as a fuel depot for the developing embryo (Tennessen et al., 2014bTennessen J.M. Bertagnolli N.M. Evans J. Sieber M.H. Cox J. Thummel C.S. Coordinated metabolic transitions during Drosophila embryogenesis and the onset of aerobic glycolysis.G3 (Bethesda). 2014; 4: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similarly, in mammals, where the placenta reduces the burden of nutrient storage, oocytes still enlarge greatly and accumulate large amounts of nutrient-rich yolk for use during the early developmental stages (Dunning et al., 2010Dunning K.R. Cashman K. Russell D.L. Thompson J.G. Norman R.J. Robker R.L. Beta-oxidation is essential for mouse oocyte developmental competence and early embryo development.Biol.

Furthermore, carbohydrates facilitate mammalian oocyte maturation and developmental competence after fertilization (Sutton-McDowall et al., 2010Sutton-McDowall M.L. Gilchrist R.B. Thompson J.G.

Dev. 2001; 58: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting a highly conserved link between carbohydrate accumulation and oocyte development. One key factor dictating the balance of carbohydrate catabolism and storage is mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. In most cells with active insulin signaling, glucose is broken down through glycolysis into pyruvate that is consumed by the mitochondria to supply the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle then provides intermediates such as NADH and succinate to fuel the electron transport chain (ETC) and stimulate ATP production. During oogenesis, mitochondria increase greatly in number in mature oocytes (Cox and Spradling, 2003Cox R.T. Spradling A.C.

After fertilization, calcium is released from the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial activity increases during embryogenesis (Campbell and Swann, 2006Campbell K. Swann K.

Mitochondrial function in the human oocyte and embryo and their role in developmental competence.Mitochondrion. 2011; 11: 797-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the mechanism behind these major changes in mitochondrial function during oocyte development, fertilization, and early embryogenesis remains unclear. The insulin-signaling pathway is a key regulator carbohydrate metabolism, mitochondrial function, and growth (Saltiel and Kahn, 2001Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Insulin signalling and the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar, Stump et al., 2003Stump C.S. Short K.R. Bigelow M.L.

USA. 2003; 100: 7996-8001Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT kinase cascade to activate targets that affect both growth and metabolism. Studies in Drosophila have shown that insulin signaling regulates oogenesis by controlling germline stem cell division, promoting follicle growth, and controlling the transition to vitellogenesis during stage 8 (LaFever and Drummond-Barbosa, 2005LaFever L.

Alpha-endosulfine, a potential regulator of insulin secretion, is required for adult tissue growth control in Drosophila.Dev. Biol. 2004; 266: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similarly, insulin is also thought to control mammalian oocyte development (Acevedo et al., 2007Acevedo N. Ding J. Smith G.D. Insulin signaling in mouse oocytes.Biol.

However, very little is known about the metabolic role for insulin signaling during germline development. In this study, we identified a dynamic shift in carbohydrate utilization during late oogenesis that leads to extensive glycogen accumulation. This shift in metabolism occurs as mitochondria depolarize, remodel their ETC, and enter the low-activity state of mitochondrial respiratory quiescence. We have found that entry into mitochondrial respiratory quiescence is controlled by a reduction in insulin signaling during the final stages of oocyte development. More specifically, the Akt target gene GSK3, which promotes remodeling of the ETC components in the mitochondria, triggers mitochondrial respiratory quiescence. Overall, these studies define the dynamic changes in mitochondrial function that couple nutrient state to oocyte development. To examine carbohydrate accumulation during Drosophila oogenesis, we dissected ovaries from adult Oregon R females and stained developing ovarioles with periodic acid Schiff’s (PAS) reagent. Oocyte glycogen content began increasing near the end of oogenesis during stage 12 and grew dramatically up until stage 14 (Figure 1A). We quantified this glycogen accumulation via colorimetric assay using dissected follicles and confirmed that glycogen rose ∼38-fold between stages 10 and 14 (Figure S1A).Figure S1A Shift in Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis Drives Glycogen Accumulation in Oocytes, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Colorimetric glycogen measurements of stage 10 and stage 14 oocytes.(B) GC/MS measurements of free fatty acids from stage 10 and stage 14 follicles.(C) GC/MS measurements of amino acids from stage 10 and stage 14 follicles.(D) Colorimetric glycogen measurements of stage 14 oocytes from pgdn39,zw1029 double-mutant females.(E) Periodic acid Schiff’s staining of glycogen in stage 14 oocytes from spinΔ58/spin10403 mutant femalesError bars represent SEM. ∗p < 0.05 ∗∗p < 0.005.

Scale bar = 50um We investigated the cause of glycogen accumulation by subjecting isolated stage 10 and 14 follicles to gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) metabolomic analysis. While most compounds, such as free fatty acids (Figure S1B), were unchanged, stage 14 follicles showed a pronounced increase in several saccharides including fructose, ribose, mannose, and galactose (Figure 1B). Additionally, a number of key glycolytic/gluconeogenic intermediates including pyruvate, phosphoglycerate, 3-phophoglycerate, glucose-1-phophate, and glucose-6-phophate increased 3- to 14-fold in stage 14 follicles (Figures 1B and 1E). Lactate, a byproduct of high glycolytic activity, remained at a constant low level between these stages, suggesting a dramatic reduction in glycolysis in stage 14 oocytes. Our GC/MS metabolomics also revealed a significant accumulation of a subset of TCA-cycle intermediates including: 2-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate, fumarate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate, suggesting an increased amino acid input into the TCA cycle in stage 14 follicles (Figure 1C). Collectively, the increases in both TCA cycle and glycolytic intermediates, particularly pyruvate, are consistent with a decreased glycolytic input into the TCA cycle and a corresponding increase in amino acid input. To further support this model, we compared the amino acid composition of stage 10 to stage 14 follicles and found that the most abundant amino acid present at stage 10, aspartate, decreased 60% by stage 14 consistent with aspartate’s role as a glucogenic amino acid (Figure S1C). To determine if gluconeogenesis contributes to glycogen accumulation in stage 14 oocytes we assayed glycogen levels in pepckGS/pepckGS mutant oocytes, which lack gluconeogenesis, and found that oocyte glycogen levels are significantly reduced (Figure 1F). In addition, pgdn39,zw1029 double mutants of the pentose-phosphate pathway, which antagonize gluconeogenesis by catabolizing glucose-6-phosphate to produce NADPH and ribose, significantly increased oocyte glycogen content, supporting a role for gluconeogenesis in germline glycogen accumulation (Figure S1D). Interestingly, the timing of glycogen accumulation precisely coincides with the period when nurse cell nuclei are digested and the oocyte becomes a closed-metabolic system. These observations suggest that degraded nurse cell contents may provide additional substrates for glucose synthesis and glycogen storage. Consistent with this idea, the purine degradation products ribose, xanthine, and hypoxanthine increased substantially in stage 14 oocytes (Figure 1D). Moreover, when we inhibited the breakdown of nurse cell nuclei using previously characterized mutations in DNaseII (Bass et al., 2009Bass B.P. Tanner E.A. Mateos San Martín D. Blute T. Kinser R.D. Dolph P.J. McCall K. Cell-autonomous requirement for DNaseII in nonapoptotic cell death.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Figure 1G) or spinster (Bass et al., 2009Bass B.P. Tanner E.A. Mateos San Martín D. Blute T. Kinser R.D. Dolph P.J. McCall K.

We examined the distribution of mitochondria throughout oogenesis using two mitochondrial markers, ATP5a and mito-GFP. Mitochondria display perinuclear localization during the early stages of oogenesis (Figures 2A, 2E , S2A–S2F , and S2J). However, beginning at stage 10, mitochondria become more widely dispersed (Figures 2C and S2J). To assess the significance of this mitochondrial dispersal, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential in dissected ovarioles using the mitochondrial membrane potential dye TMRE. Mitochondria exhibit a strong membrane potential signal beginning early in oogenesis. The signal is strongest in the perinuclear region of the cell where mitochondria are enriched (Figures 2B and 2F). Strikingly, mitochondrial membrane potential becomes strongly reduced during stage 10B (Figures 2D and 2F–2H) (N > 40 follicles/stage), suggesting that dispersal coincides with a decrease in mitochondrial activity.Figure S2Mitochondria Enter a Low-Energy State of Respiratory Quiescence to Promote Glycogen Storage in Late Oogenesis, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–F) Females containing a mitochondrial-GFP transgene were dissected, fixed, and stained with ATP5a and GFP antibodies.

(J) Quantification of perinuclear ATP5a staining from stage 8 and stage 10 follicles. Scale bar = 50um We examined mitochondrial activity directly by measuring the specific enzymatic activity of ETC complexes using compound assays for complex I/III and complex II/III. Early follicles (germaria-stage 8) displayed high levels of both complex I/III and complex II/III activity (Figures 2I and 2J). A significant amount of this activity was inhibited by rotenone (complex I inhibitor) or by malonate (complex II inhibitor), respectively. Both complex I/III and complex II/III activity decreased dramatically in stage 14 follicles, despite the fact that the amount of mitochondrial DNA increased 2-fold between stage 10 and stage 14 (Figure 2N). Furthermore, virtually all of the rotenone-sensitive or malonate-sensitive activity was lost. The low levels of complex I/III and complex II/III activity in stage 14 oocytes are consistent with our previous observation that mitochondrial membrane potential is lost. In contrast, complex IV activity remained constant in stage 14 oocytes, suggesting complexes I, II, and III are specifically downregulated during the final stages of oogenesis (Figure 2K). We examined developing embryos to learn when and where mitochondrial activity is restored after fertilization. Mitochondrial membrane potential was re-established during embryonic cellularization (Figure S2G), dorsal closure (Figure S2H), and in developing muscle (Figure S2I). Moreover, complex I/III and complex II/III enzymatic activity both recovered during embryogenesis (Figure 2I and 2J). If decreased mitochondrial activity is a primary cause of glycogen accumulation, then glycolytic intermediates should begin to increase in stage 10 oocytes. Consistent with our model, GC/MS metabolomics of stage 8 and stage 10 follicles, revealed that many glycolytic (Figure 2L) and TCA cycle intermediates (Figure 2L) that were high in stage 14, had already begun to increase during stage 10. Thus, oocyte mitochondrial respiratory quiescence is likely to promote glycogen accumulation. In mitochondria from early-stage follicles (germaria-stage 8), we observed robust bands corresponding to assembled respiratory chain complexes I, III, IV, and V via blue native gel electrophoresis (Figure 3A). Strikingly, complexes I and V were significantly decreased in mitochondria from purified stage 14 oocytes, while complex IV was unchanged (Figure 3A). Complexes I and V reappeared during embryogenesis (Figure 3B), consistent with the return of mitochondrial activity after fertilization. We quantified these effects by calculating the ratio of complexes I:IV (Figure 3C), III:IV (Figure S3A), and V:IV (Figure 3D). The ratios of complexes I:IV and V:IV both decrease in stage 14 oocytes only to increase again during embryogenesis. Using native western blots for ATP5a (Figure 3E), we observed a reduction in the amount of assembled complex V and a corresponding increase in lower-molecular-weight complexes during late oogenesis.Figure S3Mitochondria Enter a Low-Energy State of Respiratory Quiescence to Promote Glycogen Storage in Late Oogenesis, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Quantification of the ratio of complex III/complex IV from early follicles, stage 14 oocytes, and 12-16hr embryos.(B) SDS Coomassie protein gel of mitochondria isolated from early stage follicles and stage 14 oocytes.(C) Western blots of cytosolic fractions from early stage and stage 14 follicles.(D) Quanitification of the number of mitochondria with well defined cristae from EM images of early stage oocytes, stage 14 oocytes, GSK3-RNAi stage 14 oocytes, and embryos.

(F) Quantification of mitochondrial ATP5a, NUDFS3, and PORIN protein levels stage 8 oocytes, stage 14 oocytes, and embryos. To determine the cause of the decline in assembled complexes I and V at the end of oogenesis, we performed western blot analysis for NDUFS3 (complex I), ATP5a (complex V), CYTOCHROME C, PORIN, COXIV, as well as ACTIN, and TUBULIN as loading controls (Figure 3F). We found the levels of these proteins did not change in lysates from stage 14 oocytes (Figure S3E). Western blots of purified mitochondria from stage 14 oocytes, however, did show a dramatic reduction in NDUFS3 and PORIN (VDAC1) levels (Figures 3G and S3F) indicating that these proteins are no longer present within mitochondria. Western blots of cytosolic fractions showed an increase in NDUFS3 levels in stage 14 oocytes (Figure S3C). SDS Coomassie gel electrophoresis of purified oocyte mitochondria showed that many proteins decrease in stage 14 (Figure S3B), suggesting that many mitochondrial proteins in addition to NDUFS3 and porin are excluded from the organelle during quiescence. These data suggest that during quiescence, respiratory components remain disassembled and are stored in the oocyte. When we examined mitochondrial structure by electron microscopy, we observed that oocyte mitochondria appear smaller and less differentiated during stage 14 than they do during stage 8 or later during embryogenesis. Furthermore, mitochondria from stage 14 oocytes lack the pronounced cristae seen in stage 8 oocytes, further supporting a global shift in mitochondrial function and remodeling of"
https://openalex.org/W2259317772,"Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have recently outperformed other state-of-the-art approaches, such as i-vector and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), in automatic Language Identification (LID), particularly when dealing with very short utterances (∼3s). In this contribution we present an open-source, end-to-end, LSTM RNN system running on limited computational resources (a single GPU) that outperforms a reference i-vector system on a subset of the NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (8 target languages, 3s task) by up to a 26%. This result is in line with previously published research using proprietary LSTM implementations and huge computational resources, which made these former results hardly reproducible. Further, we extend those previous experiments modeling unseen languages (out of set, OOS, modeling), which is crucial in real applications. Results show that a LSTM RNN with OOS modeling is able to detect these languages and generalizes robustly to unseen OOS languages. Finally, we also analyze the effect of even more limited test data (from 2.25s to 0.1s) proving that with as little as 0.5s an accuracy of over 50% can be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2266905444,"Limited attention has been directed toward the influence of non-abusive parenting behaviour on brain structure in adolescents. It has been suggested that environmental influences during this period are likely to impact the way that the brain develops over time. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between aggressive and positive parenting behaviors on brain development from early to late adolescence, and in turn, psychological and academic functioning during late adolescence, using a multi-wave longitudinal design. Three hundred and sixty seven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained over three time points from 166 adolescents (11–20 years). At the first time point, observed measures of maternal aggressive and positive behaviors were obtained. At the final time point, measures of psychological and academic functioning were obtained. Results indicated that a higher frequency of maternal aggressive behavior was associated with alterations in the development of right superior frontal and lateral parietal cortical thickness, and of nucleus accumbens volume, in males. Development of the superior frontal cortex in males mediated the relationship between maternal aggressive behaviour and measures of late adolescent functioning. We suggest that our results support an association between negative parenting and adolescent functioning, which may be mediated by immature or delayed brain maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2252541578,"Enteric neuropathies are severe gastrointestinal disorders with unsatisfactory outcomes. We aimed to investigate the potential of enteric neural stem cell therapy approaches for such disorders by transplanting mouse enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) into ganglionic and aganglionic mouse gut in vivo and analysing functional integration and long-term safety.Neurospheres generated from yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expressing ENCCs selected from postnatal Wnt1-cre;R26R-YFP/YFP murine gut were transplanted into ganglionic hindgut of wild-type littermates or aganglionic hindgut of Ednrbtm1Ywa mice (lacking functional endothelin receptor type-B). Intestines were then assessed for ENCC integration and differentiation using immunohistochemistry, cell function using calcium imaging, and long-term safety using PCR to detect off-target YFP expression.YFP+ ENCCs engrafted, proliferated and differentiated into enteric neurons and glia within recipient ganglionic gut. Transplanted cells and their projections spread along the endogenous myenteric plexus to form branching networks. Electrical point stimulation of endogenous nerve fibres resulted in calcium transients (F/F0 = 1.16 ± 0.01;43 cells, n = 6) in YFP+ transplanted ENCCs (abolished with TTX). Long-term follow-up (24 months) showed transplanted ENCCs did not give rise to tumours or spread to other organs (PCR negative in extraintestinal sites). In aganglionic gut ENCCs similarly spread and differentiated to form neuronal and glial networks with projections closely associated with endogenous neural networks of the transition zone.Transplanted ENCCs successfully engrafted into recipient ganglionic and aganglionic gut showing appropriate spread, localisation and, importantly, functional integration without any long-term safety issues. This study provides key support for the development and use of enteric neural stem cell therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2254881360,"Objective A study was conducted to recover carbapenem-resistant bacteria from the faeces of dairy cattle and identify the underlying genetic mechanisms associated with reduced phenotypic susceptibility to carbapenems. Methods One hundred and fifty-nine faecal samples from dairy cattle were screened for carbapenem-resistant bacteria. Phenotypic screening was conducted on two media containing ertapenem. The isolates from the screening step were characterised via disk diffusion, Modified Hodge, and Carba NP assays. Carbapenem-resistant bacteria and carbapenemase-producing isolates were subjected to Gram staining and biochemical testing to include Gram-negative bacilli. Whole genome sequencing was performed on bacteria that exhibited either a carbapenemase-producing phenotype or were not susceptible to ertapenem and were presumptively Enterobacteriaceae. Results Of 323 isolates collected from the screening media, 28 were selected for WGS; 21 of which were based on a carbapenemase-producing phenotype and 7 were presumptively Enterobacteriaceae and not susceptible to ertapenem. Based on analysis of WGS data, isolates included: 3 Escherichia coli harbouring blaCMY-2 and truncated ompF genes; 8 Aeromonas harbouring blacphA-like genes; 1 Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring a novel blaOXA gene (blaOXA-497); and 6 Pseudomonas with conserved domains of various carbapenemase-producing genes. Conclusions Carbapenem resistant bacteria appear to be rare in cattle. Nonetheless, carbapenem-resistant bacteria were detected across various genera and were found to harbour a variety of mechanisms conferring reduced susceptibility. The development and dissemination of carbapenem-resistant bacteria in livestock would have grave implications for therapeutic treatment options in human medicine; thus, continued monitoring of carbapenem susceptibility among enteric bacteria of livestock is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2253380333,"Seed weight is a critical and direct trait for oilseed crop seed yield. Understanding its genetic mechanism is of great importance for yield improvement in Brassica napus breeding. Two hundred and fifty doubled haploid lines derived by microspore culture were developed from a cross between a large-seed line G-42 and a small-seed line 7-9. According to the 1000-seed weight (TSW) data, the individual DNA of the heaviest 46 lines and the lightest 47 lines were respectively selected to establish two bulked DNA pools. A new high-throughput sequencing technology, Specific Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF-seq), was used to identify candidate genes of TSW in association analysis combined with bulked segregant analysis (BSA). A total of 1,933 high quality polymorphic SLAF markers were developed and 4 associated markers of TSW were procured. A hot region of ~0.58 Mb at nucleotides 25,401,885-25,985,931 on ChrA09 containing 91 candidate genes was identified as tightly associated with the TSW trait. From annotation information, four genes (GSBRNA2T00037136001, GSBRNA2T00037157001, GSBRNA2T00037129001 and GSBRNA2T00069389001) might be interesting candidate genes that are highly related to seed weight."
https://openalex.org/W2260211043,"Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prevalent chronic liver disease all over the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between dietary vitamin C intake and NAFLD. Method Subjects were diagnosed with NAFLD by abdominal ultrasound examination and the consumption of alcohol was less than 40g/day for men or less than 20g/day for women. Vitamin C intake was classified into four categories according to the quartile distribution in the study population: ≤74.80 mg/day, 74.81–110.15 mg/day, 110.16–146.06 mg/day, and ≥146.07 mg/day. The energy and multi-variable adjusted odds ratio (OR), as well as their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), were used to determine the relationship between dietary vitamin C intake and NAFLD through logistic regression. Result The present cross-sectional study included 3471 subjects. A significant inverse association between dietary vitamin C intake and NAFLD was observed in the energy-adjusted and the multivariable model. The multivariable adjusted ORs (95%CI) for NAFLD were 0.69 (95%CI: 0.54–0.89), 0.93 (95%CI: 0.72–1.20), and 0.71 (95%CI: 0.53–0.95) in the second, third and fourth dietary vitamin C intake quartiles, respectively, compared with the lowest (first) quartile. The relative odds of NAFLD was decreased by 0.71 times in the fourth quartile of dietary vitamin C intake compared with the lowest quartile. After stratifying data by sex or the status of obesity, the inverse association remained valid in the male population or non-obesity population, but not in the female population or obesity population. Conclusion There might be a moderate inverse association between dietary vitamin C intake and NAFLD in middle-aged and older adults, especially for the male population and non-obesity population."
https://openalex.org/W2258212760,"Neurogenesis is initiated by the transient expression of the highly conserved proneural proteins, bHLH transcriptional regulators. Here, we discover a conserved post-translational switch governing the duration of proneural protein activity that is required for proper neuronal development. Phosphorylation of a single Serine at the same position in Scute and Atonal proneural proteins governs the transition from active to inactive forms by regulating DNA binding. The equivalent Neurogenin2 Threonine also regulates DNA binding and proneural activity in the developing mammalian neocortex. Using genome editing in Drosophila, we show that Atonal outlives its mRNA but is inactivated by phosphorylation. Inhibiting the phosphorylation of the conserved proneural Serine causes quantitative changes in expression dynamics and target gene expression resulting in neuronal number and fate defects. Strikingly, even a subtle change from Serine to Threonine appears to shift the duration of Atonal activity in vivo, resulting in neuronal fate defects."
https://openalex.org/W2253234903,"Inflammation plays a fundamental role in the inception and development of atherosclerosis (ATH). Mechanisms of inflammation include the infiltration of monocytes into the injured area and subsequent differentiation into either pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages or anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. We have previously published data suggesting bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) enhances M2 macrophage differentiation and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vitro. In this regard, we hypothesized BMP-7 would inhibit plaque formation in an animal model of ATH through monocytic plasticity mediation. ATH was generated in male and female Apo E-/- mice via partial left carotid artery (PLCA) ligation and mice were divided into 3 groups: Sham, PLCA, and PLCA+BMP-7 (200ug/kg; i.v.). Our data suggest that BMP-7 inhibits plaque formation and increases arterial systolic velocity. Furthermore, we report inhibition of monocyte infiltration and a decrease in associated pro-inflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-6) in the PLCA+BMP-7 mice. In contrast, our data suggest a significant (p<0.05) increase in M2 macrophage populations with consequential enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1RA, IL-10, and Arginase 1) expression following BMP-7 treatment. We have also observed that mechanisms promoting monocyte into M2 macrophage differentiation by BMP-7 involve the upregulation and activation of the BMP-7 receptor (BMP-7RII). In conclusion, we report that BMP-7 has the potential to mediate cellular plasticity and mitigate the inflammatory immune response, which results in decreased plaque formation and improved blood velocity."
https://openalex.org/W2254857256,"External loads applied to skeletal muscle cause increases in the protein translation rate, which leads to muscle hypertrophy. Although some studies have demonstrated that increases in the capacity and efficiency of translation are involved in this process, it remains unclear how these two factors are related to the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy. The present study aimed to clarify the roles played by the capacity and efficiency of translation in muscle hypertrophy. We used an improved synergist ablation in which the magnitude of compensatory hypertrophy could be controlled by partial removal of synergist muscles. Male rats were assigned to four groups in which the plantaris muscle was unilaterally subjected to weak (WK), moderate (MO), middle (MI), and strong (ST) overloading by four types of synergist ablation. Fourteen days after surgery, the weight of the plantaris muscle per body weight increased by 8%, 22%, 32% and 45%, in the WK, MO, MI and ST groups, respectively. Five days after surgery, 18+28S rRNA content (an indicator of translational capacity) increased with increasing overload, with increases of 1.8-fold (MO), 2.2-fold (MI), and 2.5-fold (ST), respectively, relative to non-overloaded muscle (NL) in the WK group. rRNA content showed a strong correlation with relative muscle weight measured 14 days after surgery (r = 0.98). The phosphorylated form of p70S6K (a positive regulator of translational efficiency) showed a marked increase in the MO group, but no further increase was observed with further increase in overload (increases of 22.6-fold (MO), 17.4-fold (MI), and 18.2-fold (ST), respectively, relative to NL in the WK group). These results indicate that increases in ribosome biogenesis at the early phase of overloading are strongly dependent on the amount of overloading, and may play an important role in increasing the translational capacity for further gain of muscular size."

Our previous epidemiological studies showed adverse effects of dioxin exposure on neurodevelopment for the first 3 years of life. Subsequently, we extended the follow-up period and investigated the influence of perinatal dioxin exposure on neurodevelopment, including motor coordination and higher cognitive ability, in preschool children. Presently, we investigated 176 children in a hot spot of dioxin contamination who were followed up from birth until 5 years old. Perinatal dioxin exposure levels were estimated by measuring dioxin levels in maternal breast milk. Dioxin toxicity was evaluated using two indices; toxic equivalent (TEQ)-polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans (PCDDs/Fs) and concentration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Coordinated movements, including manual dexterity, aiming and catching, and balance, were assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (Movement ABC-2). Cognitive ability was assessed using the nonverbal index (NVI) of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II). In boys, total test and balance scores of Movement ABC-2 were significantly lower in the high TEQ- PCDDs/Fs group compared with the moderate and low exposure groups. NVI scores and the pattern reasoning subscale of the KABC-II indicating planning ability were also significantly lower in the high TCDD exposure group compared with the low exposure group of boys. However, in girls, no significant differences in Movement ABC-2 and KABC-II scores were found among the different TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and TCDD exposure groups. Furthermore, in high risk cases, five boys and one girl highly exposed to TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and TCDD had double the risk for difficulties in both neurodevelopmental skills. These results suggest differential impacts of TEQ-PCDDs/Fs and TCDD exposure on motor coordination and higher cognitive ability, respectively. Moreover, high TEQ-PCDDs/Fs exposure combined with high TCDD exposure may increase autistic traits combined with developmental coordination disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2254472944,"Melatonin is rhythmically secreted by both the pineal gland and retina in a circadian fashion, with its peak synthesis occurring during the night. Once synthesized, melatonin exerts its effects by binding to two specific G-protein coupled receptors-melatonin receptor type 1(MT1) and melatonin receptor type 2(MT2). Recent studies suggest the involvement of MT1 and MT2 in the regulation of glucose homeostasis; however the ability of melatonin signaling to impart timing cues on glucose metabolism remains poorly understood. Here we report that the removal of MT1 or MT2 in mice abolishes the daily rhythm in blood glucose levels. Interestingly, removal of melatonin receptors produced small effects on the rhythmic expression patterns of clock genes within skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Taken together, our data suggest that the loss of the daily rhythm in blood glucose observed in MT1(-/-) and MT2(-/-) mice does not occur as a consequence of 'disrupted' clocks within insulin sensitive tissues. Finally our results highlight a diurnal contribution of melatonin receptor signaling in the daily regulation of blood glucose levels."
https://openalex.org/W2266669623,"Our knowledge of neural plasticity suggests that neural networks show adaptation to environmental and intrinsic change. In particular, studies investigating the neuroplastic changes associated with learning and practicing motor tasks have shown that practicing such tasks results in an increase in neural activation in several specific brain regions. However, studies comparing experts and non-experts suggest that experts employ less neuronal activation than non-experts when performing a familiar motor task. Here, we aimed to determine the long-term changes in neural networks associated with learning a new dance in professional ballet dancers over 34 weeks. Subjects visualized dance movements to music while undergoing fMRI scanning at four time points over 34-weeks. Results demonstrated that initial learning and performance at seven weeks led to increases in activation in cortical regions during visualization compared to the first week. However, at 34 weeks, the cortical networks showed reduced activation compared to week seven. Specifically, motor learning and performance over the 34 weeks showed the typical inverted-U-shaped function of learning. Further, our result demonstrate that learning of a motor sequence of dance movements to music in the real world can be visualized by expert dancers using fMRI and capture highly significant modeled fits of the brain network variance of BOLD signals from early learning to expert level performance."
https://openalex.org/W2270035025,"The selectivity with which proprioceptive sensory neurons innervate their central and peripheral targets implies that they exhibit distinctions in muscle-type identity. The molecular correlates of proprioceptor identity and its origins remain largely unknown, however. In screens to define muscle-type proprioceptor character, we find all-or-none differences in gene expression for proprioceptors that control antagonistic muscles at a single hindlimb joint. Analysis of three of these genes, cadherin13 (cdh13), semaphorin5a (sema5a), and cartilage-acidic protein-1 (crtac1), reveals expression in proprioceptor subsets that supply muscle groups located at restricted dorsoventral and proximodistal domains of the limb. Genetically altering the dorsoventral character of the limb mesenchyme elicits a change in the profile of proprioceptor cdh13, sema5a, and crtac1 expression. These findings indicate that proprioceptors acquire aspects of their muscle-type identity in response to mesenchymal signals expressed in restricted proximodistal and dorsoventral domains of the developing limb."
https://openalex.org/W2257977784,"Background Obesity is a common risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Currently, there are no specific treatments against NAFLD. Thus, examining any molecule with potential benefits against this condition emerged melatonin as a molecule that influences metabolic dysfunctions. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin would function against NAFDL, studying morphological, ultrastuctural and metabolic markers that characterize the liver of ob/ob mice. Methods Lean and ob/ob mice were supplemented with melatonin in the drinking water for 8 weeks. Histology and stereology were performed to assess hepatic steatosis and glycogen deposition. Ultrastructural features of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and their juxtapositions were evaluated in livers of all experimental groups. Furthermore, hepatic distribution and expression of markers of ER and mitochondria (calnexin, ATP sintase β, GRP78 and CHOP) and metabolic dysfunction (RPB4, β-catenin) and cellular longevity (SIRT1) were analyzed. Results Melatonin significantly reduced glycemia, identified also by a decrease of hepatic RBP4 expression, reversed macrosteatosis in microsteatosis at the hepatic pericentral zone, enlarged ER-mitochondrial distance and ameliorated the morphology and organization of these organelles in ob/ob mouse liver. Furthermore, in ob/ob mice, calnexin and ATP synthase β were partially restored, GRP78 and CHOP decreased in periportal and midzonal hepatocytes and β-catenin expression was, in part, restored in peripheral membranes of hepatocytes. Melatonin supplementation to ob/ob mice improves hepatic morphological, ultrastructural and metabolic damage that occurs as a result of NAFLD. Conclusions Melatonin may be a potential adjuvant treatment to limit NAFLD and its progression into irreversible complications."
https://openalex.org/W2253190088,"There is an increasing demand for non-antibiotics solutions to control infectious disease in intensive pig production. Here, one such alternative, namely pig antibodies purified from slaughterhouse blood was investigated in order to elucidate its potential usability to control post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), which is one of the top indications for antibiotics usage in the pig production. A very cost-efficient and rapid one-step expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography procedure was used to purify pig immunoglobulin G from slaughterhouse pig plasma (more than 100 litres), resulting in >85% pure pig IgG (ppIgG). The ppIgG thus comprised natural pig immunoglobulins and was subsequently shown to contain activity towards four pig-relevant bacterial strains (three different types of Escherichia coli and one type of Salmonella enterica) but not towards a fish pathogen (Yersinia ruckeri), and was demonstrated to inhibit the binding of the four pig relevant bacteria to a pig intestinal cell line (IPEC-J2). Finally it was demonstrated in an in vivo weaning piglet model for intestinal colonization with an E. coli F4+ challenge strain that ppIgG given in the feed significantly reduced shedding of the challenge strain, reduced the proportion of the bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae, increased the proportion of families Enterococcoceae and Streptococcaceae and generally increased ileal microbiota diversity. Conclusively, our data support the idea that natural IgG directly purified from pig plasma and given as a feed supplement can be used in modern swine production as an efficient and cost-effective means for reducing both occurrence of PWD and antibiotics usage and with a potential for the prevention and treatment of other intestinal infectious diseases even if the causative agent might not be known."
https://openalex.org/W2273365605,"High reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and enhanced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) proliferation are observed in numerous cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms by which hormones such as angiotensin II (Ang II) acts to promote these cellular responses remain poorly understood. We have previously shown that the ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a molecular switch that coordinates intracellular signaling events can be activated by the Ang II receptor (AT1R). Whether this small GTP-binding protein controls the signaling events leading to ROS production and therefore Ang II-dependent VSMC proliferation, remains however unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in rat aortic VSMC, Ang II stimulation led to the subsequent activation of ARF6 and Rac1, a key regulator of NADPH oxidase activity. Using RNA interference, we showed that ARF6 is essential for ROS generation since in conditions where this GTPase was knocked down, Ang II could no longer promote superoxide anion production. In addition to regulating Rac1 activity, ARF6 also controlled expression of the NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox 1) as well as the ability of the EGFR to become transactivated. Finally, ARF6 also controlled MAPK (Erk1/2, p38 and Jnk) activation, a key pathway of VSMC proliferation. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that Ang II promotes activation of ARF6 to controls ROS production by regulating Rac1 activation and Nox1 expression. In turn, increased ROS acts to activate the MAPK pathway. These signaling events represent a new molecular mechanism by which Ang II can promote proliferation of VSMC."
https://openalex.org/W2293780940,"Background Detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) is still a challenge if conventional markers of kidney function are within reference range. We studied the sensitivity and specificity of NGAL as an AKI marker at different degrees of renal ischemia. Methods Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 10-, 20- or 30-min unilateral renal ischemia, to control operation or no operation, and AKI was evaluated 1 day later by histology, immunohistochemistry, BUN, creatinine, NGAL (plasma and urine) and renal NGAL mRNA expression. Results A short (10-min) ischemia did not alter BUN or kidney histology, but elevated plasma and urinary NGAL level and renal NGAL mRNA expression although to a much smaller extent than longer ischemia. Surprisingly, control operation elevated plasma NGAL and renal NGAL mRNA expression to a similar extent as 10-min ischemia. Further, the ratio of urine to plasma NGAL was the best parameter to differentiate a 10-min ischemic injury from control operation, while it was similar in the non and control-operated groups. Conclusions These results suggest that urinary NGAL excretion and especially ratio of urine to plasma NGAL are sensitive and specific markers of subclinical acute kidney injury in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2278661334,"Deletions encompassing the BP1-2 region at 15q11.2 increase schizophrenia and epilepsy risk, but only some carriers have either disorder. To investigate the role of CYFIP1, a gene within the region, we performed knockdown experiments in human neural progenitors derived from donors with 2 copies of each gene at the BP1-2 locus. RNA-seq and cellular assays determined that knockdown of CYFIP1 compromised cytoskeletal remodeling. FMRP targets and postsynaptic density genes, each implicated in schizophrenia, were significantly overrepresented among differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Schizophrenia and/or epilepsy genes, but not those associated with randomly selected disorders, were likewise significantly overrepresented. Mirroring the variable expressivity seen in deletion carriers, marked between-line differences were observed for dysregulation of disease genes. Finally, a subset of DEGs showed a striking similarity to known epilepsy genes and represents novel disease candidates. Results support a role for CYFIP1 in disease and demonstrate that disease-related biological signatures are apparent prior to neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2401613704,"Human skin contains various populations of memory T cells in permanent residence and in transit. Arguably, the best characterized of the skin subsets are the CD8(+) permanently resident memory T cells (TRM) expressing the integrin subunit, CD103. In order to investigate the remaining skin T cells, we isolated skin-tropic (CLA(+)) helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and CD8(+) CD103(-) T cells from skin and blood for RNA microarray analysis to compare the transcriptional profiles of these groups. We found that despite their common tropism, the T cells isolated from skin were transcriptionally distinct from blood-derived CLA(+) T cells. A shared pool of genes contributed to the skin/blood discrepancy, with substantial overlap in differentially expressed genes between each T cell subset. Gene set enrichment analysis further showed that the differential gene profiles of each human skin T cell subset were significantly enriched for previously identified TRM core signature genes. Our results support the hypothesis that human skin may contain additional TRM or TRM-like populations."
https://openalex.org/W2295729186,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA sequences that guide post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via complementarity to their target mRNAs. Discovered only recently, miRNAs have drawn a lot of attention. Multiple protein complexes interact to first cleave a hairpin from nascent RNA, export it into the cytosol, trim its loop, and incorporate it into the RISC complex which is important for binding its target mRNA. This process works within one cell, but circulating miRNAs have been described suggesting a role in cell-cell communication. Motivation Viruses and intracellular parasites like Toxoplasma gondii use miRNAs to manipulate host gene expression from within the cellular environment. However, recent research has claimed that a rice miRNA may regulate human gene expression. Despite ongoing debates about these findings and general reluctance to accept them, a recent report claimed that foodborne plant miRNAs pass through the digestive tract, travel through blood to be incorporated by alveolar cells excreting milk. The miRNAs are then said to have some immune-related function in the newborn. Principal Findings We acquired the data that supports their claim and performed further analyses. In addition to the reported miRNAs, we were able to detect almost complete mRNAs and found that the foreign RNA expression profiles among samples are exceedingly similar. Inspecting the source of the data helped understand how RNAs could contaminate the samples. Conclusion Viewing these findings in context with the difficulties foreign RNAs face on their route into breast milk and the fact that many identified foodborne miRNAs are not from actual food sources, we can conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the original claims and evidence presented may be due to artifacts. We report that the study claiming their existence is more likely to have detected RNA contamination than miRNAs."

Also we studied the functional and immunological properties of rat islets isolated with different enzyme preparations to determine whether this impacts these parameters. Rat-islets were isolated from the pancreas with two different collagenases with commonly accepted collagenase, neutral protease, and clostripain activities. Islets had a similar and acceptable glucose-induced insulin-release profile but a profound statistical significant difference in production of the chemokines IP-10 and Gro-α. The islets were studied with nanotomy which is an EM-based technology for unbiased study of ultrastructural features of islets such as cell-cell contacts, endocrine-cell condition, ER stress, mitochondrial conditions, and cell polarization. The islet-batch with higher chemokine-production had a lower amount of polarized insulin-producing β-cells. All islets had more intercellular spaces and less interconnected areas with tight cell-cell junctions when compared to islets in the pancreas. Islet-graft function was studied by implanting encapsulated and free islet grafts in rat recipients. Alginate-based encapsulated grafts isolated with the enzyme-lot inducing higher chemokine production and lower polarization survived for a two-fold shorter period of time. The lower survival-time of the encapsulated grafts was correlated with a higher influx of inflammatory cells at 7 days after implantation. Islets from the same two batches transplanted as free unencapsulated-graft, did not show any difference in survival or function in vivo. Lack of insight in factors contributing to the current lab-to-lab variation in longevity of encapsulated islet-grafts is considered to be a threat for clinical application. Our data suggest that seemingly minor variations in activity of enzymes applied for islet-isolation might contribute to longevity-variations of immunoisolated islet-grafts."
https://openalex.org/W2252347224,"Information about spatial and temporal variability in the distribution and abundance of shark-populations are required for their conservation, management and to update measures designed to mitigate human-shark interactions. However, because some species of sharks are mobile, migratory and occur in relatively small numbers, estimating their patterns of distribution and abundance can be very difficult. In this study, we used a hierarchical sampling design to examine differences in the composition of species, size- and sex-structures of sharks sampled with bottom-set longlines in three different areas with increasing distance from the entrance of Sydney Harbour, a large urbanised estuary. During two years of sampling, we obtained data for four species of sharks (Port Jackson, Heterodontus portusjacksoni; wobbegong, Orectolobus maculatus; dusky whaler, Carcharhinus obscurus and bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas). Only a few O. maculatus and C. obscurus were caught, all in the area closest to the entrance of the Harbour. O. maculatus were caught in all seasons, except summer, while C. obscurus was only caught in summer. Heterodontus portusjacksoni were the most abundant species, caught in the entrance location mostly between July to November, when water temperature was below 21.5°C. This pattern was consistent across both years. C. leucas, the second most abundant species, were captured in all areas of Sydney Harbour but only in summer and autumn when water temperatures were above 23°C. This study quantified, for this first time, how different species utilise different areas of Sydney Harbour, at different times of the year. This information has implications for the management of human-shark interactions, by enabling creation of education programs to modify human behaviour in times of increased risk of potentially dangerous sharks."
https://openalex.org/W2271104528,"The high prevalence of domestic violence (DV) among married women in India and associated negative health repercussions highlight the need for effective prevention strategies and tools to measure the efficacy of such interventions. Literature supporting differing manifestations of DV by culture underscores the need for a culturally-tailored scale to more effectively measure DV in the Indian context. We therefore aimed to develop and validate such a tool, the Indian Family Violence and Control Scale (IFVCS), through a mixed-methods study. The psychometric development of IFVCS is herein discussed. After field pre-testing and expert review, a 63-item questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 630 married women from May-July 2013 in Pune, India. The item response theory approach for binary data to explore the IFVCS structure suggested that IFVCS is reliable, with the majority of items having high (>0.5) and significant factor loadings. Concurrent validity, assessed by comparing responses to IFVCS with the validated, abridged Conflict Tactics Scale-2, was high (r = 0.899, p<0.001) as was the construct validity, demonstrated by its significant association with several established DV correlates. Therefore, initial assessment of the IFVCS psychometric properties suggests that it is an effective tool for measuring DV among married women in India and speaks to its capacity for enhancing understanding of DV epidemiology and for evaluating the effectiveness of future DV interventions."

Summer Black leaves by using Illumina HiSeq™ 2000. The sums of 272,941,656 reads were generated from vitis vinifera leaf at four different developmental stages, with more than 27 billion nucleotides of the sequence data. At each growth stage, RNA samples were indexed through unique nucleic acid identifiers and sequenced. KEGG annotation results depicted that the highest number of transcripts in 2,963 (2Avs4A) followed by 1Avs4A (2,920), and 3Avs4A (2,294) out of 15,614 (71%) transcripts were recorded. In comparison, a total of 1,532 transcripts were annotated in GOs, including Cellular component, with the highest number in ""Cell part"" 251 out of 353 transcripts (71.1%), followed by intracellular organelle 163 out of 353 transcripts (46.2%), while in molecular function and metabolic process 375 out of 525 (71.4%) transcripts, multicellular organism process 40 out of 525 (7.6%) transcripts in biological process were most common in 1Avs2A. While in case of 1Avs3A, cell part 476 out of 662 transcripts (71.9%), and membrane-bounded organelle 263 out of 662 transcripts (39.7%) were recorded in Cellular component. In the grapevine transcriptome, during the initial stages of leaf development 1Avs2A showed single transcript was down-regulated and none of them were up-regulated. While in comparison of 1A to 3A showed one up-regulated (photosystem II reaction center protein C) and one down regulated (conserved gene of unknown function) transcripts, during the hormone regulating pathway namely SAUR-like auxin-responsive protein family having 2 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated transcripts, phytochrome-associated protein showed 1 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated transcripts, whereas genes associated with the Leucine-rich repeat protein kinase family protein showed 7 up-regulated and 1 down-regulated transcript, meanwhile Auxin Resistant 2 has single up-regulated transcript in second developmental stage, although 3 were down-regulated at lateral growth stages (3A and 4A). In the present study, 489 secondary metabolic pathways related genes were identified during leaf growth, which mainly includes alkaloid (40), anthocyanins (21), Diterpenoid (144), Monoterpenoid (90) and Flavonoids (93). Quantitative real-time PCR was applied to validate 10 differentially expressed transcripts patterns from flower, leaf and fruit metabolic pathways at different growth stages."
https://openalex.org/W2252617398,"Microbially induced corrosion (MIC) is a complex problem that affects various industries. Several techniques have been developed to monitor corrosion and elucidate corrosion mechanisms, including microbiological processes that induce metal deterioration. We used zero resistance ammetry (ZRA) in a split chamber configuration to evaluate the effects of the facultatively anaerobic Fe(III) reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 on the corrosion of UNS G10180 carbon steel. We show that activities of S. oneidensis inhibit corrosion of steel with which that organism has direct contact. However, when a carbon steel coupon in contact with S. oneidensis was electrically connected to a second coupon that was free of biofilm (in separate chambers of the split chamber assembly), ZRA-based measurements indicated that current moved from the S. oneidensis-containing chamber to the cell-free chamber. This electron transfer enhanced the O2 reduction reaction on the coupon deployed in the cell free chamber, and consequently, enhanced oxidation and corrosion of that electrode. Our results illustrate a novel mechanism for MIC in cases where metal surfaces are heterogeneously covered by biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W2271889976,"Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a food-borne bacterium that causes hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome in humans. While cattle are a known source of E. coli O157:H7 exposure resulting in human infection, environmental reservoirs may also be important sources of infection for both cattle and humans. Bacteriophage-encoded Shiga toxins (Stx) carried by E. coli O157:H7 may provide a selective advantage for survival of these bacteria in the environment, possibly through their toxic effects on grazing protozoa. To determine Stx effects on protozoan grazing, we co-cultured Paramecium caudatum, a common ciliate protozoon in cattle water sources, with multiple strains of Shiga-toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 and non-Shiga toxigenic cattle commensal E. coli. Over three days at ambient laboratory temperature, P. caudatum consistently reduced both E. coli O157:H7 and non-Shiga toxigenic E. coli populations by 1-3 log cfu. Furthermore, a wild-type strain of Shiga-toxigenic E. coli O157:H7 (EDL933) and isogenic mutants lacking the A subunit of Stx 2a, the entire Stx 2a-encoding bacteriophage, and/or the entire Stx 1-encoding bacteriophage were grazed with similar efficacy by both P. caudatum and Tetrahymena pyriformis (another ciliate protozoon). Therefore, our data provided no evidence of a protective effect of either Stx or the products of other bacteriophage genes on protozoan predation of E. coli. Further research is necessary to determine if the grazing activity of naturally-occurring protozoa in cattle water troughs can serve to decrease cattle exposure to E. coli O157:H7 and other Shiga-toxigenic E. coli."

The aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with influenza vaccination coverage in hospitalized patients aged ≥ 65 years hospitalized due to causes unrelated to influenza in Spain. We carried out a cross-sectional study. Bivariate analysis was performed comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, taking in to account sociodemographic variables and medical risk conditions. Multivariate analysis was performed using multilevel regression models. We included 1038 patients: 602 (58%) had received the influenza vaccine in the 2013-14 season. Three or more general practitioner visits (OR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.19-2.18); influenza vaccination in any of the 3 previous seasons (OR = 13.57; 95% CI 9.45-19.48); and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (OR = 1.97; 95% CI 1.38-2.80) were associated with receiving the influenza vaccine. Vaccination coverage of hospitalized elderly people is low in Spain and some predisposing characteristics influence vaccination coverage. Healthcare workers should take these characteristics into account and be encouraged to proactively propose influenza vaccination to all patients aged ≥ 65 years."
https://openalex.org/W2252762950,"Background Shiga toxin (Stx) is a common virulence factor of all Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) that cause a wide spectrum of disease, including hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Although several commercial kits are available for detection of Stx produced by STEC, none of them are capable of recognizing all subtypes of Stxs, which include three subtypes of Stx1 and seven subtypes of Stx2. Methods and Findings New monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against Stx1 and Stx2 were developed. A universal sandwich ELISA capable of detecting all known subtypes of Stx1 and Stx2 was established using a pool of newly developed antibodies. To precisely monitor the sensitivity of the assay for each subtype of Stxs, recombinant toxoids were created and used as standards in ELISAs. Because of the high affinity of the antibodies incorporated, the ELISA assay is highly sensitive with a limit of detection for the different subtypes of Stx1a and Stx2a between 10 and 50 pg/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The assay was also able to identify STEC based on the production of Stxs using the supernatants of culture fluids or even single colonies on agar plates without lengthy enrichment in liquid medium. When applied to ground beef samples, this newly developed ELISA was capable of distinguishing beef samples spiked with a single bacterial cell. Conclusions A highly sensitive and universal assay for all subtypes of Stx1 and Stx2 was developed. It has significantly improved upon the current technologies by avoiding false negative results due to the narrow detection range of the assay. The assay developed in this study can be useful for prompt detection of new and emerging serotypes and screening ground beef samples for contamination of STEC at an early stage in the food supply chain, thus avoiding the need for possible recall."
https://openalex.org/W2444289263,"Inflammatory activation of microglia and β amyloid (Aβ) deposition are considered to work both independently and synergistically to contribute to the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies indicate that long-term use of phenolic compounds provides protection against AD, primarily due to their anti-inflammatory actions. We previously suggested that phenolic compound curcumin ameliorated phagocytosis possibly through its anti-inflammatory effects rather than direct regulation of phagocytic function in electromagnetic field-exposed N9 microglial cells (N9 cells). Here, we explored the prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2)-related signaling pathway that involved in curcumin-mediated phagocytosis in fibrillar β-amyloid peptide (1-42) (fAβ42)-stimulated N9 cells. Treatment with fAβ42 increased phagocytosis of fluorescent-labeled latex beads in N9 cells. This increase was attenuated in a dose-dependent manner by endogenous and exogenous PGE2, as well as a selective EP2 or protein kinase A (PKA) agonist, but not by an EP4 agonist. We also found that an antagonist of EP2, but not EP4, abolished the reduction effect of PGE2 on fAβ42-induced microglial phagocytosis. Additionally, the increased expression of endogenous PGE2, EP2, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and activation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein, and PKA were depressed by curcumin administration. This reduction led to the amelioration of the phagocytic abilities of PGE2-stimulated N9 cells. Taken together, these data suggested that curcumin restored the attenuating effect of PGE2 on fAβ42-induced microglial phagocytosis via a signaling mechanism involving EP2 and PKA. Moreover, due to its immune modulatory effects, curcumin may be a promising pharmacological candidate for neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2267557170,"Zambia has a high maternal mortality ratio, 398/100,000 live births. Few pregnant women access emergency obstetric care services to handle complications at childbirth. We aimed to assess the deficit in life-saving obstetric services in the rural and urban areas of Kapiri Mposhi district.A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 as part of the 'Response to Accountable priority setting for Trust in health systems' (REACT) project. Data on all childbirths that occurred in emergency obstetric care facilities in 2010 were obtained retrospectively. Sources of information included registers from maternity ward admission, delivery and operation theatre, and case records. Data included age, parity, mode of delivery, obstetric complications, and outcome of mother and the newborn. An approach using estimated major obstetric interventions expected but not done in health facilities was used to assess deficit of life-saving interventions in urban and rural areas.A total of 2114 urban and 1226 rural childbirths occurring in emergency obstetric care facilities (excluding abortions) were analysed. Facility childbirth constituted 81% of expected births in urban and 16% in rural areas. Based on the reference estimate that 1.4% of childbearing women were expected to need major obstetric intervention, unmet obstetric need was 77 of 106 women, thus 73% (95% CI 71-75%) in rural areas whereas urban areas had no deficit. Major obstetric interventions for absolute maternal indications were higher in urban 2.1% (95% CI 1.60-2.71%) than in rural areas 0.4% (95% CI 0.27-0.55%), with an urban to rural rate ratio of 5.5 (95% CI 3.55-8.76).Women in rural areas had deficient obstetric care. The likelihood of under-going a life-saving intervention was 5.5 times higher for women in urban than rural areas. Targeting rural women with life-saving services could substantially reduce this inequity and preventable deaths."
https://openalex.org/W2271588670,"Peroxisomes are single-membrane bound organelles that are essential for normal development in plants and animals. In mammals and yeast, the peroxin (PEX) proteins PEX3 and PEX19 facilitate the early steps of peroxisome membrane protein (PMP) insertion and pre-peroxisome budding from the endoplasmic reticulum. The PEX3 membrane protein acts as a docking site for PEX19, a cytosolic chaperone for PMPs that delivers PMPs to the endoplasmic reticulum or peroxisomal membrane. PEX19 is farnesylated in yeast and mammals, and we used immunoblotting with prenylation mutants to show that PEX19 also is fully farnesylated in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We examined insertional alleles disrupting either of the two Arabidopsis PEX19 isoforms, PEX19A or PEX19B, and detected similar levels of PEX19 protein in the pex19a-1 mutant and wild type; however, PEX19 protein was nearly undetectable in the pex19b-1 mutant. Despite the reduction in PEX19 levels in pex19b-1, both pex19a-1 and pex19b-1 single mutants lacked notable peroxisomal β-oxidation defects and displayed normal levels and localization of peroxisomal matrix and membrane proteins. The pex19a-1 pex19b-1 double mutant was embryo lethal, indicating a redundantly encoded critical role for PEX19 during embryogenesis. Expressing YFP-tagged versions of either PEX19 isoform rescued this lethality, confirming that PEX19A and PEX19B act redundantly in Arabidopsis. We observed that pex19b-1 enhanced peroxisome-related defects of a subset of peroxin-defective mutants, supporting a role for PEX19 in peroxisome function. Together, our data indicate that Arabidopsis PEX19 promotes peroxisome function and is essential for viability."
https://openalex.org/W2266393225,"Crohn's disease, an incurable chronic inflammatory bowel disease, has been attributed to both genetic predisposition and environmental factors. A dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, observed in numerous patients but also in at least one hundred unaffected first-degree relatives, was proposed to have a causal role. Gut microbiota β-D-glucuronidases (EC 3.2.1.33) hydrolyse β-D-glucuronate from glucuronidated compounds. They include a GUS group, that is homologous to the Escherichia coli GusA, and a BG group, that is homologous to metagenomically identified H11G11 BG and has unidentified natural substrates. H11G11 BG is part of the functional core of the human gut microbiota whereas GusA, known to regenerate various toxic products, is variably found in human subjects. We investigated potential risk markers for Crohn's disease using DNA-sequence-based exploration of the β-D-glucuronidase loci (GUS or Firmicute H11G11-BG and the respective co-encoded glucuronide transporters). Crohn's disease-related microbiomes revealed a higher frequency of a C7D2 glucuronide transporter (12/13) compared to unrelated healthy subjects (8/32). This transporter was in synteny with the potential harmful GUS β-D-glucuronidase as only observed in a Eubacterium eligens plasmid. A conserved NH2-terminal sequence in the transporter (FGDFGND motif) was found in 83% of the disease-related subjects and only in 12% of controls. We propose a microbiota-pathology hypothesis in which the presence of this unique β-glucuronidase locus may contribute to an increase risk for Crohn's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2252999403,"Black sea bass (Centropristis striata) migrations are believed to play a role in overwinter survival and connectivity between juvenile and adult populations. This study investigated oceanographic drivers of winter habitat choice and regional differences between populations of juvenile and adult black sea bass. Trends in cohort strength, as a result of juvenile survival, were also identified. Oceanographic and fisheries survey data were analyzed using generalized additive models. Among the oceanographic variables investigated, salinity was the main driver in habitat selection with an optimal range of 33-35 practical salinity units (PSU) for both juveniles and adults. Preferred temperature ranges varied between juveniles and adults, but held a similar minimum preference of >8°C. Salinity and temperature ranges also differed by regions north and south of Hudson Canyon. Shelf water volume had less of an effect than temperature or salinity, but showed an overall negative relationship with survey catch. The effect of winter conditions on juvenile abundance was also observed across state and federal survey index trends. A lack of correlation observed among surveys in the fall paired with a strong correlation in the spring identifies the winter period as a factor determining year-class strength of new recruits to the population. A rank order analysis of spring indices identified three of the largest year classes occurring during years with reduced shelf water volumes, warmer winter shelf waters, and a 34 PSU isohaline aligned farther inshore. While greater catches of black sea bass in the northwest Atlantic Ocean remain south of Hudson Canyon, the species' range has expanded north in recent years."
https://openalex.org/W2411156127,"Background Dogs with leptospirosis show similar organ manifestations and disease course as human patients, including acute kidney injury and pulmonary hemorrhage, making this naturally-occurring infection a good animal model for human leptospirosis. Expression patterns of cytokines and enzymes have been correlated with disease manifestations and clinical outcome in humans and animals. The aim of this study was to describe mRNA expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in canine leptospirosis and to compare it with other renal diseases to identify patterns characterizing the disease and especially its pulmonary form. Methodology and Principal Findings The mRNA abundance of cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, TGF-β) and enzymes (5-LO, iNOS) was measured prospectively in blood leukocytes from 34 dogs with severe leptospirosis and acute kidney injury, including 22 dogs with leptospirosis-associated pulmonary hemorrhages. Dogs with leptospirosis were compared to 14 dogs with acute kidney injury of other origin than leptospirosis, 8 dogs with chronic kidney disease, and 10 healthy control dogs. Canine leptospirosis was characterized by high 5-LO and low TNF-α expression compared to other causes of acute kidney injury, although the decreased TNF-α expression was also seen in chronic kidney disease. Leptospirosis-associated pulmonary hemorrhage was not characterized by a specific pattern, with only mild changes noted, including increased IL-10 and decreased 5-LO expression on some days in affected dogs. Fatal outcome from pulmonary hemorrhages was associated with low TNF-α, high IL-1β, and high iNOS expression, a pattern possibly expressed also in dogs with other forms of acute kidney injury. Conclusion The patterns of cytokine and enzyme expression observed in the present study indicate a complex pro- and anti-inflammatory response to the infection with leptospires. The recognition of these signatures may be of diagnostic and prognostic relevance for affected individuals and they may indicate options for newer therapies targeting the identified pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2264162621,"Most antibodies recognize conformational or discontinuous epitopes that have a specific 3-dimensional shape; however, determination of discontinuous B-cell epitopes is a major challenge in bioscience. Moreover, the current methods for identifying peptide epitopes often involve laborious, high-cost peptide screening programs. Here, we present a novel microarray method for identifying discontinuous B-cell epitopes in celiac disease (CD) by using a silicon-based peptide array and computational methods.Using a novel silicon-based microarray platform with a multi-pillar chip, overlapping 12-mer peptide sequences of all native and deamidated gliadins, which are known to trigger CD, were synthesized in situ and used to identify peptide epitopes.Using a computational algorithm that considered disease specificity of peptide sequences, 2 distinct epitope sets were identified. Further, by combining the most discriminative 3-mer gliadin sequences with randomly interpolated3- or 6-mer peptide sequences, novel discontinuous epitopes were identified and further optimized to maximize disease discrimination. The final discontinuous epitope sets were tested in a confirmatory cohort of CD patients and controls, yielding 99% sensitivity and 100% specificity.These novel sets of epitopes derived from gliadin have a high degree of accuracy in differentiating CD from controls, compared with standard serologic tests. The method of ultra-high-density peptide microarray described here would be broadly useful to develop high-fidelity diagnostic tests and explore pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2272247382,"Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase plays a crucial role as a master controller in the cellular DNA damage response. Inhibition of ATM leads to inhibition of the checkpoint signaling pathway. Hence, addition of checkpoint inhibitors to anticancer therapies may be an effective targeting strategy. A recent study reported that Wip1, a protein phosphatase, de-phosphorylates serine 1981 of ATM during the DNA damage response. Squalene has been proposed to complement anticancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy; however, there is little mechanistic information supporting this idea. Here, we report the inhibitory effect of squalene on ATM-dependent DNA damage signals. Squalene itself did not affect cell viability and the cell cycle of A549 cells, but it enhanced the cytotoxicity of gamma-irradiation (γIR). The in vitro kinase activity of ATM was not altered by squalene. However, squalene increased Wip1 expression in cells and suppressed ATM activation in γIR-treated cells. Consistent with the potential inhibition of ATM by squalene, IR-induced phosphorylation of ATM effectors such as p53 (Ser15) and Chk1 (Ser317) was inhibited by cell treatment with squalene. Thus, squalene inhibits the ATM-dependent signaling pathway following DNA damage through intracellular induction of Wip1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2252681143,"Potassium channels have been shown to determine wound healing in different tissues, but their role in intestinal epithelial restitution--the rapid closure of superficial wounds by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)--remains unclear.In this study, the regulation of IEC migration by potassium channel modulation was explored with and without additional epidermal growth factor (EGF) under baseline and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-pretreated conditions in scratch assays and Boyden chamber assays using the intestinal epithelial cell lines IEC-18 and HT-29. To identify possibly involved subcellular pathways, Western Blot (WB)-analysis of ERK and Akt phosphorylation was conducted and PI3K and ERK inhibitors were used in scratch assays. Furthermore, mRNA-levels of the potassium channel KCNN4 were determined in IEC from patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).Inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent potassium channels significantly increased intestinal epithelial restitution, which could not be further promoted by additional EGF. In contrast, inhibition of KCNN4 after pretreatment with IFN-γ led to decreased or unaffected migration. This effect was abolished by EGF. Changes in Akt, but not in ERK phosphorylation strongly correlated with these findings and PI3K but not ERK inhibition abrogated the effect of KCNN4 inhibition. Levels of KCNN4 mRNA were higher in samples from IBD patients compared with controls.Taken together, we demonstrate that inhibition of KCNN4 differentially regulates IEC migration in IFN-γ-pretreated vs. non pretreated conditions. Moreover, our data propose that the PI3K signaling cascade is responsible for this differential regulation. Therefore, we present a cellular model that contributes new aspects to epithelial barrier dysfunction in chronic intestinal inflammation, resulting in propagation of inflammation and symptoms like ulcers or diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W2269648341,"The estuarine planktonic copepods have a wide geographical distribution and commendable tolerance to various kinds of contaminants. The primary aim of the present study was to contrast the impacts of model POPs (TBBPA and HBCD) on three common estuarine planktonic copepods (Oithona similis, Acartia pacifica and Pseudodiaptomus inopinus) and establish a protocol for the assessment of acute toxicity of marine organic pollutants. We first quantified the 96h-LC50 (0.566, 0.04 and 0.257 mg/L of TBBPA to the three subjects above respectively and 0.314 mg/L of HBCD to P. inopinus; all reported concentrations are nominal values). In the sub-lethal toxicity tests, it was turned out that the effects of copepods exposed to TBBPA could product different influences on the energy ingestion and metabolism. Different type of pollutions, meanwhile, could also bring varying degree effect on the target copepods. In general, the indicators (the rate of oxygen consumption, ammonia excretion, food ingestion and filtration) in higher concentration groups showed marked significant difference compared with controls as well a dose-effect relationship. The study also extended the research on the joint toxicity of TBBPA and HBCD based on the survival rate of P.inopinus. Whether 1:1 concentration or 1:1 toxic level, the research showed synergy effect relative to single exposure conditions. The result indicated that current single ecological testing used for environmental protection activities may underestimate the risk for copepods. It was also demonstrated that short-term sub-lethal experiment could be a standard to evaluate the sensitivity of copepods to POPs."

The hypothalamus is a master regulator of endocrine and metabolic control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the hypothalamic volume would be associated to metabolic parameters in ALL survivors. Thirty-eight (21 women) survivors participated in this study 34 years after diagnosis and with a median age of 38 (27-46) years. All were treated with a median CRT dose of 24 Gy and 11 years (3-13) of complete hormone supplementation. Comparisons were made to 31 matched controls. We performed analyses of fat mass, fat free mass, plasma (p)-glucose, p-insulin, Homa-Index (a measure of insulin resistance), serum (s)-leptin, s-ghrelin and of the hypothalamic volume in scans obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla. Serum leptin/kg fat mass (r = -0.4, P = 0.04) and fat mass (r = -0.4, P = 0.01) were negatively correlated with the HT volume among ALL survivors, but not among controls. We also detected significantly higher BMI, waist, fat mass, p-insulin, Homa-Index, leptin/kg fat mass and s-ghrelin and significantly lower fat free mass specifically among female ALL survivors (all P<0.01). Interestingly, s-ghrelin levels increased with time since diagnosis and with low age at diagnosis for childhood ALL. Our results showed that leptin/kg fat mass and fat mass were associated with a reduced HT volume 34 years after ALL diagnosis and that women treated with CRT after ALL are at high risk of metabolic abnormalities. Taken together our data suggest that the hypothalamus is involved in the metabolic consequences after CRT in ALL survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2334502699,"Cth2 is an mRNA-binding protein that participates in remodeling yeast cell metabolism in iron starvation conditions by promoting decay of the targeted molecules, in order to avoid excess iron consumption. This study shows that in the absence of Cth2 immediate upregulation of expression of several of the iron regulon genes (involved in high affinity iron uptake and intracellular iron redistribution) upon oxidative stress by hydroperoxide is more intense than in wild type conditions where Cth2 is present. The oxidative stress provokes a temporary increase in the levels of Cth2 (itself a member of the iron regulon). In such conditions Cth2 molecules accumulate at P bodies-like structures when the constitutive mRNA decay machinery is compromised. In addition, a null Δcth2 mutant shows defects, in comparison to CTH2 wild type cells, in exit from α factor-induced arrest at the G1 stage of the cell cycle when hydroperoxide treatment is applied. The cell cycle defects are rescued in conditions that compromise uptake of external iron into the cytosol. The observations support a role of Cth2 in modulating expression of diverse iron regulon genes, excluding those specifically involved in the reductive branch of the high-affinity transport. This would result in immediate adaptation of the yeast cells to an oxidative stress, by controlling uptake of oxidant-promoting iron cations."
https://openalex.org/W1916020809,"In this paper, we consider the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for random sampling of combinatorial objects. The running time of such an algorithm depends on the total mixing time of the underlying Markov chain and is unknown in general. For some Markov chains, upper bounds on this total mixing time exist but are too large to be applicable in practice. We try to answer the question, whether the total mixing time is close to its upper bounds, or if there is a significant gap between them. In doing so, we present the software library marathon which is designed to support the analysis of MCMC based sampling algorithms. The main application of this library is to compute properties of so-called state graphs which represent the structure of Markov chains. We use marathon to investigate the quality of several bounding methods on four well-known Markov chains for sampling perfect matchings and bipartite graph realizations. In a set of experiments, we compute the total mixing time and several of its bounds for a large number of input instances. We find that the upper bound gained by the famous canonical path method is several magnitudes larger than the total mixing time and deteriorates with growing input size. In contrast, the spectral bound is found to be a precise approximation of the total mixing time."

Few studies have yet analyzed which of these measures are the most important for verdict modelling or which data classification techniques perform best for this application. To compare the performance of different techniques in classifying members of a criminal network, this article applies three different machine learning classifiers-Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and Random Forest-with a range of social network measures and the necessary databases to model the verdicts in two real-world cases: the U.S. Watergate Conspiracy of the 1970's and the now-defunct Canada-based international drug trafficking ring known as the Caviar Network. In both cases it was found that the Random Forest classifier did better than either Logistic Regression or Naïve Bayes, and its superior performance was statistically significant. This being so, Random Forest was used not only for classification but also to assess the importance of the measures. For the Watergate case, the most important one proved to be betweenness centrality while for the Caviar Network, it was the effective size of the network. These results are significant because they show that an approach combining machine learning with social network analysis not only can generate accurate classification models but also helps quantify the importance social network variables in modelling verdict outcomes. We conclude our analysis with a discussion and some suggestions for future work in verdict modelling using social network measures."

Information about potential covariates was collected by interview. The frequency of stable and unstable chromosome aberrations in chromosome 1, 2 and 4 was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization technique.Colorectal cancer patients, as compared to controls, had a relatively higher frequency of chromosome 1 translocations (median: 3.5 versus 1.0 /1000 cells, p = 0.006), stable aberrations (3.8 versus 1.0 /1000 cells, p = 0.007) and total aberrations (p = 0.009). There were no differences observed for chromosomes 2 and 4. Our results showed an increase in the odds of having colon cancer by about 50-80% associated with an increase by 1/1000 cells in the number of chromosome 1 aberrations.The results revealed that the frequency of chromosomal aberrations, especially translocations in chromosome 1, seems to be a promising method to show a colon cancer risk. Additionally, our study suggests the reasonableness of use of biomarkers such as chromosome 1 aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in screening prevention programs for individuals at higher colon cancer risk to identify those who are at increased risk and require more frequent investigations, e.g. by sigmoidoscopy."
