https://openalex.org/W2027027985,"Strong infrared circular polarization resulting from dust scattering in reflection nebulae in the Orion OMC-1 star-formation region has been observed. Circular polarization at shorter wavelengths might have been important in inducing chiral asymmetry in interstellar organic molecules that could be subsequently delivered to the early Earth by comets, interplanetary dust particles, or meteors. This could account for the excess of l –amino acids found in the Murchison meteorite and could explain the origin of the homochirality of biological molecules."

However, molecular and biochemical aspects of the condensation of two aminoacyl substrates or a peptidyl and an aminoacyl substrate, leading to the formation of a peptide bond, have remained essentially impenetrable. To investigate this crucial part of nonribosomal peptide synthesis, an in vitro assay for a dipeptide formation was developed. Two recombinant holomodules, GrsA (PheATE), providing d-Phe, and a C-terminally truncated TycB, corresponding to the first, l-Pro-incorporating module (ProCAT), were investigated. Upon combination of the two aminoacylated modules, a fast reaction is observed, due to the formation of the linear dipeptided-Phe-l-Pro-S-enzyme on ProCAT, followed by a noncatalyzed release of the dipeptide from the enzyme. The liberated product was identified by TLC, high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C NMR, and comparison with a chemically synthesized standard to be the expectedd-Phe-l-Pro diketopiperazine. Further minimization of the two modules was not possible without a loss of transfer activity. Likewise, a mutation in a proposed active-site motif (HHXXXDG) of the condensation domain giving ProCAT(H147V), abolished the condensation reaction. These results strongly suggest the condensation domain to be involved in the catalysis of nonribosomal peptide bond formation with the histidine 147 playing a catalytic role.

Microorganisms use the nonribosomal pathway to synthesize a large group of structurally diverse and often complex secondary metabolites with biological activities, including antibiotics, siderophores, biosurfactants, immunosuppressants, and antitumor and antiviral agents. These low molecular weight peptide-based compounds are synthesized by means of multifunctional enzymes, the peptide synthetases, which can recruit not only proteogenic amino acids but also a large number of unusual amino acids and hydroxy acids that form peptide and ester bonds. The incorporated constituents can be further altered by epimerization or N-methylation, and the peptide backbone can be acylated, glycosylated, or cyclized (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D.

Study of the peptide synthetases is crucial to understanding the complex biosynthesis of bioactive peptides and should produce useful tools for synthesizing novel compounds (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T.

In recent years, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the modular structure of peptide synthetases by sequencing several of the biosynthetic gene clusters. The results have already enabled us to create novel products with biological activity through genetic engineering (4Stachelhaus T. Schneider A.

On the other hand, most of the mechanistic aspects underlying the processes of condensation, epimerization, termination and interaction between synthetases have remained essentially elusive on the molecular level (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 2von Döhren H. Keller U. Vater J. Zocher R. Chem.

Peptide synthetases are composed of modules, which contain all enzymatic activities to incorporate one constituent into the product. The modules are in co-linear arrangement with the primary structure of the product (see Fig. 1), and they can be subdivided into different domains responsible for the single chemical reactions (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 8Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol.

The adenylation domain recognizes a substrate amino acid and activates it in the form of an acyl adenylate at the expense of ATP (8Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol.

Subsequently, the activated substrate is covalently bound to the thiolation domain or peptidyl carrier protein by a thioester linkage of the acyl group with the thiol moiety of the co-factor 4′-phosphopantetheine (P-pant) 1The abbreviations used are: P-pant4′-phosphopantetheineDKPdiketopiperazinePCRpolymerase chain reactionLSCliquid scintillation countingHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryACVδ-(l-α-aminoadipoyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valinePheATEPheAT, ProCAT, ProCA, and ProAT, deletion mutants or derivatives of the phenylalanine (Phe)-activating enzyme GrsA and the proline (Pro)-activating enzyme TycB, containing the adenylation domain (A), thiolation domain (T), epimerization domain (E), or condensation domain (C).

Biol. 1996; 3: 913-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The latter is covalently attached to the side-chain hydroxyl moiety of an invariant serine residue within the peptidyl carrier protein (17Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). According to the multiple carrier thiotemplate model (18Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), elongation then occurs by swinging of the loaded P-pant arm to a donor site, where a peptide bond is formed between the activated acyl group and the free amino (or imino, hydroxy) group of a second amino acid, which is loaded in a similar manner onto the next module and positioned at an acceptor site (2von Döhren H. Keller U. Vater J. Zocher R. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2675-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 12Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Passed on in this fashion from the first to the last module of the enzyme complex, the peptide chain grows in an N- to C-terminal direction from the starter amino acid until it reaches its final length. During the synthesis, all intermediates remain covalently bound to the enzyme complex (19Roskoski R. Kleinkauf H. Gevers W. Lipmann F. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4846-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Upon release, which is in most cases thought to be mediated by a thioesterase domain, the linear peptide can also be branched, cyclized, or oligomerized (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 2von Döhren H. Keller U. Vater J. Zocher R. Chem.

In our effort to understand the mechanistic details of the manifold reactions catalyzed by peptide synthetases, we have been particularly interested in the elongation process, because the reaction of peptide bond formation and the responsible site(s) have not yet been characterized. Sequence analysis, however, has identified the so-called condensation domain as a good candidate for this site (20de Crécy-Lagard V. Marlière P. Saurin W. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. II Life Sci. 1995; 318: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar). This domain is found as a part of the repetitive modules and coincides in frequency with the number of peptide bonds that have to be formed for the linear peptide of final length. Condensation domains are always fused to the N-terminal end of modules accepting acyl groups from the preceding module (elongation modules), and they are absent in modules activating the first acyl constituent to be incorporated (initiation modules) (see Fig. 1) (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 20de Crécy-Lagard V. Marlière P. Saurin W. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. II Life Sci. 1995; 318: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to the multiple carrier model, the condensation domains are expected to harbor an acceptor and a donor site for the loaded P-pant carriers of the two adjacent modules (12Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A data base search for homologues of the condensation domain (which is about 450 amino acids in length) reveals at first sight no significant similarities to protein sequences other than peptide synthetases (for one possible homologue, see “Discussion”). However, the domains contain a sequence motif (HHXXXDG, His motif) that resembles the active-site motif of well studied acyl transferases, such as dihydrolipoyl transacetylase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 20de Crécy-Lagard V. Marlière P. Saurin W. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. II Life Sci. 1995; 318: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar). For these enzymes, the second histidine has been shown to act as the catalytic base in the course of the respective reaction (21Shaw W.V. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 14: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 22Leslie A.G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Russell G.C.

Prog. Oxford. 1994; 76: 565-580Google Scholar). Attempts to study the reaction of peptide bond formation are confronted by some experimental difficulties. It is one of the reactions performed in multiple number, and it requires the interaction of at least two modules. Furthermore, the peptide synthetases are members of the secondary metabolism, which makes them hard to purify in large quantities, and their enormous size makes them difficult to handle. On the other hand, recombinant enzymes (fragments) were found not to be modified into their active holo-forms due to a missing P-pant transferase activity in the heterologous host (8Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6163-6169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Pfeifer E. Pavela-Vrancic M. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H.

Biol. 1997; 4: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Very recent discovery of a superfamily of P-pant transferases, including those specific for modifying peptide synthetases, has provided us with the tools to investigate the complex mechanisms of nonribosomal peptide synthesis using recombinant proteins (12Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 28Walsh C.T. Gehring A.M. Weinreb P.H. Quadri L.E. Flugel R.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this work, we have developed a system to study the process of nonribosomal peptide bond formation. It is based on the initiation reaction of gramicidin S and tyrocidine synthesis but has been simplified by enzyme fragmentation to a single condensation event. We show that the condensation domain indeed plays a catalytic role and that the His motif is part of (one of) the active site(s). In order to investigate nonribosomal peptide bond formation, fragments of the peptide synthetase genes grsAand tycB corresponding to modules or truncated modules were PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA of Bacillus brevis ATCC 9999 and B. brevis ATCC 8185, respectively. PCR amplification was performed using the Expand long range PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's protocol. Restriction sites for subsequent cloning were introduced with PCR oligonucleotides, purchased from MWG-Biotech. The following nucleotides were utilized (modified sequences underlined; restriction sites in boldface type): 1) 5′-PheATE-NcoI, 5′-ATA TCC ATG GTA AAC AGT TCT AAA AG-3′; 2) 3′-PheAT-BamHI: 5′-ATC GGA TCC ATT TGG TCT ATA CAA C-3′; 3) 3′-GrsA-BamHI, 5′-ATAGGA TCC CGT TAA TGA ATC GGC CAA C-3′; 4) 5′-ProCAT-NcoI, 5′-ATA CC A TGG GTG TAT TTA GCA AAG AAC-3′; 5) 5′-ProAT-NcoI, 5′-TAT CCA TGG TTC CGT TGC TGA CAG AAG-3′; 6) 3′-ProCA-BamHI, 5′-ATAGGA TCC AAG AAT TTG CTC CCA AAT CGC-3′; and 7) 3′-ProCAT-BamHI, 5′-ATA GGA TCC GCT TTC CTC CCC GCC TTC C-3′. PCR products were purified with the QIAquick-spin PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with NcoI and BamHI, and ligated into the His6-tag vector pQE60, which was cut in the same manner. Standard procedures were applied for all DNA manipulations (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and the preparation of the recombinant plasmids using Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue (30Bullock W.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-378Google Scholar). Cloning in pQE60 yielded the plasmids pPheAT (using oligonucleotides 1 and 2), pPheATE (1 plus 3), pProCA (4 plus 6), pProCAT (4 plus 7), and pProAT (5 plus 7). The plasmid pProCAT(H147V) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of pProCAT using inverse PCR. The following primers were 5′-phosphorylated and used to amplify the entire plasmid pProCAT: 5′-H147V, 5′-TGA TCC TCA TGG ACG GCT GG-3′; 3′-H147V, 5′-CGT GAA AGC TCC AGA TGA CC-3′. The mutations (underlined) introduced with the primers effect an H(CAC)147V(GTG) substitution within the corresponding gene product and a silent H(CAT)146H(CAC) mutation to generate a PmaCI restriction site that allowed a simple detection of the mutated plasmid. The fusion sites between vector and inserts of the constructed plasmids as well as the mutation of the plasmid pProCAT(H147V) were confirmed by sequencing using the ABI prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (ABI). To achieve in vivo production of functional holopeptide synthetase modules, the P-pant transferase genegsp (31Borchert S. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was co-expressed. For this purpose, thePvuII fragment of pGsp+ (31Borchert S. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), containing thegsp gene under the control of the T7 promoter, was cloned into the SmaI site of the plasmid pREP4, yielding the helper plasmid pREP4/gsp. Normally, pREP4 facilitates a constitutive production of the lac repressor protein LacI in order to ensure tight regulation of pQE expression vectors. Both pREP4/gsp and the pQE60 derivatives carrying the peptide synthetase fragments were transformed for protein expression into E. coli BL21(DE3). This strain bears the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible gene of the T7 polymerase on a λ prophage DE3 within its chromosome (32Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6011) Google Scholar). This arrangement allowed the co-expression of peptide synthetase fragments and the P-pant transferase Gsp. Expression of the recombinant constructs and purification of the His6-tagged proteins was carried out as described previously (9Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6843-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stachelhaus T. Hüser A. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 913-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The fusion of a His6 tag results in appending the amino acid sequence “GSRSHHHHHH” at the C terminus of the recombinant protein. As judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar), the proteins could be purified to apparent homogeneity using single-step Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled and dialyzed against assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 2 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 mm EDTA). After the addition of 10% glycerol (v/v), the proteins could be stored at −80 °C with no observable loss of activity even after several months. Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated extinction coefficients for the absorbance of these proteins at 280 nm (A280): 138,690 m−1 cm−1 for GrsA, 69,180m−1 cm−1 for PheAT, 92,230m−1 cm−1 for ProCAT, 90,830m−1 cm−1 for ProCA, and 38,980m−1 cm−1 for ProAT. The P-pant transferase gene bli (34Gaidenko T.A. Belitsky B.R. Haykinson M.J. Biotechnologia. 1992; 3: 13-19Google Scholar) was amplified from chromosomal DNA of Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 10716 and cloned into the expression vector pQE70. PCR amplification was performed as described above using the following 5′-modified oligonucleotides: 5′-Bli-SphI, 5′-ATA GCA TGC AAG CAG AAA AAA TAT CTC ATG-3′; 3′-Bli-BglII, 5′-ATA AGA TCT TGA CAG TTC AGC GCA CG-3′. The amplified DNA was purified, digested with SphI andBglII, and ligated into the His6 tag vector pQE70. The resultant expression plasmid, pBli, was transformed inE. coli M15[pREP4], and subsequent expression and purification of the recombinant protein was carried out as described previously (16Stachelhaus T. Hüser A. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 913-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To maintain the overexpressed protein in solution, the sonication buffer was modified and contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 500 mm sodium chloride, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. As judged from a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the 28-kDa protein Bli could be purified to near homogeneity. The relevant fractions were pooled and dialyzed against modified assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 250 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA); the protein concentration was then determined using the calculatedA280 of Bli (31,750 m−1cm−1). In vitro incorporation of the co-factor P-pant was performed as described elsewhere (17Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem.

The extent of apo to holo conversion was judged by the rate of thioester formation prior to and after the in vitro modification. The ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction was carried out to confirm the adenylation activity of all recombinant peptide synthetase fragments purified. Reaction mixtures contained the following (final volume of 100 μl): 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm amino acid, and 250 nm enzyme. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 0.15 μCi (16.06 Ci/mmol) of tetrasodium [32P]pyrophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were quenched by adding 0.5 ml of a stop mix containing 1.2% (w/v) activated charcoal, 0.1m tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 0.35 mperchloric acid. Subsequently, the charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with 1 ml of water, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of water. After the addition of 3.5 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (Rotiscint Eco Plus; Roth), the charcoal-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) using a 1900CA Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). Thioester formation to monitor the amount of covalent amino acid binding was basically performed as described previously (16Stachelhaus T. Hüser A. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 913-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures in assay buffer contained 500 nm enzyme, 2 mm ATP, and 3 μCi ofl-[4-3H]phenylalanine (27.0 Ci/mmol) orl-[5-3H]proline (24.7 Ci/mmol) purchased from Amersham/Buchler. The assay was initiated by the addition of the cognate radiolabeled amino acid. For the determination of enzyme kinetics, samples (100 μL) were removed at various time points from 5 to 600 s, and the reaction was quenched immediately by the addition of 800 μl of chilled 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The samples were collected on mixed ester filters (ME25; Schleicher & Schüll) and washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the acid-stable label was then quantified by LSC. The formation of the dipeptide was analyzed using different combinations of derivatives of GrsA and the first module of TycB. To ensure a complete acylation of the peptide synthetase fragments with their cognate amino acids, a preincubation was carried out for 3 min at 37 °C; 1 μm PheATE or PheAT was incubated in assay buffer containing 2 mm ATP and 4.4 μm ofl-[4-3H]phenylalanine (27.0 Ci/mmol) (mixture A); ProCAT, ProCA, ProAT, or ProCAT(H147V) was incubated in assay buffer containing 1 μm enzyme, 2 mm ATP and 0.5 mm proline (mixture B). Alternatively, labeled phenylalanine was replaced by 0.5 mm of the unlabeled amino acid, and/or the unlabeled proline was substituted by 4.8 μm of l-[5-3H]proline (24.7 Ci/mmol). The condensation reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 volume of mixture B to 1 volume of mixture A in the different combinations delineated in Figs. 4 and 6. At time points from 15 to 600 s, 100-μl samples were taken and immediately quenched by the addition of 0.8 ml of chilled 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable label was collected and quantified as described above.Figure 6Peptide bond formation depends on the presence of a functional condensation domain. The same assay as described in Fig. 4 was carried out with truncated derivatives of PheATE and ProCAT and with the mutant protein ProCAT(H147V). The enzyme combinations were PheATE and ProCAT(H147V) (A), PheATE and ProAT (B), PheATE and ProCA (C), and PheAT and ProCAT (D). 100% enzyme (charged) refers to a complete aminoacylation of the GrsA derivative used. None of these proteins was able to form the dipeptide. The results shown in Fig. 4 for ProCAT are included in A for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to analyze the nature of the product(s), samples (100 μL) were removed at time points from 1 to 60 min, diluted by adding 400 μl of water, and immediately extracted with butanol/chloroform (4:1 (v/v)). The organic phases were transferred to fresh tubes and washed once with 500 μl of 0.1 m sodium chloride. Nonradioactive samples were prepared in a 10-fold up-scale of the radioactive assay. After removal of the solvent under vacuum, the residue was further investigated by TLC, HPLC-MS, and 1H and 13C NMR (see below). For TLC separation, radiolabeled samples were resolved in 20 μl of 90% ethanol (v/v), applied to silica plates (Silica gel 60 F254; Merck) and run in solvent system A: ethyl acetate/pyridine/acetic acid/water (90:30:9:16 (v/v)). Labeling was visualized by autoradiography (X-Omat AR; Kodak) and/or by scanning on a LB2723 thin layer scanner II (Berthold). Nonradioactive samples prepared were resolved in 10% of buffer B and analyzed by HPLC using a C18 reversed-phase column (Nucleosil 3 × 250 mm, pore size 120 Å, particle size 3 mm; Macherey & Nagel) on a Pharmacia HPLC system monitoring at detector wavelengths of 214 and 256 nm simultaneously. The following gradient profile was used at a flow rate of 0.35 ml min−1: 10 s loading (10% buffer B), linear gradient up to 30% buffer B in 1 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% buffer B in 20 min, and then holding 100% buffer B for 10 min (buffer A, 0.05% formic acid in H2O; buffer B, 0.04% formic acid in methanol). HPLC-MS of nonradioactive samples was performed on a Gynkotek HPLC system and a ESI source (Analytica of Branford Inc.) as an interface to a HP 5989 Hewlett Packard mass spectrometer in negative mode.

Many of these responses require de novogene expression mediated by the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. We investigated the mechanism by which TNFR1 recruits the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) and the p38s, two mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families that together regulate AP-1. We show that the human SPS1 homologue germinal center kinase (GCK) can interact in vivo with the TNFR1 signal transducer TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and with MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) upstream of the SAPKs, thereby coupling TRAF2 to the SAPKs. Receptor interacting protein (RIP) is a second TNFR signal transducer which can bind TRAF2. We show that RIP activates both p38 and SAPK; and that TRAF2 activation of p38 requires RIP. We also demonstrate that the RIP noncatalytic intermediate domain associates in vivo with an endogenous MAPKKK that can activate the p38 pathway in vitro. Thus, TRAF2 initiates SAPK and p38 activation by binding two proximal protein kinases: GCK and RIP. GCK and RIP, in turn, signal by binding MAPKKKs upstream of the SAPKs and p38s.

These include fever, shock, cachexia, tumor necrosis, leukocyte adhesion, and extravasation, induction of other cytokines, cell growth, and apoptosis (1Bazzoni F. Beutler B. Flier J.S. The Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand and Receptor Families. 1996: 1717-1725Google Scholar). TNF is important in the regulation of normal immune development where it governs in part the ablation of autoreactive lymphocytes during immune cell selection. In addition, TNF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes, as well as acute and chronic inflammatory diseases such as endotoxic shock and arthritis. TNF exerts its effects by binding to one of two receptors, the 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNFR)-1/CD120a or the 75-kDa TNFR2/CD120b (1Bazzoni F. Beutler B. Flier J.S.

The protein recruitment model for TNF signaling posits that ligand-induced TNFR trimerization results in the binding, to the TNFR intracellular extensions, of signal transducing proteins which then relay signals to downstream effectors. The intracellular extension of TNFR1 contains a death domain. Death domains mediate homotypic and heterotypic protein-protein interactions (2Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 3Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) and are critical for nucleating receptor-effector complexes and implementing several signaling programs including apoptosis (2Vandenabeele P.

Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Among the first death domain-containing proteins shown to bind TNFR1 was TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD). The binding of TRADD and TNFR1 requires the death domains of both polypeptides (4Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). TRADD can also bind two additional signal transducers: TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), a member of the TRAF family of signal transducers, and receptor interacting protein (RIP), a death domain-containing Ser/Thr kinase. RIP can also bind TRAF2 and, accordingly, TNF treatment is thought to result in the formation of a TRADD·RIP·TRAF2 complex (5Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V.

The activation of gene expression is an important consequence of TNFR1 engagement and is essential for many of the biological responses to TNF. TNF can recruit the multimeric transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (14Brenner D.A. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 337: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 15Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwartz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). TNF recruitment of AP-1 is pivotal to the inflammatory response. AP-1 is a heterodimer consisting of the c-Jun transcription factor and either a member of the Fos or activating transcription factor (ATF) family of transcription factors (16Karin M. Liu Z.-g. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar). Upon activation, AP-1 binds tocis elements in the genes for cytokines such as interleukin-2 and TNF itself. In addition, AP-1 is necessary for the expression of inflammatory proteases such as collagenase, and cell surface adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, which promote leukocyte adhesion and extravasation (16Karin M. Liu Z.-g. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar, 17Read M.A. Whitley M.Z. Gupta S. Pierce J.W. Best J. Davis R.J. Collins T. J. Biol.

TNF can activate two subfamilies of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of Ser/Thr kinases that together are largely responsible for the regulation of AP-1 in response to inflammatory stimuli (18Kyriakis J.M.

MAPK pathways have been strongly conserved in eukaryotic evolution and always employ a central, three tiered “core module” of protein kinases, wherein MAPKs are activated by Tyr and Thr phosphorylation catalyzed by members of the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) family. MEKs, in turn are activated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation catalyzed by several protein kinase families collectively referred to as MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) (26Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar).

We report herein that the GCK COOH-terminal regulatory domain can bind both TRAF2 and MEKK1 and that MEKK1 is a likely physiologic target of GCK. The TRAF2-GCK and GCK-MEKK1 interactions effectively couple one SAPK regulatory pathway to TNFR1. We also show that RIP can activate both the SAPK and p38 pathways in vivo; and our results indicate that RIP is required for TRAF2 activation of p38. The RIP intermediate domain is both necessary and sufficient for SAPK and p38 activation; and we demonstrate that the RIP intermediate domain, when overexpressed, can associate in vivo with an endogenous MAPKKK activity. This complex can be employed in assays to reconstitute the p38 pathway in vitro. We conclude from these results that GCK and RIP are proximal components in redundant, bifurcating mechanisms for TRAF2-mediated SAPK activation; by contrast, RIP is a dominant effector for TRAF2 activation of p38. In addition, we propose that both GCK and RIP elicit SAPK and p38 activation by binding, and possibly triggering activation of MAPKKKs. We used the following vectors: pEBG, which expresses a GST-tagged polypeptide (27Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

GCK and MEKK1 constructs were prepared by polymerase chain reaction amplification and cloning according to standard methods (50Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RIP constructs were prepared as described (51Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muiños F.-X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Human TRAF2 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from human T cell cDNA. 293 cells were cultivated in 10-cm dishes and, as shown in the figures, were co-transfected (by the CaPO4 method) with either 0.3 μg of pCMV5-GCK, 0.3 μg of pEBG-GCK (unless indicated), 7 μg of the indicated pCDM12-Myc-RIP or 7 μg of pEBV-TRAF2 and 1 μg of either pMT3-SAPK-p46β1 or p38α. As necessary, transfected DNA levels were balanced with empty plasmid. After 18 h, SAPK and p38 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and assayed, respectively, for c-Jun or ATF2 kinase activity as described (18Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). GCK was assayed as described (38Salmerón A. Ahmad T.B. Carlile G.W. Pappin D.

GST-SEK1-KR was purified from transfected 293 cells as described below for MKK6 and p38. Phosphorylation of GST-SEK1-KR was performed as in Yan et al. (32Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M.

For dominant inhibitory experiments, 3 μg of pCMV5-MEKK1 (817–1340) were co-transfected along with 0.3 μg of pEBG-GCK and 1 μg of pMT3 SAPK. 293 cells were transfected by the CaPO4 method. Unless indicated, 1–5 μg of plasmid was used. As necessary, transfected DNA levels were balanced with empty plasmid.

Lysis buffer was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 kallekrein inhibiting units/ml aprotinin, 2 μmleupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with high stringency wash buffer (lysis buffer prepared with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and containing 1m LiCl) and twice with wash buffer (no LiCl). Immunoblotting was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-FLAG antibody was from Kodak, anti-GST and MEKK1 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-TRAF2 antibody was from Santa Cruz. For in vitro binding of GCK to MEKK1, 293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCMV5-M2-FLAG-MEKK1 (817–1221). After 20 h, the MEKK1 was immunoprecipitated and washed under stringent conditions as described above. To the beads were added 10 ng of GST or GST-GCK which had been purified from transfected cell extracts as described below. As controls, mock immunoprecipitations were prepared using extracts of cells transfected with empty vector. The GCK was allowed to incubate with the MEKK1 at which time the beads were washed under stringent conditions as described above. To the beads were added kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100) containing MgCl2 (10 mm) and [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm). Autophosphorylation/phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 30 °C. For mock immunoprecipitations, the supernatants containing GST-GCK were removed and allowed to autophosphorylate as above. GST, GST-p38, -SEK1-K129R, and -MKK6 were purified from 7–10 plates of 293 cells transfected with the relevant pEBG constructs. GST-GCK was purified from 20 plates of transfected cells. The purification protocol was the same for all four proteins. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin, 10 kallekrein inhibiting units of aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min) and Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v) was added to the supernatants. Supernatants were then loaded onto 250-μl glutathione-agarose columns pre-equilibrated with column buffer (lysis buffer prepared without sucrose and with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100). Columns were washed twice with column buffer, three times with high stringency column wash buffer (column buffer containing 1 m LiCl), and twice again with column buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glutathione in column buffer and the purified proteins dialyzed into storage buffer (column buffer containing 50% (v/v) glycerol). Proteins prepared in this manner were stable for up to 6 months at −20 °C. GST-ATF2(4–94) or GST-c-Jun(1–135) were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (18Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P.

For activation assays, each of the Myc-RIP constructs was immunoprecipitated from at least seven 10-cm plates of 293 cells expressing the relevant pCDM12 construct. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of RIP plasmid for these experiments. The lysis and immunoprecipitation procedure have been described (Ref. 18Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar and see above). Immune complexes were washed at high stringency as described above for the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 20-μl RIP beads or blank beads (prepared from mock immunoprecipitations performed with nonimmune serum) were suspended in a total of 40 μl of assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100). To this were added 20 μl of assay buffer containing 6 ng of inactive GST-MKK6 or an equivalent amount of MKK6/p38 storage buffer. Reactions were started with the addition of 15 μl of [32P]ATP/MgCl2 mixture to give final concentrations of 100 μm [32P]ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction tubes were then centrifuged and 30 μl"

In 5L hepatoma cells, TCDD induces a G1 cell cycle arrest through a mechanism that involves the AhR. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) controls cell cycle progression through G1 in addition to promoting differentiation. We examined whether the human AhR or its dimerization partner, the AhR nuclear translocator, interacts with pRb as a basis of the TCDD-induced cell cycle arrest. In vivo and in vitro assays reveal a direct interaction between pRb and the AhR but not the AhR nuclear translocator protein. Binding between the AhR and pRb occurs through two distinct regions in the AhR. A high affinity site lies within the N-terminal 364 amino acids of the AhR, whereas a lower affinity binding region colocalizes with the glutamine-rich transactivation domain of the receptor. AhR ligand binding is not required for the pRb interaction per se, although immunoprecipitation experiments in 5L cells reveal that pRb associates preferentially with the liganded AhR, consistent with a requirement for ligand-induced nuclear translocation.

TCDD triggers a variety of responses in animals including liver toxicity, immune suppression, hyperplasia, and developmental and reproductive toxicity. In humans, TCDD exposure causes chloracne, but concern also extends to TCDD-induced tumor promotion, birth defects, and immunotoxicity (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The AhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that acts in concert with the AhR nuclear translocator (Arnt) (6Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar).

Cloning and characterization of the AhR and Arnt proteins revealed that both contain a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and PAS homology domain (8Hankinson O. Arch. Biochem.

Although both TADs are functionally competent (e.g. in yeast expression systems), in vivo studies indicate that the TAD of AhR predominates, at least in TCDD-induced CYP1A1 gene expression (14Jain S.

A new perspective on AhR function and TCDD action comes from two recent reports describing a relationship between AhR activity and the cell cycle (16Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 17Weiss C. Kolluri S.K. Kiefer F. Gottlicher M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Ma and Whitlock (16Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) examined differences in the growth rates of wild-type (Hepa1) and AhR-defective mouse cell lines and determined that the AhR influences G1 cell cycle progression. AhR-defective cells that contain only 10% of wild-type AhR levels exhibit a prolonged transition through the G1phase, but when transfected with an AhR expression construct, these cells grew with normal doubling times. Weiss and co-workers (17Weiss C. Kolluri S.K. Kiefer F. Gottlicher M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), using wild-type (5L) and AhR-defective (BP8) rat hepatoma cells, observed a TCDD-dependent G1 arrest only in the 5L cells. Furthermore, expression of the AhR in the BP8 cells ordinarily refractory to TCDD-induced growth arrest reconstituted the inhibitory phenotype, suggesting direct involvement by the AhR in the G1 arrest. Progression through G1 phase of the cell cycle is regulated by pRb. pRb is a 110-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein that undergoes cyclic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during the cell cycle (18Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 19Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). The hypophosphorylated, active form of pRb triggers cells to arrest in G1, whereas progression beyond the G1 checkpoint and entry into S phase occur following pRb inactivation by cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-mediated hyperphosphorylation (20Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, pRb is believed to function as a repressor protein in G1 arrest by binding to the transcription factor E2F, preventing E2F-mediated transcription of genes required for S phase. The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein relieves E2F repression by binding to and sequestering pRb (21Whyte P. Buchkovich J.J. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Raybuck M. Weinberg R.A. Harlow E. Nature. 1988; 334: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that E1A also suppresses drug induction of rat CYP1A1through a mechanism involving the xenobiotic response element (22Kobayashi A. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Sogawa K. Fuji-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that E1A disrupts a functional interaction between the AhR-Arnt complex and pRb necessary for AhR-mediated gene expression. Similarly, the TCDD-inducible G1 cell cycle arrest in 5L cells may involve an interaction between pRb and the AhR-Arnt complex. These observations prompted us to examine whether the AhR or Arnt protein is capable of interacting with pRb. Immunocoprecipitation results detected an interaction between the AhR-Arnt complex and pRb. Using the yeast two-hybrid system and the GST fusion protein pull-down assay, we show a direct interaction between pRb and the AhR. In contrast, the Arnt protein does not interact with pRb. The pRb-AhR interaction involves primarily a sequence(s) located within the N-terminal 364 amino acids of the AhR, although a C-terminal 83-amino acid region encompassing the glutamine-rich domain is also involved. The data also suggest that the pRb-AhR interaction per se is not contingent upon ligand binding. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the AhR and pRb directly interact in vivo and in vitro.

All AhR and Arnt LexA fusion proteins were constructed using pLexA vector (MATCHMAKER system, CLONTECH). This vector encodes a 202-amino acid LexA repressor DNA-binding domain under the control of the yeast PADH1 promoter followed by a multiple cloning site. The human AhR and Arnt constructs were derived from the plasmid phuAHR (Ref. 23Dolwick K.M. Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 911-917PubMed Google Scholar; provided by Dr. C. Bradfield, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) and plasmid pBM5NeoM1-1 (Ref. 6Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar; provided by Dr. O. Hankinson, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). Full-length and truncated coding regions of the AhR were PCR amplified using the primer hAhR-F with the appropriate reverse primer. PCR products were subcloned into theNotI site of pLexA and designated pYAhRFL, pYAhR1–672, pYAhR1–589 and pYAhR1–528. The full-length and truncated human Arnt coding regions were PCR amplified using the primer hArnt-F with either hArnt-R (full length) or hArnt694-R (truncated). Arnt PCR products were subcloned into the BamHI site of pLexA to create pYArntFL and pYArnt1–694. The human pRb construct encoding amino acids 374–928 was generated by PCR amplification of p2206TRB (Ref. 24Hatakeyama M. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar; provided by Dr. R. Weinberg, MIT, Cambridge, MA) using the primers Rb374-F and Rb928-R. The PCR product was subcloned into the XhoI site of pB42AD generating pB42ADpRb, comprising an in-frame fusion between pRb and a vector-encoded 88-residue activation domain (B42). Constructs were checked by DNA sequencing using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Yeast cells (leucine auxotrophic strain EGY48) were transformed using the LiAc method as described in the MATCHMAKER manual (CLONTECH). The two-hybrid assay used two reporters (LEU2 and lacZ) under the control of LexA operators. Quantitation of β-galactosidase activity was performed on liquid cultures using the chemiluminescent reporter assay Galacton-light™ (Tropix) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, yeast transformants were grown on selective plates for 3–5 days, after which 3–5 colonies were used to inoculate 5 ml of minimum dropout glucose medium and incubated at 30 °C overnight. Subsequently, 0.5 ml was used to inoculate 5 ml of selection medium containing galactose and grown in log phase for 5 h. A 1.5-ml aliquot was removed and washed once with 1.5 ml of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 35 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and resuspended in 300 μl of Z buffer. Cells were permeabilized by freeze-thawing twice in liquid nitrogen for 1 min, after which triplicate assays were performed using 20 μl of the cell lysate with 70 μl of the Galacton™ substrate in a 96-well microplate and incubated at room temperature for an hour. β-Galactosidase activity presented as relative light units was determined in a MLX Microtiter® plate luminometer (Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA) using parameters suggested by the manufacturer. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG (25Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) was used to generate GST fusion proteins with the human AhR (amino acids 1–364 and 537–774) and human Arnt (amino acids 510–780). PCR amplified products using plasmid phuAHR and the primer sets GST-hAhR-F/GST-hAhR364-R and GST-hAhR537-F/GST-hAhR774-R were directionally subcloned intoXbaI/HindIII-cut andEcoRI/HindIII-cut vector, respectively, to give pGEXAhR1–364 and pGEXAhR537–774. An Arnt-encoding cDNA was generated by PCR using plasmid pBM5NeoM1-1 and primers GST-hArnt510-F and GST-hArnt780-R followed by directional cloning intoEcoRI/HindIII-cut pGEX-KG vector generating pGEXArnt510–780. GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli following induction by 1 mmisopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Fusion proteins were recovered from cells resuspended in NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors, following two passages through the French press and clarification of the lysate at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads. A cDNA encoding full-length human pRb was generated by PCR amplification of p2206TRB using the primers pCR3Rb-F and pCR3Rb928-R and cloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) by TA cloning. In vitro transcription and translation of pRb was performed in the TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the protocol provided by the manufacture. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 90 min. Binding assays were carried out on ice for 2 h using 10 μl of the translated pRb incubated with glutathione-agarose beads containing 5 μg of GST or GST fusion protein in 1 ml of NETN buffer containing protease inhibitors. Beads were washed six times in NETN buffer and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography using a GS-525 MolecularImager® system (Bio-Rad). Wild-type rat hepatoma 5L cells and the AhR-defective BP8 variants were grown in 100-mm plates as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Subconfluent cultures of 5L cells were treated with 5 nm TCDD or 0.05% (v/v) vehicle (Me2SO) for 1 h and then lysed on ice for 30 min by addition of 1 ml/plate lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed on total cell lysate from 3 × 105 cells using the G3-245 anti-pRb monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) on ice for 4 h followed by binding to protein G-coupled beads. Beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blocked with 4% Blotto in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Filters were probed with the anti-pRb antibody and antibodies against mouse AhR and Arnt (Ref. 26Pollenz R.S. Sullivan H.L. Holmes J. Necela B. Peterson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30886-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr. R. Pollenz, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) for 4 h at room temperature, followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Detection was by chemiluminescence using Western-Star and imaging on a GS-525 MolecularImager. The TCDD-inducible G1 arrest in 5L cells may bespeak an interaction between pRb and the AhR-Arnt complex and is supported by immunocoprecipitation experiments (Fig.1). Immunoprecipitates from control or TCDD-treated 5L cell lysates using an antibody against human pRb were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of AhR, Arnt protein, and pRb. A TCDD-inducible coprecipitation of the AhR and Arnt protein is revealed by the enrichment of these proteins without a corresponding increase in pRb levels (compare lanes 2 and 3). Digital imaging and quantitation of the bands reveal that AhR and Arnt levels are increased 2.5- and 2.2-fold, respectively, after normalization for pRb. Hence, the data suggest that the AhR-Arnt complex does indeed interact with pRb upon TCDD activation of the AhR. Furthermore, the result also reveals that the AhR-Arnt complex is capable of interacting with the hypophosphorylated, active form of pRb, because the inactive hyperphosphorylated form of pRb detectable in the 5L cell lysate (lane 1, ppRb) is not a component of the immunoprecipitates. Precipitation of pRb, AhR, or Arnt was not observed with nonimmune IgG (data not shown). To examine whether the AhR or Arnt protein directly contacts pRb, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay. The assay uses two reporter genes (LEU2 and lacZ) under the control of multiple LexA operators, detectable as growth of the leucine auxotrophs and blue colony formation on leucine-deficient X-gal plates. Fusion constructs linking the full-length human AhR or Arnt protein to the DNA-binding domain of the LexA repressor induced both reporters in the absence of the plasmid pB42ADpRb (Fig. 2,C, AhRFL, and G, ArntFL), indicating that the TADs contained in the full-length AhR and Arnt are both transcriptionally competent. This agrees with past observations (14Jain S. Dolwick K.M. Schmidt J.V. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31518-31524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the purpose of the yeast two-hybrid assay, however, this domain needed to be removed. Because the AhR TAD is complex, comprising several regions each capable of transactivation (27Sogawa K. Iwabuchi K. Abe H. Fuji-Kuriyama Y. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the AhR C terminus was progressively deleted in a series of LexA fusion constructs to remove the entire TAD (AhR1–672, 1–589, and 1–528). In contrast, the TAD of Arnt is confined primarily to the last 34 amino acids (27Sogawa K. Iwabuchi K. Abe H. Fuji-Kuriyama Y. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Arnt1–694 construct removes the TAD as well as the glutamine-rich region. When transformed into cells in the absence of pB42ADpRb, none of the AhR and Arnt truncated constructs induced β-galactosidase expression nor grew on leucine-deficient plates (Fig.2, −pRb). Cotransformation with pB42ADpRb stimulated β-galactosidase expression and growth on selective medium in cells transformed with the truncated AhR proteins (Fig. 2, +pRb). Restoration of reporter expression by the pLexA bait and pB42AD prey constructs is interpreted as evidence for a direct pRb-AhR interaction. Specificity for this interaction is suggested by the failure of pRb to interact with Arnt1–694. The AhR-pRb interaction and the impact of ligand binding were examined quantitatively by the yeast two-hybrid assay using liquid cultures (Fig. 3). Background β-galactosidase activity in cells (i.e. transformed with the reporter plasmid p8op-lacZ) was not increased in cells cotransformed with the pB42ADpRb construct, indicating that pRb alone is incapable of transcriptional activation. The full-length AhR in the absence of pRb triggered a 200-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3, compare columns 1 and 5). Cotransformation of pRb fails to induce AhRFL-driven β-galactosidase activity further (compare columns 5 and 7), suggesting that the pRb interaction with AhRFL is probably masked by the potent TAD of the receptor. In contrast, the truncated AhR constructs were almost devoid of inherent AhR transactivation activity inducing at most a 2–3-fold increase in reporter expression (Fig. 3, compare column 1with columns 9, 13, and 17). Interactions between pRb and the truncated AhR proteins stimulated a 10–100-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity, being most pronounced with the AhR1–672 construct (compare columns 9and 11). The ≈20-fold difference in pRb-dependent β-galactosidase activity between AhR1–672 and AhR1–589 suggests that pRb may be interacting, at least in part, with this 83-amino acid AhR region between residues 589 and 672 (compare columns 11 and 15). Analysis of the Arnt constructs reveals that although the full-length protein stimulates a 6000-fold increase of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3, comparecolumns 1 and 21), the truncated Arnt1–694 construct expresses only residual transactivation activity (4-fold above background). Significantly, neither protein confers enhanced β-galactosidase activity in the presence of pRb, consistent with the failure of Arnt to bind pRb in the plate assay (Fig. 2). The decrease in ArntFL-induced β-galactosidase activity in the presence of pRb construct is thought to be due to the activation domain encoded by pB42ADpRb interfering with the activity of the TAD of Arnt. Control Western blot experiments on yeast cell extracts using antibodies against LexA and pRb reveal that expression of the LexA fusion constructs and pB42ADpRb are comparable among the transformants (data not shown). In yeast cells devoid of pRb, the AhR ligand βNF stimulated a modest (2–3-fold) increase in β-galactosidase activity in the cells expressing the AhRFL, AhR1–672, or AhR1–589 fusion protein but not AhR1–528. Notably, no synergism in reporter expression was detected in βNF-treated cells cotransformed with pB42ADpRb, suggesting that ligand binding is neither a prerequisite for nor a facilitator of the AhR-pRb interaction. These results are reconcilable with the TCDD dependence observed in the 5L cell immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1) if ligand is required for AhR nuclear translocation and colocalization with the Arnt protein and pRb but not for complex formation. βNF actually appears to suppress the pRb interaction with the shorter AhR constructs (i.e. AhR1–589 compare columns 15 and16; AhR1–528, compare columns 19 and20). It is conceivable that a ligand-induced conformational change in these severely truncated proteins lacking the region between residues 589 and 672 renders them less able to bind pRb. Lavender et al. (28Lavender P. Vandel L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1997; 12: 2721-2727Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) recently showed that HBP1, a high mobility group-box transcription factor, binds pRb through two distinct pRb-binding sites. High affinity binding involved the LXCXE consensus pRb-binding motif in HBP1, while a separate, low affinity binding site colocalized with the HBP1 activation domain. In contrast, binding between pRb and MyoD occurs through the bHLH domain of MyoD (29Gu W. Schneider J.W. Condorelli G. Kaushal S. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. 1993; 72: 309-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). In addition to a TAD and bHLH domain, visual inspection of the amino acid of the AhR sequence reveals an LXCXE motif located (amino acids 331–335 in the human AhR) within the PAS domain. Given the existence of multiple putative pRb-binding motifs in the AhR, GST fusion pull-down studies were performed (Fig. 4). This in vitro assay also provides a convenient method to identify potential pRb interactions within the AhR and Arnt protein TADs masked in the yeast two-hybrid assay. GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione agarose were used as affinity reagents to bind full-length35S-radiolabeled pRb generated by in vitrotranscription and translation (Fig. 4, Input). Retention of radiolabeled pRb was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Both the GST fragment alone and the GST-hArnt (aa 510–780) protein bound pRb at near background levels defined as binding to naive beads. Because the fragment used encompasses the Arnt protein TAD, the data confirm that this domain does not bind pRb. In contrast, GST-hAhR (aa1–364) protein bound pRb almost 20-fold above background. GST-hAhR (aa537–774) encompassing the glutamine-rich component of the TAD of the receptor also bound pRb, although with a lower affinity (i.e.5.2-fold) than the N-terminal region. The results clearly show that pRb interacts specifically with both N- and C-terminal regions of AhR, placing one site in the N-terminal 364 amino acids containing both the bHLH and the LXCXE motif. The second site lies between residues 537 and 774. In fact, we can narrow this down further to an 83-amino acid glutamine-rich region between residues 589 and 672, because deleting this region resulted in a ≈20-fold decrease in β-galactosidase reporter expression (Fig. 3). This paper presents evidence for a direct interaction between the AhR and pRb and seems to involve at least two distinct regions within the AhR. The GST-AhR pull-down data place one site in the N terminus of the AhR encompassing the first 364 amino acids and a second site within residues 537–774. The ≈20-fold decrease in β-galactosidase activity in the two-hybrid assay following removal of residues 589–672 suggests that the latter site lies within this 83-amino acid region. The N-terminal region contains both a bHLH and LXCXE motif, whereas the C-terminal sequence harbors a glutamine-rich TAD. Studies on the high mobility group-box transcription factor, HBP1, revealed that its LXCXE motif and activation domain functioned as high and low affinity pRb-binding sites, respectively (28Lavender P.

https://openalex.org/W2092328154,"SHPS-1 (or SIRP) is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily abundantly expressed in neurons and other cell types. Within its cytoplasmic domain, it possesses at least two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, which are targets for tyrosine phosphorylation and mediate the recruitment of SHP-2, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Since other immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs-containing receptors have critical roles in the negative regulation of hemopoietic cell functions, we wanted to examine the expression of SHPS-1 in cells of hematological lineages. By analyzing a panel of hemopoietic cell lines, evidence was provided that SHPS-1 is abundantly expressed in macrophages and, to a lesser extent, in myeloid cells. No expression was detected in T-cell or B-cell lines. Expression of SHPS-1 could also be documented in normal ex vivo peritoneal macrophages. Further studies showed that SHPS-1 was an efficient tyrosine phosphorylation substrate in macrophages. However, unlike in non-hemopoietic cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated SHPS-1 in macrophages associated primarily with SHP-1 and not SHP-2. Finally, our analyses allowed us to identify several isoforms of SHPS-1 in mouse cells. In part, this heterogeneity was due to differential glycosylation of SHPS-1. Additionally, it was caused by the production of at least two distinct shps-1 transcripts, coding for SHPS-1 polypeptides having different numbers of Ig-like domains in the extracellular region. Taken together, these findings indicate that SHPS-1 is likely to play a significant role in macrophages, at least partially as a consequence of its capacity to recruit SHP-1.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in a wide variety of cellular responses, including growth factor-induced proliferation and differentiation, G-protein-coupled receptor signal transduction, and antigen/Fc receptor signaling (reviewed in Ref. 1Cooper J.A. Kemp B.E. Peptides and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 85-113Google Scholar). As the mechanisms inducing protein tyrosine phosphorylation are becoming well understood, significant interest has been directed toward identifying the processes involved in their negative regulation. As a result, numerous protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseITIMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifSH2Src homology 2PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPNGasepeptide:N-glycosidase F. have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 2Tonks N.K.

In some cases such as the hemopoietic cell phosphatase SHP-1, PTPs have been shown to be potent inhibitors of cell signaling. protein-tyrosine phosphatase immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif Src homology 2 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis peptide:N-glycosidase F. Generally, there is little known about the modes of recruitment and activation of PTPs in physiological situations. Nonetheless, a significant advance in our comprehension of these processes was provided by the discovery that certain inhibitory receptors on hemopoietic cells, such as FcγRIIB and killer inhibitory receptors, contain within their cytoplasmic domain a motif capable of inhibiting receptor-mediated signal transduction (Refs. 3Muta T.

This sequence, termed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), is (V/I/T)XYXX(V/L) (where V is valine, I is isoleucine, T is threonine, L is leucine, Y is tyrosine, and X is any residue). Phosphorylation of the tyrosine in the ITIM triggers binding and activation of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphatases like the protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 and the inositol phosphatase SHIP (reviewed in Ref. 6Sharenberg A.M. Kinet J.-P. Cell. 1996; 87: 961-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). There is now strong genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that the inhibitory function of ITIM-containing receptors is mediated via these phosphatases. Through molecular cloning, several additional receptors with potential ITIMs have been identified. Whereas most are restricted to hemopoietic cells, one receptor, named SHPS-1 or SIRP (hereafter termed SHPS-1), was first identified in non-hemopoietic cell types, especially neuronal cells (7Fujioka Y.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The sequence of SHPS-1 is highly conserved across species. It possesses three extracellular Ig-like domains, a single hydrophobic transmembrane sequence, and an intracellular domain of ∼115 amino acids containing at least two ITIMs. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 was reported to occur in response to various stimuli, including activation of TPK receptors such as insulin receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor (8Kharitonenkov A.

This phosphorylation was shown to trigger the binding of SHP-2, a PTP expressed in all cell types (7Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M.

Whereas the exact physiological role of SHPS-1 remains to be clarified, there are convincing indications that it can inhibit receptor-mediated growth signals (8Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). As other ITIM-containing receptors are involved in modulating hemopoietic cell functions, we wished to examine the distribution of SHPS-1 in hemopoietic cells. Although SHPS-1 was absent in most hemopoietic cell types, we observed that it accumulated in large amounts in macrophages. However, contrary to non-hemopoietic cells where SHPS-1 associates primarily with SHP-2 (Refs. 7Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol.

Cells were harvested after 5 days of incubation. Cytofluorometric analyses demonstrated that >90% of cells expressed high affinity receptors for IgG and were positive for Mac-1 (data not shown). Tissues were obtained from 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice. A mouse C57BL/6 fetal thymocyte cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Louis Matis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, New Haven, CT) was screened with a polymerase chain reaction-generated radiolabeled probe corresponding to the first Ig-like domain of mouse SHPS-1 (9Yamao T.

Positive clones were analyzed by sequencing (data not shown). RNAs were isolated from tissues or cells of C57BL/6 mice using either the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (11Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar) or the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Equivalent amounts of RNA (30 μg) were tested in ribonuclease (RNase) protection assays, as described previously (10Chow L.M.L. Davidson D. Fournel M. Gosselin P. Lemieux S. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Matis L.A. Veillette A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3437-3448PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled antisense RNA probes corresponding to nucleotides 421–635 (first Ig-like region) or 1351–1626 (third Ig-like and transmembrane domains) in the mouseshps-1 sequence reported by Yamao et al. (9Yamao T. Matozaki T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Takahashi N. Ochi F. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were produced using the Riboprobe System (Promega, Madison, WI). Polyclonal antisera directed against the first Ig-like domain (αIg1) or the cytoplasmic domain (αcyto) of SHPS-1 were obtained by immunizing rabbits with TrpE fusion proteins encompassing the corresponding SHPS-1 sequences. Rabbit antibodies reacting against SHP-1, SHP-2, phospholipase C-γ1, Cbl, Vav, Syk, Csk, Lyn, Shc, SLP-76, and phosphotyrosine have been described elsewhere (12Beauchemin N. Kunath T. Robitaille J.

An antiserum directed against the SH3 domain of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase was kindly provided by Dr. Tony Pawson, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The anti-Grb-2 serum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was reported elsewhere (17Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Cells or tissues were lysed in 1× TNE buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40; 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 10 μg per ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone,N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, as well as the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (50 mm) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). Proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation using the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were then collected with formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus protein A (Pansorbin; Calbiochem) and washed three times in TNE buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. In the case of mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10, S. aureus protein A was coupled to rabbit anti-mouse IgG prior to incubation with immunoprecipitates. Proteins were subsequently eluted in sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed in 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, and transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) for immunoblotting. For immunoblots of total cell lysates, cells were lysed in boiling SDS-containing sample buffer, and lysates corresponding to equivalent cell numbers were separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed according to a previously described protocol (18Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), using 125I-protein A (Amersham Canada, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Immunoreactive products were detected by autoradiography. All quantitations were done with a PhosphorImager (BAS 2000; Fuji). After immunoprecipitation, immune complexes were collected with S. aureus protein A as described above. Following several washes, samples were treated for 2 h at 37 °C with 1000 units of peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After elution in sample buffer, immunoprecipitates were boiled and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The wild-type shps-1 cDNA and the shps-1 cDNA lacking nucleotides 849–1502 from the sequence of Yamao et al. (Ref. 9Yamao T. Matozaki T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Takahashi N. Ochi F. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar; Δ shps-1) were cloned from a C57BL/6 mouse thymocyte cDNA library. Amyc-tagged version of shps-1 cDNA was created by polymerase chain reaction. These cDNAs were inserted in the multiple cloning site of pNT-Neo, a mammalian expression vector that contains an SRα promoter and the neomycin resistance gene (neo). 70Z/3 pre-B cells or BI-141 T-cells were transfected by electroporation (260 V, 960 microfarads), using linearized DNA (50 μg). Transfected cells were selected by growth in medium containing G418 (0.5 mg/ml for 70Z/3 and 0.75 mg/ml for BI-141). J774A cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 20 μm bPV (PIC), a synthetic analog of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (kindly given by Dr. Barry Posner, McGill University, Montréal, Québec, Canada). They were then processed for immunoprecipitation according to the protocol outlined above. To study the expression of SHPS-1 in hemopoietic cells, mouse shps-1cDNAs were first cloned using a C57BL/6 mouse-derived cDNA library. Approximately 106 recombinants were screened by hybridization with a radiolabeled DNA probe corresponding to the first Ig-like domain of SHPS-1. A total of 38 positive clones were identified and characterized by sequencing (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of a representative clone is shown in Fig.1 A. When compared with two previously reported mouse shps-1 cDNAs, our cDNA showed differences in the predicted sequence for the SHPS-1 protein. This was especially noticeable in the first Ig-like domain, where ∼10% of residues were different. A similar degree of divergence could also be observed between the two shps-1 cDNAs reported earlier. Although the exact basis for this variation is not known, the fact that all our cDNA clones had identical sequences (data not shown) and that the three known types of cDNAs had been characterized from distinct strains suggested that it may reflect some degree of polymorphism of the shps-1 gene in the mouse. The accumulation of shps-1 transcripts in mouse tissues was next examined by RNase protection assay (Fig. 1 B). Total cellular RNA (30 μg) from a variety of C57BL/6 tissues was incubated overnight with a radiolabeled antisense riboprobe corresponding to the first Ig-like region of SHPS-1. After digestion with RNase A, the protected probe fragments were resolved by electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. The expected fragment of 214 nucleotides was present in all mouse tissues tested (lanes 1–5), including thymus (lane 1) and spleen (lane 2). Notably, the highest levels of shps-1 RNA were found in spleen (lane 2) and brain (lane 3). Similar results were obtained when a probe corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of SHPS-1 was used (data not shown). To assess further the distribution of SHPS-1, its levels of protein expression were examined. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the first Ig-like domain (Ig1) or the cytoplasmic portion (cyto) of SHPS-1 were produced in rabbits, as outlined under “Material and Methods.” When used in immunoblots (Fig. 2 A), these two types of antisera recognized an ∼120-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide in lysates of a T-cell line transfected with ashps-1 cDNA (lanes 2 and 4) but not in untransfected cells (lanes 1 and 3). The antisera directed against the cytoplasmic domain of SHPS-1 (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 4) could also efficiently immunoprecipitate SHPS-1 from Nonidet P-40-containing cell lysates. However, those against the first Ig-like domain (lanes 1 and2) were unable to recognize SHPS-1 under these conditions. This phenomenon likely indicated that the antibodies against the first Ig-like domain reacted with epitopes that required denaturation of SHPS-1 to be accessible. Next, the expression of SHPS-1 in mouse tissues was ascertained. Tissues from C57BL/6 mice were lysed in Nonidet P-40-containing buffer, and SHPS-1 polypeptides were recovered by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antiserum against the cytoplasmic domain. After electrophoresis in 8% SDS-PAGE gels, immunoreactive products were detected by anti-SHPS-1 immunoblotting using another antiserum directed against the same portion of the molecule (Fig.3 A). We found that thymus (lane 1) and spleen (lane 2) contained appreciable amounts of a 120-kDa polypeptide consistent with SHPS-1 (7Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar,8Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). A similar product was observed in liver (lane 4). The electrophoretic migration of these polypeptides was fairly diffuse, in keeping with the previous documentation that SHPS-1 is extensively glycosylated (7Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Lesser amounts of an ∼50-kDa product were also detected in these tissues. Contrary to spleen, thymus, and liver, brain tissue (lane 3) contained immunoreactive products with different molecular masses. It possessed two major species of ∼95 and ∼42 kDa, in addition to minor products of 120, 75, 60, and 35 kDa. Comparable results were obtained when an antiserum produced against the first Ig-like domain of SHPS-1 was used for immunoblotting (Fig.3 B), although this antiserum was clearly less sensitive. As SHPS-1 is a glycoprotein (7Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), the possibility that the heterogeneity in the apparent molecular mass of SHPS-1 was due to differences in glycosylation was tested. After immunoprecipitation, SHPS-1 polypeptides were treated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which removes asparagine-linked sugars. They were then resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gels and detected by anti-SHPS-1 immunoblotting (Fig.3 C). This analysis revealed that, when deglycosylated, SHPS-1 polypeptides from thymus (lane 1), spleen (lane 2), brain (lane 3), and liver (lane 4) invariably migrated as two products of ∼65 and ∼35 kDa, hereafter named p65 and p35. These two proteins constituted ∼75 and ∼25% of SHPS-1 detected in these tissues, respectively (data not shown). The ability to detect SHPS-1 in thymus and spleen suggested that it might be expressed in hemopoietic cells. However, as these tissues contain multiple cell lineages including non-hemopoietic cells, it was still conceivable that SHPS-1 is not expressed in hemopoietic cells. To address this issue further, the expression of SHPS-1 was evaluated in a series of mouse hemopoietic cell lines. Cells were lysed directly in boiling sample buffer, and lysates from equivalent cell numbers were separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of SHPS-1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-SHPS-1 antibodies (Fig.4 A). Among the various cell lines examined, T-cells (lanes 1 and2), B-cells (lanes 3–8), and mast cells (lanes 9 and 10) generally lacked SHPS-1. There was one exception with the B-cell line WEHI-231 (lane 6), which possessed a modest amount of SHPS-1. By contrast, SHPS-1 was abundantly expressed in the macrophage-derived cell lines J774A (lane 11) and RAW264.7 (lane 12). Accumulation of SHPS-1 was also documented in another macrophage cell line, 1C-21 (data not shown). Moderate levels of expression were also detected in the myelomonocytic cell line WEHI-3B (lane 13) and the factor-dependent myeloid cell line B6SutA1(lane 14), whereas no SHPS-1 was found in 32D, another factor-dependent myeloid cell line (lane 15). Finally, low levels of SHPS-1 were observed in the undifferentiated leukemia cell line L1210 (lane 16) but not in the erythroleukemic cell line MEL (lane 17). In general, the SHPS-1 protein detected in these cells migrated at ∼120 kDa. However, in B6SutA1 (lane 14), it had an apparent mass of ∼130 kDa. The exact basis for this difference is not known. In addition to a 120-kDa product, the macrophage cell lines (lanes 11 and 12) also contained large amounts of an immunoreactive species of ∼50 kDa. We wished to evaluate whether the polypeptides of 120 and 50 kDa found in macrophages were also glycosylated versions of p65 and p35. To this end, immunoprecipitated SHPS-1 molecules from J774A cells were subjected to deglycosylation as outlined above. A subsequent anti-SHPS-1 immunoblot (Fig. 4 B) demonstrated that the molecular masses of these two glycoproteins were indeed diminished to 65 and 35 kDa after enzymatic removal of asparagine-linked sugars (lane 2). Contrary to normal mouse tissues, however (Fig.3 C), J774A contained approximately equal quantities of p65 and p35. To examine whether SHPS-1 was also expressed in normal macrophages, its presence was evaluated in peritoneal macrophages. Cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mouse after intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate, and the accumulation of SHPS-1 was ascertained by immunoblotting of total cell lysates with anti-SHPS-1 antibodies (Fig.5). This analysis showed that ex vivo peritoneal macrophages (lane 3) expressed SHPS-1 in amounts analogous to those of J774A (lane 2). Once again, two distinct SHPS-1 molecules, gp120 and gp50, could be observed in these cells. Whereas part of the heterogeneity in the molecular weight of SHPS-1 was explained by differences in glycosylation, two distinct SHPS-1 polypeptides, p65 and p35, remained after deglycosylation. To gain insight into the nature of these products, the C57BL/6 mouse library tested above was assessed for the existence of alternative shps-1 cDNAs. Notably, one cDNA exhibited an internal deletion of 654 nucleotides (Figs. 1 Aand 6 A), thereby lacking nucleotides 849–1502 of the sequence published by Yamao et al. (9Yamao T. Matozaki T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Takahashi N. Ochi F. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SHPS-1 polypeptide encoded by this cDNA is expected to lack the second and third Ig-like domains (Figs. 1 A and 6 B), thus having a predicted mass of ∼32 kDa before glycosylation. A similar cDNA was recently cloned from mouse brain by Comu et al. (19Comu S. Weng W. Olinsky S. Ishwad P. Mi Z. Hempel J. Watkins S. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8702-8710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first wanted to ensure that transcripts corresponding to this cDNA variant existed in tissues and cells. Thus, RNase protection assays were conducted on RNA samples isolated from spleen, brain, or peritoneal macrophages, using riboprobes corresponding either to the conserved first Ig-like domain (Fig.7 A) or to the third Ig-like domain and transmembrane sequence (Fig. 7 B). This last riboprobe is expected to produce a 270-nucleotide fragment when protected by wild-type shps-1 transcripts, while yielding a smaller 123-nucleotide fragment in the presence of the deleted version of shps-1 RNAs. In this experiment, we found that a single fragment was protected in all cells and tissues when the probe corresponding to the first Ig-like domain was used (Fig.7 A). By contrast, two different fragments of 270 and 123 nucleotides were observed with the probe covering the third Ig-like region and the transmembrane domain (Fig. 7 B). This was especially obvious in peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 7 B, top panel, lane 3), where shps-1 RNAs were 5 to 6 times more abundant than in spleen (lane 1) or brain (lane 2). Nonetheless, a longer autographic exposure of this gel (bottom panel) showed that the 123-nucleotide species was also present in spleen (lane 1) and brain (lane 2). To test whether the deleted shps-1 cDNA could encode p35, wild-type and deleted (Δ) cDNAs were individually transfected by electroporation in the mouse B-cell line 70Z/3, which normally lacks SHPS-1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). Stably transfected cells were selected by growth in medium supplemented with G418 (0.5 mg/ml). An anti-SHPS-1 immunoblot of total cell lysates (Fig.8 A) showed that, contrary to parental 70Z/3 cells (lane 1), cells bearing the full-lengthshps-1 cDNA (lane 3) expressed an SHPS-1 polypeptide that comigrated with the larger molecule found in J774A (lane 4). In contrast, cells bearing the deleted cDNA (lane 2) displayed a species of SHPS-1 coinciding with the smaller product from J774A (lane 4). To support further the notion that p35 was encoded by the shortershps-1 cDNA, we tested the effect of deglycosylation (Fig. 8 B). This assay demonstrated that, when deglycosylated, the molecule produced by this cDNA (lane 4) resolved at the same position as the 35-kDa polypeptide from J774A (lane 6). In comparison, the polypeptide encoded by the full-length cDNA (lane 5) comigrated with the 65-kDa protein found in the macrophage cell line (lane 6). Hence, these results indicated that p35 is likely an alternative form of SHPS-1 lacking the second and third Ig-like domains. Previous studies have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHPS-1 in fibroblasts led to its association with the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (7Fujioka Y. Matozaki T.

We now show that cells transfected with syndecan-2 or syndecan-4 also bind collagen and are non-invasive. In contrast, cells transfected with the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteoglycan glypican-1 do not bind to collagen and remain invasive, even though glypican- and syndecan-expressing cells have similar surface levels of heparan sulfate, and their proteoglycans have similar affinities for collagen. Analysis of cells expressing syndecan-1-glypican-1 chimeric proteoglycans reveals that inhibition of invasion requires the extracellular domain of syndecan but not its transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain. Surprisingly, cells bearing a chimera composed of the glypican extracellular domain fused to the syndecan transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains bind to collagen but remain invasive, implying that adhesion to collagen is not by itself sufficient to inhibit invasion. Apparently, the extracellular domain of syndecan-1, presumably by interacting with cell-surface signal transducing molecules, directly regulates complex cell behaviors such as motility and invasiveness. These results also show for the first time that syndecans and glypicans can have distinct functions, even when expressed by the same cell type.

These results also show for the first time that syndecans and glypicans can have distinct functions, even when expressed by the same cell type. Receptors for the extracellular matrix are critical participants in regulating both embryonic development and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. In addition to mediating physical attachment of cells, such receptors can promote intracellular signaling that directs specific alterations in gene expression that are coupled with changes in cell shape, growth, and motility (1Roskelley C.D. Srebrow A. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Changes in the expression and/or activation state of receptors for the extracellular matrix often accompany the progression of pathological states, particularly where cell migration and tissue invasion occur (e.g. inflammatory diseases and cancer) (2Albelda S.M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 4-17PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wahl S.M. Feldman G.M. McCarthy J.B. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The role of integrins in extracellular matrix-associated adhesion and signaling is now well established (4Ruoslahti E. Tumour Biol. 1996; 17: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the role of another class of cell-surface molecules, the heparan sulfate proteoglycans, is less well understood, even though it is clear that these molecules also participate in signaling processes (5Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans belong primarily to two families of molecules, the syndecans and the glypicans, that differ significantly in core protein domain structure (9David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 10Lander A.D. Stipp C.S. Ivins J.K. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 347-358PubMed Google Scholar, 11Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The syndecans have a transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain, whereas the glypicans are anchored to the extracytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). 1The abbreviations used are: GPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolPI-PLCphosphatidylinositol phospholipase CPBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminMOPSO3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acidFGFfibroblast growth factor. Furthermore, the core proteins of syndecans are thought to adopt a highly extended conformation, due to a relatively high proline content (12Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and to have most or all of their heparan sulfate chains attached at positions distal to the plasma membrane, near the N terminus of the core protein (13Kokenyesi R. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12304-12309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the core proteins of glypicans appear to have a largely globular structure and to possess heparan sulfate chains that are attached close to the plasma membrane (10Lander A.D. Stipp C.S. Ivins J.K. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 347-358PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mertens G. Van der Schueren B. Van den Berghe H. David G. J.

Because syndecans and glypicans often coexist on the same cells, it is important to determine whether they perform functions that are similar or distinct. Also unknown is whether individual members of the syndecan family perform different functions. The four family members (designated syndecans 1–4) all have highly related transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, but their extracellular domains show little homology except with regard to the placement and number of some of the heparan sulfate attachment sites. Different members of the syndecan family exhibit tissue-specific expression in adult mice and undergo large changes in expression during development (16Bernfield M. Hinkes M.T. Gallo R.L. Development. 1993; : 205-212PubMed Google Scholar). Most murine cells express at least one member of the syndecan family, and many cells and tissues express multiple syndecans (17Kim C.W.

Syndecans-1, -2, and -4 all bind to basic FGF and support FGF receptor-1 signaling in K562 cells (7Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In contrast, syndecan-4, but not other syndecans, localizes to focal adhesions (18Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

Furthermore, plates coated with the core protein of syndecan-4, but not syndecan-1, are able to mediate adhesion of fibroblasts (20McFall A.J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol.

Whereas syndecan-1 binds to collagen and fibronectin, purified syndecan-3, which is found primarily in neural tissues, apparently does not (21Chernousov M.A. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16810-16814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is at least some evidence for functional differences among syndecans. glycosylphosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid fibroblast growth factor. Given that cells can use syndecan-1 to attach to the extracellular matrix, and given the regulated pattern of expression of syndecans during both development and the progression of tumor cells to the metastatic phenotype, it has been proposed that syndecans are important regulators of the migratory and invasive behaviors of cells, both normal and transformed (22Bernfield M.

Med. 1996; 28: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For example, syndecan-1 expression is lost on epithelial cells undergoing changes in shape and position during development (24Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. Vainio S. Bernfield M. Dev.

Normal murine mammary gland epithelial cells made deficient in syndecan-1 lose their epithelial morphology, become fibroblastic in appearance, and exhibit characteristics of neoplastically transformed cells including anchorage-independent growth and increased invasiveness (30Kato M. Saunders S. Nguyen H. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Transformed epithelial cells having low levels of syndecan-1 expression regain their epithelial morphology and growth characteristics following transfection with the cDNA for syndecan-1 (31Leppa S. Mali M. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, syndecan-1 expression is reduced during malignant transformation, and loss of syndecan-1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in carcinomas of the head and neck (32Inki P. Joensuu H. Grenman R. Klemi P. Jalkanen M. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 70: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 33Pulkkinen J.O. Penttinen M. Jalkanen M. Klemi P. Grenman R. Acta Oto-laryngol. 1997; 117: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have previously used ARH-77 B-lymphoid cells as a model for studying the role of syndecan-1 in regulating adhesion, migration, and growth of tumor cells (34Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol.

Blood. 1998; 91: 2679-2688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line was derived from a human plasma cell leukemia and expresses low amounts of heparan sulfate on the cell surface. ARH-77 cells do not bind to type I collagen and will readily invade into native type I collagen gels, but following their transfection with the cDNA for syndecan-1 they both bind to collagen and are rendered non-invasive on collagen gels (34Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work we have used the ARH-77 cell invasion model to explore structure-function relationships among heparan sulfate proteoglycans, including relationships among syndecans and between syndecans and glypican-1. The DNA fragments containing the full coding sequences of different proteoglycans were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego) (Fig.1), and orientations were confirmed by restriction mapping. The murine syndecan-1 full coding sequence was cleaved from pGEM-3Z-murine syndecan-1 (12Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), subcloned into pBK-CMV phagemid vector (Stratagene, La Jolla) at the EcoRI (5′) andHindIII (3′) sites, and then cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. A tail-less murine syndecan-1 construct designated syn/279t (lacking the coding region for the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain) was generated via oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by creating a stop codon at the position of amino acid 279, leading to truncation of all but one amino acid of the cytoplasmic domain. The pcDNA3 vectors containing the full coding sequence for either rat syndecan-2 or rat syndecan-4 were provided by Dr. John Gallagher (37Kojima T. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,38Pierce A. Lyon M. Hampson I.N. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3894-3900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat glypican-1 full coding sequence was cleaved from pBluescript-glypican-1 (39Litwack E.D. Stipp C.S. Kumbasar A. Lander A.D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3713-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Two constructs encoding chimeric proteoglycans were prepared, one designated syn/glyp, coding for the syndecan-1 extracellular domain and the portion of glypican-1 coding for the GPI-linkage region, the other glyp/syn, containing the glypican-1 extracellular domain and the syndecan-1 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. For the syn/glyp chimera, the cDNAs for both murine syndecan-1 and rat glypican-1 were cloned into pBluescript KS (+) (Stratagene). Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, a unique restriction site,NheI, was inserted between the extracellular domain and the transmembrane domain of the syndecan-1 cDNA (between amino acids 252 and 253). Similarly, an NheI site was also inserted between the extracellular domain and the GPI linkage region of the glypican-1 cDNA (between amino acids 523 and 524). The DNA fragments encoding syndecan-1 and glypican-1 extracellular domains were cleaved from their intact constructs with NotI (5′) andNheI (3′). The syndecan-1 extracellular domain coding sequence was then ligated to the vector, which retained the coding sequence of the glypican-1 GPI linkage region. The sequence of the syn/glyp chimeric construct was confirmed using dideoxy sequencing with Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and the construct was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. For the glyp/syn-1 chimera, anEcoRI DNA fragment containing the full coding region of rat glypican-1 was inserted into pGEM3Z-murine syndecan-1 at theEcoRI site, upstream of the syndecan-1 coding region. The vector DNA containing both glypican-1 and syndecan-1 coding sequences in tandem was digested with BbsI (cut at 1636 base pairs of glypican-1 cDNA) and SfiI (cut at 1027 base pairs of syndecan-1 cDNA) to remove a DNA fragment that contained the 3′ end of glypican-1 (including the GPI anchorage signal) and the 5′ end of syndecan-1 (including extracellular domain and part of transmembrane domain). Two oligonucleotides (the + strand, 5′-cggccgccactcgcccagagcctcacgtgctgggaggtgtcattgccggaggcctagt-3′; the −strand, 5′- aggcctccggcaatgacacctcccagcacgtgaggctctgggcgagtggcg-3′) were annealed to form a short DNA fragment with cohesive ends ofBbsI (5′) and SfiI (3′). This fragment, containing the GPI anchorage signal of glypican-1 and part of the transmembrane domain of syndecan-1, was then ligated into the digested vector to link the glypican-1 extracellular domain in frame with the syndecan-1 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The resulting glyp/syn-1 chimera was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, excised, and cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of the pMV7 vector. In order to clone the glyp/syn chimeric construct into pcDNA3 in the sense orientation, the construct was excised from pMV7, subcloned into pBK-CMV phagemid vector (Stratagene) atEcoRI (5′) and HindIII (3′) sites, and then cloned into pcDNA3. Although the sequence coding for GPI anchorage remains in this construct, the presence of the syndecan-1 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains prevents addition of a GPI anchor and results in a transmembrane proteoglycan. ARH-77 cells were maintained and transfected by electroporation as described previously (34Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the plasmid DNAs containing the full coding sequence for either syndecan-2 or syndecan-4 or by liposome-mediated transfection with the plasmid DNAs containing full-length syndecan-1, syn/279t, glypican-1, or chimeras. For controls, ARH-77 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 plasmid DNA not containing inserted DNA. Liposome-mediated transfection was performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). All transfected cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and geneticin (0.3 mg/ml). Clones of syndecan-2- or syndecan 4-transfected cells were isolated by two limiting dilutions (34Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were analyzed for syndecan-2 or -4 expression by Northern blotting. The transfected cells expressing syndecan-1, syn/279t, glypican-1, or chimeric proteoglycans were isolated by cell sorting using either monoclonal antibody 281.2 against the murine syndecan-1 extracellular domain (40Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) or a polyclonal antibody against the rat glypican-1 extracellular domain (41Litwack E.D. Ivins J.K. Kumbasar A. Paine-Saunders S. Stipp C.S. Lander A.D. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the syn/glyp chimeric proteoglycan is linked to the cell membrane via a GPI linkage, a dot blot assay was used to detect the release of the syndecan-1 extracellular domain following treatment of the cell surface with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Briefly, cells expressing the chimera were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma) and 2.5 units/ml PI-PLC (Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was brought to 6 m urea and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. Equal fractions of the supernatants were loaded onto Gene-Trans membrane (Plasco, Woburn, MA) using an immunoblot apparatus (Milliblot D; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was probed with monoclonal antibody 281.2 (10 μg/ml) in Blotto (3% powdered milk, 0.5% BSA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20, and 0.025% NaN3) followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG (5 μg/ml) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS. Bound antibody was detected using avidin-horseradish peroxidase and color developed with diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories). To confirm that the glyp/syn chimera contained the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain, cells bearing the chimeric proteoglycan were extracted with buffer containing 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mmbenzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 30 min. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were brought to 6 m urea and 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.5, and subjected to dot blotting as described above. The membrane was probed with an antiserum generated against a 7-amino acid peptide corresponding to the 7 C-terminal amino acids that are present within the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain (12Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) followed by a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml) (Vector Laboratories) and color-generated as described above. To compare the levels of core protein present on the glyp/syn and syndecan-1 transfectants, equal numbers of cells were extracted and dot-blotted as described above. After probing blots with the antibody against the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain, blots were scanned, and the relative amounts of core present were determined by analysis using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were extracted as described above and brought to 6 m urea and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. The samples were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged to remove cell debris. DEAE-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) were added to the supernatants, and the mixtures were rotated overnight at 4 °C. The DEAE beads were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the bound proteoglycans eluted from the beads with 1m NaCl in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and were then diluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm CaCl to a final concentration of 0.1 m NaCl. For analysis of core protein size of the syndecan-1 and the syn/glyp chimera, half of each sample was sequentially treated twice with heparitinase (1 milliunits/ml; Seikagaku, Rockville, MD) at 42 °C for 30 min and twice with chondroitinase ABC (50 milliunits/ml) (Seikagaku) at 37 °C for 30 min. Because glypican-1 does not have chondroitin sulfate chains, half of the glypican-1 or glyp/syn sample was treated with heparitinase only. The other half of each sample was left untreated to analyze the intact proteoglycans. All samples were then desalted by passing over excellulose columns (Pierce) and eluted with distilled H2O containing 0.1% SDS. The samples were dried, dissolved in sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.005% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto a 4–12% Tris glycine SDS-PAGE gel (Novex, San Diego). The proteins were transferred to the Gene-Trans membrane in Towbin's buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, containing 0.19 mglycine and 10–20% methanol) using a Semi-Phor semi-dry transfer unit (Hoeffer Scientific, San Francisco). For syndecan-1 and syn/glyp samples, the membrane was probed with the 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody 281.2 (40Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (10 μg/ml) in Blotto and exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR-5 film. For glypican-1 and glyp/syn samples, the membrane was probed with an antisera to glypican-1 (41Litwack E.D. Ivins J.K. Kumbasar A. Paine-Saunders S. Stipp C.S. Lander A.D. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (2.5 μg/ml) in Blotto followed by a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml) and avidin- horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). Bound horseradish peroxidase was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Relative amounts of heparan sulfate present on the various transfectants were determined by flow cytometry of cells stained with 10E4, a monoclonal antibody against heparan sulfate (42David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 cells were harvested by centrifugation and incubated with 10 μg/ml 10E4 (Seikagaku) in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed with medium and then incubated with 5.5 μg/ml biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgM (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min followed by avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories) for 10 min then analyzed by flow cytometry. For comparison of relative core protein amounts, cells expressing the syndecan-1 ectodomain were harvested by centrifugation, incubated with 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody 281.2, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For cells expressing the glypican-1 extracellular domain, cells were incubated with the antisera to glypican-1 (2.5 μg/ml) followed by a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml) and avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The affinities of proteoglycans to collagen were determined using affinity co-electrophoresis as described previously (43Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 44Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly,35SO4-labeled cells that expressed syndecan-1 or glypican-1 were extracted and proteoglycans bound to DEAE beads as described above for Western blotting. The proteoglycans were then eluted with 1 m NaCl in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and diluted with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 0.15 m NaCl. Samples were digested with chondroitinase ABC (50 milliunits/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, desalted by passing over excellulose columns, and eluted from the columns with electrophoresis buffer containing 0.1 m sodium acetate and 50 mm sodium MOPSO (Fluka Biochemika), pH 7.0. The samples (50,000 cpm per gel) were subjected to electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels containing lanes in which rat tail type I collagen had been incorporated at a range of concentrations. Following electrophoresis, the gel was soaked in 5% acetic acid for 4 h and dried with forced warm air. The labeled material was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and plots of radioactivityversus distance from the origin were obtained for each collagen-containing lane using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Because proteoglycan samples were heterogeneous in their affinities for type I collagen, and because it had previously been shown that proteoglycan binding results in an arrest of migration at the start of collagen-containing lanes (44Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bound fraction was quantified as the percentage of radioactivity that had been shifted to within 100 pixels of the origin (representing a mobility less than one-third of that of free proteoglycan in the same gels). Bound fraction (θ) was plotted as a function of collagen concentration and fit to the equation θ = 1/(1 + (Kd/[collagen])2) (44Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 24-well tissue culture plate was coated with 250 μl (per well) of either 0.1% BSA in PBS or 20 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 281.2 in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The coated wells were washed with PBS, blocked with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again with PBS. Cells were then plated on the coated wells (5 × 104 cells per well) in 500 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in medium either with or without 10 μm cytochalasin D (Calbiochem). Clones of syndecan-2- or syndecan-4-transfected cells were isolated by two limiting dilutions and analyzed for specific syndecan expression by Northern blotting (data not shown). All clones expressing syndecan-2 or syndecan-4 bound to type I collagen-coated microtiter wells, whereas the neo-transfected cells failed to bind (data not shown). Cells expressing the proteoglycans, or neo-transfected controls, were plated on the surface of native type I collagen gels, and the distance to the leading front of the invading cells and the percentage of cells invading the gel were quantified as described previously (34Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones expressing syndecan-2 are inhibited from invading gels in a manner similar to syndecan-1 (TableI; relative to neo-transfected cells, expression of syndecan-2 results in an 83% inhibition of cell invasion). Clones expressing syndecan-4 also invade gels poorly but to a greater extent than cells expressing syndecan-1 or syndecan-2 (TableII; relative to neo-transfected cells expression of syndecan-4 results in an 59% inhibition of cell invasion). Thus, multiple members of the syndecan family can inhibit cell invasion.Table IExpression of syndecan-2 inhibits cell invasionTransfectant cloneSyndecan expressionPercent cells invadingDepth of invasionμmA5P3Syn-13.3 ± 0.7509 ± 8.22–2-1Syn-23.1 ± 0.3459 ± 19.32–2-3Syn-23.4 ± 0.1477 ± 17.92–2-5Syn-23.1 ± 0.2482 ± 11.1NeoNegative18.4 ± 0.31345 ± 44.4Clones of transfected cells were isolated and analyzed for syndecan-2 (syn-2) expression by Northern blotting.

(1993) Neuron11, 15–28). NCS-1 has been considered to be expressed only in neurons, but we show that NCS-1 expression can be detected in bovine adrenal chromaffin and PC12 cells, two widely studied model neuroendocrine cells. NCS-1 was present in both cytosolic and membrane fractions including purified chromaffin granules, and in immunofluorescence, its distribution overlapped with peripheral punctate staining seen with the synaptic-like microvesicle marker synaptophysin in PC12 cells. The possible functional role of NCS-1 in exocytosis of dense-core granules was tested using transient transfection in PC12 cells and assay of co-transfected growth hormone (GH) release. Overexpression of NCS-1 increased evoked GH release in intact cells in response to ATP. No effect of overexpression was seen on GH release because of Ca2+ in permeabilized cells suggesting that NCS-1 may have a regulatory but not direct role in neurosecretion.

Regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones during neurosecretion is triggered by a rise in cytosolic Ca2+concentration (1Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).

The site of action of frequenin is not known nor is it known whether it interacts directly with the exocytotic machinery or if it has an indirect regulatory effect on neurotransmission. In addition, it is not known if frequenin functions in exocytosis in non-neuronal cells. Frequenin is a member of a family of related Ca2+-binding proteins. Within this family are two subclasses of proteins. Type A includes proteins such as visinin (12Yamagata K. Goto K. Kuo C.H. Kondo H. Miki N.

Type B includes proteins expressed in neurons such as neurocalcin (15Okazaki K. Watanabe M. Ando Y. Hagiwara M. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

All members of this family possess 2–3 functional Ca2+-binding domains and an N-terminal myristoylation site. Mammalian neurocalcin, hippocalcin, and NCS-1 are expressed in various neuronal classes, and it is clear that NCS-1 is the chicken (17Nef S. Fiumelli H. de Castro E. Raes M.- B. Nef P. J. Recept.

Adrenal chromaffin and PC12 cells have proved to be good models for the study of neurosecretion (4Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). They express many proteins previously believed to be neuron-specific, and exocytosis of dense-core granules in these cells uses the same conserved machinery that functions in synaptic neurotransmission (20Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, addressed the question of whether NCS-1 is expressed in these cell types and exploited PC12 cells for functional analysis of the role of NCS-1. We show here that the mammalian frequenin homologue, NCS-1, is expressed in neuroendocrine cells. Overexpression of NCS-1 resulted in an increase in stimulated exocytosis in intact though not permeabilized PC12 cells implicating frequenin/NCS-1 as a general but indirect regulator of neurosecretion. Bovine chromaffin cells were prepared and cell cultures maintained as described previously (21Burgoyne R.D. Boulton A. Baker G. Taylor C. Neuromethods: Intracellular Messengers. 20. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1992: 433-470Google Scholar). PC12 cell cultures were maintained as described previously (22Graham M.E. Gerke V. Burgoyne R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from whole brain of Wistar rats and cultured chromaffin bovine cells using an RNeasy isolation kit (Qiagen, Surrey, UK), cDNA synthesized with a reverse transcription system, and amplified in PCR reactions using an Omne-E dryblock thermocycler (Hybaid, Middlesex, UK). The primers contained restriction endonuclease sites (underlined) to allow subsequent cloning. The sense and antisense primers used for NCS-1, based on the rat nucleotide sequence (GenBankTM number L27421), were 5′-CATGGATCCATGGGGAAATCCAACAGCAAGT-3′ (BamHI) and 5′-CATGGTACCCTATACCAGCCCGTCGTAGAGG-3′ (KpnI), respectively, and for neurocalcin/hippocalcin, based on the bovine nucleotide sequence of neurocalcin (15Okazaki K. Watanabe M. Ando Y. Hagiwara M. Terasawa M. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), were 5′-GCTGGATCCATGGGAAAAGAGAACAGCAAGC-3′ (BamHI) and 5′-ACTGAAGCTTTCAGAACTGGCCGGCGCTGCTG-3′ (HindIII). For protein expression, the NCS-1 PCR product from rat brain was ligated into the pQE-30 vector to provide an N-terminal His6-tag (Qiagen, Surrey, UK) and transformed into M15 [pREP4] cells. Recombinant protein expression was induced with 500 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h and His6-tagged proteins, after sonication and lysis, purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose by applying a 50–500 mm imidazole gradient. All chromatography was performed at 4 °C using a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. Peak fractions containing recombinant NCS-1 were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the pooled protein was stored at −80 °C. His6-NCS-1 (300 μg) in complete Freund's adjuvant (Pierce, Chester, UK) was injected subcutaneously into a rabbit, followed after 4 weeks by a similar injection in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Pierce, Chester, UK). Bleeds were taken thereafter at 2–4-week intervals after boosting with His6-NCS-1 (300 μg) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 7 days beforehand. Affinity purification was performed by incubating 1 mg of His6-NCS-1 linked to a 0.5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column with unpurified antiserum for 1 h at room temperature. The column was then washed with 50 mm imidazole, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm ATP, 10% glycerol (v/v), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Antibodies were eluted with 3 ml of 5m LiCl in 10 mm KH2PO4at pH 7.2 and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before storage at −80 °C. Bovine adrenal medullae were homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), filtered, and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from this step was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to provide cytosolic (supernatant) and microsomal (pellet) fractions. The pellet from the 17,000 × gcentrifugation contained mitochondria as well as chromaffin granules, and the granules were further purified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min over a 1.7 msucrose cushion. Granule membranes were then prepared by lysis of the granule pellet and washing in 5 mm Hepes, 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.3, to remove content proteins. For fractionation of PC12 cells, cells were homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and nuclei were pelleted at 750 ×g for 5 min. The postnuclear supernatant was loaded on a 0.6–1.8 m sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 6 h (23Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, samples were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose by transverse electrophoresis, and probed as described previously (24Roth D. Morgan A. Martin H. Jones D. Martens G.J.M. Aitken A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with anti-NCS-1 antiserum (1:400). As a control, preimmune serum from the same rabbit was used at the same dilution. Cells were grown in culture on glass coverslips for 3 days before fixation in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. The cells were washed twice in PBS and incubated for 30 min in PBTA (0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.3% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Following this, the cells were incubated with affinity-purified anti-NCS-1 antibody (1:10) or anti-secretogranin II antibody (1:75; a gift from Dr. D. Cutler, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, London) in PBTA for 1 h and washed three times in PBTA. The cells were then incubated in anti-rabbit IgG biotinylated (1:100; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 1 h, washed three times in PBTA followed by a further incubation in streptavidin-Texas Red (1:50; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 30 min. The cells were again washed three times in PBTA, and the coverslip was blotted and allowed to air dry before mounting. For dual labeling of NCS-1 and synaptophysin or NCS-1 and dopamine β-hydroxylase, cells were incubated as above for NCS-1 but with anti-synaptophysin antibody (1:50; Sigma, Dorset, UK) or anti-dopamine β-hydroxylase antibody (1:100; a gift from Dr. D. Apps, Department of Biochemistry, University of Edinburgh) and anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (1:75; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) present in addition to the first and second antibodies, respectively. For transient transfections, the NCS-1 PCR product was directly ligated into the eukaryotic vectors pcDNA 3.1 (−) and pcDNA 3.1 (+) (Invitrogen, The Netherlands) for sense and antisense plasmids, respectively. PC12 cells were maintained in culture in 24-well trays and transiently co-transfected using GH secretion as a marker for transfected cells using 4 μg/well of each plasmid as described previously (25Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After removal of culture medium, cells were treated with or without 300 μm ATP for 15 min or permeabilized for 6 min with 20 μm digitonin (25Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) before challenge with or without Ca2+ for 15 min. Buffer samples and cells were assayed for GH levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim, East Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine whether NCS-1 or the related neuronal Ca2+-binding proteins neurocalcin and hippocalcin are expressed in chromaffin cells we initially used an RT-PCR approach. Primers were designed based on the rat NCS-1 sequence or alternatively based on the bovine neurocalcin sequence. The neurocalcin primers were also predicted to amplify cDNA for hippocalcin. A PCR product of the expected size for NCS-1 (around 600 base pairs) was amplified from rat brain and bovine adrenal chromaffin cell cDNA (Fig.1 A) and confirmed as encoding NCS-1 by cloning and sequencing. In contrast, the bovine neurocalcin/hippocalcin primers gave a weak PCR signal from rat brain cDNA, as predicted because of species differences, but gave no product from bovine chromaffin cell cDNA (Fig. 1 A). These data suggested that NCS-1 but not neurocalcin or hippocalcin is expressed by chromaffin cell cultures. The absence of neurocalcin from mouse chromaffin cells despite its presence in adrenal nerve terminals has been reported (26Iino S. Kobayashi S. Hidaka H. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 289: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The expression of NCS-1 in chromaffin cell cultures and PC12 cells was confirmed using an antiserum raised against recombinant His6-tagged NCS-1. This antiserum recognized recombinant NCS-1 but not recombinant VILIP or neurocalcin (Fig. 1 B). This antiserum labeled a single co-migrating band in immunoblots of rat brain, chromaffin, and PC12 cell homogenates (Fig. 1 C). No polypeptides were detected using a preimmune antiserum. In rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, a well characterized myeloid secretory cell line, no polypeptides were detected by the anti-NCS-1 antiserum (Fig. 1 C). In subcellular fractions from adrenal medulla, NCS-1 was detected in cytosol, and despite the presence of 5 mm EDTA during homogenization and fractionation, was also present in microsomal and to a lesser extent in purified chromaffin granule membrane fractions (Fig. 1 E). Expression of NCS-1 in chromaffin cells in the primary cultures was confirmed by dual label immunofluorescence using affinity-purified anti-NCS-1 and antibodies that recognize the chromaffin granule protein dopamine β-hydroxylase (Fig. 1, F and G). The data from fractionation of adrenal medulla were consistent with NCS-1 expression as a soluble and also a membrane-associated protein. The diffuse localization in chromaffin cells by immunofluorescence would be consistent with such a distribution. In contrast, in PC12 cells in addition to a diffuse cellular staining, anti-NCS-1 also gave a distinct peripheral punctate staining pattern that substantially overlapped with that of the synaptic-like microvesicle vesicle (SLMV) marker synaptophysin (Fig. 2,A and B), suggesting that a portion of the NCS-1 in PC12 cells is present on SLMVs. A marker for dense-core granules in PC12 cells, secretogranin II, gave only a diffuse staining pattern (Fig. 2 C). On sucrose gradient fractionation of PC12 cells, a complex distribution was found that included some overlap with secretogranin II (data not shown), and so it is possible, but not conclusive, that NCS-1 may also be associated with dense-core granules in PC12 cells. To examine a possible function of NCS-1 in control of dense-core granule exocytosis, we tested the effect of its overexpression using the GH transient co-transfection assay in which GH acts as a reporter of exocytosis in only the transfected cells (27Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection with sense NCS-1 plasmid had no effect on total GH levels within the cells 3 days after transfection, but the antisense plasmid used as a control in these experiments markedly reduced cellular GH levels (Fig.3 A). When exocytosis was examined in response to stimulation with ATP to activate purinergic receptors, it was clear that the antisense plasmid had little effect on the extent of GH release, expressed as a percentage of total cellular GH content, but that overexpression of NCS-1 because of transfection with sense plasmid increased the extent of stimulated GH release by around 50% (Fig. 3 B). This increase was reproducible and seen in four separate transfections, the data from which are pooled in Fig. 3 B. Overexpression of NCS-1 had no effect on basal GH release. These results indicate that NCS-1 can act as a positive regulator of the pathway leading to dense-core granule exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells. To examine whether NCS-1 overexpression was because of an effect on an early stage of the pathway activated by ATP or if it could directly increase the extent of exocytosis, GH release was also assayed from digitonin-permeabilized cells that allow analysis of any direct effects on Ca2+- regulated exocytosis. Overexpression of NCS-1 did not affect GH release in the absence of Ca2+ nor in response to Ca2+ over the range of 1–10 μm in permeabilized cells (Fig.4) suggesting that NCS-1 may not act directly on the exocytotic machinery.Figure 4Lack of effect of overexpression of NCS-1 on reporter growth hormone release from permeabilized PC12 cells. Cells were transfected with control or sense NCS-1 plasmid along with GH-encoding plasmid. After 3 days the cells were washed and permeabilized for 6 min by incubation in 20 μm digitonin. The cells were then challenged with 0 (■), 1 (▨), 3(▩), or 10 (▪) μm free Ca2+ and GH release during a 15-min period assayed and expressed as a percentage of total cellular GH levels (n = 3–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has previously been suggested (17Nef S.

Lu B. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that NCS-1 is a neuron-specific protein, but the data presented here show that NCS-1 is also apparently expressed in adrenal chromaffin and PC12 cells, two widely studied model neuroendocrine cells. Sequence comparison of NCS-1 from chicken, rat (17Nef S. Fiumelli H. de Castro E. Raes M.- B. Nef P. J. Recept. Signal Transduct.

Brain Res. 1997; 44: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with frequenin and related proteins has led to the conclusion (18Olafsson P. Soares H.D. Herzog K.-H. Wang T. Morgan J.I. Lu B. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 44: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that NCS-1 should be regarded as the frequenin expressed in these species. We have extended the work on Drosophila and Xenopus frequenin (9Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A.

NCS-1 expression was demonstrated by RT-PCR amplification from chromaffin cell cDNA, and protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence on both chromaffin and PC12 cells. No evidence for neurocalcin or hippocalcin expression in chromaffin cells was found by RT-PCR, and in fact hippocalcin has been shown to have a very restricted distribution in only hippocampal neurons (16Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Miura M. Noguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The antiserum raised against recombinant NCS-1 recognized only a single polypeptide that co-migrated in brain, chromaffin, and PC12 cells. It did not recognize neurocalcin, and no polypeptides were detected in RBL cells, demonstrating its specificity. In addition, we have confirmed NCS-1 expression in chromaffin and PC12 cells using an antiserum raised against a peptide corresponding to the distinct C-terminal sequence of this protein. 2B. W. McFerran, M. E. Graham, and R. D. Burgoyne, unpublished observations. The localization of NCS-1 was complex, being found in cytosolic fractions and in membrane fractions from adrenal medulla including a crude microsomal fraction and also purified chromaffin granule membranes. Other members of this family including neurocalcin (28Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hippocalcin (29Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Saitoh S. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18898-18904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to associate with membranes only in the presence of Ca2+, but NCS-1 was associated with membranes from chromaffin and PC12 cells even when prepared in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. Co-localization of NCS-1 in immunofluorescence with the SLMV marker synaptophysin in PC12 cells suggested its presence on SLMVs. NCS-1 also showed an additional diffuse distribution in PC12 cells. Its complex distribution on subcellular fractionation and sucrose gradients precluded unequivocal demonstration of its presence or absence on dense-core granules. The function of NCS-1 associated with SLMVs remains to be established. The cellular function of NCS-1/frequenin is unknown, but studies inDrosophila and Xenopus strongly suggest that it is a positive regulator of neurotransmitter release and may act as a Ca2+ sensor leading to the facilitation of exocytosis. This role would be consistent with its high level of expression in brain. We have examined the possible role of NCS-1 in dense-core granule exocytosis using transient transfection in PC12 cells. This approach was chosen as any expressed protein should be correctly post-translationally modified and NCS-1 has an N-terminal myristoylation site (17Nef S. Fiumelli H. de Castro E. Raes M.- B. Nef P. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Olafsson P. Soares H.D. Herzog K.-H. Wang T. Morgan J.I. Lu B. Mol.

It has previously been shown that following co-transfection with two plasmids around 90% of the cells expressing GH also express the second protein (30Chung S-H. Takai Y. Holz R.W. J. Biol.

We have also confirmed such a high efficiency of co-expression in our assays using transfected light chain of botulinum neurotoxin C. This neurotoxin inhibited GH release by 95% suggesting that essentially all cells expressing GH also express this second transfected protein. 3R. Fisher and R. D.

Analogous to the overexpression of frequenin in Drosophila, overexpression of NCS-1 increased stimulated release of reporter GH from intact transfected PC12 cells compared with control transfections. In these experiments, we used an antisense NCS-1 construct as an additional control. It would appear unlikely that an antisense plasmid could result in depression of NCS-1 levels within the short time course of this experiment, and so it was surprising that, in the cells transfected with the antisense plasmid, total GH levels were reduced. This may indicate an additional role of NCS-1, but we cannot rule out that this is because of a loss of PC12 cells transfected with antisense NCS-1 rather than a specific effect on GH synthesis. The low percentage of cells (around 5–10% (25Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) that become transfected precludes quantitative analysis of NCS-1 levels within those cells by immunoblotting. The increase in ATP-stimulated GH release from intact PC12 cells was a specific effect as in previous work no effect of plasmids encoding various control proteins or nSec-1 was seen on GH exocytosis (25Graham M.E. Sudlow A.W. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2369-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, the effect of transfection with NCS-1 was specific to intact cells, and no changes were observed in Ca2+-induced GH release after permeabilization of the cells. The data presented here show that NCS-1 is not expressed solely in neurons and for the first time implicate NCS-1/frequenin in the pathway leading to dense-core granule exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells. Studies on neurotransmission in Drosophila have suggested that frequenin may act in the synapse via effects on K+channels (35Poulain C. Ferrus A. Mallart A. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 427: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or the plasma membrane Na+-Ca2+exchanger (10Rivosecchi R. Pongs O. Theil T. Mallart A. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1994; 474: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). NCS-1/frequenin may, therefore, act as a regulator of neurosecretion by effects at the level of plasma membrane channels and pumps, but it has not been possible to exclude a direct effect on the exocytotic machinery. At physiological Mg2+ concentration, Ca2+ binding to NCS-1 is half-maximal at 0.3 μm free Ca2+ (36Cox J.A. Drussel I. Comte M. Nef S. Nef P. Lenz S.E. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32807-32814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it, therefore, shows a much higher Ca2+ affinity than that required for the Ca2+-triggered fusion step in either dense-core granule or synaptic vesicle exocytosis, which requires 10 or 100 s of μm Ca2+, respectively (1Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The data in this study suggest that NCS-1 may not function directly in exocytosis, and the most probable role of NCS-1/frequenin is as a general regulator of neurosecretion via effects on Ca2+ signaling pathways or Ca2+ homeostasis.

Although the exact function of these newly discovered domains is unknown, it is recognized that they may influence enzyme regulation by binding different ligands. In this study, the recombinant PI 4-kinase PH domain was explored for its ability to bind to different phospholipids. First, we isolated partial cDNAs of the >7-kilobase transcripts of PI 4-kinases from carrot (DcPI4Kα) andArabidopsis (AtPI4Kα). The deduced primary sequences were 41% identical and 68% similar to rat and human PI 4-kinases and contained the telltale lipid kinase unique domain, PH domain, and catalytic domain. Antibodies raised against the expressed lipid kinase unique, PH, and catalytic domains identified a polypeptide of 205 kDa in Arabidopsis microsomes and an F-actin-enriched fraction from carrot cells. The 205-kDa immunoaffinity-purified Arabidopsis protein had PI 4-kinase activity. We have used the expressed PH domain to characterize lipid binding properties. The recombinant PH domain selectively bound to phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI-4-P), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2), and phosphatidic acid and did not bind to the 3-phosphoinositides. The PH domain had the highest affinity for PI-4-P, the product of the reaction. Consideration is given to the potential impact that this has on cytoskeletal organization and the PI signaling pathway in cells that have a high PI-4-P/PI-4,5-P2 ratio.

Since the first report of changes in phosphoinositide metabolism in response to light (1Morse M.J. Crain R.C. Satter R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7075-7078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there have been many studies of the metabolism of inositol phospholipids in plants (2Drøbak B.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 3Cote G.G. Crain R.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 39-46Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. Briggs W.R. Heath R.L.

These studies reveal two distinguishing features of phosphoinositide metabolism in higher plants: 1) [3H]PI-4-P 1The abbreviations used are: PI-4-Pphosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphatePI-45-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePI4Kphosphatidylinositol 4-kinasePIphosphatidylinositolPH domainpleckstrin homology domainPLCphospholipase CPI-3-Pphosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphatePI-34-P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphatePAphosphatidic acidPCRpolymerase chain reaction, RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA endskbkilobaseseEF-1αelongation factor-1αPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNBD12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)).1The abbreviations used are: PI-4-Pphosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphatePI-45-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePI4Kphosphatidylinositol 4-kinasePIphosphatidylinositolPH domainpleckstrin homology domainPLCphospholipase CPI-3-Pphosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphatePI-34-P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphatePAphosphatidic acidPCRpolymerase chain reaction, RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA endskbkilobaseseEF-1αelongation factor-1αPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisNBD12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)). is 10–20-fold higher than [3H]PI-4,5-P2, and 2) changes in [3H]PI-4-P are detectable. Conversely, in the most responsive animal systems, the ratio of PI-4-P to PI-4,5-P2 is ∼1:1, and there is only a transient change in PI-4,5-P2, with little to no change in PI-4-P even though inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate may increase 40-fold (5Cunningham E. Thomas G.M.H. Ball A. Hiles I. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 775-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). One explanation that we are exploring for these differences is that the synthesis of PI-4,5-P2 is rate-limiting in plant cells because PI-4-P is sequestered by cytoskeletal or other proteins and not readily available for phosphorylation to PI-4,5-P2 or other metabolic pathways. phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate 5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase phosphatidylinositol pleckstrin homology domain phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate 4-P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate phosphatidic acid polymerase chain reaction, RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends kilobases elongation factor-1α polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)). phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate 5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase phosphatidylinositol pleckstrin homology domain phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate 4-P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate phosphatidic acid polymerase chain reaction, RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends kilobases elongation factor-1α polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)). The first committed step in the biosynthesis of PI-4,5-P2is the phosphorylation of PI by PI 4-kinase to form PI-4-P. PI-4-P is phosphorylated by PI-4-P 5-kinase to form PI-4,5-P2. Biochemically, PI 4-kinase and PI-4-P 5-kinase activities have been studied in plant membranes (6Sommarin M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys.

( Bethesda ). 1997; 115: 864Google Scholar), but the genes encoding PI 4-kinases in plants have remained elusive. A clear distinction between two structurally different isoforms of the PI 4-kinase has emerged from the cloning and sequencing of PI 4-kinase from yeast (14Flanagan C.A. Schnieders E.A. Emerick A.W.

The two isoforms differ in size, amino acid sequence homology, and putative location and function within the cell. The smaller type encodes a polypeptide of ∼110–125 kDa that is found in the cytosol and is associated with the Golgi apparatus (22Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The second type encodes a larger protein of ∼200–230 kDa that is membrane-associated (19Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of the group of higher molecular mass PI 4-kinases is that they contain putative PH domains. PH domains are poorly conserved protein modules of ∼100 amino acids in length (23Shaw G. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 24Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M.

Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These motifs exist in proteins that associate with membranes during signal transduction. PH domains bind a variety of ligands ranging from other signal transduction proteins such as G-protein βγ subunits (27Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to polyphosphorylated inositol lipids (28Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.-F. Wang L.-P. Liu S.-M. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) bind to inositol phospholipids. The affinity of PH domains for PI-4-P, PI-4,5-P2, PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate varies with the type of protein (32Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This means that rapid cellular changes in the levels of the inositol phospholipids could affect the location and regulation of specific PH domain-containing proteins. Identifying PH domains and their ligand affinities should increase the understanding of how a protein is regulated. The PH domains of the PI 4-kinases have been described based only on primary sequence homology with other PH domains and have not been characterized biochemically. Here we show biochemical and molecular evidence for a large molecular mass PI 4-kinase in both carrot (DcPI4Kα) andArabidopsis (AtPI4Kα), and we show for the first time the affinity of a PI 4-kinase PH domain for specific phosphoinositides. The active enzyme was purified using antibodies raised against the expressed conserved domains. The molecular mass of the PI 4-kinase was estimated to be 205 kDa based on Western blot analysis of the purified protein. Western blots also indicated thatDcPI4Kα is associated with an F-actin fraction. More important, using a new technique, Fat Western blotting, we determined that the recombinant carrot PI 4-kinase PH domain binds specifically to phosphatidic acid (PA), PI-4-P, and PI-4,5-P2. The lipid binding data give new insights into potential mechanisms for regulating PI 4-kinase activity and its distribution. Total RNA was extracted from carrot cells grown in suspension culture (33Chen Q. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1990; 94: 1820-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by hot borate/phenol/chloroform extraction (34Hall T.C. Ma Y. Buchbinder B.U. Pyne J.W. Sun S.M. Bliss F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3196-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 35Perera I. Zielinski R. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 100: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and primed with random hexamers (Boehringer Mannheim) as described (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Amplification of cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction was achieved with degenerate oligonucleotides deduced from conserved amino acid sequences of known PI 4-kinases. The conserved regions were used by Nakagawa et al. (19Nakagawa T. Goto K. Kondo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12088-12094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to clone the rat PI 4-kinase. The sequences of these regions are (V/T)GDDCRQ and HIDFGF(M/V). Arabidopsis codon usage was followed to design the degenerate primers, and EcoRI sites were added to the 5′-ends of the primers to facilitate subcloning of PCR products into pBluescript (Stratagene). The sequences of the primers, using the International Union of Biochemistry code for degeneracy, were CGG AAT TCR YTG GWG AYG AYT GYC GTC AR for the sense primer and CGG AAT TCN ATR AAW CCR AAR TCD ATR TG for the antisense primer. The PCRs containing 10 μl of the cDNA synthesis mixture, 20–25 pmol of each primer, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) were amplified by 25 cycles of the following: 97 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were resolved by agarose gel (1%, w/v) electrophoresis, gel-purified, digested with EcoRI, and subcloned into pBluescript. Sequence of the cDNA was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). After determining the sequence of the PCR product, gene-specific primers were used to amplify cDNA 3′ and 5′ to the original PCR product by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method exactly as described previously (38Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The ArabidopsisPI 4-kinase was cloned by using the carrot 5′-RACE product as a probe to screen an Arabidopsis λYES cDNA library (a gift of Dr. Ralph Dewey, North Carolina State University). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and random hexamers. The plated library (3 × 106 clones) was hybridized to the carrot cDNA at 55 °C for 16 h in hybridization buffer containing 6× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA (SSPE; 1× SSPE = 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 149 mm NaCl) and 5× Denhardt's solution (100× Denhardt's solution = 2% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2% (w/v) Ficoll 400, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg of calf thymus DNA (Sigma)). The final wash was in 1× SSPE and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 55 °C for 1 h. The nylon membrane was exposed to x-ray film for 24 h at −80 °C. Two hybridization-positive clones were carried through three successive screens. The larger clone was 2.5 kb and was used as a probe to screen an Arabidopsis λZap II cDNA library that had been selected for large cDNAs (39Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldman K. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Again, two positive clones were carried through three sequential screening steps, and the largest clone (3.1 kb) was analyzed for its complete sequence by the Iowa State Sequencing Facility. Total RNA was fractionated by formaldehyde-containing agarose gel electrophoresis (40Zielinski R.E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1987; 84: 937-943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred by capillary transfer and UV-cross-linked to nylon membrane and then hybridized with the Arabidopsis cDNA labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was at 42 °C in hybridization buffer containing 50% (v/v) formamide. The final wash of the blot was in 0.1× SSPE and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. The nylon was then exposed to x-ray film for 3 days at −80 °C. A cDNA encoding the carrot PI 4-kinase PH domain was generated by PCR amplification with primers that flanked either end of the domain sequence. The sequences of the primers were CGG GAT CCC CCC TGG TTA GGC AAC ACA TT (sense) and GGA ATT CCA ACC TTG AAA ACG CAA GCT T (antisense). The primers contained BamHI (sense primer) and EcoRI (antisense primer) sites on their 5′-ends to facilitate directional subcloning into the bacterial expression vector pRSET-A (Invitrogen). The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with BamHI andEcoRI, and ligated into pRSET-A. BL21(DE3) pLys S cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid, and expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration) to the cell culture. Bacterial cells expressing the His-tagged PH domain were lysed by sonication and solubilized in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and the recombinant polypeptide was purified by metal affinity chromatography using ProBond resin (Invitrogen). Because the PH domain was insoluble, purification was carried out under denaturing conditions with solutions containing 8 m urea. Column fractions were dialyzed sequentially to remove urea and to promote refolding. Tomato eEF-1α (a gift from Christine K. Shewmaker, Calgene Inc.) was expressed and purified using the same protocol. Total microsomes were prepared from carrot suspension culture cells 5 days after transfer or from whole Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Suspension culture cells were filtered by gravity and homogenized in an equal volume of buffer containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 95 mm LiCl, 2 mm EGTA, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (0.1 g/g of cells), 8% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/100 ml leupeptin, and 2 mm benzamidine. Homogenization was with an equal volume of 0.2-mm glass beads in a Virtis homogenizer in 30-s pulses for 2 min at 4 °C. Arabidopsis plants were coarsely macerated and ground in a Virtis homogenizer with an equal volume of buffer containing 3 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 30 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/100 ml leupeptin, and 2 mm benzamidine. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 60 min to obtain a microsomal fraction. Microsomes were resuspended in 30 mm Tris (pH 7.4). F-actin-rich fractions were prepared from the microsomal fraction isolated from 5-day-old carrot suspension culture cells as described previously (10Tan Z. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 100: 2116-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PCR was used to amplify the reading frame of the largest AtPI4Kα clone. The primers used were CGG GAT CCG TTC AGT CAC ATA TAT TAG AA (sense) and G GAA TTC TTA CTT CTC GAT GCC TTG (antisense). An internalBamHI site 45 nucleotides upstream of the region encoding the lipid kinase unique domain and the EcoRI site of the antisense primer allowed the PCR product to be digested with these two enzymes, purified, and ligated into pRSET-B. Expression and purification of the recombinant protein were exactly the same as for the recombinant PH domain described above, except that the protein was not dialyzed. Instead it was concentrated in a Centricon 10 (Amicon, Inc.), and resolved by SDS-PAGE so that ∼50 μg of recombinant protein were present in each lane of the gel. The gel was stained with 0.05% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in water and washed copiously with water until the bands were visible. The bands containing the recombinant protein were excised from the gel and sent to Zeneca LifeScience Molecules for injection into two rabbits (662 and 663). The rabbits were given seven boosts of the recombinant protein over the course of 3 months. Sera from test bleeds and production bleeds were analyzed for cross-reactivity to the recombinant protein by immunoblotting (data not shown). Antiserum from test bleed 2 of rabbit 662 was purified for IgG on a protein A-Sepharose column (Sigma). Unspecific and His tag-generated antibodies were removed by incubating the purified IgG with an acetone precipitate of E. coli cells expressing His-tagged eEF-1α and removing the aggregates by centrifugation (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A protein A-Sepharose-antibody affinity column was made by direct coupling with dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma) as described previously (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Production bleed antisera from both rabbits (0.5 ml total) were pooled and added to 1 ml of protein A-Sepharose beads in 30 mm Tris (pH 7.4). After coupling the antibody to the beads, the column was washed with 20 bed volumes of 30 mm Tris (pH 8.0). The efficiency of coupling of antibody to protein A beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after the addition of dimethyl pimelimidate. Heavy chain IgG bands were present at 55 kDa before coupling, but not after. Arabidopsis microsomes (12.5 mg) were solubilized for 30 min at 4 oC in buffer used to solubilize cytoskeletal proteins (2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 μg/ml leupeptin, and 670 μg/ml DNase I) (42Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1992Google Scholar). Solubilized microsomes were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with antibody-coupled beads in a 10 × 33-mm column resuspended in 1 bed volume of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4) at 4 °C with shaking for 2 h. The bed was allowed to settle, and the flow-through fraction was collected. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4). In addition, to prepare the column for elution and to ensure adequate washing, the column was washed with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) until the flow-through fraction had a spectrophotometric absorbance reading of <0.010 at 280 nm. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 3.0). Fractions of 1 bed volume were collected, immediately neutralized with 0.05 volume of 1m phosphate (pH 8.0), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and for PI 4-kinase activity. Each fraction eluted from the immunoaffinity column was assayed in duplicate (60 μl/assay) to determine the PI 4-kinase activity. The reaction mixture contained final concentrations of 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 0.5 mg/ml PI, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.9 mmATP, 30 mm Tris (pH 7.2), and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) in a total volume of 100 μl. Stock PI (5 mg/ml) was solubilized in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h with intermittent shaking. The reactions were stopped with 1.5 ml of ice-cold CHCl3/MeOH (1:2) and kept at 4 °C until the lipids were extracted. Lipids were extracted as described previously (9Cho M.H. Shears S.B. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1993; 103: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Extracted lipids were vacuum-dried, solubilized in CHCl3/MeOH (2:1), and spotted onto Whatman LK5D silica gel plates that had been completely dried in a microwave oven for 5 min after presoaking in 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate for 80 s. The lipids were separated in either a CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH/H2O (86:76:6:16) solvent system (9Cho M.H. Shears S.B. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1993; 103: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or a borate/pyridine-based solvent (43Walsh J.P. Caldwell K.K. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9184-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and quantitated with a Bioscan System 500 Imaging Scanner. The plates were subsequently exposed to a phosphor screen for 2 days and visualized by a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Carrot microsomes were solubilized in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 4 °C overnight. To preclear unspecific antibodies and antigens, solubilized microsomes were incubated for 1 h on ice with 0.2 volume of preimmune serum from rabbit 662. 0.33 volume of protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with shaking. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was saved and used for subsequent steps. Immunoprecipitation, as described previously (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), was carried out by adding to the supernatant either preimmune serum or partially purified antiserum from test bleed 2 of rabbit 662 (described above). The protein A-antibody-antigen complex was washed three times with 30 mm Tris (pH 7.2) and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for subsequent analysis by electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE using 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (44Bjerrum O.J. Schafer-Nielsen C. Dunn M.J. Analytical Electrophoresis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1986: 315Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated for 1 h with anti-AtPI4Kα antiserum (1:1000) at 25 °C. Cross-reactivity was detected by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG, F(ab′)2 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce), and subsequent chemiluminescent detection by exposing the blot to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for the amount of time indicated. Phospholipids were from Sigma, except for PI-3-P and PI-3,4-P2, which were from Matreya, Inc., and NBD-labeled PA, NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine, and rhodamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine, which were from Avanti Polar Lipids. Phospholipids were solubilized in chloroform as stock solutions of 1 mg/ml. A minimum of 10 μl containing 0.5, 1.0, or 5.0 μg of lipid were spotted onto nitrocellulose (NitroBind, MSI) at a time. The membrane and lipids were dried at 24 °C for 1 h. The nitrocellulose was incubated with 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (isolated by cold ethanol precipitation; Sigma A-6003) in TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h and then placed in a solution containing the His-tagged fusion proteins (PH domain or eEF-1α) diluted in TBST (0.5 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight with shaking. The nitrocellulose was washed with TBST three times for 10 min each and then incubated with T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen) to the His-tagged region diluted 1:10,000 in TBST for 1 h at 24 °C. The nitrocellulose was washed three times for 10 min in TBST at 24 °C and then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) at a titer of 1:30,000 in TBST for 1 h at 24 °C. The nitrocellulose was washed again in TBST three times for 10 min and then incubated for 5 min in a 1:1 mixture of peroxidase substrate and luminol/enhancer (Pierce) for subsequent c"
https://openalex.org/W2052650131,"The two isoforms of the mammalian mitochondrial phosphate carrier (PiC), A and B, differing in the sequence near the N terminus, arise from alternative splicing of a primary transcript of the PiC gene (Dolce, V., Iacobazzi, V., Palmieri, F., and Walker, J. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10451–10460). To date, the PiC isoforms A and B have not been studied at the protein level. To explore the tissue-distribution and the potential functional differences between the two isoforms, polyclonal site-directed antibodies specific for PiC-A and PiC-B were raised, and the two bovine isoforms were obtained by expression in Escherichia coliand reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. Western blot analysis demonstrated that isoform A is present in high amounts in heart, skeletal muscle, and diaphragm mitochondria, whereas isoform B is present in the mitochondria of all tissues examined. Heart and liver bovine mitochondria contained 69 and 0 pmol of PiC-A/mg of protein, and 10 and 8 pmol of PiC-B/mg of protein, respectively. In the reconstituted system the pure recombinant isoforms A and B both catalyzed the two known modes of transport (Pi/Pi antiport and Pi/H+ symport) and exhibited similar properties of substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity. However, they strongly differed in their kinetic parameters. The transport affinities of isoform B for phosphate and arsenate were found to be 3-fold lower than those of isoform A. Furthermore, the maximum transport rate of isoform B is about 3-fold higher than that of isoform A. These results support the hypothesis that the sequence divergence between PiC-A and PiC-B may have functional significance in determining the affinity and the translocation rate of the substrate through the PiC molecule.

The transport of inorganic phosphate across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the matrix compartment is essential for the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.

In the reconstituted system the native bovine PiC protein catalyzes the Pi/H+symport as well as the Pi/Pi exchange, which functions by a sequential mechanism (5Stappen R. Krämer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11240-11246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of the mature PiC is made up of three tandemly related domains about 100 amino acids in length (6Runswick M.J. Powell S.J. Nyren P. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1367-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These repetitive elements are related to those found in the other well characterized members of the mitochondrial carrier family (see Refs. 7Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg.

They are also found in a number of other proteins of known sequence but of unknown function, which therefore belong to the same protein superfamily (7Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg.

Frontiers of Cellular Bioenergetics: Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Physiopathology. Plenum, New York London1998Google Scholar). By examination of the transmembrane topography of the PiC in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it has been proposed that both the N- and C-terminal regions of the PiC protrude toward the cytosol and that the polypeptide chain spans the membrane six times (13Palmieri F. Bisaccia F. Capobianco L. Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Iacobazzi V. Zara V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Only one gene for the PiC has been detected in man and cow (14Dolce V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10451-10460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of which the human one has been localized to chromosome 12q23 (15Marsh S. Carter N.P. Dolce V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Genomics. 1995; 29: 814-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In both man and cow two closely related exons named IIIA and IIIB appear to be alternatively spliced (14Dolce V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10451-10460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alternative splicing mechanism affects amino acids 4–45 of the mature PiC. More recently, by Northern blot analysis, isoform A has been found to be limited to heart and skeletal muscle, whereas isoform B is expressed in all tissues examined (16Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). phosphate carrier isoform A of the phosphate carrier isoform B of the phosphate carrier polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline. The biochemical characterization of potential functional differences between isoforms A and B of the mitochondrial PiC has so far been precluded by the lack of a purification procedure for separating the two isoforms. Similarly, tissue distribution studies of PiC-A and PiC-B at the protein level have been prevented by the lack of specific antibodies. We therefore raised antibodies against PiC isoforms A and B and produced two recombinant proteins that have either the PiC-A or the PiC-B sequence. In this study we demonstrate that the two PiC isoforms are tissue-specific, and that the two recombinant isoforms exhibit different transport affinities (Km) and specific activities (Vmax) after purification and reconstitution into liposomes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a functional comparison of mitochondrial carrier isoforms has been performed. The coding regions for the mature bovine PiC isoforms A and B were amplified from 10 ng of bovine heart cDNA (isoform A) and bovine liver cDNA (isoform B), respectively, by 30 cycles of polymerase chain reactions. The forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers employed in these reactions corresponded to nucleotides 444–453 linked to 1770–1781 (forward primer A), 444–453 linked to 2051–2062 (forward primer B), and 5955–5978 (reverse primers A and B) of the bovine PiC gene sequence (14Dolce V. Iacobazzi V. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10451-10460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward and reverse primers carried NdeI and XhoI restriction sites as linkers, respectively. The absence of the stop codon in the reverse primer sequences led to the expression of the two PiC isoforms with an extra leucine and glutamic acid, encoded by the XhoI restriction site sequence, plus a tail of six histidines at their C terminus. The reaction products were cloned in the expression vector pET21b, and their sequences were verified by the modified dideoxy chain termination method (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). The expression of PiC-A and PiC-B as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytosol was accomplished in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3), as described first for the bovine oxoglutarate carrier (18Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and then for several other mitochondrial carriers (11Palmieri L. De Marco V. Iacobazzi V.

Control cultures containing the empty pET21b vector were processed in parallel. Purified inclusion bodies (18Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), were solubilized in 1.67% (w/v) N-dodecanoylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) for 5 min at 0 °C. The solution was diluted 20 times with SSP buffer consisting of 0.1% Sarkosyl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Pi, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was chromatographed on Ni+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column (Quiagen). Unspecifically bound proteins were washed with the SSP buffer supplemented with increasing concentrations of histidine. Pure PiC isoforms A and B were recovered when histidine reached 10 mm. The purified proteins were desalted by a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10 Pharmacia) and stored at −70 °C. All chromatographic steps were performed at 4 °C. Purified PiC-A and PiC-B isoforms were reconstituted by cyclic removal of the detergent with a hydrophobic column (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The composition of the initial mixture used for reconstitution was 200 μl of purified PiC isoform (about 400 ng of protein), 100 μl of 10% Triton X-114, 90 μl of 10% phospholipids in the form of sonicated liposomes (1Bisaccia F. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), 30 mm Pi (except where otherwise indicated), 20 mm Pipes (pH 6.5), 0.63 mg of cardiolipin (Sigma), and water to a final volume of 700 μl. After vortexing, this mixture was recycled 13 times through an Amberlite column (Fluka) (3.2 × 0.5 cm) preequilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Pipes (pH 6.5) and the substrate at the same concentration as in the starting mixture. All operations were performed at 4 °C, except the passages through Amberlite, which were carried out at room temperature. The reconstituted Pi/Pi antiport activity was determined by measuring the uptake (forward exchange) or the efflux (backward exchange) of [33P]phosphate in exchange for unlabeled substrate (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For backward exchange measurements, as well as for measuring the efflux of phosphate as a Pi/H+symport, the proteoliposomes containing internal Pi were prelabeled, immediately after reconstitution, by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration, i.e. by adding carrier-free [33P]phosphate of high specific radioactivity for 20 min. The external substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on a Sephadex G-75 column (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) in the presence of a reversible inhibitor, 5 μm p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (23Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), in order to avoid the efflux of internal substrate by the Pi/H+ symport. Transport was started by adding 5 mm dithioerythritol and labeled Pi at the indicated concentrations (forward exchange), 5 mmdithioerythritol and 30 mm cold Pi (backward exchange), or 5 mm dithioerythritol alone (Pi/H+ symport). In all cases the carrier-mediated transport was terminated by addition of 25 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (23Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In control samples the inhibitor was added at time 0 according to the inhibitor stop method (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The assay temperature was 25 °C. All transport measurements were carried out at the same internal and external pH value of 6.5. Finally, the external substrate was removed, and the radioactivity in the liposomes was measured (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In forward exchange kinetic measurements, the initial transport rate was calculated in millimoles/min/g of protein from the time course of isotope equilibration, as has been published previously (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the case of backward exchange and Pi/H+ symport, the decrease in radioactivity inside the liposomes was fitted to the equation α = 100(1 − e −kt ) (where α is the percentage of isotopic equilibration) (24Schroers A. Krämer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The rates were expressed as apparent velocities, i.e. the product ofk and the substrate concentration inside the liposomes, and they are directly proportional to the actual transport rate (22Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,24Schroers A. Krämer R. Wohlrab H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10558-10564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The antisera anti-PiC-A and anti-PiC-B were raised against the amino acid sequences 1–10 of the mature bovine PiC-A and 7–16 of the mature bovine PiC-B, respectively. The synthesis of peptides, the coupling to ovalbumin of the first peptide through Tyr-6 or Tyr-10, and of the second one through Cys-7, as well as the generation of the antibodies were carried out as described previously (25Bisaccia F. Capobianco L. Brandolin G. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3705-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Samples, solubilized in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, were separated by SDS-PAGE (as described in Capobianco et al. (26Capobianco L. Bisaccia F. Mazzeo M. Palmieri F.

The membranes were incubated with the antiserum anti-PiC-A or the antiserum anti-PiC-B (each diluted 1:40,000 in PBS-TM (PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) non-fat dried milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20)) for 2 h, washed three times in PBS-TM for 10 min each, and then incubated for 2 h with the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) diluted 1:2000 in PBS-TM. The membranes were washed and developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The films were scanned with an LKB 2202 Ultroscan laser densitometer. To determine the amount of PiC-A and PiC-B in mitochondria, standard calibration curves were constructed using 5–30 ng pure recombinant PiC-A or PiC-B as the standard. Nitrocellulose membranes containing the standards and the mitochondrial samples were simultaneously immunodecorated as described above. Once it was checked that mitochondrial sample loading was within the linear range of the calibration curves, the densitometric signal intensity was used to measure the amount of PiC-A and PiC-B (27Pardridge W.M. Boado R.J. Farrell C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18035-18040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dyer J. Barker P.J. Shirazi-Beechey S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue dye or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, stained with Coomassie Blue dye, and their N-terminal sequences determined with a pulsed liquid protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 477A). The pure recombinant PiC isoforms were estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels with an LKB 2202 Ultroscan laser densitometer, using carbonic anhydrase as protein standard. To assay the protein incorporated into liposomes, the vesicles were passed through a Sephadex G-75 column, centrifuged at 300,000 ×g for 30 min and delipidated with organic solvents as described in Capobianco et al. (26Capobianco L. Bisaccia F. Mazzeo M. Palmieri F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8974-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Then, the SDS-solubilized protein was determined by comparison with carbonic anhydrase in SDS gels and/or by quantitative immunodecoration (as described above) with the antiserum anti-PiC-A and the antiserum anti-PiC-B. The sequence divergence between isoforms A and B of PiC is confined to the N-terminal region of the PiC protein and is precisely localized between amino acids 4–45 of the mature protein corresponding to exons III A and III B of the PiC gene (Fig.1). The isolation of the cDNA clones encoding PiC isoforms A and B (see “Experimental Procedures”) created the possibility to produce, in bacteria, homogeneous A and B isoforms of PiC, which could be used to explore the functional differences between the two isoforms. To this end, PiC-A and PiC-B isoforms were expressed in E. coli,purified, and refolded into the active form using a pET expression system and the Sarkosyl refolding procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” After induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, PiC-A and PiC-B accumulated in the bacterial cytosol as inclusion bodies (Fig. 2,A and B, lane 1). The presence of the histidine tail at the C-terminal end of the expressed PiC isoforms allowed their purification by a Ni+-agarose affinity column (Fig. 2, A andB, lane 5). About 2 mg of each isoform were obtained per liter of bacterial culture. The identity of PiC-A and PiC-B was confirmed by the determination of their N-terminal sequences, and by their reaction with specific antisera, as shown in Fig.3.Figure 3Tissue specificity of PiC isoforms A and B explored by Western blot analysis. 150 μg of mitochondria isolated from various bovine tissues and 0.2 μg of purified PiC-A and PiC-B were run on SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting, the nitrocellulose sheets were treated with the anti-PiC-A antiserum (panel A) or the anti-PiC-B antiserum (panel B). Lanes A, recombinant PiC-A; lanes B, recombinant PiC-B; lanes H–K, mitochondria from heart (H), diaphragm (D), skeletal muscle (SM), liver (L), lung (Lu), brain (Br), and kidney (K). The autoradiography films were exposed for 15 s (panel A) or 60 min (panel B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To prepare antisera specific for PiC-A and PiC-B, we first raised antibodies against three synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 1–10 and 8–17 of PiC-A, and residues 7–16 of PiC-B. Only the antibodies generated by using the latter two peptides were found, at the dilution used in this work, to be highly specific for PiC-A and PiC-B, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes A and B). We then investigated the presence of the two PiC isoforms in the mitochondria of several bovine tissues by Western blotting. Fig. 3 A shows that the antiserum specific for PiC-A immunodecorated a band of 34 kDa in the lysates of heart, diaphragm, and skeletal muscle, but none in the lysates of liver, lung, brain, and kidney. On the contrary, the antiserum specific for PiC-B (Fig. 3 B) reacted with a band of 34 kDa in the mitochondrial lysates of all the tissues investigated. These results indicate that the PiC-A isoform is present only in muscles, whereas the PiC-B isoform is present in all the mitochondria tested. It should be noted that the autoradiography films were exposed for 15 s in the case of the immunoblotting with anti-PiC-A antiserum (Fig. 3 A) and 60 min in the case of the immunoblotting with the anti-PiC-B antiserum (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the expression levels of PiC-A in mitochondria of heart, skeletal muscle, and diaphragm are much higher than those of PiC-B in the mitochondria of all the tissues. Furthermore, no immunoreaction was observed with the anti-PiC-A antiserum and the lysates of liver, lung, brain, and kidney when the exposure time was prolonged to 60 min. To quantify PiC-A and PiC-B levels in mitochondria, various amounts of mitochondrial samples were loaded onto the gel and immunoblotted simultaneously with the appropriate range of recombinant PiC-A and PiC-B standards (see “Experimental Procedures”). In four determinations, the abundance of PiC isoforms was calculated to be 69 ± 13 pmol/mg of protein of PiC-A in heart mitochondria, and 10 ± 2 and 8 ± 1 pmol/mg of protein of PiC-B in heart and liver mitochondria, respectively. For kinetic analysis of the two PiC isoforms the reconstitution procedure has been optimized by adjusting the parameters that influence the efficiency of carrier incorporation into the liposomes. With both isoforms optimal transport activity was obtained with 0.6 μg/ml and 12.8 mg/ml protein and phospholipid concentration, respectively, with a Triton X-114/phospholipid ratio of 1.1 and with 13 passages through the same Amberlite column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Furthermore, since cardiolipin has been shown to be essential for the reconstitution of purified PiC (1Bisaccia F. Palmieri F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 386-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Kadenbach B. Mende P. Kolbe H.V.J. Stipani I. Palmieri F.

FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of this phospholipid on reconstitution of the two recombinant PiC isoforms. Fig.4 shows that the activity of both isoforms was increased 5-fold by optimal concentrations of cardiolipin and that isoform B was more active than isoform A at all cardiolipin concentrations applied (at 1 and 0.33 mm external phosphate for PiC-A and PiC-B, respectively). The different external Pi concentrations used for the two isoforms were chosen according to the Km values of PiC-A and PiC-B (see below) to accomplish comparable conditions in kinetic terms for the two isoforms. The clear stimulation of the activity of the two isoforms by low concentrations of cardiolipin (<5%) contrasts with the lack of effect observed with PiC purified from bovine heart (23Stappen R. Krämer R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a difference probably due to the absence of cardiolipin in the recombinant PiC isoforms. Kinetic constants were determined for pure recombinant PiC-A and PiC-B over a wide range of Pi concentrations from a standard double-reciprocal set of experiments (see Table I). The transport affinities (Km) for Pi on the external membrane surface of the reconstituted PiC-A and PiC-B isoforms, measured by the forward exchange method, were determined to be 2.21 ± 0.15 and 0.78 ± 0.02 mm for PiC-A and PiC-B, respectively. The specific activities of recombinant PiC-A and PiC-B (Vmax) were 125 ± 18 and 349 ± 22 mmol/min/g of protein for PiC-A and PiC-B, respectively. These activities were calculated by taking into account the amount of PiC isoforms recovered in the proteoliposomes after reconstitution. Under our experimental conditions the inserted protein varied between 14 and 20% of the protein added to the reconstitution mixture. Furthermore, no difference in the efficiency of reconstitution (i.e. the share of successfully incorporated protein) was observed between PiC-A and PiC-B.Table IKinetic constants of recombinant PiC-A and PiC-B isoformsPiCForward exchange measurementsBackward exchange measurementsPi/Pi antiportVmaxPi/Pi antiport externalKmPi/Pi antiport external KiPi/Pi antiport internal KmPi/H+ symport internal Kmmmol · min−1 · g protein−1mmmmPiC-A125 ± 18 (6)aValues given are means ± S.D.

In this report, we have shown that Ke 6 is a 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and can regulate the concentration of biologically active estrogens and androgens. The Ke 6 enzyme is preferentially an oxidative enzyme and inactivates estradiol, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone. However, the enzyme has some reductive activity and can synthesize estradiol from estrone. We find that the Ke 6 gene is expressed within the ovaries and testes. The presence of Ke 6 protein within the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte places it in a strategic location to control the level of steroids to which the egg is exposed. Previously, it had been shown that glucocorticoids can induce renal cysts in the neonatal rodent, only when given at a narrow time window of postnatal kidney development. We propose that the reduction in the level of Ke 6 enzyme, which occurs in the cpk, jck, andpcy mice, may lead to abnormal elevations in local level of sex steroids, which either directly or indirectly via abnormal glucocorticoid metabolism result in recessive renal cystic disease, a developmental disorder of the kidney.

The inhibition of the Ke 6 gene expression using antisense deoxyoligonucleotides in embryonic kidneys in organ cultures gives rise to numerous cysts against a background of normal nephrogenesis (5Aziz N. Nearing J. Kreidberg J. Donovan M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6: 690Google Scholar, 6Aziz N. Donovan M. Fejes-Toth A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1743Google Scholar). Importantly, the human Ke 6 gene is located on chromosome 6p21 (7Kikuti Y. Ando A. Tamiya G. Kimura M. Ferreira E. Tsuji K. Trowsdale J. Inoko H. Genomics. 1997; 42: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) where the human autosomal recessive PKD mutation has been mapped (8Zerres K. Mucher G. Bachner L. Deschennes G. Eggermann T. Kaarriainen H. Knapp M. Lennert T. Misselwitz J. Muhlendahl K. Neumann H. Pirson Y. Rudnik-Schoneborn S. Steinbeck V. Wirth B. Scharer K. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and therefore there is a possibility that the Ke 6 gene is the primary mutation in autosomal recessive PKD.

Maxwell M. St.-Jacques B. Brenner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and protein (4Aziz N. Brown D Lee W.S. Fejes-Toth Aniko Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5581-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) has been extensively characterized in our laboratory.Our earlier data base searches with the Ke 6 sequence showed that it belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (1Aziz N. Maxwell M. St.-Jacques B. Brenner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At that time, Ke 6 was most similar to bacterial oxidoreductases with no close similarity to any mammalian oxidoreductase in the data base, leaving the exact function of Ke 6 unknown. Recently, we searched the data base again with Ke 6 and found it is similar to 17βHSD4 (9Leenders F. Adamski J. Husen B. Thole H. Jungblut P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine Ke 6 for 17βHSD activity with various androgen and estrogen substrates.As reported here, we find that Ke 6 protein is an NAD-dependent 17βHSD, making it the seventh member of this class of enzyme. It efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of estradiol, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone and also the reduction of estrone to form biologically active estradiol. The identification of the substrate of Ke 6 allows us to postulate that regulated sex steroid metabolism plays a crucial role in the development of the mammalian kidney, and aberrations in this regulation leads to developmental problems. We propose that the developing kidney is affected by abnormal estrogen/androgen metabolism or by abnormal glucocorticoid metabolism, which could occur as a consequence of elevated sex steroid levels. Estrogen levels have been implicated in the inhibition of 11βHSD enzyme in a study by Low et al. (10Low S. Assaad S. Rajan K. Chapman K. Edwards C. Seckl J. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 139: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), where it was determined that gonadectomy of the normal female mouse stimulated the expression of the 11βHSD1 gene and estradiol replacement inhibited its activity. Elevated levels of estrogens and androgens in thecpk/cpk kidney could result in a defect in glucocorticoid metabolism by the inhibition of 11βHSD1.The involvement of a steroid dehydrogenase in renal cyst formation is particularly intriguing since previously several laboratories had demonstrated that the rodent kidney is extremely vulnerable to cyst formation in response to steroid administration at a critical time in development (11Perey D.

Moreover, the cystogenic potential of glucocorticoids has been directly demonstrated in metanephric kidneys in organ culture by us (5Aziz N. Nearing J. Kreidberg J. Donovan M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6: 690Google Scholar) and others (18Avner E. Sweeney W. Piesco N. Ellis D. Experimentia. 1984; 40: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recessive PKD in humans and mice is primarily a developmental disorder and is clinically, phenotypically, and genetically distinct from the autosomal dominant form of PKD, which manifests in adults (19Welling L. Grantham J. Brenner B. Rector F.W.B. The Kidney. II. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991: 1657-1694Google Scholar). Autosomal recessive PKD in humans occurs in neonates or in early childhood and is usually fatal due to the severity of kidney maldevelopment (19Welling L. Grantham J. Brenner B. Rector F.W.B. The Kidney. II. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1991: 1657-1694Google Scholar).In this study we have identified the substrates of Ke 6 and have characterized its kinetic properties and phylogeny. We have used Northern and Western analyses to show that Ke 6 is expressed in the ovary and testis, which are targets for estrogen and androgens, as is the kidney. We have also localized the expression of Ke 6 within the rat ovary. These findings support a function of Ke 6 as a 17βHSD, a regulator of sex steroid concentrations in these tissues.DISCUSSIONThe enzyme 17βHSD catalyzes a key reaction in the biosynthesis and metabolism of sex steroids in both gonadal and nongonadal tissues (29Labrie F. Luu-The V. Lin S-X. Labrie C. Simard J. Breton R. Belanger A. Steroids. 1997; 62: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Oxidoreduction at carbon 17 of estrogens and androgens, carried out by 17βHSDs, modulates the levels of biologically active estrogens and androgens within tissues. The levels of estrogens and androgens in turn control a variety of important physiological functions, such as growth, reproduction, and differentiation. To date, six isozymes of the 17βHSD family have been identified and characterized, and in addition, it has been determined that retinol dehydrogenase also possesses 17βHSD activity (29Labrie F. Luu-The V. Lin S-X. Labrie C. Simard J. Breton R. Belanger A. Steroids. 1997; 62: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The enzymes belong to the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family and use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or its phosphate as cofactors. The seven 17βHSDs (including retinol dehydrogenase) have different substrate and cofactor specificities, tissue distributions, and subcellular localizations, which suggests each of these enzymes has a distinct physiological role in endocrine (glandular) and intracrine (local) metabolism of sex steroids (30Andersson S. Moghrabi N. Steroids. 1997; 62: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).In Table I, we have compared Ke 6 to other 17βHSDs (28Biswas M. Russell D. J. Biol.

Ke 6 is similar to 17βHSD2, 17βHSD4, and 17βHSD6 in preference for NAD+ as a cofactor and for oxidative activity. However, Ke 6 also has reductive activity for estrone, suggesting a broader role in regulating the sex steroid concentration. These enzymatic differences, which distinguish Ke 6 from the other 17βHSDs, are in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1), which shows that Ke 6 is on a branch that is clearly distinct form the other 17βHSDs, and that the closest enzymes to Ke 6 are an E. coli reductase and two steroid dehydrogenases: 7αHSD and 17βHSD4, which oxidize their substrate.Table IProperties of the Ke 6 enzyme and other 17βHSDsEnzymeHighest expressionSubcellular locationMolecular massSubstratesaE2, estradiol; T, testosterone; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; E1, estrone; A-diol, androstenediol; A-dione, androstenedione.Reaction typeCofactorMethodRef.kDaKe 6Kidney, liver, ovary, testis, spleenMicrosomes34E2OxidativeNADRecombinant proteinThis reportTOxidativeNADDHTOxidativeNADE1ReductiveNADH17βHSD1Ovary, placentaCytosol34E1ReductivePrefers NADPHTransfected Cos-m6 cells31Poutanen M.

Open table in a new tab An important function of the ovary is the synthesis and secretion of 17β-estradiol, and this involves two cell populations (36Erickson G. Magoffin D. Dyer C. Hofeditz C. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). DHEA, produced by the adrenals, is released into the circulation and taken up by the well vascularized theca cells where it is converted into androstenediol by 3βHSD (37Voutilanen R. Tapanainen J. Chung B. Matteson K. Miller W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Androstenedione is then aromatized into estrone by P450 aromatase in the granulosa cells (37Voutilanen R. Tapanainen J. Chung B. Matteson K. Miller W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 63: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Estrone can then be converted into the biologically active estradiol by the reductive activity of 17βHSDs. Alternatively, androstenedione may be converted to testosterone by an androgenic 17βHSD to testosterone, which is then aromatized to estradiol (34Geissler W. Davis D. Wu L. Bradshaw K. Patel S. Mendonca B. Elliston K. Wilson J. Russell D. Andersson S. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The localization of Ke 6 protein within the cumulus cells confirms the presence of more than one 17βHSD within the ovary. 17βHSD1, an NADPH-dependent enzyme that is expressed at high levels in the ovary, is found in the granulosa cells of primary and antral follicles (38Sawetawan C. Milewich L. Word A. Carr B. Rainey W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 99: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Type 2, 3, 4, and 6 17βHSDs are not present in the ovary (39Zhang Y. Word A. Fesmire S. Carr B. Rainey W. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3594-3598PubMed Google Scholar). The physical separation of the two 17βHSDs, Ke 6, and the 17βHSD1 within the ovary, achieved by the cellular organization of granulosa cells and cumulus cells within the follicle, is interesting. The location of 17βHSD1 within the granulosa cells and Ke 6 within the cumulus cells may allow the ovary to achieve a fine tuned balance of the optimal sex steroid levels. 17βHSD1 has strong reductive activity and synthesizes estradiol (40Poutanen M. Isomaa V. Peltoketo H. Vihko R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whereas Ke 6 has both oxidative and reductive activities, inactivating and synthesizing estradiol. The smaller Michaelis constant of Ke 6 and its greater activity with estradiol over estrone suggest that it is primarily an oxidative enzyme that can switch to a reductive mode determined in the appropriate physiologic milieu. Because the Ke 6 enzyme can inactivate androgenic steroids, which 17βHSD1 cannot do, the strategic location of Ke 6 within the cumulus cells could have a critical role in protecting the egg from exposure to androgen, which is known to be produced by the ovary. It is also possible that after ovulation, when the oocyte is within the oviduct, it is supplied estradiol that is synthesized within the cumulus cells by the reductive activity of the Ke 6 enzyme.The kidney is also a highly steroid-sensitive organ equipped with several steroid dehydrogenases, which inactivate glucocorticoids and sex steroids. The particular location of specific 17βHSDs and 11βHSD enzymes along the nephrons may serve specific needs. Besides Ke 6, the kidney expresses 17βHSD2, 17βHSD4, and 17βHSD6, which are also oxidative enzymes and use the same cofactor as the Ke 6 enzyme. The Ke 6 protein is located within the S3 segment of the proximal tubules and within the intercalated cells of the collecting ducts (4Aziz N. Brown D Lee W.S. Fejes-Toth Aniko Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5581-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 11βHSD1 is present in the proximal tubules (41Edwards C. Burt D. McIntyre M. Kloet E. Stewart P. Bret L. Sutano W. Monder C. Lancet. 1988; : 986-989Abstract PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar); 11βHSD2 is present in the collecting ducts (42Rusvai E. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10717-10720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The location of 17βHSD2, 17βHSD4, and 17βHSD6 within the kidney has not been determined to our knowledge. The presence of four 17βHSDs and two 11βHSDs within the kidney indicates the importance of maintaining an optimal level of sex steroids and glucocorticoids which may be particularly critical during development.Previously, we had determined that the Ke 6 gene is severely down-regulated in the kidneys of three different recessive murine models of polycystic kidney disease, the cpk,pcy, and jck mouse (1Aziz N. Maxwell M. St.-Jacques B. Brenner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Maxwell M. Nearing J. Aziz N. J. Biol.

Brown D Lee W.S. Fejes-Toth Aniko Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5581-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cpk/cpkmouse was initially described and characterized as a model for the human recessive polycystic kidney disease because of the gross enlargement of the kidneys due to numerous cysts (43Preminger G. Koch W. Fried F. McFarland Murphy, E. Mandell J. J. Urol. 1982; 127: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The disease closely resembled human autosomal recessive PKD in several aspects, recessive inheritance of the mutation, earliest cysts in the proximal tubules and later predominance of cysts in the collecting tubules, and aggressive nature of the disease with death occurring at infancy (43Preminger G. Koch W. Fried F. McFarland Murphy, E. Mandell J. J. Urol. 1982; 127: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, Woo and Greenbaum (44Woo D. Greenbaum L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 385Google Scholar), reported that the ovary of thecpk/cpk mouse is markedly underdeveloped, determined by morphological, histological, and functional studies. Thecpk/cpk females failed to superovulate in response to human chorionic gonadotropin treatment. Histological analyses revealed the presence of atresic follicles, and the sizes of the ovaries and uteri were much smaller than normal (44Woo D. Greenbaum L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 385Google Scholar). Recently the same laboratory also showed abnormal testicular development in the cpk homozygote males with fewer and immature seminiferous tubules. 2D. Woo, personal communication. It is possible that abnormal sex steroid metabolism is responsible for the underdevelopment of the gonads in the cpk/cpk mice. We expect to find a reduction in the expression of the Ke 6 gene in the gonads of thecpk homozygotes since we had previously found that Ke 6 mRNA levels is reduced in all tissues of this recessive murine PKD model (1Aziz N. Maxwell M. St.-Jacques B. Brenner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another recessive murine model of polycystic kidney disease, the kat (kidney, anemia, andtestes) mouse has been described with testicular abnormalities (45Janaswami P. Birkenmeier E. Cook S. Rowe L. Bronson R. Davisson M. Genomics. 1997; 40: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which further indicates the tight linkage between kidney and gonadal differentiation.The 17βHSD ability of Ke 6 to promote either estradiol synthesis (reduction) or estradiol, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone inactivation (oxidation) could be important in the development of both the kidney and the gonads of the cpk homozygotes by maintaining optimal levels of sex steroids within these organs. The development of the urinary and genital systems are closely associated in the earliest stages. The urogenital ridge gives rise to both the nephric and gonadal structures, and androgens and estrogens are likely to regulate differentiation and organization of both organ systems. Regulation of the intracellular levels of these steroids by Ke 6 and other 17βHSDs would be expected to be important in the developing kidney and gonads. The Ke 6 gene, encoded within the major histocompatibility complex, has been intimately linked to the development of cysts in the kidney and liver of mice (1Aziz N. Maxwell M. St.-Jacques B.

The inhibition of the Ke 6 gene expression using antisense deoxyoligonucleotides in embryonic kidneys in organ cultures gives rise to numerous cysts against a background of normal nephrogenesis (5Aziz N. Nearing J. Kreidberg J. Donovan M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6: 690Google Scholar, 6Aziz N. Donovan M. Fejes-Toth A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1743Google Scholar). Importantly, the human Ke 6 gene is located on chromosome 6p21 (7Kikuti Y. Ando A. Tamiya G. Kimura M. Ferreira E. Tsuji K. Trowsdale J. Inoko H. Genomics. 1997; 42: 422-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) where the human autosomal recessive PKD mutation has been mapped (8Zerres K. Mucher G. Bachner L. Deschennes G. Eggermann T. Kaarriainen H. Knapp M. Lennert T. Misselwitz J. Muhlendahl K. Neumann H. Pirson Y. Rudnik-Schoneborn S. Steinbeck V. Wirth B. Scharer K. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and therefore there is a possibility that the Ke 6 gene is the primary mutation in autosomal recessive PKD.

Our earlier data base searches with the Ke 6 sequence showed that it belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family (1Aziz N. Maxwell M. St.-Jacques B. Brenner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1847-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At that time, Ke 6 was most similar to bacterial oxidoreductases with no close similarity to any mammalian oxidoreductase in the data base, leaving the exact function of Ke 6 unknown. Recently, we searched the data base again with Ke 6 and found it is similar to 17βHSD4 (9Leenders F. Adamski J. Husen B. Thole H. Jungblut P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine Ke 6 for 17βHSD activity with various androgen and estrogen substrates. As reported here, we find that Ke 6 protein is an NAD-dependent 17βHSD, making it the seventh member of this class of enzyme. It efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of estradiol, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone and also the reduction of estrone to form biologically active estradiol. The identification of the substrate of Ke 6 allows us to postulate that regulated sex steroid metabolism plays a crucial role in the development of the mammalian kidney, and aberrations in this regulation leads to developmental problems. We propose that the developing kidney is affected by abnormal estrogen/androgen metabolism or by abnormal glucocorticoid metabolism, which could occur as a consequence of elevated sex steroid levels. Estrogen levels have been implicated in the inhibition of 11βHSD enzyme in a study by Low et al. (10Low S. Assaad S. Rajan K. Chapman K. Edwards C. Seckl J. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 139: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), where it was determined that gonadectomy of the normal female mouse stimulated the expression of the 11βHSD1 gene and estradiol replacement inhibited its activity. Elevated levels of estrogens and androgens in thecpk/cpk kidney could result in a defect in glucocorticoid metabolism by the inhibition of 11βHSD1. The involvement of a steroid dehydrogenase in renal cyst formation is particularly intriguing since previously several laboratories had demonstrated that the rodent kidney is extremely vulnerable to cyst formation in response to steroid administration at a critical time in development (11Perey D. Herdman R. Good R. Science. 1967; 158: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Filmer R. Carone F. Rowland R. Babcock J. Am. J.

In this study, we have investigated the specificity of recombinant mouse PC2 for proenkephalin-related internally quenched (IQ) peptides, for methylcoumarin amide-based fluorogenic peptides, and for recombinant rat proenkephalin. IQ peptides exhibited specificity constants (kcat/Km) between 9.4 × 104m−1 s−1(Abz-Val-Pro-Arg-Met-Glu-Lys-Arg-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Gln-EDDnp; where Abz is οrtho-aminobenzoic acid and EDDnp isN-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine)) and 0.24 × 104m−1 s−1(Abz-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Arg-Val-Gly-Arg-Pro-Glu-EDDnp), with the peptide B to Met-enk-Arg-Phe cleavage preferred (Met-enk is met-enkephalin). Fluorogenic substrates with P1, P2, and P4 basic amino acids were hydrolyzed with specificity constants ranging between 2.0 × 103m−1s−1 (Ac-Orn-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA; where MCA is methylcoumarin amide) and 1.8 × 104m−1s−1 (<Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA; where <Glu is pyroglutamic acid). Substrates containing only a single basic residue were not appreciably hydrolyzed, and substrates lacking a P4 Arg exhibited kcat of less than 0.05 s−1. Substitution of ornithine for Lys at the P4 position did not significantly affect the kcat but increased the Km 2-fold. Data from both sets of fluorogenic substrates supported the contribution of a P4 Arg to PC2 preference. Analysis of proenkephalin reaction products using immunoblotting and gel permeation chromatography demonstrated that PC2 can directly cleave proenkephalin and that the generation of small opioid peptides from intermediates is mediated almost entirely by PC2 rather than by PC1. These results are in accord with the analysis of PC2 knock-out brains, in which the amounts of three mature enkephalins were depleted by more than three-quarters.

Previous reports from our laboratory using cell-based systems have provided support for the idea that PC1 is the chief enzyme concerned with the generation of intermediate-sized peptides from proenkephalin (PE) and that PC2 is mostly responsible for the production of small, bioactive opioid peptides (5Breslin M.B.

Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, the major PE products in PC2-containing AtT-20/PE cells, as well as in PC2-expressing Rin-PE cells, are the fully processed opioid peptides Met-enk-Arg-Phe, Met-enk-Arg-Gly-Leu, Met-enk, and Leu-enk (6Johanning K.

In agreement with the notion that PC2 expression is correlated with more complete processing of PE, antisense experiments have shown that PC2 is largely responsible for the processing of PE into smaller opioid peptides in Rin cells (6Johanning K.

Taken together, this work supported the idea that both prohormone convertases prefer paired basic cleavage sites containing a P4 basic residue and can cleave at single basic residues given the presence of additional amino-terminal basic residues. However, in general, work with natural substrates has not revealed additional preferences for residues surrounding the cleavage site. Synthetic fluorogenic and internally quenched peptides and methylcoumarin amide (MCA)-containing substrates have been used to determine kinetic parameters of subtilisin-like enzymes and to explore the structural features surrounding the dibasic cleavage sites that contribute to enzyme specificity (25Jean F. Basak A. Dimaio J. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Basak A. Schmidt C. Ismail A.F. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Lazure C. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1995; 46: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the kinetic properties of PC2 against proenkephalin-related internally quenched substrates and a series of fluorogenic peptides. In addition, we examined the hydrolysis of recombinant PE in vitro by PC1 and PC2. Finally, we have used PC2 knock-out mice (27Furuta M. Yano H. Zhou A. Rouille Y. Holst J.J. Carroll R. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Furuta H. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) to confirm the involvement of this enzyme in the natural processing of PE. To determine the specificity of PC2 for proenkephalin-derived peptides, internally quenched Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrates (where Abz isortho-aminobenzoic acid and EDDnp is N-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)ethylenediamine) were synthesized and purified as described previously (28Hirata Y. Cezari M.H.S. Nakaie C.R. Boschcov P. Ito A.S. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lett. Peptide Sci. 1994; 1: 299-308Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Del Nery E. Juliano M.A. Meldal M. Svendsen I. Scharfstein J. Walmsley A. Juliano L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The molecular weight and purity of synthesized peptides were checked by mass spectroscopy laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) using TofSpec-E from Micromass. In these intramolecularly quenched peptides the Abz group is attached to the amino terminus and the EDDnp moiety to a carboxyl-terminal glutamine, necessary for the solid-phase peptide synthesis (29Del Nery E. Juliano M.A. Meldal M. Svendsen I. Scharfstein J. Walmsley A. Juliano L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A total of 11 substrates, 11–12 amino acids in length, was synthesized corresponding to the sequences surrounding PE cleavage sites (Fig. 1). In addition, another set of 10 substrates was synthesized that corresponded to analogs of a 12-residue peptide B-like sequence (Abz-VPEMEKRYGGFMQ-EDDnp). In the latter peptides, Arg and Ala were substituted at various positions from P3 to P7 to determine the effect of sequence preference. To investigate the potential requirement for length, an extended peptide B-related substrate was synthesized (Abz-LPSDEEGESYSKEVPEMEKRYGGFMQ-EDDnp). Recombinant mPC2 was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using the dihydrofolate reductase-coupled amplification method previously described (30Lindberg I. Shaw E. Finley J. Leone D. Deininger P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); cells were subsequently stably supertransfected with cDNAs encoding 21-kDa rat 7B2 (12Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in a Cellmax artificial capillary cell culture system (Cellco, Germantown, MD). PC2 was purified from 20 ml of conditioned media (in which the primary proteins present were the 71- and 75-kDa proenzyme forms) diluted 1:3 in buffer A on a 5 × 50-mm Protein-Pak anion-exchange column (Waters Chromatography, Milford, MA) using a step gradient first from 0 to 35% B in 175 min at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, followed by a further gradient to 100% B in 50 min at 0.50 ml/min. Buffer A was 20 mm Bis-Tris, 0.1% Brij, pH 6.5, and buffer B was 1 m sodium acetate, 20 mm Bis-Tris, 0.1% Brij, pH 6.5. Two-ml fractions were collected and assessed for purity on 8.8% gels using Coomassie staining. Recombinant rat PE was overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using the dihydrofolate-reductase amplification method (30Lindberg I. Shaw E. Finley J. Leone D. Deininger P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recombinant PE was purified from the conditioned medium essentially as described previously (30Lindberg I. Shaw E. Finley J. Leone D. Deininger P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using a 4.6 × 25-mm Vydac semi-preparative C4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) by elution with 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Recombinant PC1 was produced by the same method, but cells were grown in a Cellmax artificial capillary cell culture system as for PC2 (Cellco, Germantown, MD). PC1 was purified from 20 ml of conditioned medium diluted 1:3 in buffer A on a 5 × 50-mm Protein-Pak anion-exchange column (Waters Chromatography, Milford, MA) using a gradient from 0 to 100% B in 120 min. The buffers used were identical to those employed for PC2. The flow rate was 0.50 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. PC1 fractions were assessed for purity as above. The actual concentration of each substrate was determined using a spectrophotometer by measuring the EDDnp absorbance at 365 nm (EDDnp extinction coefficient, 17, 300m−1). A stock solution of 1 mmpeptide was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Internally quenched substrates (final dilutions of 2 μm and 200 nm) were subjected to digestion by recombinant mouse PC2 at 37 °C in a buffer containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 5 mm calcium chloride, and 0.1% Brij in a total volume of either 1 ml or 250 μl. Cuvettes and buffer were kept at 37 °C prior to the addition of substrate. Recombinant pro-PC2 was diluted 1:3 with the above buffer and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to obtain the 66-kDa autoactivated form of this enzyme (12Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the preparation under saturating substrate concentrations was 29 μmol/h/mg. Substrate was added to reaction buffer in the cuvette, and the cuvette was placed in the thermostated fluorometer (37 °C) for equilibration. Abz fluorescence of each substrate was measured with a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer (λexcitation = 320 nm; λemission = 420 nm) at time 0 and was recorded at various points after the addition of PC2 (36 nm final concentration). These reaction conditions represent pseudo first-order conditions. Fluorescence data were fitted to a first-order curve by nonlinear regression (one phase exponential decay) using GraphPad version 2.0 (ISI Software, CA) as shown in Equation 1.Y=Spane−kt+plateauEquation 1 where Y is the amplitude of the fluorescence change; k is the apparent first- order rate constant; and plateau is the fluorescence at the end point of the reaction. The resultant apparent first-order rate constants were divided by the moles of enzyme (as calculated from the protein concentration and assuming a molecular mass of 66 kDa for activated PC2). These experiments were always performed in duplicate and, for the three best substrates of each group, at two different substrate concentrations. In addition, six IQ substrates (Fig. 1, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, and 10) were subjected to PC1 digestion under the same pseudo first-order rate conditions (2 μm substrate). PC1 (115 nmfinal) was preincubated in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 5 mm calcium chloride, 0.1% Brij for 1 h in order to attain linear cleavage rates (9Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was then added to the substrate as described above for PC2 digestions in a total volume of 1 ml. To verify cleavage at the dibasic pair, each Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp substrate (100 μm) was incubated overnight with PC2 (5 nm) in the same reaction mixture as described above for subsequent isolation of the product by HPLC and was identified by mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF). Custom synthesis of Cbz-Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA (where Cbz is benzyloxycarbonyl) was performed by Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA) and verified by amino acid composition. The 7B2 hCT1-31 peptide was synthesized by LSUMC Core Laboratories. Boc-Gly-Arg-Arg-MCA, Boc-Gly-Lys-Arg-MCA, Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA, Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA, and <Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA were purchased from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, KY). All other fluorogenic substrates were synthesized at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Canada, as described elsewhere (31Jean F. Boudreault A. Basak A. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A series of MCA-based fluorogenic substrates was tested for hydrolysis rates by PC2 (3.7 to 260 ng, depending on the rate of hydrolysis) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 5 mm calcium chloride, 0.1% Brij, and 100 nm 21-kDa 7B2 (which stabilizes the enzyme; Ref. 12Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Various concentrations of the different peptides were used, as indicated in the figure legends, and the rates of hydrolysis were determined by fluorometry. The background fluorescence in each substrate at the start of incubation was subtracted from the final values. Km and Vmax values were obtained by applying Michaelis-Menten kinetics to the data using the Enzfitter program (Elsevier-Biosoft). PC assays were performed in duplicate at 37 °C in a buffer consisting of 100 mmsodium acetate, 5 mm calcium chloride, and 0.1% Brij (final concentrations); the pH of the sodium acetate buffer in PC1-containing reactions was 5.5, and the pH of PC2-containing reactions was 5.0. Activity was estimated using the fluorogenic substrate <Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA. Forkcat/Km determinations, pro-PC2 was preincubated in assay buffer for 20 min at 37 °C for conversion to the 66-kDa active form (12Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate. All reactions were carried out in a 50-μl total reaction volume in a polypropylene microtiter plate as described previously (12Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Free amino methyl coumarin was measured with a Cambridge Technology microtiter plate fluorometer (Watertown, MA) at λexcitation = 380 nm and λemission = 460 nm. For the time course digestion experiment PC1 and PC2 (0.24 μg; 55 and 72 nmfinal concentrations, respectively) were preincubated at the appropriate pH values (1 h for PC1 at pH 5.5 and 20 min for PC2 at pH 5.0) as described above in a 50-μl reaction volume; recombinant rat PE (1.25 μg; 0.91 μm final concentration) was then added. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 0, 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, at which time 1/10 volume of a 10× solution of Laemmli sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.06 mg/ml bromphenol blue) was added. Samples were then boiled, and a tenth of the reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to Western blotting as described previously (6Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The antiserum used was raised against peptide F (32Christie D.L. Birch N.P. Aitken J.F. Harding D.R. Hancock W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and recognizes proenkephalin as well as PE cleavage products containing peptide F. Chromaffin granule total protein (about 20 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis to compare the pattern of natural cleavage products to those resulting from the digestion with PC1 and PC2. All experiments were repeated at least twice. PE (450 nm final concentration) was incubated with preincubated PC2 (40 nm) in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% final concentration) and frozen until HPGPC, performed as described previously (33Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27871-27878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). HPGPC fractions were collected into polypropylene tubes to which 5 μg of bovine serum albumin had been added as carrier. Duplicate aliquots of each fraction were subjected to enkephalin radioimmunoassay as described previously (34Lindberg I. Yang H.Y. Brain Res. 1984; 299: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), either untreated or following treatment with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B (35Lindberg I. Thomas G. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to reveal cryptic enkephalin sequences and to remove carboxyl-terminal basic amino acids that interfere with immunoreactivity. Enkephalin antisera used were raised against Met-enk-Arg-Phe (JAS; Ref. 36Mocchetti I. Giorgi O. Schwartz J.P. Costa E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 106: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Met-enk (RB4; Ref. 37Giraud P. Eiden L.E. Audigier Y. Gillioz Conte-Devols B. Bourdouresque F. Eskay R. Oliver C.

PE digestions with PC2 and RIAs were carried out at least twice with similar results. Frozen brains from PC2-knock-out and wild-type control mice were thawed and immediately homogenized in 5 volumes of ice-cold 1n acetic acid, 20 mm HCl, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, half of the supernatant was lyophilized and resuspended in 250 μl of 32% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for gel permeation analysis. High pressure gel permeation was carried out as described previously (6Johanning K. Mathis J.P. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) except that the flow rate was 0.40 ml/min, and 0.40 ml was collected per fraction. Aliquots of fractions were assayed for the various enkephalins by RIA, in certain cases following tryptic digestion and carboxypeptidase B trimming as described previously (35Lindberg I. Thomas G. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 480-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the results were reported per fraction. The experiment was repeated once with a separate set of brains. Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of rat PE that depicts the different cleavage sites and peptides known to result from proteolytic cleavage of this precursor molecule (39Udenfriend S. Kilpatrick D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The numbers above the PE structure indicate the 11–12-residue internally quenched peptides used for studies of PC2 specificity. As shown in the diagram, peptide B is an example of an intermediate that results from cleavage at a paired basic site and that serves as a substrate for generation of the opioid peptide Met-enk-Arg-Phe. Peptide E, an intermediate-sized peptide, can give rise to both Met-enk and Leu-enk. Whereas internally quenched peptide substrate series represent an effective means to determine enzyme preference at various subsites (25Jean F. Basak A. Dimaio J. Seidah N.G. Lazure C. Biochem.

A variety of kinases are known to modulate nuclear protein import in response to specific hormonal or other cellular signals regulating their activity (2Jans D.A. Biochem.

In the case of the T-ag CcN motif, we have shown that substitution of one kinase site by a consensus site for another can alter the cellular signals able to regulate the nuclear import of proteins carrying the modified prNLS (19Xiao C-Y. Hübner S. Elliot R.M. Caon A. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6451-6457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although a number of prNLSs have been defined, the mechanistic basis of prNLS-mediated regulation of nuclear transport is largely unclear. Our recent work with respect to CK2 enhancement of T-ag nuclear import indicates that phosphorylation facilitates recognition of the T-ag NLS by the NLS-binding importin subunits (22Hübner S.

We were interested in measuring the kinetics of nuclear accumulation of the relfamily member Dorsal, the Drosophila melanogaster morphogen whose graded nuclear translocation is integral in determining dorsal-ventral polarity during embryogenesis (4Govind S. Steward R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Modifying genes that regulate Dorsal nuclear accumulation include the transmembrane receptor protein Toll, the Raf family kinase Pelle, the protein Tube, which may have a chaperone function with respect to Dorsal or Pelle, and the cytoplasmic retention factor Cactus (23Norris J.L.

In identical fashion to otherrel family members, Dorsal possesses a consensus site for PKA 22 amino acids N-terminal to a 6- amino acid NLS within the ∼300-amino acid rel homology domain (see Fig. 1), where the enhancing role of PKA in terms of nuclear localization has been qualitatively described, using transfection systems for Dorsal (23Norris J.L.

In this study we define the Dorsal prNLS kinetically by quantitating the nuclear uptake of β-galactosidase fusion proteins at the single cell level both in vivo and in vitro in the HTC rat hepatoma line using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (10Jans D.A. Moll T. Nasmyth K. Jans P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17064-17067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,13Jans D.A. Ackermann M. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6451-6457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). While Dorsal fusion protein nuclear uptake is NLS-dependent, it is also strongly dependent on the PKA site, whereby substitution of Ser312 by either Ala or Glu using site-directed mutagenesis essentially abolishes nuclear accumulation. Exogenous addition of cAMP or PKA catalytic (C-) subunit enhances nuclear import of the wild-type Dorsal proteins. Results using an ELISA-based binding assay indicate that the mechanistic basis of the PKA site modulation of Dorsal fusion protein nuclear import is PKA-site enhancement of the binding interaction between the NLS-binding importin 58/97 complex and the Dorsal NLS. The fact that Drosophilaembryos expressing PKA site and NLS Dorsal mutant variants show impaired development and fail to hatch supports the physiological relevance of the results. We conclude that the Dorsal NLS and PKA site constitute a prNLS essential to Dorsal function, and able to function in heterologous mammalian cell systems, where phosphorylation regulates interaction with importin 58/97. PKA (EC 2.7.1.37) catalytic (C-) subunit (bovine heart) was from Sigma; other reagents were from the sources previously described (10Jans D.A. Moll T. Nasmyth K. Jans P. J. Biol.

Plasmids expressing the Dorsal β-galactosidase fusion proteins were derived by standard recombinant DNA technology. Inserts encoding Dorsal amino acids 1–678 (D1 construct, full-length Dorsal), 1–346 (D2 construct, encoding therel homology domain), and 297–346 (D3 construct, encoding the PKA site at Ser312 together with the NLS at amino acids 335–340), were derived using a polymerase chain reaction and ligated into the NcoI site of a derivative of plasmid vector pPR2 (14Rihs H.-P.

The D3 construct containing the NLS-deficient mutant (Thr337 Glu339), as well as plasmids encoding the PKA site Ser312 substitutions by Ala or Glu (see Fig. 1) were derived by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type Dorsal β-galactosidase fusion protein-expressing constructs using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech U.S.E. mutagenesis kit. The T-ag-CcN-β-galactosidase fusion protein used as a control contains T-ag amino acids 111–135, encompassing the CcN motif (including CK2 and cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites and NLS) fused N-terminal to the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase enzyme sequence (amino acids 9–1023) (13Jans D.A.

NLS-dependent nuclear protein import can be reconstituted in this system through the exogenous addition of cytosolic extract (untreated reticulocyte lysate, Promega catalog no. L415A), an ATP-regenerating system (0.125 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 30 mm creatine phosphate, 2 mm ATP), and transport substrate (0.2 mg/ml 5-(iodacetamido)-fluorescein-labeled fusion protein). Image analysis and curve-fitting were performed as forin vivo assays. Where indicated, proteins were either coinjected with cAMP (250 μm in the pipette) in the case of the in vivoexperiments, or 25 μm cAMP, 2.5 μm PKA C-subunit inhibitor peptide PKI 5–24, and 400 picomolar units PKA C-subunit/μl included in the cytosol in the case of in vitro experiments (19Xiao C-Y.

In experiments where the dependence of transport on the GTP-binding protein Ran/TC4 was tested, cytosolic extract was treated with 850 μm GTPγS (nonhydrolyzable GTP analog) for 5 min at room temperature, prior to use in the in vitro assay (34Efthymiadis A.

The lectin wheat germ agglutinin, which impairs nuclear pore complex function, was used at 240 μg/ml. In vitrophosphorylation of fusion proteins by PKA C-subunit was analyzed quantitatively by determination of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation as described previously (13Jans D.A. Ackermann M.

Mouse importin 58- and 97-glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (22Hübner S. Xiao C-Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, fusion proteins (0.5 μg/well) were coated overnight at 4 °C in 96-well microtiterplates (Nunc). After blocking, appropriate dilutions of mouse importin 58-glutathione S-transferase or precomplexed importin 58/97-glutathione S-transferase complex were then added to the wells and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Bound importin was detected using rabbit anti-glutathioneS-transferase and goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies (Sigma) and the colorimetric substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. A405 was followed with time using a plate reader (Molecular Devices), with values corrected by subtracting both the absorbance at 0 min and the absorbance of wells incubated without importin 58- or 58/97-glutathione S-transferase complexes. Correction was made for differences in coating efficiency as described previously using a parallel β-galactosidase ELISA (22Hübner S. Xiao C-Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1987; 238: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) cloned immediately downstream of the Xenopus globin gene leader, which is known to direct efficient translational initiation in Drosophila embryos (37Driever W. Siegel V. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Development. 1990; 109: 811-820PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (see above) was used to change the PKA site Ser312 to Ala and to Glu, and to create the NLS-deficient double mutant (Lys337 to Thr, Gln339 to Glu) in pBP-dorsal to generatedorsal mutants exactly comparable to those described above for the bacterially expressed Dorsal fusion proteins. For eachdorsal construct, a cassette comprising the globin translation signals and modified dorsal cDNA was excised and introduced in the appropriate orientation into plasmid pCasperbcdBglII, a P-element-derived vector (37Driever W. Siegel V. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Development. 1990; 109: 811-820PubMed Google Scholar) carrying the promoter region of the bcd gene (38Berleth T. Burri M. Thoma G. Richstein S. Frigerio G. Noll M.

As a wild-type control, a dorsalcDNA carrying the Met-His6 N-terminal epitope tag, cloned in pBP4-dorsal, was similarly introduced into pCasperbcdBglII. The epitope tag has no effect on Dorsal protein function. The P-element vectors carrying the dorsalcassettes were then introduced into the Drosophila genome through conventional transformation methods (39Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar). To determine their ability to substitute for the wild-typedorsal gene in defining embryonic dorsal-ventral pattern, the mutant transgenes were crossed into females of the genotypew/w; dl 1 /dl 1 . The presence of thew + eye marker allowed identification of females carrying the transgenes by their colored eyes. Genetically, thedl 1 allele behaves like a null mutation; Dorsal protein is not present in embryos produced bydl 1 /dl 1 females (see also Fig.7 B). dorsal mutant females carrying the variousdorsal mutant transgenes were placed on yeast and allowed to lay eggs. Cuticular preparations of the embryos produced by these females were made 72 h after egg deposition (40van der Meer J.M. Drosophila Inform. Serv. 1977; 52: 160Google Scholar). Multiple transgenic lines were obtained and analyzed for each construct; significant differences in expression are associated with different chromosomal sites of insertion. Although the level of phenotypic rescue was relatively constant for each insert identified for a particular dorsal transgene from line to line, there were differences in the level of rescue, and analysis was restricted to those insertions that provided the highest level of rescue of thedorsal mutant phenotype. About a third of transgenic inserts obtained for a particular construct were found to provide the highest level of observable rescue (see “Results”); two of six stocks carrying p(w +, bcd-dorsal, NLS mutant) led to the formation of embryos producing Filzkörper material, three of 10 stocks carrying either p(w +, bcd-dorsal, Ala312) or p(w +, bcd-dorsal, Glu312) led to the formation of embryos producing ventral denticles as well as Filzkörper material, and one third of transgenic lines carrying the wild-type dorsal gene under the transcriptional control of the bcd promoter produced hatching embryos when pre"

The same mutations in Kit and Ret have been found associated with two human malignancies, mastocytosis and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B), respectively. Both mutations caused Ron-mediated transformation of 3T3 fibroblasts and tumour formation in nude mice. Moreover, cells transformed by the oncogenic Ron mutants displayed high metastatic potential. The Ron mutant receptors were constitutively active and the catalytic efficiency of the mutated kinase was higher than that of wild-type Ron. Oncogenic Ron mutants enhanced activation of the Ras/MAPK cascade with respect to wild type Ron, without affecting the JNK/SAPK pathway. Expression of Ron mutants in 3T3 fibroblasts led to different patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. These data show that point mutations altering catalytic properties and possibly substrate specificity of the Ron kinase may force cells toward tumorigenesis and metastasis."

In addition to its role in the generation of high affinity receptors, gp130 is required for signal transduction by these cytokines. In the present study we have examined the role of the N-terminal located, extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module of gp130 in signal transduction by IL-6 and LIF. We have expressed wild-type human gp130 or three mutants in murine myeloid M1-UR21 cells that lack functional endogenous gp130 but express the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and the LIF receptor (LIFR). By measuring cellular responses, such as morphological changes upon differentiation, soft agar colony formation, and induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT3, we show that signaling by IL-6, but not LIF, is significantly reduced by mutations in the Ig-like module of gp130. However, the binding of125I-labeled IL-6 or LIF is not affected by these mutations. We also present evidence that the Ig-like module forms part of the epitope of an anti-gp130 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the bioactivity of IL-6, but not of LIF or OSM. The data suggest that gp130-activation by IL-6 and LIF requires different regions of gp130, that the Ig-like module of gp130 may be required for IL-6-induced gp130 dimerization, and that the stoichiometry of the high affinity IL-6 receptor-complex differs from those of the receptor-complexes for LIF and OSM.

The members of this family, which are IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), are structurally related and exert many overlapping biological activities, such as the induction of acute phase proteins, regulation of hematopoiesis, and the control of proliferation and differentiation of neural cells (for a review, see Ref. 1Taga T.

In addition to gp130, the high affinity, signaling receptor-complexes for the IL-6-type cytokines contain at least one other receptor subunit. For example, the biological activities of LIF are mediated by gp130 and the LIF receptor (LIFR) (2Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P.

The IL-6-type cytokines that induce trimeric receptor-complexes as well as those that induce hexameric complexes activate intracellular signaling through the dimerization of gp130 to a second signaling receptor, either gp130, the LIFR or the OSMRβ (4Mosley B.

The formation of a hexameric receptor-complex occurs when the ligand (e.g. IL-6) requires a nonsignaling receptor (the IL-6R) for its association with gp130. Gp130 belongs to the class I hemopoietin receptors, which are characterized by an extracellular cytokine binding domain (CBD) consisting of two fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like modules, each of ∼100 residues. The N- and the C-terminal modules of the CBD normally contain four conserved cysteines and a WSXWS motif (whereX is any amino acid), respectively (13Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). The extracellular region of gp130 contains 597 residues and consists of an N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module followed by a CBD and three membrane-proximal FNIII modules (14Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). This region is most closely related to the corresponding region in the receptor for granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSFR) (15Larsen A. Davis T. Curtis B.M. Gimpel S. Sims J.E. Cosman D. Park L. Sorensen E. March C.J. Smith C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), with an amino acid identity of 26% (46% homology). A truncated form of gp130 lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains as well as the three membrane-proximal FNIII modules has been shown to bind to IL-6 in a complex with the extracellular domain of the IL-6R (16Horsten U. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Müllberg J. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the neutralizing effects of anti-gp130 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggested that gp130 has different binding sites for the IL-6-type cytokines and their receptors (17Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Roche C. Gu Z.-J. Clément C. Klein B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3474-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Chevalier S. Fourcin M. Robledo O. Wijdenes J. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14764-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); however, the specific binding interfaces on gp130 remain essentially uncharacterized. In the G-CSFR, both the Ig-like module and the CBD are required for ternary receptor complex formation with G-CSF (19Hiraoka O. Anaguchi H. Asakura A. Ota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25928-25934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The importance of the Ig-like module in G-CSF signaling has also been implied from epitope-mapping studies of neutralizing anti-G-CSFR mAbs (20Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and from results showing that a G-CSFR mutant lacking most of the Ig-like module was significantly impaired in its ability to transduce a mitogenic response upon stimulation with G-CSF (21Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C-P. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These data, and the fact that gp130 has the same modular structure as the G-CSFR (14Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 15Larsen A. Davis T. Curtis B.M. Gimpel S. Sims J.E. Cosman D. Park L. Sorensen E. March C.J. Smith C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), led us to propose a model of the hexameric IL-6 receptor complex, in which the Ig-like module of gp130 in one IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 trimer interacts with IL-6 in the opposite trimer (22Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). The “bridging” function of the Ig-like module of gp130 in the hexameric IL-6 receptor-complex would require two ligands in the complex, and we therefore predicted that the Ig-like module of gp130 is not involved in the formation of trimeric receptor complexes such as that for LIF (and possibly OSM) (22Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 B). In the model of the hexameric IL-6 receptor complex, the interactions between IL-6 and the CBDs of the IL-6R and gp130 are based on the trimeric complex of growth hormone (GH) with its two identical receptors (GHR) (23de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Using the GH terminology, site I on IL-6 binds the IL-6R, and site II binds gp130. The IL-6-type cytokines, however, have a third receptor-binding site, site III, that has no equivalent in GH (22Simpson R.J. Hammacher A. Smith D.K. Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Site III in IL-6 (24Brakenhoff J.P.J. de Hon F.D. Fontaine V. ten Boekel E. Schooltink H. Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C.

Sites II and III on IL-6 have been shown to interact with two different gp130 molecules in the hexameric receptor complex (7Paonessa G. Graziani R. De Serio A. Savino R. Ciapponi L. Lahm A. Salvati A.L. Toniatti C. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In our model, the Ig-like module in one IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 trimer exerts a bridging function by interacting with site III on IL-6 in the opposite trimer (Fig. 1 A). In this report, using three Ig-mutants of gp130 ((ΔIg)gp130, which lacks the Ig-like module, (GR-Ig)gp130, a chimera with the Ig-like module of the human G-CSFR, and (+Flag)gp130, which has a Flag sequence at its N terminus), we present experimental evidence that the Ig-like module of gp130 is required for signaling by IL-6, but not LIF. To generate IL-6-unresponsive cells, M1 cells (previously transfected with the pPGKNeo vector containing the neomycin resistance gene transcribed from the PGK promoter) were subjected to two rounds of mutagenesis with the DNA intercalator ICR-191. Typically, 8 × 106 cells were incubated for 1.75 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Trace Biosciences, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia), and 5 μg/ml ICR-191 (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). To identify IL-6-unresponsive cells, ICR-191-treated cells (50,000 cells/35-mm dish) (Nunc Inc., Roskilde, Denmark) were grown in soft agar with 100 ng/ml IL-6. Large, tight colonies (consisting of cells that neither differentiated nor were clonally suppressed) were propagated in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS, and 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). One such unresponsive clone, the M1-UR21 cell line, lacks functional endogenous gp130 based on the following criteria: the cells did not bind125I-labeled LIF with high affinity and failed to react with anti-mouse gp130 antibodies (from T. Hirano and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), as measured by immunoblotting and using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Furthermore, responsiveness to IL-6 and LIF could be rescued by transfection of these cells with gp130 cDNA. AnAccII/blunted SacI fragment of pBS130BES containing the cDNA of human gp130 was cloned into theEcoRV site of pcDNA1-Amp (Invitrogen) for mutagenesis by PCR or based on the method of Kunkel et al. (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed on a PCR System 9600 thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer). The conditions used for mutagenesis were: 34 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C (320 s in the first cycle), 20 s at 52 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C (360 s in the last cycle). To generate (GR-Ig)gp130, the primary sequences of the Ig-like modules of gp130 and the human G-CSFR were aligned manually, and anEcoR V restriction enzyme site was introduced in corresponding positions in the cDNAs. In gp130, theEcoRV site was introduced at Gly123-Leu124 (numbering as in Ref. 14Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide (5′) GGAATCACAATAATTAGCGGATATCCTCCAGAAAAA (3′). The (5′) EcoRV/(3′) XbaI fragment of gp130 encoding the remaining 3′ residues to Gln918 was ligated to a (5′)XbaI/(3′) EcoRV fragment of the G-CSFR, which encodes the predicted signal sequence and residues Glu24-Tyr121 (20Layton J.E. Iaria J. Nicholson S.E. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (our numbering includes the 23-residue signal sequence and differs from Larsen, et al., Ref. 15Larsen A. Davis T.

(GR-Ig)gp130, which was obtained following “domain swapping,” thus contains residues Glu24-Tyr121 of the G-CSFR, and Pro125-Gln918 of gp130.

For (ΔIg)gp130 the (5′) SalI/(3′) NdeI fragment was replaced by a fragment lacking the Ig-like module (residues Glu23-Leu124; Ref. 14Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), that had been generated using the oligonucleotides (5′) CGTAAAGAGTCGACAGGTCCTCCAGAAAAACCT (3′), and (5′) TCGTGCTTCATATGTGATCCCACTTGCTTC (3′) (denoted 1753C), and pBS130BES as a template. To generate (+Flag)gp130, the (5′)SalI/(3′) NdeI gp130 fragment was replaced by a fragment encoding the Flag sequence Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys between the predicted signal sequence and Glu23. This fragment had been generated using gp130 as a template, and the oligonucleotides 1753C and (5′) ATGCACTGAGTCGACAGGTGATTATAAAGACGACGACGATAAG (3′). For expression in M1-UR21 cells, the cDNA of wt-gp130 was excised from pcDNA1-Amp using BamHI and cloned into theXbaI site of pEF-BOS using BamHI/XbaI adapters. (ΔIg)gp130 and (+Flag)gp130 were inserted intoBamHI-digested pEF-BOS. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using a model 370A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The restriction enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Typically, 20 μg of pEF-BOS, containing a gp130 construct, and 2 μg of pPGKPuropA vector, containing the puromycin resistance gene transcribed from the PGK promoter, were co-transfected into 4 × 106 M1-UR21 cells, using gene pulsar cuvettes with 0.4 cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad) in a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 270 V and 960 microfarads. The cells were resuspended in 100 ml of DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS and plated into four 24-well dishes (Nunc). After 2 days in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2, puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) was added to each well at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Independently derived cell lines that were viable after 10–12 days of selection were expanded. The transfected cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) for binding of the anti-human gp130 mAbs B-T6, B-S12, and B-T2 (17Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G.

Fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Silenius Laboratories, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia) was used as secondary antibody. Nonviable cells were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and gated out at analysis. For analysis of morphological changes upon differentiation, cells were plated in 6-well plates (Nunc) (10,000 cells in 2 ml/well) in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS and various concentrations of mouse IL-6. After 5 days in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for IL-6-induced increases in forward and side scatter (FSC and SSC). Data from 10,000 events were collected. The cells were plated into 35-mm culture dishes (Nunc) (∼ 150 cells in 1 ml/dish) in DMEM containing 20% (v/v) FBS and 0.3% (w/v) dissolved bacto-agar (Difco). Prior to addition of the cell suspension, 0.1 ml of serial dilutions of mouse IL-6 or LIF, or medium as a negative control, were added to the dishes. After 7 days in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the colonies were counted and scored for differentiation. Colonies with a halo of dispersed cells or composed entirely of dispersed cells were scored as differentiated. The cells were serum-starved for 5 h in DMEM in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and stimulated with factor at 37 °C.

The cells (2–12 × 106cells/data point in duplicates) were incubated for at least 3 h on ice with 125I-labeled factor in the presence of 0–25 nm of unlabeled competitor, or with various concentrations of 125I-labeled factor in the absence of competitor, in a total volume of 100 μl. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 500 nm of unlabeled competitor. The data were examined using the curve-fitting program LIGAND (36Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 307-310Crossref Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of the Ig-like module of gp130 in signaling by IL-6-type cytokines, the following human gp130 constructs were generated: (ΔIg)gp130, which lacks the Ig-like module, (GR-Ig)gp130, a chimera with the Ig-like module of the human G-CSFR, and (+Flag)gp130, which has a Flag sequence at its N terminus (Fig. 2) (see also “Experimental Procedures”). Wild-type gp130 and the mutants were subcloned into the expression vector pEF-BOS and transfected into murine myeloid M1-UR21 cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In contrast to M1 cells, which differentiate into macrophages and undergo clonal suppression in response to IL-6 and LIF (37Metcalf D. Leukemia. 1989; 3: 349-355PubMed Google Scholar), M1-UR21 cells are unresponsive to these cytokines because of lack of functional endogenous gp130 (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 4C). The M1-UR21 cells do, however, express the IL-6R and the LIFR as well as the intracellular machinery necessary for the physiological response to IL-6 and LIF (data herein). Transfection of wt-gp130 into M1-UR21 cells thus resulted in restoration of IL-6- and LIF-responsiveness, and mutations in gp130 that influence the bioactivity of these cytokines can readily be identified in this cell system. Independently derived viable cell lines were expanded and analyzed for expression of gp130 by flow cytometry using anti-gp130 mAbs and isotype-matched mAbs as negative controls. Cells transfected with wt-gp130 or the mutants, but not nontransfected M1-UR21 cells (cf. Fig. 7), all yielded cell lines expressing anti-gp130 mAb-reactive protein on the surface, as exemplified using mAb B-T6 (Fig. 3). Additionally, (+Flag)gp130- and (GR-Ig)gp130-expressing cell lines were also reactive with an anti-Flag mAb and a conformation-sensitive mAb recognizing the G-CSFR-Ig like module, respectively (Fig. 3).Figure 3Cell surface expression of gp130 and gp130 mutants. M1-UR21 cells transfected with wt-gp130, (ΔIg)gp130, (GR-Ig)gp130, or (+Flag)gp130 were incubated with mAbs B-T6, M2, or 711 (shaded graphs) or isotype-matched antibodies (solid lines) as negative controls, and binding was measured by flow cytometry, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” FACScan profiles of one representative cell line from each transfection are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three or four independently derived cell lines from each transfection with wt-gp130 or the mutants were stimulated for 5 days with various concentrations of IL-6, prior to measurement by flow cytometry of cell size and vacuolization (Fig. 4). Increases in these two parameters correlate with differentiation of the cells into macrophages and are reflected in increases in FSC and SSC, respectively (Fig.4 A). Maximal stimulation of M1-UR21 cells transfected with wt-gp130 was seen with 30 ng IL-6/ml and resulted in a shift of >65% of cells from the lower left (LL) quadrant to the upper left (UL), upper right (UR), and lower right (LR) quadrants (Fig. 4 B). Increased cell size and vacuolization of the wt-gp130 transfectants was also seen at lower concentrations of IL-6 (EC50 = 1.4 ng/ml), with shifts of approximately 60, 50, 25, and 3% at 10, 3, 1, and 0.3 ng/ml, respectively. Stimulation of (+Flag)gp130 and (ΔIg)gp130 transfectants with 30 ng IL-6/ml resulted in shifts of approximately 20% (S.E. = 3.5%) and 25% (S.E. = 14.5%), respectively, and smaller shifts were obtained with lower concentrations of IL-6 (Fig.4 B). Cells transfected with (GR-Ig)gp130, however, showed no significant changes in morphology at 0–30 ng of IL-6/ml (Fig.4 B). In a separate experiment, duplicate samples of one cell line of (GR-Ig)gp130 were stimulated with a higher dose of IL-6. Whereas the positive control (wt-gp130 transfectants) differentiated at near maximal level in response to 20 ng of IL-6/ml, (GR-Ig)gp130, and nontransfected M1-UR21 cells as a negative control, remained undifferentiated even at 800 ng of IL-6/ml (Fig. 4 C). Two representative independently derived cell lines from each transfection were chosen for further analysis of differentiation capacity in a soft agar colony assay (Fig. 5). M1-UR21 cells transfected with wt-gp130 fully differentiated in response to IL-6 (EC50 = 0.4 ng/ml) (Fig. 5 A). Cells expressing (+Flag)gp130 were over 10-fold less responsive to IL-6 (EC50 = 4.8 ng/ml). The (ΔIg)gp130 transfectants, at 820 ng of IL-6/ml (a concentration corresponding to >2000-fold the EC50 of wt-gp130 transfectants), showed approximately 50% of the maximal differentiation of wt-gp130 transfectants, but maximal stimulation (and therefore their EC50) was not obtained within the concentration range of IL-6 in this assay. (GR-Ig)gp130 transfectants were essentially unresponsive to IL-6, their differentiation being indistinguishable from background levels at all concentrations of IL-6 assayed (Fig. 5 A). Stimulation with LIF induced macrophage differentiation of M1-UR21 cells transfected with wt-gp130 at low concentrations of factor (EC50 = 0.06 ng/ml) (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to IL-6, however, LIF activity was not significantly affected in cells expressing the gp130 mutants, the EC50 of (+Flag)gp130, (ΔIg)gp130, or (GR-Ig)gp130 being 0.2, 0.2, and 0.04 ng of LIF/ml, respectively. One cell line from each transfection was also analyzed for intracellular signaling, as measured by the inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription, STAT3 (Fig.6). The activation of STAT3 is a critical event in gp130-mediated terminal differentiation of M1 cells (38Min"

Although several invertebrate Ca2+ channel α1 subunits have also been cloned, their functional characteristics remain unclear, as heterologous expression of a full-length invertebrate channel has not previously been reported. We have cloned a cDNA encoding the α1 subunit of a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel from the scyphozoan jellyfishCyanea capillata, one of the earliest existing organisms to possess neural and muscle tissue. The deduced amino acid sequence of this subunit, named CyCaα1, is more similar to vertebrateL-type channels (α1S, α1C, and α1D) than to non-L-type channels (α1A, α1B, and α1E) or low voltage-activated channels (α1G). Expression of CyCaα1 in Xenopus oocytes produces a high voltage-activated Ca2+ current that, unlike vertebrateL-type currents, is only weakly sensitive to 1,4-dihydropyridine or phenylalkylamine Ca2+ channel blockers and is not potentiated by the agonist S(−)-BayK 8644. In addition, the channel is less permeable to Ba2+than to Ca2+ and is more permeable to Sr2+. CyCaα1 thus represents an ancestral L-type α1 subunit with significant functional differences from mammalian L-type channels.

CREB binds to cAMP-responsive element sequence elements (TGANNTCA) both as a homodimer and as a heterodimer in association with other members of the CREB/ATF family, including ATF-1 and the cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) (1Gonzalez G.A.

Phosphorylation of Ser133 within the kinase-inducible transcriptional activation domain of CREB is required to induce the transcriptional activity of the protein. Phosphorylation of Ser133 activates CREB, at least in part, by facilitating its binding to the 256-kDa CREB-binding protein. The CREB·CREB-binding protein complex can, in turn, interact with and activate the basal transcriptional machinery (8Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H.

Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple signaling pathways in different cell lineages can mediate the phosphorylation and activation of CREB. These include a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathway that is activated by increased intracellular cAMP (2Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar, 3Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), a calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathway in which CREB can be phosphorylated by CaM kinases II and IV (10Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and a Ras-dependent pathway in which the serine/threonine kinase RSK2 is thought to phosphorylate CREB on Ser133 (11Ginty D.D.

Recent studies have demonstrated that transcriptionally active CREB is required for the activation of normal murine T cells following engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (12Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Resting T cells contain exclusively unphosphorylated and inactive CREB. TCR cross-linking leads to the rapid and transient phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133. More important, transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative unphosphorylatable form of CREB display a profound T cell proliferative defect characterized by G1 cell cycle arrest, markedly decreased IL-2 production, and defective transcriptional induction of multiple Fos and Jun proteins (12Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). These results were consistent with other reports that demonstrated that T and B cell activation results in CREB phosphorylation and increased CREB DNA-binding activity (13Wollberg P. Soderqvist H.

Despite the importance of CREB phosphorylation in normal T cell activation, the signaling pathways that regulate CREB phosphorylation (and dephosphorylation) following TCR engagement remained unknown. In the studies described in this report, we have used pharmacological agonists and antagonists, mutant T cell lines, and transient transfection approaches to better define the signaling pathways that regulate CREB phosphorylation in thymocytes and T cells. Our results show that although CREB can be independently phosphorylated by at least three distinct signaling pathways in T cells, TCR cross-linking appears to mediate CREB phosphorylation via a signaling pathway involving the activation of p56lck , protein kinase C, Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and RSK2. CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Four to eight-week-old animals were used in the studies described in this report. Animals were maintained in the University of Chicago laboratory animal barrier facility in micro-isolator cages. All animal experimentation was carried out according to NIH guidelines and was approved by the animal care committee of the University of Chicago. The JCAM-1 and JCAM-1/p409lck cell lines were a generous gift from Dr. David Straus (University of Chicago). Jurkat and JCAM-1 T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mmglutamate, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. JCAM-1/p409lck cells were grown in the presence of G418 (1 mg/ml) and hygromycin (250 μg/ml). Murine splenic T cells were purified using a commercially available T cell column (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting cells were >90% CD3+ as assessed by flow cytometry. Single cell suspensions of thymocytes and splenic T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mmglutamate, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 0.05 mm2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C. Splenic T cells and thymocytes (4 × 106 cells/ml) were activated by treatment with plastic-immobilized anti-CD3 mAb 145.2C11 (16 μg/ml), PMA (10 ng/ml), or ionomycin (0.5 μg/ml). Jurkat T cells were activated by treatment with plastic-immobilized OKT3 antibody (10 μg/ml). Experiments using inhibitors involved preincubation with each inhibitor for 30 min at 37 °C prior to activation. The concentrations of inhibitors used were as follows: bisindolylmaleimide I, 12 μm; H-7, 10 μm; H-8, 10 μm; KN-93, 1 μm; W-7, 25 μm, chelerythrine chloride, 4 μm; and PD98059, 50 μm. Exponentially growing Jurkat T cells (107) were transiently transfected using a commercially available eletroporator (Bio-Rad; 250 V, 950 microfarads) with 25 μg of an expression vector encoding Gal4-CREB either alone or together with eukaryotic expression vectors encoding wild-type RSK2 (pMT2-HARSK2), a catalytically inactive mutant RSK2 (pMT2-HARSK2(KR100)) (a kind gift from Dr. M. E. Greenberg, Harvard Medical School), constitutively active p21v-Ha-ras , a dominant-negative N17Ras, or a dominant-negative Raf-1 (21Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) containing an ATP-binding site mutation in the catalytic domain. Following electroporation, the cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C (1 × 106cells/ml), divided into aliquots, and then activated as described above. Activated cell extracts were used for Western blot analyses as described below. Anti-murine CD3 (145.2C11) and anti-human CD3 (OKT3) antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). PMA, ionomycin, forskolin, H-7 (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride), H-8 (N-(2-[methylamino]ethyl)-5-isoquiolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride), bisindolylmaleimide I, chelerythrine chloride, KN-93 (2-[N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)]amino-N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylbenzylamine), and W-7 (N-6-aminohexyl-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide HCl) were purchased from Calbiochem. Protein samples corresponding to 2 × 106 T cells were lysed in 50 μl of sample buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.008% bromphenol blue). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (21Muthusamy N. Barton K. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22MacNicol A.M. Muslin A.J. Williams L.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 571-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated CREB was detected using two different anti-phosphopeptide antibodies that have each been shown previously to react specifically and exclusively with the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB: (i) a rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody, α-pCREB (1:3000 dilution; a generous gift from Dr. M. E. Greenberg) (23Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), and (ii) a commercially available rabbit polyclonal IgG prepared against a Ser133 phospho-CREB peptide (amino acids 123–136, KRREILSRRP(pS)YRK; 1:3000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoreactivity was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:2500 dilution; Life Technologies, Inc.) using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). A rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of CREB (α-CREB; 1:3000 dilution; a generous gift from Dr. M. E. Greenberg) was used to detect the total levels of CREB protein using identical Western blotting conditions. To assess changes in CREB phosphorylation in response to different activation signals in T cells, we performed Western blot analyses using two different rabbit polyclonal antibodies that have been shown previously to specifically and exclusively recognize the Ser133-phosphorylated form of CREB (α-pCREB) (23Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In an initial series of experiments, purified murine splenic T cells were stimulated for 1–120 min with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb (α-CD3), and the resulting cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with the α-pCREB antibody. T cell activation following TCR cross-linking by treatment with α-CD3 induced the rapid but transient phosphorylation of CREB Ser133 (Fig.1 A). Phosphorylation was observed as early as 1–2 min after TCR cross-linking, peaked within 5 min, and declined steadily over the next 2 h. Of note, total levels of CREB protein as assessed by Western blotting with an α-CREB antibody were unchanged during α-CD3-mediated T cell activation (Fig.1 A). Cross-linking of TCR with α-CD3 activates a number of distinct signaling pathways (24Janeway C.A. Bottomly K. Cell. 1994; 76: 275-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 25Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). The activation of phospholipase Cγ and subsequent phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis lead to the generation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C, whereas inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate leads to elevations of intracellular Ca2+ and subsequent activation of several calmodulin-dependent enzymes including calcineurin and CaM kinases II and IV. In addition, TCR cross-linking is known to activate the Ras signaling pathway (26D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J.

Parker P.J. Owen M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17975-17982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TCR-mediated activation of T cells can be simulated by treatment with PMA plus the Ca2+ionophore ionomycin. To determine directly which of these signaling pathways could result in CREB phosphorylation in purified normal T cells, we analyzed the effects of stimulation with PMA, ionomycin, and PMA + ionomycin on CREB phosphorylation. Incubation of purified splenic T cells with PMA and/or ionomycin resulted in the rapid phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 (Fig. 1 B). As compared with TCR cross-linking with the α-CD3 antibody, both PMA and ionomycin treatment resulted in slightly more rapid and longer lasting phosphorylation of CREB (compare the 1- and 120-min time points in Fig.1, A and B). As was the case for α-CD3-mediated activation, treatment with either PMA or ionomycin did not significantly change the total levels of CREB in splenic T cells (Fig.1 B). These results for splenic T cell activation were confirmed in thymocytes in which stimulation with α-CD3, PMA, and ionomycin each was shown to be capable of independently inducing CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 (Ref. 12Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar and data not shown). The experiments described above suggested that multiple pathways could result in CREB phosphorylation in T cells. To determine which of these pathways is required for the TCR-mediated phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133, we assessed the effects of specific protein kinase inhibitors on CREB phosphorylation following TCR cross-linking with an α-CD3 mAb. Bisindolylmaleimide I has been shown to specifically inhibit PKC activity in intact cells (32Chulak C. Couture R. Foucart S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 115: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Tang S.H. Yaney G.C. Sharp G.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 863-870PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, bisindolylmaleimide I profoundly inhibited α-CD3-mediated phosphorylation of CREB. The effect of bisindolylmaleimide I appeared to be specific for PKC because, in control experiments, the same dose of bisindolylmaleimide I inhibited PKC-induced CREB phosphorylation induced by treatment with PMA, but had no effect on PKA-mediated CREB phosphorylation induced by treatment with forskolin (Fig. 2 A). Further evidence for the critical role of PKC in TCR-mediated CREB phosphorylation came from experiments in which two additional PKC inhibitors, H-7 and chelerythrine chloride, were also shown to inhibit α-CD3-induced phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 (Fig. 2 B). These results were also in accord with a recent study that demonstrated that depletion of PKC activity by prolonged treatment of T cells with PMA abrogated CREB Ser133 phosphorylation in response to TCR cross-linking (7Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). H-8 is a specific inhibitor of PKA. As shown in Fig. 2 C, preincubation of splenic T cells with H-8 had no effect on α-CD3-mediated phosphorylation of CREB in splenic T cells. The dose of H-8 and the preincubation conditions used in these experiments were adequate because, in parallel control experiments, an identical dose of H-8 completely inhibited forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig.2 C). Thus, we conclude that PKA is not required for CREB phosphorylation following TCR engagement. KN-93 and W-7 have been shown previously to inhibit calcium-dependent CaM kinase II and calmodulin, respectively, in T cells (34Amin A.R. Swenson C.D. Xue B. Ishida Y. Nair B.G. Patel T.B. Chused T.M. Thorbecke G.J. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 152: 422-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Andrew D.P. Yoshino T. Guh L. Martin S.M. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1671-1684PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 D, W-7 completely inhibited CREB phosphorylation following treatment of purified splenic T cells with ionomycin. On the other hand, KN-93 only partially inhibited CREB phosphorylation following ionomycin treatment (Fig. 2 D). These results were consistent with previous studies that have shown that both CaM kinases II and IV can phosphorylate CREB on Ser133 (36Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1038-1043Google Scholar, 37Matthews R.P. Guthrie C.R. Wailes L.M. Zhao X. Means A.R. McKnight G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6107-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 38Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). W-7, by inhibiting both enzymes completely, blocked ionomycin-induced CREB phosphorylation, whereas KN-93, which inhibits only CaM kinase II, still allowed partial CREB phosphorylation by CaM kinase IV. In marked contrast to their effects on ionomycin-mediated CREB phosphorylation, neither KN-93 nor W-7 significantly inhibited CREB phosphorylation following TCR cross-linking with α-CD3 mAb (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that calmodulin-dependent kinases are not required for CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 following TCR cross-linking. In some cases, thymocytes and splenic T cells display disparate responses to activation signals. For example, double positive (CD4+CD8+) thymocytes undergo apoptosis in response to TCR cross-linking, whereas mature single positive (CD4+ and CD8+) peripheral T cells proliferate in response to TCR engagement. Thus, thymocytes and peripheral T cells may utilize distinct signaling pathways in response to identical activation signals. To determine directly whether thymocytes and peripheral T cells utilize different signaling pathways to mediate CREB phosphorylation in response to TCR cross-linking, we compared the effects of specific protein kinase inhibitors on TCR-mediated CREB phosphorylation in these two cell types. As was the case in peripheral T cells, both bisindolylmaleimide I and chelerythrine chloride, but not H-8 or W-7, inhibited α-CD3-induced CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 in thymocytes (Fig.3). Moreover, ionomycin-induced CREB phosphorylation in thymocytes was also completely inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist, W-7, and partially inhibited by the CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN-93. Thus, in both thymocytes and mature peripheral T cells, PKC-dependent pathways appear to be required for CREB phosphorylation following TCR cross-linking. Although studies of normal peripheral T cells and thymocytes provide the most accurate assessment of the role of specific signaling pathways in T cell activation, these cells are difficult to transfect and to genetically manipulate. Thus, it would be useful to identify an immortalized T cell line in which CREB phosphorylation could be induced by TCR cross-linking. Recent studies have demonstrated that stimulation of Jurkat T cells with the α-CD3 mAb OKT3 results in the phosphorylation of CREB specifically and exclusively on Ser133 (7Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have confirmed these findings and have shown that treatment of Jurkat cells with α-CD3 mAb, PMA, or ionomycin induces CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 (Fig.4, A and B). Thus, wild-type and mutant Jurkat cells represent a useful model system for studying CREB phosphorylation in a cultured cell line. p56lck , a T cell-restricted member of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases, is known to play an important early role in TCR-mediated signal transduction. Cross-linking of TCR leads to the rapid activation of p56lck , which in turn phosphorylates and activates the protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP70. Activation of p56lck and ZAP70 is required for the subsequent activation of the calcium-, PKC-, and Ras-dependent signaling cascades that regulate T cell activation. To determine directly if p56lck is important in TCR-mediated phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133, we compared the effects of TCR cross-linking on CREB phosphorylation in wild-type Jurkat T cells and in the JCAM-1 mutant of Jurkat cells that lacks p56lck (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 B, cross-linking of TCR on JCAM-1 cells failed to induce detectable CREB phosphorylation. This was not due to a deficiency in CREB protein because JCAM-1 and wild-type Jurkat cells contained comparable levels of CREB protein as assessed by Western blot analysis with an α-CREB antibody (Fig. 4 B). More important, treatment of the p56lck -deficient JCAM-1 cells with PMA induced CREB phosphorylation that was indistinguishable from that seen in wild-type Jurkat cells (Fig. 4 C), suggesting either that PKC lies downstream of p56lck in the CREB activation pathway or that PKC and p56lck belong to parallel pathways that regulate CREB activation following TCR stimulation. The critical role of p56lck in CREB phosphorylation following TCR cross-linking was confirmed in experiments in which TCR-mediated CREB phosphorylation was rescued in JCAM-1 cells following stable transfection with a p56lck expression vector (Fig.4 B, compare JCAM-1 and JCAM-1/p409 lck). Taken together, these experiments demonstrated a critical role for p56lck in TCR-mediated CREB Ser133phosphorylation. Ligand binding to many growth factor receptors results in the activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to stimulation of a Ras-dependent kinase cascade that includes sequential phosphorylation and activation of Raf, MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (pp90rsk or RSK) (38Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 39Blemis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Activated MAPKs as well as members of the pp90rsk family are known to translocate to the nucleus and to phosphorylate several transcription factors (39Blemis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 40Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, a Ras-dependent Ser/Thr protein kinase has been shown to phosphorylate CREB in response to nerve growth factor stimulation (11Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses showed this CREB kinase to be identical to the Ser/Thr protein kinase RSK2 (41Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The p21ras pathway is known to be rapidly activated in response to TCR engagement by both PKC-dependent and protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways (42Downwarrd J. Graves J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 89-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 43Rao A. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 10: 495-520PubMed Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that Ras and RSK2 might be important for CREB phosphorylation in response to TCR engagement. To more directly determine the role of p21ras in TCR-induced CREB phosphorylation, we co-transfected Jurkat T cells with an expression vector encoding a recombinant form of CREB (Gal4-CREB) and expression vectors encoding either a constitutively active Ras (CA-Ras) or a dominant-negative mutant Ras protein, N17Ras (DN-Ras). The difference in the size of Gal4-CREB and endogenous CREB made it possible to distinguish the two molecules by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Co-transfection with CA-Ras and Gal4-CREB resulted in CREB phosphorylation, even in the absence of TCR engagement (Fig.5 A). More important, expression of DN-Ras markedly inhibited α-CD3-induced phosphorylation of Gal4-CREB (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, α-CD3 (but not CA-Ras)-induced CREB phosphorylation was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, suggesting that Ras lies downstream of PKC in the CREB activation pathway in T cells (Fig. 5 A). These results were not due simply to differences in transfection efficiencies or to levels of expression of Gal4-CREB in the different transfected cell cultures because identical results were observed in at least three independent transfection experiments. Activated Ras is known to activate Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK in T cells. To assess the role of Raf-1 in TCR-mediated CREB phosphorylation, we co-transfected Jurkat T cells with Gal4-CREB and a vector encoding a dominant-negative form of Raf-1 (Fig. 5 B). Overexpression of the dominant-negative Raf-1 form inhibited α-CD3-mediated CREB phosphorylation. This result was not due to differences in transfection efficiencies or levels of expression of the Gal4-CREB protein because an aliquot of the same culture of doubly transfected cells (Gal4-CREB + dominant-negative Raf-1) stimulated with forskolin demonstrated significant Gal4-CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). To assess the role of MEK/MAPK in CREB phosphorylation following TCR cross-linking, we tested the effects of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 on CREB phosphorylation in normal T cells following activation with either α-CD3 or forskolin. As shown in Fig. 6, PD98059 inhibited CREB Ser133 phosphorylation in response to TCR cross-linking, but had no effect on forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation. Taken together, these results were consistent with a model in which activation of Ras, Raf-1, and MEK is required for TCR-mediated CREB phosphorylation. As described above, in PC12 cells, nerve growth factor-mediated activation of Ras leads to the subsequent activation of RSK2, which in turn phosphorylates and activates CREB. To assess the role of RSK2 in the TCR-induced phosphorylation of CREB, we transfected Jurkat T cells with expression vectors encoding wild-type RSK2 or a catalytically inactive mutant of RSK2 (RSK2(KR100)) along with a Gal4-CREB expression vector. TCR-mediated stimulation of Jurkat T cells transfected with Gal4-CREB resulted in low level phosphorylation of Gal4-CREB (Fig.7 A, eighth lane). Phosphorylation of Gal4-CREB was dramatically increased by co-transfection of the wild-type RSK2 expression vector (Fig. 7 A, twelfth lane). This increase in Gal4-CREB phosphorylation required a kinase-active form of RSK2 because it was not observed in cells co-transfected with catalytically inactive RSK2(KR100) (Fig. 7 A, fourteenth lane). These differences in Gal4-CREB phosphorylation were not due to differences in transfection efficiencies or levels of expression of Gal4-CREB because treatment of an aliquot of each transfected culture with forskolin induced comparable levels of Gal4-CREB phosphorylation, whether or not the cells were co-transfected with the RSK2 expression vector (Fig. 7 A, compareninth, twelfth, and fifteenth lanes). Thus, the effects of RSK2 overexpression on CREB phosphorylation were specific for TCR-mediated activation. In addition, the RSK2-dependent phosphorylation of CREB in response to α-CD3 stimulation required activation of PKC because bisindolylmaleimide I, but not H-8, inhibited Gal4-CREB phosphorylation in cells co-transfected with the RSK2 expression vector and stimulated by TCR engagement (Fig. 7 B). Taken together, these experiments demonstrated that RSK2 participates in the TCR-mediated phosphorylation of CREB and suggested that RSK2 and PKC may belong to a common signaling pathway. Finally, TCR-mediated Gal4-CREB phosphorylation in Jurkat cells transfected with RSK2 was abrogated by co-transfection with a dominant-negative Ras expression vector (Fig.7 C), confirming the requirement for Ras in RSK2-dependent, α-CD3-induced CREB Ser133phosphorylation. Activation of pre-existing CREB by phosphorylation on Ser133 is one of the early events in the signaling pathways activated by engagement of the T cell antigen receptor. This rapid and transient activation of CREB is critically important for the normal transcriptional induction of specific AP1 family members, the transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene, and subsequent cell cycle progression and T cell proliferation (12Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the studies described in this report, we have investigated the signaling pathways responsible for CREB phosphorylation in normal peripheral T cells and thymocytes. Our results demonstrate that CREB phosphorylation in these cells can be mediated by at least three distinct pathways: (i) a PKA-dependent pathway that can be simulated by treatment with forskolin and blocked by H-8, (ii) a calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathway that can be simulated by treatment with ionomycin and blocked by W-7, and (iii) a PKC-dependent pathway that can be simulated by treatment with PMA and blocked by chelerythrine chloride, H-7, and bisindolylmaleimide I. Despite the multiplicity of signaling pathways that are capable of mediating CREB phosphorylation in T cells, our experiments are consistent with a model in which CREB phosphorylation and activation are mediated by a single signaling pathway that requires activation of p56lck , PKC, Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and RSK2. Our conclusion that activation of PKC is required for TCR-mediated CREB Ser133 phosphorylation is based on the use of pharmacological inhibitors that could potentially have effects on multiple signal transduction molecules. However, the validity of our conclusions concerning the role of PKC is supported by the following considerations: (i) three different inhibitors of PKC abrogated TCR-mediated CREB phosphorylation, whereas three inhibitors of PKA and calcium/calmodulin kinase pathways had no effect on CREB phosphorylation following TCR cross-linking; (ii) in parallel control experiments, PKC inhibitors had no effect on forskolin- or ionomycin-mediated CREB phosphorylation in the same cells; and (iii) our results in normal T cells and thymocytes are consistent with a previous report that demonstrated that depletion of activated PKC by prolonged treatment of Jurkat T cells with PMA also abrogated TCR-mediated CREB Ser133 phosphorylation (7Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Moreover, the previous finding of the importance of PKC in mediating CREB phosphorylation following immunoglobulin cross-linking in B cells suggests that common signaling pathway(s) may regulate CREB activation in response to antigen receptor cross-linking in these two different lymphoid cell lineages (15Xie H. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for p21ras in TCR-mediated induction of the IL-2 gene and T cell proliferation (26D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J.

Our results demonstrate that Ras, Raf-1, and MEK also play critical roles in the TCR-mediated activation of CREB in T cells. Specifically, we have shown that (i) expression of constitutively active Ras resulted in the phosphorylation of CREB even in the absence of TCR signaling; (ii) TCR-induced phosphorylation of CREB was inhibited by expression of dominant-negative mutant Ras or Raf-1 proteins as well as by PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK; and (iii) expression of the dominant-negative Ras protein also abrogated the RSK2-dependent phosphorylation of CREB following TCR engagement. Although our findings do not allow us to definitively conclude whether Ras lies upstream or downstream of RSK2 in the CREB activation pathway, by analogy with the PC12 system (11Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 41Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), we would propose a model in which TCR engagement leads to the activation of Ras, Raf-1, and MEK, which in turn results in RSK2 activation. At least two signaling pathways have been shown to be capable of activating p21ras in response to TCR engagement (26D'Ambrosio D. Cantrell D.A. Frati L. Santoni A. Testi R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A.

Med. 1992; 176: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The first of these requires protein-tyrosine kinases and can be blocked by inhibitors such as herbimycin. The second pathway appears to be unique to T cells and involves the activation p21ras by PKC. Our findings that PKC inhibitors block TCR-mediated CREB phosphorylation but fail to block CREB phosphorylation in response to expression of constitutively active p21ras and that expression of dominant-negative N17Ras also blocks TCR-mediated CREB phosphorylation suggest that PKC-mediated activation of p21ras is important for TCR-mediated activation of CREB. When considered in the context of our current understanding of TCR-mediated signaling pathways, our results suggest the following working model for TCR-mediated CREB activation. Cross-linking of TCR leads to the rapid activation of p56lck , which results in the activation of PKC. Activated PKC in turn leads to the activation of Ras-Raf-1-MEK-MAPK. Activated MAPK then activates RSK2, which phosphorylates CREB on Ser133. It should be emphasized that such a straightforward linear signaling model is likely oversimplified and that several features of the model remain untested or unproved. For example, the pathways by which activated p56lck leads to PKC activation remain unclear, as do the links between PKC and Ras. Similarly, we have not formally demonstrated the relationship between activated MAPK and RSK2 activation in T cells, nor have we demonstrated that RSK2 directly phosphorylates CREB Ser133 in vivo. Despite these caveats, our results have identified a number of the critical signaling components that regulate CREB activation following stimulation through the T cell antigen receptor, and our working model suggests future experiments designed to more precisely elucidate this important T cell signaling pathway. The inhibition of T cell activation is important for the treatment of both autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection. Currently available immunosuppressive agents target the calcineurin-dependent activation of NFAT (e.g. cyclosporin A) or the pathway that leads to the activation of NF-κB (e.g. glucocorticoids and aspirin). Given the importance of CREB phosphorylation in T cell activation, the CREB activation pathway described herein represents a potentially novel target for the development of immunosuppressive drugs. To obtain specificity, it will likely be important to inhibit distal parts of the pathway that are specific for CREB phosphorylation rather than proximal signaling molecules such as PKC or Ras, which play more generalized roles in cellular homeostasis in many mammalian cell lineages. Nevertheless, our previous finding that expression of a dominant-negative (unphosphorylatable) form of CREB markedly inhibits IL-2 expression and T cell proliferation (12Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) suggests that specific inhibitors of this pathway may have potent immunosuppressive effects. We thank Drs. A. MacNicol, M.

https://openalex.org/W2320961257,"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is characterized by heterozygous germline mutations in the p53 gene. Accompanied by genomic instability and loss or mutation of the remaining wild type p53 allele, a low frequency of spontaneous immortalization in LFS fibroblasts occurs. It is believed that the loss of p53 wild type function contributes to immortalization of these LFS fibroblasts, but it is not clear if this is sufficient. Because stabilization of telomere length is also thought to be a necessary step in immortalization, telomerase activity, expression of the telomerase RNA component (hTR) and telomere length were analysed at various passages during the spontaneous immortalization of LFS skin fibroblasts. One LFS strain which immortalized, MDAH087 (087), had no detectable telomerase activity whereas another LFS strain which immortalized, MDAH041 (041), had detectable telomerase activity. In preimmortal cells from both strains, hTR was not detected by in situ hybridization. Immortal 087 cells remained negative for hTR, while immortal 041 cells demonstrated strong hTR in situ hybridization signals. 087 cells had long and heterogenous telomeres whereas telomeres of 041 cells had short, stable telomere lengths. Tumorigenicity studies in nude mice with ras-transformed 087 and 041 cells resulted in both cell lines giving rise to tumors and retaining telomerase status. Overall these results suggest that strain specificity may be important in telomerase re-activation and that both abrogation of p53 function and a mechanism to maintain telomeres are necessary for immortalization."
https://openalex.org/W2322632282,"The TrkA receptor protein tyrosine kinase is involved in signalling PC12 cell differentiation and cessation of cell division in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). To assess the importance of adaptor proteins and Ras in NGF control of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase), specific receptor mutations in Trk have been employed. We show that phosphorylation of tyrosine 490, but not 785, of Trk is essential for activation of both Ras and PI 3-kinase in vivo, correlating with tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and binding of Shc to the adaptor Grb2 and the Ras exchange factor Sos. A mutant receptor that lacks Y490 and Y785, but contains an introduced YxxM motif which binds the regulatory domain of PI 3-kinase, is unable to activate Ras despite causing increased PI 3-kinase activity. This indicates clearly that activation of PI 3-kinase by itself is not sufficient to cause activation of Ras, arguing against a model in which PI 3-kinase acts upstream of Ras. The Shc site of Trk is thus crucial for the activation of Ras and PI 3-kinase."

We show here that ATF-2 binds the PEPCK-C CRE-1 element, that sense ATF-2 expression correlates with increased promoter activity, and that antisense ATF-2 expression correlates with decreased promoter activity. Furthermore, expression of p38β MAP kinase, a known modifier of ATF-2, correlates with increased reporter activity, while cotransfection of p38β MAP kinase and ATF-2 shows augmented transcriptional activation.

Cells were incubated with DNA precipitates for 16 h, washed, and maintained in complete medium 48 h prior to harvest. Relative luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described (21Shuman J.D. Cheong J. Coligan J.E. J. Biol.

In all cases, transfection data represent the mean of three independent experiments, where error bars indicate the S.D. of the mean. Fao cells were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and 30–50 μg of nuclear protein was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21235-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported to bind the PEPCK-C CRE-1 element (Fig.1 A) (13Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J.D. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Notably, the CRE-1 site matches the consensus sequence reported for ATF-2 homodimers (Fig.1 A) (20Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) rather than the CREB or AP1 consensus sequences. Because ATF-2 expression was recently demonstrated in rat liver (21Shuman J.D. Cheong J. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12793-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we wondered if it bound the CRE-1 site. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the slowest migrating shift produced with hepatoma nuclear extracts (lane 1) is supershifted when anti-ATF-2 serum is included in the binding reaction (lane 3). By comparison, C/EBPα, a factor reported to bind this site, also produces a supershift complex (lane 2) upon inclusion of specific antiserum. However, the C/EBPα supershift complex is not abundant and the band from which the supershift complex derives is not obvious. To demonstrate the expected migration positions for these protein-nucleic acid complexes, shift reactions were formed with full-length C/EBPα and ATF-2 prepared byin vitro transcription-coupled translation (lanes 4 and 5, respectively). These results demonstrate that ATF-2, like C/EBPα, binds the CRE-1 element in the PEPCK-C promoter. To determine what effect, if any, ATF-2 might have on PEPCK-C promoter activity, we transfected Fao hepatoma cells with a luciferase reporter construct encompassing −275 to +73 of the PEPCK promoter (Fig. 1 A) (27Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9657-9664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region contains the CRE-1 motif as well as the P3(I) motif, both reported binding sites for C/EBPα. As shown in Fig. 2 A, luciferase activity increased up to 4-fold with increasing amounts of transfected sense ATF-2 expression plasmid. To extend these observations, we cotransfected the reporter vector with increasing amounts of antisense ATF-2 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2 B, basal reporter activity decreased about 2-fold when cells were cotransfected with plasmid encoding antisense ATF-2. The Western blot (Fig. 2 C) shows nuclear extracts from a representative transfection experiment and demonstrates that ATF-2 protein levels decrease upon antisense ATF-2 expression (lane 2) and increase upon sense ATF-2 expression (lane 3) relative to steady state ATF-2 levels (lane 1). These results are consistent with a role for ATF-2 in the regulation of PEPCK-C gene expression. ATF-2 is a known substrate for p38 MAP kinases (26Jiang Y. Chen C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), a subfamily of stress-activated protein kinases in the MAP kinase family (30Han J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of p38β expression on a reporter construct containing the minimal thymidine kinase promoter modified by proximal insertion of two ATF-2 consensus sites (2× CRE-1-Luc) (21Shuman J.D. Cheong J. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12793-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, p38β MAP kinase expression correlated with an 8-fold increase in 2× CRE-1-Luc reporter activity. This is comparable with expression of ATF-2 alone, which stimulates activity approximately 10-fold. When ATF-2 and p38β MAP kinase are cotransfected, reporter activity increased about 24-fold. In contrast, expression of a transfected p38β MAP kinase “dead” mutant showed activity that was comparable with basal levels (data not shown). These results suggest that p38β MAP kinase augments ATF-2 activity in Fao hepatoma cells. We next tested the PEPCK −275 reporter, which shows much higher basal levels of transcription despite the fact that cultures were propagated in the presence of complete medium (serum and glucose), repressing conditions for PEPCK-C expression. As shown in Fig. 3 B, p38β MAP kinase alone stimulates transcription about 2-fold. This result is comparable with the 2-fold effect observed upon expression of ATF-2 alone. Upon cotransfection, ATF-2 and p38β MAP kinase stimulate PEPCK −275 reporter activity about 5-fold. These results are analogous to those obtained using the minimal promoter/reporter construct, although they show lower levels of transcriptional activation. This is likely due to endogenous factors that contribute to regulation of the PEPCK-C promoter. Given the level of induction observed, the results are consistent with the notion that ATF-2 functions in maintenance of PEPCK-C transcription, likely during conditions that activate a stress-inducible MAP kinase pathway(s). As a specificity control for the effects we observed with p38β MAP kinase, we cotransfected protein kinase A or p42 ERK-1 with ATF-2. As shown in Fig. 4, expression of protein kinase A alone showed reporter activity twice basal. This is not surprising, as PEPCK-C is a known target for cAMP mediated effects. When ATF-2 was cotransfected with PKA, activity was 2.7 times basal, which is equivalent to ATF-2 alone (2.5-fold). Similar results were obtained with p42 ERK-1, which shows activity that is equivalent to basal (1.5 times basal). When ATF-2 is cotransfected, reporter activity increases 2.6-fold, again, equivalent to ATF-2 alone. These observations argue that the transcriptional augmentation we observed with ATF-2 and p38β MAP kinase is not generalizable to any protein kinase, but is restricted to stress activated protein kinases. Because sodium arsenite activates p38 MAP kinases (32Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), a finding we confirmed in Fao cells using antipeptide sera specific for phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase (data not shown), we wondered if PEPCK-C promoter activity would be impacted. As a first test, Fao cells transfected with the PEPCK −275 reporter gene were cultured 48 h in complete medium followed by treatment with 50 μm sodium arsenite for 6 h. As shown in Fig.5, promoter activity after arsenite treatment was comparable with that observed following transfection of ATF-2. However, when ATF-2 transfectants were subjected to treatment with sodium arsenite, a larger increase (4.4-fold) in luciferase activity was observed. Importantly, transcriptional effects observed after arsenite treatment were blocked in cells transfected with an antisense ATF-2 expression plasmid. These results are consistent with the interpretation that stressors, which activate the p38 MAP kinase pathway, contribute to maintenance of PEPCK-C transcription. The CRE-1 site located between −100 and −80 of the PEPCK-C promoter is a perfect match to the consensus binding sequence reported for ATF-2 homodimers (20Benbrook D.M. Jones N.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and ATF-2 is one of the transcription factors in hepatoma cell nuclear extracts that binds this sequence in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Consistent with this, sense and antisense ATF-2 transfections increase and decrease, respectively, reporter gene activity driven by the PEPCK-C promoter. Preserving glucose homeostasis is crucial to organismal survival, as PEPCK-C catalyzes a step regulating entry of metabolites into the gluconeogenic pathway. This reaction is a liver-specific function that is maintained during stress, for example, PEPCK-C mRNA increased 5-fold following two-thirds resection of the liver (19Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a previous report concluding that oxidative stress induced by sodium arsenite and/or hydrogen peroxide selectively repressed PEPCK-C expression in hepatoma cells (34Sutherland C. Tebbey P.W. Granner D.K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), our observations are consistent with a function for ATF-2 in maintaining PEPCK-C expression during stress conditions. Because of grossly differing choices of methodology it is difficult to reconcile the opposing results, but should be noted that the previous report initiated assays of PEPCK-C expression from conditions that are maximally inducing, whereas our studies initiated assays from culture conditions that repress promoter activity to basal levels. ATF-2 is expressed in most tissues, is a substrate for stress-inducible MAP kinases (both the p38 and the stress-activated protein/JNK subfamilies), and exhibits increased transcription activating and DNA binding activities in the phosphorylated form (23Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 24van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The p38 MAP kinases and the JNKs modify the same residues in ATF-2, Thr69/71 and Ser90 (35Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Although the studies presented here were limited to p38 MAP kinases, we expect that JNK MAP kinases would result in a similar augmentation of ATF-2-dependent transcription. Starting from conditions that are repressing for endogenous PEPCK-C activity, serum and high glucose, we observed stimulation of PEPCK-C promoter activity by transfection of ATF-2 alone or p38β MAP kinase alone. When ATF-2 and p38β MAP kinase were cotransfected, augmented transcriptional activation was observed. Failure to observe augmented transcription with PKA and ATF-2 or with ERK-1 and ATF-2 indicates that the transcriptional increase was specific. In addition, treatment of Fao cells (in the presence of serum) with sodium arsenite, an activator of p38 MAP kinases, resulted in a similar increase over basal promoter activity. The fact that this effect was eliminated upon expression of antisense ATF-2 again indicates specificity. These results support a role for ATF-2 in the maintenance of PEPCK-C expression in hepatocytes in response to extracellular signals that activate stress-inducible MAP kinases. Our studies are consistent with available results from gene deletion experiments. Homozygous deletion of the genes encoding transcription factors CREB, CREM, C/EBPβ, and D-site-binding protein show no obvious defect in glucose homeostasis (2Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of the gene for C/EBPα results in hypoglycemia, failure to store liver glycogen, failure to develop fat tissue, and lethality. (17Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). However, C/EBPα is neither an acute phase-reactive protein (36Alam T. An M.R. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5021-5034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nor does it's expression increase following partial hepatectomy (19Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, C/EBPα decreases under both of these conditions, consistent with observations regarding its antiproliferative effects in cell lines (37Mischoulon D. Rana B. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 39Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J. Science. 1992; 256: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although C/EBPβ expression increases after partial hepatectomy (19Diehl A.M. Yang S.Q. Yin M. Lin H.Z. Nelson S. Bagby G. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar), it is not a known substrate for stress-induced MAP kinases, suggesting that C/EBP proteins and CREB/CREM proteins are not likely activators of PEPCK-C expression during conditions of stress. Although transcriptional effects observed in cell culture systems do not always faithfully reflect regulation as it occurs in vivo (2Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), our studies support a role for ATF-2 as a regulator of the hepatocyte PEPCK-C promoter during conditions of stress.

Both sequences matched with 100% identity nucleotide sequences of expressed sequence tags from human placenta and rat PC-12 cells. Two CRHSP-24 transcripts of 0.7 and 2.9 kilobases were detected in multiple rat tissues by Northern analysis, whereas a single 24-kDa protein was observed by Western blotting. The CRHSP-24 protein is 147 amino acids in length, is composed of nearly 14% proline, and is phosphorylated entirely on serine residues. Western analysis and 32P metabolic labeling of acini revealed CRHSP-24 to be maximally phosphorylated in control cells and to undergo a rapid sustained dephosphorylation on at least 3 serine residues in response to calcium-mobilizing stimuli. Dephosphorylation of CRHSP-24 was completely inhibited by pretreatment of acini with cyclosporin A or FK506. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of FK506 were blocked by excess rapamycin.

Calcineurin, also known as protein phosphatase-2B, is unique among the serine/threonine protein phosphatases because its activity is highly regulated by calcium and calmodulin. This enzyme is a heterodimer composed of a 19-kDa regulatory subunit and 60-kDa catalytic subunit, the latter of which binds calmodulin (reviewed in Refs. 1Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol.

As the holoenzyme is activated by high nanomolar/low micromolar concentrations of calcium in vitro, calcineurin is believed to be relatively inactive in cells under basal conditions of low intracellular calcium and then becomes activated following stimulation with calcium-mobilizing agonists (7Stemmer P.M.

Thus, in contrast to the apparent multitude of cellular substrates for the type 1 and 2A serine/threonine phosphatases in cells (3Cohen P. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), relatively few in vivo cellular targets of calcineurin have been described, especially outside of the nervous system. Pancreatic acinar cells are among the most well characterized electrically non-excitable cell types that utilize calcium as a primary mode of intracellular signaling. These highly differentiated epithelial cells are responsible for the synthesis, packaging, storage, and regulated secretion of digestive enzymes (27Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Go V.-L.W. Dimagno E.P. Gardner J.D. Lebenthal E. Reber H.A. Scheele G.A. The Pancreas, Pathology and Disease. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 167-189Google Scholar). CsA was previously shown to inhibit calcineurin activity and calcium-stimulated secretion in acutely isolated rat acinar cells (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using 32P metabolic labeling and two-dimensional electrophoresis, it was found that calcineurin inhibition specifically blocked the secretagogue-induced dephosphorylation of a 24-kDa cytosolic phosphoprotein while having no discernible effects on other phosphoproteins. This protein was further characterized as a calcineurin substrate by demonstrating its selectivein vitro dephosphorylation in acinar cell lysates prepared in the presence of okadaic acid and EDTA to inhibit other serine/threonine protein phosphatases (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study describes the purification and characterization of this novel phosphoprotein, termed CRHSP-24 for calcium-regulatedheat-stable protein with a molecular mass of 24 kDa. Poly(A) RNA from rat pancreas and the rat multi-tissue poly(A) RNA Northern blot were purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Cyclosporin A was a gift from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (East Hanover, NJ). FK506 was purchased from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and rapamycin from LC Laboratories (Worburn, MA). The pGEX-Kt expression vector was a gift from Dr. J. Dixon. Human expressed sequence tag clone 143057 containing CRHSP-24 was provided by the WashU-Merck EST Project (St. Louis, MO) and distributed through the Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genome Expression Consortium, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Rat expressed sequence tag clone 106032 was provided by the Institute for Genomic Research (Gaithersburg, MD). Antibody production was conducted at the Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory Inc. (Canadensis, PA). Pancreatic acinar cells were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats (28Burnham D.B. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10523-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described previously (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol.

These compounds were added to cells, creating a final vehicle concentration of 0.1%; control cells received equal final concentrations of vehicle. Tissues were suspended in ∼5 volumes of lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer. Tissue homogenates were kept on ice for 30 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 30 min. Protein concentrations of the resulting supernatants were determined using a Bio-Rad assay. Lysates were dissolved in 4× concentrated SDS buffer, creating a final concentration of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% (v/v) glycerol, and then boiled for 4 min. Heat-stable protein prepared from 32P-labeled acinar cells was separated by two-dimensional PAGE (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wishart M.J. Groblewski G.E. Goke B.J. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. Am. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the phosphoamino acid content of the CRHSP-24 isoforms was analyzed as described previously (30Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Purification was conducted in batches of 100 or 200 rat pancreases. Each pancreas was removed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored for 24 h at −40 °C before use. Frozen pancreases were homogenized in 5 volumes of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.25m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. Heat-stable protein was prepared from the soluble fraction as described (yielding ∼125 mg of heat-stable protein/100 pancreases) (30Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Heat-stable protein isolated from 32P-labeled acinar cells was then added to the unlabeled material in order to identify CRHSP-24 throughout the purification procedure. The combined extracts were adjusted with 100% trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min. The soluble fraction was further adjusted to 2.5% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h, and the precipitated protein (∼20 mg of total protein/100 pancreases), containing CRHSP-24, was recovered by a second centrifugation. The pellet was washed with 100% ethanol and then suspended in 10–20 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, creating a final pH of 6.8 at room temperature. Using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus, the extract was loaded on to a Mono-Q anion-exchange column that had been equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and then eluted with a 0–200 mm NaCl linear gradient at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. CRHSP-24 was recovered in the 0–160 mm NaCl fraction (containing ∼2 mg of total protein/100 pancreases). Eluted proteins were filtered through a Centriplus Mr100,000 cutoff membrane and then concentrated in a Centriprep-10 concentrating tube. Proteins were separated on multiple lanes (350–400 μg/lane) of 12.5% SDS gels using a Bio-Rad II preparative electrophoresis apparatus. Following SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The portion of each gel corresponding to CRHSP-24 was excised with a razor and rehydrated in electroelution buffer (25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS). Proteins were eluted from the gel pieces using a Bio-Rad electroelution apparatus and then electrodialyzed overnight in the absence of SDS. Approximately 12 μg of bovine serum albumin was added to the combined eluants, and the proteins were concentrated in a Centricon-10 tube. SDS was further removed by passing the sample through an Extractigel column (Pierce). The sample was then reconcentrated and diluted in two-dimensional PAGE solubilization buffer (29Wishart M.J. Groblewski G.E. Goke B.J. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G676-G686PubMed Google Scholar). Using this procedure, proteins that had been purified from a total of 600 rat pancreases were combined, run on two separate two-dimensional PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 40% methanol and 1% acetic acid and then destained in 50% methanol and washed extensively with water. CRHSP-24 isoforms were excised and digested with trypsin (31Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described (30Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing was conducted at the Michigan State University Protein Sequencing Facility using an Applied Biosystems Model 494 automated protein sequencer. The 441-nucleotide coding sequence of rat CRHSP-24 was inserted into a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) pGEX-Kt bacterial expression vector as described previously (30Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing verified that the coding sequences for GST and CRHSP-24 were in frame. GST-CRHSP-24 fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli BL21/DE3 by induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at room temperature. Recombinant CRHSP-24 was purified from bacterial lysates by glutathione affinity chromatography and thrombin cleavage as described previously (30Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western analysis was conducted as described previously (30Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing of whole cell lysates prepared in two-dimensional sample buffer was conducted using a Bio-Rad mini-isoelectric focusing cell as recommended by the manufacturer. Anti-rat polyclonal GST-CRHSP-24 antiserum was characterized and used at a final dilution of 1:1000 in combination with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000). Northern analysis was conducted using the32P-labeled rat CRHSP-24 cDNA as a probe as described (32). Rat pancreatic acini were fixed on ice for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% formaldehyde, prepared from paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, acini were rinsed in PBS, cryoprotected in sucrose, and frozen after centrifugation in a mixture of 20% sucrose and Tissue-Tek OCT embedding medium (Miles Laboratories Inc., Elkhart, IN) as described previously (33Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538PubMed Google Scholar). Procedures for immunofluorescence microscopy with 5-μm-thick cryostat sections were as described previously in detail (33Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538PubMed Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 2% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to CRHSP-24 were used at dilutions ranging from 0.5 to 1 μg/ml. After antibody incubations and rinsing, sections were mounted under coverslips with a 3:1 mixture of glycerol and PBS containing 4 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine and viewed by conventional epifluorescence microscopy (Leitz Aristoplan). Images were digitized and processed using Photoshop 3.0 software (Adobe, Mountain View, CA). Based on its isoelectric focusing pattern, CRHSP-24 was determined to be phosphorylated on multiple residues in control cells and to undergo a pronounced alkaline shift in response to the calcium-mobilizing secretagogue cholecystokinin (CCK) (Fig.1) or treatment with calcium ionophore (data not shown). In the basal state, CRHSP-24 was maximally phosphorylated and predominantly present as its most acidic isoform (Fig. 1, spot 1, pI 6.2). Following stimulation of cells with CCK, there was a large decrease in the phosphate content of spot 1, with significant increases in the intensities of three more alkaline isoforms of CRHSP-24 (spots 2–4, pI 6.3, 6.5, and 6.8, respectively). Phosphoamino acid analysis of each of the CRHSP-24 isoforms before and after CCK treatment revealed the protein to be phosphorylated entirely on serine residues (Fig. 1). The absence of tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). Collectively, the presence of the four phospho isoforms of CRHSP-24 as seen by isoelectric focusing indicates that the protein is phosphorylated on a minimum of 4 separate serine residues in acinar cells. Efforts to identify CRHSP-24 using specific antibodies to candidate phosphoproteins were unsuccessful, suggesting that CRHSP-24 was novel. Therefore, the amino acid sequence of CRHSP-24 was elucidated by purifying the protein from a large-scale preparation of over 600 rat pancreases. Purification was facilitated by the thermal stability of CRHSP-24 as well as its high solubility in aqueous solutions. As a final step in the procedure, CRHSP-24 was immobilized to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye and autoradiography (data not shown). Microgram quantities of CRHSP-24 were obtained from each of the three most acidic phospho isoforms of the protein (Fig. 1, spots 1–3). These pieces of membrane were combined and treated with trypsin; the resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig.2 A). Eluant fractions containing CRHSP-24 peptides were submitted for microsequence analysis. High quality sequence was obtained from two peptides of 19 and 20 amino acids in length. A search of the GenBankTM Data Bank revealed that both of the purified CRHSP-24 amino acid sequences were positioned in the same reading frame of an expressed sequence tag from a human placenta cDNA library. Upon sequencing, this 722-base pair cDNA was found to contain a Kozak consensus sequence (34Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar) positioned 12 nucleotides from the 5′-end, which aligns it with a TAG stop codon beginning at nucleotide 552. This defined coding sequence predicts a 147-amino acid protein containing both of the purified rat CRHSP-24 peptides positioned contiguously within the molecule. An expressed sequence tag from rat PC-12 cells showing high homology to the human clone was subsequently identified. This 2.9-kilobase cDNA was found to code for a protein having >96% homology to the human protein and, likewise, contained both of the purified peptide sequences (Fig.2 C). In addition to an expanded 3′-untranslated region, the larger rat cDNA has a 30-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region that contains no other translational start sites. In the nonphosphorylated state, rat CRHSP-24 has a calculated molecular mass of 15.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.8. CRHSP-24 is predicted to be abundantly hydrophilic, consistent with its presence in the soluble fraction following high speed centrifugation. It is rich in proline, containing 20 residues that account for nearly 14% of the protein by frequency. This high proline content is especially noted in the amino terminus, where a stretch of 7 prolines is parted by a single glutamine residue. Finally, rat CRHSP-24 also contains 14 serine, 13 glycine, and 13 valine residues, which collectively constitute >27% of the protein. The CRHSP-24 protein has an ∼62% identity to the predicted coding region of a recently identified cDNA that encodes a putative double-stranded RNA-binding protein termed PIPPIN (35Casitglia D. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Cestelli A. DiLiegro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar to CRHSP-24, PIPPIN is a small (154 amino acids) hydrophilic protein that, when expressed in vitro, undergoes anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE. The highest identity between the two proteins is located carboxyl-terminal to the first 40 amino acids of CRHSP-24; conversely, a much lower identity is noted in the amino termini of the two molecules. Unlike the broad tissue distribution of CRHSP-24 (see below), the PIPPIN mRNA was found exclusively in rat brain. In addition, PIPPIN is predicted to contain two double-stranded RNA-binding domains that are partially conserved in CRHSP-24. Within one of these domains, CRHSP-24 contains a 19-amino acid region (residues 73–92) with 73% identity to the E. colicold-shock proteins. Bacterial cold-shock proteins are a family of low molecular mass (∼70 amino acids) DNA- and RNA-binding proteins that are believed to function as transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins (36Jones P.G. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The rat CRHSP-24 cDNA was used to probe a Northern blot of rat pancreas poly(A) mRNA (Fig. 3 A). Two CRHSP-24 transcripts of ∼2.9 and 0.7 kilobases were identified. The larger transcript was similar in size to the rat cDNA, suggesting that this clone potentially represents a full-length CRHSP-24 mRNA. Similarly, the smaller 0.7-kilobase message was consistent with the size of the human cDNA. An analysis of mRNA from various rat tissues indicated that both of the CRHSP-24 transcripts were present in all organs tested. CRHSP-24 mRNA was particularly abundant in pancreas, testis, liver, and lung, whereas lower levels were found in spleen, brain, and heart. Much lower amounts were seen in kidney and skeletal muscle. Similar results were obtained when analyzing the relative expression of the CRHSP-24 protein (Fig. 3 B). Immunoblotting using specific anti-rat CRHSP-24 antiserum (see below) indicated a ubiquitous expression of a single 24-kDa protein in rat. The presence of a single protein in pancreas and other tissues using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the full-length CRHSP-24 protein suggests that both of the mRNA transcripts detected by Northern blotting potentially code for the same protein and may differ in their untranslated regions. Alternatively, it is also possible that the smaller CRHSP-24 transcript codes for a homologous or alternatively spliced protein that is not recognized by the antibodies. The highest levels of CRHSP-24 protein expression occurred in pancreas, parotid gland, liver, testis, and lung, whereas the lowest levels were found in stomach, small intestinal mucosa, and kidney. The predicted coding sequence from the rat CRHSP-24 cDNA was subcloned into a pGEX-Kt expression vector and expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein. GST-CRHSP-24 was purified from bacterial lysates, and the CRHSP-24 portion was recovered by thrombin cleavage (Fig. 4 A,lane 1). Despite its predicted molecular mass of 15.8 kDa, recombinant CRHSP-24 migrated at ∼24 kDa following 12.5% SDS-PAGE, in close agreement with the size of the purified rat protein. Reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE is a property shared by a number of other heat-stable molecules, including inhibitor-1 and -2, DARPP-32 (3Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar), stathmin (37Sobel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 301-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate protein (38Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PHAS-I (39Hu C. Pang S. Kong X. Velleca M. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and CRHSP-28 (30Groblewski G.E. Wishart M.J. Yoshida M. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31502-31507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against recombinant GST-CRHSP-24 recognized a 24-kDa protein in acinar cell lysates (Fig. 4 A,lane 2), which was predominantly associated with the soluble fraction prepared from a 100,000 × gcentrifugation (compare lanes 3 and 4) and highly enriched in a heat-stable extract from acini (lane 5). This subcellular localization was unchanged by CCK treatment of acini (data not shown). Specificity of the antiserum was demonstrated by competitively inhibiting the 24-kDa signal with the addition of an excess of recombinant CRHSP-24 protein to the buffer prior to immunoblotting (lane 6). Using a standard curve generated by immunoblotting various amounts of recombinant rat CRHSP-24 (data not shown) and comparing it with the level of expression in a cell lysate, it was estimated that CRHSP-24 represents ∼0.01% of total acinar cell protein. Immunoblotting was also conducted following two-dimensional electrophoresis of 32P-labeled proteins from control and CCK-stimulated acini (Fig. 4 B). Overlaying the autoradiograph of 32P-labeled CRHSP-24 with the film from the immunoblot revealed that the antiserum recognized all of the phosphorylated isoforms of CRHSP-24. Furthermore, the pattern of the CCK-induced alkaline shift in CRHSP-24 seen by 32P labeling was readily apparent by immunoblotting, indicating that the affinity of the antiserum for CRHSP-24 was not altered by the phosphorylation state of the protein. Similar to the subcellular distribution of the protein detected by Western blotting, immunohistochemical localization of CRHSP-24 using affinity-purified antibodies showed a diffuse pattern of cytosolic staining that was most intense in the basal cytoplasm (Fig.5). Little or no staining was observed in nuclei and secretory granules (Fig. 5). Specificity of CRHSP-24 staining was evidenced by the total loss of fluorescence seen following preincubation of the antibody with a molar excess of antigen (data not shown). A similar diffuse cytosolic localization of CRHSP-24 was also detected in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC-12 cells (data not shown). The overall pattern of CRHSP-24 localization was unchanged by a 30-min KCl depolarization of PC-12 cells or CCK treatment of acini (data not shown). As CRHSP-24 was initially identified as a calcineurin substrate in acinar cells (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effects of the immunosuppressants CsA, FK506, and rapamycin to influence its phosphorylation were examined by immunoblotting following isoelectric focusing (Fig. 6). Treatment of acinar cells with CsA (1 μm) or FK506 (10 nm) either alone or in combination with rapamycin (2 μm) had no effects on CRHSP-24 phosphorylation. In contrast, treatment with 1 nm CCK or the calcium ionophore ionomycin (data not shown) stimulated a marked shift in CRHSP-24 to its three more alkaline isoforms, indicative of its dephosphorylation. The CCK-induced dephosphorylation was seen as early as 30 s and was sustained for up to 30 min in the presence of agonist (data not shown). Pretreatment of cells with CsA or FK506 prior to CCK fully inhibited the dephosphorylation of CRHSP-24, whereas rapamycin pretreatment had no effects. Conversely, excess rapamycin completely reversed the effect of FK506 to inhibit the dephosphorylation of CRHSP-24, but was unable to block the inhibitory effects of CsA. These results are in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that FK506 and rapamycin are ligands for the same intracellular receptor, yet act on different enzymes within cells, namely calcineurin and RAFT1, respectively (40Sabatini D.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1994; 78: 35-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Previously, a resistance of acinar cells to calcineurin inhibition by FK506 was reported (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This resistance was speculated to be due to a reduced concentration of FKBP12 in acini. Subsequently, it was shown that rapamycin, which also acts through FKBP12, is a potent and specific inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase in acini (41Bragado M.J. Groblewski G.E. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C101-C109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, p70 S6 kinase inhibition by rapamycin was reversed by pretreatment with excess FK506, demonstrating that these compounds are ligands for the same intracellular binding protein, but act on different signaling pathways in acini. Whether the FK506 resistance was due to a different source of the compound, its nonspecific binding to buffer components or lab ware, its hydrophobic aggregation in aqueous solution when used at micromolar concentrations, or a reversal of the FK506-FKBP12-calcineurin complex upon preparation of the lysates is uncertain. The present results are consistent with the effects of rapamycin and FK506 on p70 S6 kinase activity in acini and, furthermore, are in close agreement with the pharmacological characteristics of these compounds in immune cells. Collectively, these data strongly support a role for calcineurin in regulating CRHSP-24 phosphorylation in acini. The alkaline shift of CRHSP-24 seen following a stimulated increase in intracellular calcium is completely inhibited by pretreatment with CsA or FK506 and is perfectly reproducedin vitro by calcineurin treatment (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that at least 3 of its serine residues are susceptible to dephosphorylation by the enzyme. The absence of any additional more alkaline forms of native CRHSP-24 on immunoblot analysis also suggests that 1 of the phosphoserines is not dephosphorylated by calcineurin. Six of the 14 serine residues of CRHSP-24 are located within the first 60 amino acids, with the sequence surrounding serines 30 and 32 forming a consensus site for potential phosphorylation by a number of protein kinases, including the proline-directed kinases. Currently, the specific serine residues that are phosphorylated on CRHSP-24 as well as the specific CRHSP-24 kinase(s) are being investigated. The regulated phosphorylation of CRHSP-24 is similar to that of NFAT in T cells. Both proteins are maximally phosphorylated on serine residues in resting cells and rapidly dephosphorylated by calcineurin following a rise in free cellular calcium. Like NFAT, CRHSP-24 appears to be phosphorylated by a constitutively active kinase in acini. This is supported by metabolic labeling, showing that under basal conditions, CRHSP-24 will incorporate large amounts of 32P during a 1-h incubation of cells with radiolabeled orthophosphate. Furthermore,32P labeling in the presence of CsA has little effect on the basal phosphorylation of CRHSP-24 (data not shown), indicating that it is also constitutively dephosphorylated by a serine phosphatase other than calcineurin. These results denote a high basal turnover rate of phosphate on CRHSP-24 and also underscore that its phosphorylation is a highly regulated process in acini. Based on amino acid homologies, CRHSP-24 may play a role as a transcriptional or translational regulatory protein in acinar cells. However, in preliminary experiments, no nucleotide binding activity of either the native or recombinant CRHSP-24 protein has been detected. It should also be noted that nucleotide binding of the cloned PIPPIN protein was not demonstrated in its initial characterization, but rather was reported as a putative property of the molecule (35Casitglia D. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Cestelli A. DiLiegro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of CRHSP-24 in the soluble fraction of acinar cell lysates seen by immunoblotting, together with its diffuse immunolocalization within cells and absence from the nuclei of acini and PC-12 cells, argues against a transcriptional role for the protein. Alternatively, CsA-mediated calcineurin inhibition in acinar cells was associated with a significant decrease in calcium-stimulated amylase secretion (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both CCK-stimulated secretion and CRHSP-24 dephosphorylation were inhibited over a similar concentration range of CsA (15Groblewski G.E. Wagner A.C.C. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As CCK is a major physiological regulatory hormone of exocrine pancreas with effects on all aspects of acinar cell metabolism, including secretion, transcription, and translation, a role for CRHSP-24 in one of these processes is highly likely. Clearly, the elucidation of the functional significance of CRHSP-24 in acini will provide valuable insight into the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of Ca2+/calcineurin-mediated signal transduction in mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W2333551700,"Raf-1 kinase has been implicated in the induction of NF-κB activity by serum growth factors, phorbol ester and PTK oncogenes. Here we show that Raf activation of NF-κB, as measured in reporter gene assays, occurs indirectly and requires the stress kinase cascade. The stress pathway presumably becomes activated through induction of an autocrine loop by activated Raf (Raf-BXB) as suramin, the tyrphostin AG1478 and a dominant negative mutant of the EGF-R blocked NF-κB activation. Raf-BXB synergizes with SAPKs and a dominant negative mutant of SEK significantly reduces activation of NF-κB consistent with a role of this signaling pathway in the activation of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W1671937407,"Raf kinases are regulators of cellular proliferation, transformation, differentiation, and apoptosis. To identify downstream targets of Raf-1 in vivo, we used NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing a Raf-1 kinase domain-estrogen receptor fusion protein (BXB-ER), whose activity can be acutely regulated by estrogen. Proteins differentially phosphorylated 20 min after BXB-ER activation in living cells were displayed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The protein with the most prominent newly induced phosphorylation was identified as stathmin, a phosphorylation-sensitive regulator of microtubule dynamics. Stathmin is rapidly phosphorylated on two ERK phosphorylation sites (serines 25 and 38) upon BXB-ER activation. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 abolished this phosphorylation, demonstrating that stathmin is targeted by BXB-ER via the MEK/ERK pathway. Prolonged BXB-ER activation resulted in the accumulation of a stathmin phosphoisomer with impaired microtubule-destabilizing activity. The appearance of this phosphoisomer after BXB-ER activation correlated with rearrangements in the microtubule network, resulting in the formation of long bundled microtubules extending toward the rim of the cells. Our results identify stathmin as a main target of the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascadein vivo and strongly suggest that ERK-mediated stathmin phosphorylation plays an important role for the microtubule reorganization induced by acute activation of Raf-1.

Raf-1 is a critical component of an important transforming pathway emanating from oncogenic Ras, and its viral homologue, v-raf, is a potent oncogene on its own (1Heidecker G. Huleihel M.

In many cells, this is sufficient to activate ERKs, which have a broad range of substrates, both in vitro and in vivo (9Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin.

Several lines of evidence indicate that oncogenic forms of Raf mediate their biological effects primarily through the activation of MEK-1/2 and hence of ERK1/2. Activated MEK-1 can reproduce the transformation of 3T3 fibroblasts by activated Raf (12Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cowley S. Paterson H.

However, there is also evidence for different biological activities of the MEK/ERK and the Raf-1 signaling pathway. ERK activation does not invariably correlate with the transforming activity of Raf in all cell types (19Gallego C. Gupta S.K. Heasley L.E. Qian N.X. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7355-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Activated Raf is able to induce differentiation of hippocampal H19-7 cells in the absence of pronounced activation of MEK and ERKs, while activated alleles of MEK and prolonged activation of ERKs fail to support differentiation (20Kuo W.L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E.M. McCarthy S.A. Yan M. Templeton D.J. McMahon M. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1458-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Most of the experimental evidence for Raf-1 targeted signaling pathways stems from in vitro experiments and overexpression studies with activated or dominant negative mutants. These approaches are very powerful in defining the hierarchical order within signaling pathways and the interaction between individual components. However, since they focus on a single pathway, they are inherently biased and usually neither reveal the complexity of the cellular response nor allow a quantitative evaluation of this complexity. For instance, it is not clear which of the numerous ERK substrates (9Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar, 11Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 135-142PubMed Google Scholar) are actually phosphorylated in response to Raf-1 activation and even less clear which participate in the biological response(s). This prompted us to globally investigate Raf-1-induced phosphorylation(s) in intact cells to identify of the main in vivo targets. To activate Raf specifically, we generated cells harboring BXB-ER, a Raf-1 kinase domain-human estrogen receptor fusion protein, whose kinase activity is under the strict control of estrogen. Protein phosphorylations acutely induced in response to BXB-ER activation were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The phosphorylated proteins were subsequently analyzed and identified by HPLC-coupled mass spectrometry. This approach circumvents artifacts such as relaxed substrate specificities of kinases in vitroor improper accessibility of the substrates. Since phosphorylations occur in intact cells, they represent physiological events likely to be involved in biological responses. This approach allowed us to detect several differentially phosphorylated proteins upon BXB-ER activation. Here, we describe the identification of stathmin as the most prominent immediate target of Raf activation in mouse fibroblasts. Stathmin destabilizes microtubules in living cells and its hyperphosphorylation is known to inhibit this destabilizing activity. BXB-ER activation immediately initiates the phosphorylation of stathmin on serine 25 and serine 38 via the activation of ERKs. This initial phosphorylation results in the appearance of stathmin forms phosphorylated to a higher stoichiometry, known to have an impaired microtubule-destabilizing activity. We further show that the appearance of hyperphosphorylated stathmin following BXB-ER activation correlates with the rearrangement of microtubular networks and the appearance of long bundled microtubules. These findings for the first time link activation of Raf kinase to specific changes in the cytoskeleton and identify stathmin as the responsible target. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 5% bovine serum in humidified atmosphere with 8% CO2. BXB represents a Raf-1 mutant rendered transforming by deletion of amino acids 26–303 (1Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Moll. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The BXB-ER expression vector was constructed following a similar strategy as described by Samuelset al. (21Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To facilitate detection of the BXB-ER fusion protein, an oligonucleotide encoding the epitope of the influenza virus hemagglutinin-specific 12CA5 antibody plus a stop codon was added to the 3′-end of the estrogen receptor portion. The construct was cloned into the pBABEpuro expression vector and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC). Several of the more than 100 puromycin (Sigma)-resistant cell clones were tested for the expression of BXB-ER by immunoprecipitation with a Raf-1 antibody followed by Western blotting with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. Seven clones with equal expression levels were pooled to yield 3T3BXB-ER cells, which were cultured in the presence of 4 μg/ml puromycin. Exponentially growing 3T3BXB-ER cells were stimulated with 5 μm estrogen with or without pretreatment for 30 min with 50 μm PD98059 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as indicated in the figure legend. For each time point, approximately 4 × 106 cells were lysed exactly as described previously (22Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M.

Kinase assays were performed as described by Hafner et al. (22Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S. Lohse M. Ueffing M. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6696-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) using as substrates 50 ng of recombinant histidine-tagged MEK-1 (His-MEK1) and 150 ng of kinase-inactive recombinant ERK1 (His-ERK) (23Gardner A.M. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17896-17901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for BXB-ER kinase assays, 150 ng of His-ERK− for MEK-1 kinase assays, and 2 μg of MBP (Life Technologies, Inc.) for ERK1/2 kinase assays. Kinase reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) as described (24Kolch W. Weissinger E. Mischak H. Troppmair J. Showalter S.D. Lloyd P. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 713-720PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were routinely checked for equal amounts of immunoprecipitated kinases with a c-Raf-specific antibody (22Hafner S. Adler H.S. Mischak H. Janosch P. Heidecker G. Wolfman A. Pippig S.

Western blots were performed as described by Kolch et al. (24Kolch W. Weissinger E. Mischak H. Troppmair J. Showalter S.D. Lloyd P. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 713-720PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 mm CAPS (Sigma), 10% methanol, adjusted to pH 11 as blotting buffer and the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 4 × 106cells in 10-cm culture dishes were washed twice in medium lacking either phosphate or methionine and cysteine and further incubated for 2 h in this medium. Cells were labeled with 250 μC/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or [35S]methionine/cysteine (ProMix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for a total of 40 min (32P label) or 3 h (35S label). Where indicated in the figure legends, cells were treated during the last 30 min of the labeling period with 50 μm PD98059 or carrier (Me2SO) and for the last 20 min with 5 μm estrogen or carrier (ethanol). Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed as described by Gorg et al. (25Gorg A. Postel W. Domscheit A. Gunther S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with the modifications introduced by Bjellqvist and co-workers (26Bjellqvist B. Pasquali C. Ravier F. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once in 4 mmNa2HPO4, 0.75 mmKH2PO4, 70 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KCl, before lysis in 100 μl of sample buffer (11m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris, 1% dithioerythritol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA) per 10-μl cellular pellet, corresponding to approximately 2 × 106 cells. For preparative purposes, 100 μl of sample buffer were used per 40 μl of cellular pellet, and urea was additionally added to a final concentration of 10 m. DNA was sheared using QIAshredders (QIAGEN) and removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 50 min. ResolyteTM, pH 4–8 (BDH), was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.5%, and isoelectric focusing was performed using the Pharmacia dry strip kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 100-μl samples were applied to the acidic and basic part of Immobiline strips with a nonlinear gradient pH 3.5–10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using sample cup holders. Strips were reswollen in 10 m urea, 0.15% dithioerythritol, 2% CHAPS, 2.5 mm EDTA, EGTA, 1% ResolyteTM, pH 4–8. A total of 100 kV-h was applied with several stepwise increases in voltage up to 3500 V. Second dimension was a standard SDS-PAGE using 12% gels (26Bjellqvist B. Pasquali C. Ravier F. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Apparent molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) were determined by marker proteins (Bio-Rad, Sigma) separated on parallel processed gels. Proteins were cut out from the gels and digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. Resulting peptides were dissolved in buffer A and separated on a 300-μm inner diameter/25-cm length μRPC C2/C18 column (LC PACKINGS) with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The gradient was 0–50% B for 0–180 min, 50–100% B for 180–270 min (A: 1.5 mm ammonium acetate, 0.15% formic acid; B: 1.5 mm ammonium acetate, 0.15% formic acid, 70% acetonitril). The HPLC was coupled via an ion spray inlet to an API 100 quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). Masses were determined in 0.1 steps over the m/z (mass/charge) range from 400 to 1500 atomic mass units in the positive charge detection modus with an orifice voltage of 40 V. Cells were seeded on Lab-Tak (Nunc) chamber slides 2 days prior to analysis. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described (27Goodnight J.A. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C. For blocking and all washes, phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 was used. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-actin, anti-β-tubulin; Boehringer Mannheim) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibody was used in a 1:50 dilution (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG; DAKO). The deletion of the regulatory domain of Raf-1 results in a constitutively activated kinase, BXB, with transforming properties (1Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Moll. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The fusion of BXB to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor renders the kinase activity hormone-dependent (21Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding such a fusion protein, termed BXB-ER, were stably introduced into NIH 3T3 cells. To avoid artifacts due to clonal variation, seven independent stable clones expressing equal levels of the fusion protein were pooled, and the resulting cells, 3T3BXB-ER, were used in all further experiments. These cells showed a robust induction of the BXB-ER kinase activity within minutes after the addition of estrogen, which was stable for several hours and slightly declined after 9 h but was still higher than in untreated proliferating cells (Fig.1). The activity of MEK-1 and ERK1/2 followed the activity of BXB-ER throughout the time course. The rapid activation of MEK-1 and ERK1/2 could be reduced by adding the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (15Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar, 16Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar), whereas BXB-ER activity was not affected. BXB-ER activation resulted in the previously described effects such as morphological transformation (elongated shape, higher refractility) and block of the cell cycle in G1 phase (6Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 7Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). These effects were detectable within 6–9 h of hormone addition and fully established after 16–20 h (data not shown). The parental NIH 3T3 cells showed no detectable changes in any of the tested parameters in response to estrogen (data not shown). To detect targets of activated Raf, NIH 3T3 and 3T3BXB-ER cells were serum-starved overnight and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 20 min prior to the addition of estrogen and harvested after an additional 20 min. Lysates were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and phosphoprotein patterns were analyzed. From the nearly 2000 proteins detected by silver stain, more than 300 were phosphorylated to a readily detectable level within the short labeling period. Upon stimulation of BXB-ER only eight phosphoproteins showed reproducible increases in their intensities, ranging from 2- to 8-fold. In control experiments, additional assays were performed in which the MEK activation was inhibited by PD98059 prior to hormone addition. In these assays, only one phosphoprotein showed MEK-independent alterations after BXB-ER activation (data not shown). Hormone addition did not change the phosphoprotein patterns of NIH 3T3 control cells, demonstrating the specificity of the system. In this study, we will focus on the analysis of the Raf-regulated phosphoproteins RRPP2 and RRPP8, while the other BXB-ER targets are still under investigation. Fig. 2 shows the results from one representative out of six independent experiments for two of the BXB-ER-regulated phosphoproteins designated RRPP2 and RRPP8. The phosphorylation of RRPP2 was increased by a factor of 8 within 20 min of BXB-ER activation in both serum-starved and exponentially growing cells (Fig. 2 and data not shown). RRPP8 could not be detected in NIH 3T3 cells and was exclusively observed in estrogen-stimulated 3T3BXB-ER cells. Since PD98059 completely blocked the BXB-ER induced hyperphosphorylation of RRPP2 and RRPP8, we conclude that they are not phosphorylated by BXB-ER directly, but rather as a result of the activation of MEKs or ERKs (compare Fig. 1). RRPP2 showed the strongest increase in intensity of all proteins analyzed and was therefore chosen for further analysis. Protein staining indicated that the amount of RRPP2 was less than 0.001% of the total cellular protein, while the RRPP8 protein was below the detection limit (data not shown). To identify RRPP2, eight preparative two-dimensional gels were run from a total of 1 × 108 serum-starved 3T3BXB-ER cells stimulated for 20 min with estrogen. A total of approximately 800 ng of Coomassie-stained RRPP2 was excised from the gels and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC and injected on-line into an electrospray mass spectrometer to determine their exact masses. The peptide masses were used to search for matching peptide mass fingerprints in the European Bioinformatics Institute nonredundant protein data base using the PeptideSearch software. The search identified several stathmin sequences from different species, with Pr22 (mouse stathmin) being the best candidate. Mouse, rat, and human stathmins yielded 10–13 matching peptides, while the next best scores of other unrelated proteins were 5 matches (data not shown). The identification was verified by the analysis of metastable fragment ions. These derive from predictable fragmentations of the peptides during ionization and measurement (29Nguyen D.N. Becker G.W.

Since fragmentations preferentially proceed from either the N terminus (y-fragments) or the C terminus (b-fragments), they allow considerable sequence determination of peptides (30Siuzdak G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11290-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Fig. 3shows a representative metastable ion analysis of two such peptides. A series of observed masses could be exactly matched to the masses expected from the staggered y fragmentation of peptides corresponding to the stathmin sequence. Several other peptides were analyzed in the same way (data not shown) to prove unambiguously that RRPP2 is indeed stathmin. Stathmin, also known as p19, Op18, prosolin, and oncoprotein 18, is a cytosolic phosphoprotein that can be phosphorylated on four different sites in vivo, namely Ser18, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63 (31Belmont L. Mitchison T. Deacon H.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 197-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to determine which sites are phosphorylated following BXB-ER activation. This was addressed by searching for phosphorylated tryptic peptides in the mass spectrum of RRPP2. We found the masses of the single phosphorylated tryptic peptides encompassing residues 15–27 and 29–40 containing the phosphorylation sites serine 18/25 and serine 38, respectively (Fig.4). The phosphorylated peptides displayed the characteristic increase in mass due to the addition of a single phosphate group. No other phosphopeptides could be detected (data not shown). To distinguish which of the possible in vivo phosphorylation sites on peptide 15–27 are actually phosphorylated, we analyzed the metastable fragment ions of the peptide. We could not find a single y-fragment ion mass that would correspond to the phosphorylation of serine 16 but found eight y-fragment ion masses that could only be generated when serine 25 was phosphorylated (TableI). These data clearly show that serine 25 and serine 38 of stathmin are phosphorylated in RRPP2.Table IIdentification of serine 25 as the phosphorylated residue in peptide 16–27Shown are all expected y-series fragments that allow the discrimination between the phosphorylation of either serine 16 or serine 25.

To confirm and extend our mass spectrometrical analysis of the stathmin phosphorylation, several experiments with a stathmin-specific antibody were performed. Two-dimensional gels of 3T3BXB-ER cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine were blotted and probed with an anti-stathmin antibody (33Koppel J. Boutterin M.C. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3703-3707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signals from the anti-stathmin antibody were overlaid and carefully aligned with the autoradiograph of the same blot (Fig.5 A). Three forms of stathmin could be detected by the stathmin antibody and assigned to [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled proteins. The observed migration pattern of stathmin in the two-dimensional gel is similar to the pattern described previously (34Luo X.N. Mookerjee B. Ferrari A. Mistry S. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10312-10318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is characteristic for several protein forms distinguished by the extent of phosphorylation. The least phosphorylated form occupies the most basic position and displays the lowest apparent molecular weight. Each phosphorylation causes a shift to the acidic part of the gel and reduces the electrophoretic mobility in the SDS-PAGE, resulting in an increased apparent molecular weight. In addition, the Western blot was aligned with a gel also prepared from [35S]methio"

To investigate the oligomeric assembly of the channel complex, we used sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis to determine the sedimentation properties of individual subunits and heteromultimers comprised of multiple subunits. When the α subunit was expressed alone, it first formed an oligomeric complex with a sedimentation coefficient of 11 S, and then generated a higher order multimer of 25 S. In contrast, individual β and γ subunits predominately assembled into 11 S complexes. We obtained similar results with expression in cells andin vitro. When we co-expressed β with α or with α plus γ, the β subunit assembled into a 25 S complex. Glycosylation of the α subunit was not required for assembly into a 25 S complex. We found that the α subunit formed intra-chain disulfide bonds. Although such bonds were not required to generate an oligomeric complex, under nonreducing conditions the α subunit formed a complex that migrated more homogeneously at 25 S. This suggests that intra-chain disulfide bonds may stabilize the complex. These data suggest that the epithelial Na+ channel subunits form high order oligomeric complexes and that the α subunit contains the information that facilitates such formation. Interestingly, the ability of the α, but not the β or γ, subunit to assemble into a 25 S homomeric complex correlates with the ability of these subunits to generate functional channels when expressed alone.

Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). ENaC belongs to an expanding family of cation channels called the DEG/ENaC protein family (3Chalfie M. Wolinsky E.

Members of this family are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and species and function in electrolyte transport, mechanosensation, and neurotransmission. ENaC consists of three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ (6Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Canessa C.M. Schild L.

Compelling functional and biochemical evidence suggests that all three subunits contribute to the formation of the functional channel. For example, the expression of all three subunits is required to generate maximal Na+currents (7Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 10McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the three subunits associate with each other (11Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although α, β, and γENaC share substantial sequence similarity, their functions are not identical. When expressed individually, only α subunits can produce Na+ channel currents. β and γ subunits are not functional on their own, however, they can assemble with αENaC to form αβ and αγ channels with new functional properties (12McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).The oligomeric assembly of plasma membrane proteins is an important posttranslational modification which is crucial both to function and to intracellular trafficking (13Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that underlie oligomeric assembly of ENaC subunits remain largely unknown. In preliminary studies, we examined the molecular mass of ENaC complexes using sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis and found that three family members, αENaC, BNC1, FaNaCh, and the combination of α, β, and γENaC assemble into large molecular mass multimers (14Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These results suggested that this family of channels may share a conserved feature in their oligomeric structure. In order to learn more about the oligomeric assembly of ENaC proteins, we studied further the homomultimerization of two other ENaC subunits β and γ, as well as the heteromultimerization of different subunit combinations.DISCUSSIONUsing sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, we found that when each ENaC subunit is expressed by itself, only αhENaC can efficiently multimerize into a large complex of 25 S; β and γhENaC form smaller 11 S complexes. However, when the other subunits are co-expressed with α, they assemble into a 25 S complex. We conclude that the 25 S complex is the favorable oligomeric structure of the ENaC channel complex.A proposed process of oligomeric assembly of ENaC subunits is shown in Fig. 9. When αhENaC was expressed alone, the newly synthesized unglycosylated proteins assembled into an 11 S complex prior to glycosylation. Following glycosylation of the 11 S complex, the glycosylated intermediates then oligomerized into the final complex of 25 S. Although β and γ were able to generate an 11 S glycosylated complex when expressed individually, they did not efficiently oligomerize further. These results suggest that the information required for oligomerization into an 11 S complex is contained in each subunit, but the information required for oligomerization into a 25 S complex is probably encoded by the α subunit.We found that when α, β, and γ were co-expressed, they followed a similar sequence of oligomerization to produce the 25 S complex; first an 11 S, and then a 25 S complex was generated. During oligomerization the α subunit may associate with β and γ subunits, and by co-assembly may carry them into higher order complexes. In earlier work we showed that assembly of the subunits occurs co-translationally; it does not occur afterward (11Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, the 11 and 25 S complexes contained both α and β, and most likely γ subunits. These results suggest that intermediate sized heteromultimers form first and then assemble to produce the larger 25 S heteromultimers.We obtained similar sized complexes using two different expression systems, in vitro translation with endoplasmic reticulum-like microsomal membranes and in vivo production in COS-7 cells. The results suggest that the complex forms without the requirement for other co-assembled proteins. In our pulse-chase studies in COS-7 cells, we did not consistently detect other proteins co-precipitating with ENaC and co-migrating on sucrose gradients. Therefore, if the 25 S complex does contain other proteins, they may have a slow turnover rate and therefore are not labeled efficiently during the pulse period. Moreover, it would be required that such proteins are present in the in vitro expression system, because results were similar in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that other proteins associate with ENaC to form a 25 S complex. The size of the 25 S complex is also consistent with electrophysiological data suggesting that ENaC channels are composed of at least nine subunits (14Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), although some data suggest that an ENaC complex may be composed of four subunits (21Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.-O.D. Fosket J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A-M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).Our results differ from a recent report on another DEG/ENaC protein, FaNaCh. Coscoy et al. (20Coscoy S. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8317-8322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found that FaNaCh formed a 9 S complex, instead of the 25 S complex we find. There are several potential explanations for the difference. It seems unlikely that use of FaNaCh expressed in human embryonic kidney cells gives different-sized complexes than ENaC expressed in COS cells or in vitro, because we found an approximately 25 S complex with FaNaChin vitro (14Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A more likely explanation relates to the detergents used. Coscoy et al. used CHAPS and Triton X-100, whereas we used digitonin. Solubilization with CHAPS and Triton X-100 may have disrupted interactions between subunits as suggested in our Fig. 1. Retention of a multimeric complex in Triton requires relatively stronger interactions between subunits than are required in digitonin. For example, the Na,K-ATPase α1 and β2subunits form a complex only in digitonin lysates, not in Triton X-100 lysates (23Pontiggia L. Gloor S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the use of digitonin may increase the molecular mass of a protein complex, the 25 S complex we detected is not likely due to the addition of digitonin to the 11 S complex, because digitonin did not increase the molecular mass of unglycosylated proteins or the standard proteins (Fig. 1). Moreover, we observed a time-dependent conversion from an 11 S to a 25 S complex, suggesting that the 25 S complex is a biosynthetic product, rather than an artifact of digitonin solubilization. In addition, the 10–45% gradient used in our studies was optimal for detection of large complexes, whereas their studies of FaNaCh used a 5–15% gradient in which a 25 S complex would sediment at the bottom of the gradient, as suggested in our Fig. 1.The data also allow us to begin to assess the importance of various structural elements in ENaC oligomerization. We found thatN-linked oligosaccharides on αENaC are not required either for its homomultimerization or for its assembly with β subunits. The results show that intra-subunit disulfide bonds form in the α subunit, but inhibiting their formation does not prevent oligomerization. However, when disulfide bonds are allowed to form, the subunit migrates as a sharper, more homogenous peak on a sucrose gradient. This suggests that intra-chain disulfide bonds may stabilize the oligomeric structure. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that disulfide bonds form between subunits, the data suggest that such disulfide bonds are not required for oligomerization of the channel.It is interesting to note that the ability of single subunits to multimerize into the 25 S complex when expressed alone correlates with their ability to form functional channels. αhENaC, brain Na+ channel 1, and FaNaCh can all form functional channels and all generate a 25 S complex when expressed alone (14Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast, β and γENaC are able to do neither. We speculate that formation of a 25 S complex is a key step in the biosynthesis of this family of channels. Perhaps the inability of some members of the DEG/ENaC family to form a high order oligomer may account for their inability to generate functional homomultimeric channels.

A more likely explanation relates to the detergents used. Coscoy et al. used CHAPS and Triton X-100, whereas we used digitonin. Solubilization with CHAPS and Triton X-100 may have disrupted interactions between subunits as suggested in our Fig. 1. Retention of a multimeric complex in Triton requires relatively stronger interactions between subunits than are required in digitonin. For example, the Na,K-ATPase α1 and β2subunits form a complex only in digitonin lysates, not in Triton X-100 lysates (23Pontiggia L. Gloor S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the use of digitonin may increase the molecular mass of a protein complex, the 25 S complex we detected is not likely due to the addition of digitonin to the 11 S complex, because digitonin did not increase the molecular mass of unglycosylated proteins or the standard proteins (Fig. 1). Moreover, we observed a time-dependent conversion from an 11 S to a 25 S complex, suggesting that the 25 S complex is a biosynthetic product, rather than an artifact of digitonin solubilization. In addition, the 10–45% gradient used in our studies was optimal for detection of large complexes, whereas their studies of FaNaCh used a 5–15% gradient in which a 25 S complex would sediment at the bottom of the gradient, as suggested in our Fig. 1.The data also allow us to begin to assess the importance of various structural elements in ENaC oligomerization. We found thatN-linked oligosaccharides on αENaC are not required either for its homomultimerization or for its assembly with β subunits. The results show that intra-subunit disulfide bonds form in the α subunit, but inhibiting their formation does not prevent oligomerization. However, when disulfide bonds are allowed to form, the subunit migrates as a sharper, more homogenous peak on a sucrose gradient. This suggests that intra-chain disulfide bonds may stabilize the oligomeric structure. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that disulfide bonds form between subunits, the data suggest that such disulfide bonds are not required for oligomerization of the channel.It is interesting to note that the ability of single subunits to multimerize into the 25 S complex when expressed alone correlates with their ability to form functional channels. αhENaC, brain Na+ channel 1, and FaNaCh can all form functional channels and all generate a 25 S complex when expressed alone (14Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast, β and γENaC are able to do neither. We speculate that formation of a 25 S complex is a key step in the biosynthesis of this family of channels. Perhaps the inability of some members of the DEG/ENaC family to form a high order oligomer may account for their inability to generate functional homomultimeric channels. Using sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, we found that when each ENaC subunit is expressed by itself, only αhENaC can efficiently multimerize into a large complex of 25 S; β and γhENaC form smaller 11 S complexes. However, when the other subunits are co-expressed with α, they assemble into a 25 S complex. We conclude that the 25 S complex is the favorable oligomeric structure of the ENaC channel complex. A proposed process of oligomeric assembly of ENaC subunits is shown in Fig. 9. When αhENaC was expressed alone, the newly synthesized unglycosylated proteins assembled into an 11 S complex prior to glycosylation. Following glycosylation of the 11 S complex, the glycosylated intermediates then oligomerized into the final complex of 25 S. Although β and γ were able to generate an 11 S glycosylated complex when expressed individually, they did not efficiently oligomerize further. These results suggest that the information required for oligomerization into an 11 S complex is contained in each subunit, but the information required for oligomerization into a 25 S complex is probably encoded by the α subunit. We found that when α, β, and γ were co-expressed, they followed a similar sequence of oligomerization to produce the 25 S complex; first an 11 S, and then a 25 S complex was generated. During oligomerization the α subunit may associate with β and γ subunits, and by co-assembly may carry them into higher order complexes. In earlier work we showed that assembly of the subunits occurs co-translationally; it does not occur afterward (11Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, the 11 and 25 S complexes contained both α and β, and most likely γ subunits. These results suggest that intermediate sized heteromultimers form first and then assemble to produce the larger 25 S heteromultimers. We obtained similar sized complexes using two different expression systems, in vitro translation with endoplasmic reticulum-like microsomal membranes and in vivo production in COS-7 cells. The results suggest that the complex forms without the requirement for other co-assembled proteins. In our pulse-chase studies in COS-7 cells, we did not consistently detect other proteins co-precipitating with ENaC and co-migrating on sucrose gradients. Therefore, if the 25 S complex does contain other proteins, they may have a slow turnover rate and therefore are not labeled efficiently during the pulse period. Moreover, it would be required that such proteins are present in the in vitro expression system, because results were similar in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that other proteins associate with ENaC to form a 25 S complex. The size of the 25 S complex is also consistent with electrophysiological data suggesting that ENaC channels are composed of at least nine subunits (14Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), although some data suggest that an ENaC complex may be composed of four subunits (21Kosari F. Sheng S.

Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Our results differ from a recent report on another DEG/ENaC protein, FaNaCh. Coscoy et al. (20Coscoy S. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8317-8322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found that FaNaCh formed a 9 S complex, instead of the 25 S complex we find. There are several potential explanations for the difference. It seems unlikely that use of FaNaCh expressed in human embryonic kidney cells gives different-sized complexes than ENaC expressed in COS cells or in vitro, because we found an approximately 25 S complex with FaNaChin vitro (14Snyder P.M.

Recently, we have reported a high affinity UG-binding protein (putative receptor), on several cell types, with an apparent molecular mass of 190 kDa (Kundu, G. C., Mantile, G., Miele, L., Cordella-Miele, E., and Mukherjee, A. B. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 2915–2919). Since UG is a homodimer in which the 70 amino acid subunits are connected by two disulfide bonds, we sought to determine whether UG monomers also interact with the 190-kDa UG-binding protein and if so, whether it has the same biological activity as the dimer. Surprisingly, we discovered that in addition to the 190-kDa species, another protein, with an apparent molecular mass of 49 kDa, binds reduced UG with high affinity and specificity. Both 49- and 190-kDa proteins are readily detectable on nontransformed NIH 3T3 and some murine cancer cells (e.g. mastocytoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma), while lacking on others (e.g. fibrosarcoma). Most interestingly, pretreatment of the cells, which express the binding proteins, with reduced UG dramatically suppresses extracellular matrix (ECM) invasion, when such treatment had no effect on fibrosarcoma cells that lack the UG-binding proteins. Tissue-specific expression studies confirmed that while both 190- and 49-kDa UG-binding proteins are present in bovine heart, spleen, and the liver, only the 190-kDa protein is detectable in the trachea and in the lung. Neither the 190-kDa nor the 49-kDa protein was detectable in the aorta. Purification of these binding proteins from bovine spleen by UG-affinity chromatography and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining identified two protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 180 kDa, respectively. Treatment of the NIH 3T3 cells with specific cytokines (i.e. interleukin-6) and other agonists (i.e.lipopolysaccharide) caused a substantially increased level of125I-UG binding but the same cells, when treated with platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, did not alter the UG binding. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that UG, through its binding proteins, plays critical roles in the regulation of cellular motility and ECM invasion.

More than three decades ago, a steroid-inducible secreted protein in the uterus of pregnant rabbits was discovered and was named blastokinin by Krishnan and Daniel (1Krishnan R.S. Daniel Jr., J.C.

Several years later it was recognized that this protein, detectable in nearly all vertebrates, inhibits phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) activity (3Levin S.W. Butler J.D. Schumacher U.K. Wightman P.D.

It is now recognized as one of the most potent endogenous immunomodulatory/antiinflammatory agents produced by the secretory epithelia of all organs that communicate with the external environment (8Mukherjee A.B. Cordella-Miele E. Kikukawa T. Miele L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 231: 135-152PubMed Google Scholar). While UG was first discovered in the rabbit uterus (1Krishnan R.S. Daniel Jr., J.C.

Cordella-Miele E. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2099-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). UG is also present in the blood (10Kikukawa T. Mukherjee A.B. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, the results of immunohistochemical analyses suggested that a protein immunoreactive to UG antibody is expressed in the mucosal epithelial cells of virtually all vertebrate classes (24Zhang Z. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Wang N. Gerhard D.S. Stone E.M. Arbour N.C. De Vries H.G. Scheffer H. Gerritsen J. Collée J.M. Ten Kate L.P. Mukherjee A.B. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that this protein plays important physiological roles. The UG gene consists of three exons, two introns, and a 5′-flanking region containing several steroid hormone-response elements, which regulate its differential, tissue-specific expression. For example, while progesterone up-regulates UG production in the uterus, its induction in the fallopian tubes is dependent upon estrogen. Prolactin appears to enhance the progesterone-induced UG gene expression in the uterus (28Chilton B.S. Mani S.K. Bullock D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Randall G.W. Daniel Jr., J.C. Chilton B.S. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1991; 91: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is now clear that prolactin transcriptionally augments progesterone-induced UG gene expression in the endometrium via a specific protein that binds at the 5′-flanking region of the UG gene (30Kleis-SanFrancisco S. Hewetson A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hayward-Lester A. Hewetson A. Beale E.G. Oefner P.J. Doris P.A. Chilton B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1335-1349PubMed Google Scholar). In the prostate and in the seminal vesicle, the UG gene is regulated by testosterone, while in the lungs it is constitutively expressed, although a 3-fold stimulation of expression by glucocorticoid treatment of rabbits has been reported. Recently, it has been found that administration of IFN-γ to mice stimulates UG production in the lungs and an IFN-γ response element has been identified in the 5′-flanking region of the mouse UG promoter (32Magdaleno S.M. Wang G. Jackson K.J. Ray M.K. Welty S. Costa R.H. DeMayo F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1142-L1151PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that treatment of cultured human bronchial epithelial cells with IFN-γ induces UG mRNA and protein (33Yao X.L. Ikezono T. Cowan M. Logun C. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 18: L864-L869Google Scholar). These results further suggest a potential role of UG in the regulation of immunological/inflammatory processes. Both natural and recombinant human UGs have an anomalous electrophoretic mobility in that they migrate like a 10-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE, when their calculated molecular mass is 15.8 kDa. We have recently achieved a high level expression of recombinant rabbit and human UGs (34Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol.

A highly allergenic protein, FeldI, found in domestic cats, that has local amino acid sequence similarity to UG, has been reported (38Morgenstern J.P. Griffith I.J. Brauer A.W. Rogers B.L. Bond J.F.

The structural features of a protein may explain, in part, its chemical and biological properties (44Kieber-Emmons T. Fang Q. Cai W. Friedman S.M. Crow M.K. Lotke P. Williams W.V.

The results showed that UG is a homodimer in which each monomer consists of 70 amino acids. The two monomers are oriented in an antiparallel fashion and are covalently connected by two disulfide bonds (Cys3→ Cys69′ and Cys69 → Cys3′). The 70 amino acids in each of the monomers form four α-helices, and there is a β-turn between α-helices 2 and 3. The appearance of the UG dimer is globular and contain a relatively large central hydrophobic cavity. Several Van der Walls interactions and hydrogen bonding exist between the two monomers and the dimer is stabilized by carboxymethylation of the disulfide bonds (45Nieto A. Ponstingl H. Beato M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is now clear that the α-helix-3 of UG, from all species studied so far, are exposed to the solvent and has the potential to interact with other molecules (e.g. binding proteins). Interestingly, Robinson et al. (54Robinson D.H. Kirk K.L. Benos D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 63: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have reported an active transport of UG from the endometrium of the uterus into the blastocoele of the preimplantation rabbit embryos, raising the possibility that a UG-binding protein (carrier) may be present on the trophoblasts. We have recently reported that UG binds to a protein with a molecular mass of 190 kDa, on several cell types, including the trophoblasts with high affinity and specificity (55Kundu G.C. Mantile G. Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2915-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we report that (a) using reduced125I-labeled human UG (hUG) and affinity cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) we identified a UG-binding protein with a molecular mass of 49 kDa, in addition to the previously reported 190 kDa species; (b) purification of the binding proteins from bovine spleen by UG affinity chromatography and analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver staining identified two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 180 kDa, respectively; (c) both of these proteins are also readily detectable in the heart, and the liver but only the 190-kDa protein band is detectable in the trachea and the lung, while in the aorta they are totally absent; (d) treatment of the NIH 3T3 cells with specific cytokines (e.g.interleukin-6) and other agents (e.g. lipopolysaccharide) appreciably enhances the intensity of radioactive UG-binding protein bands while treatment of the same cells with platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, IFN-γ, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate failed to do so; and (e) both nonreduced and reduced UG dramatically suppressed the invasion of ECM by NIH 3T3, murine mastocytoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma but not of fibrosarcoma cells. Interestingly, while mastocytoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma cells appeared to express the UG-binding proteins, they were undectable in fibrosarcoma cells. Taken together, these results raise the possibility that hUG plays critical roles in regulating cellular invasiveness of both normal and some cancer cells, at least in part, via its specific, high affinity binding proteins. Recombinant hUG was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity according to the method of Mantile et al. (35Mantile G. Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Singh G. Katyal S.L. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20343-20351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DSS was purchased from Pierce. BioCoat MatrigelTM invasion chambers were from Collaborative Biomedical. The cells (NIH 3T3, mouse mastocytoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, and fibrosarcoma) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. Chemoinvasion assays were performed as described previously (55Kundu G.C. Mantile G. Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2915-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 56Melchiori A. Carlone S. Allavena G. Aresu O. Parodi S. Aaronson S.A. Albini A. Anticancer Res. 1990; 10: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells (NIH 3T3, mouse mastocytoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, and fibrosarcoma) were harvested with trypsin and EDTA and then centrifuged. The cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/bovine serum albumin. The lower compartment of the invasion chamber was filled with fibroblast-conditioned medium, which was used as a chemoattractant. The upper compartment was overlaid with polyethylene phthalate membrane precoated with MatrigelTM basement membrane matrix. The cells (1.6 × 105/well) were seeded in the upper compartment of the prehydrated Matrigel- coated invasion chambers in the absence or presence of reduced hUG and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a humidified incubator. The cells that invaded the Matrigel and attached to the lower surface of the filter were stained with Giemsa. The upper surface of the filter was scraped with moist cotton swabs to remove Matrigel and nonmigrated cells. The chamber was washed with water, the migrated cells were counted under an inverted microscope, and photomicrographs (120 ×) were taken by using a Zeiss photomicroscope, Axiovert 405 M. The UG (20 μg) was radioiodinated using sodium [125I]iodide (2 mCi; carrier free) and IODO-BEADS. The reaction was carried out in 150 μl of PBS, pH 7.4 at 25 °C for 10 min and 125I-UG was purified by Sephadex G-25 spun column chromatography (1200 × g for 4 min). The specific activity of purified carrier-free 125I-UG was 25 μCi/μg. The confluent cells (NIH 3T3, mouse mastocytoma, sarcoma, lymphoma and fibrosarcoma), in 12-well plates, were washed once with PBS, pH 7.4 and then incubated with varying concentrations of reduced125I-UG in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), pH 7.6, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of excess unlabeled reduced hUG at room temperature for 2 h. The UG was reduced in presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by rapid removal of unbound 125I-UG, and the cells were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and solubilized in 1 n NaOH followed by addition of an equal volume of 1 n HCl. The radioactivity was measured by gamma counter (ICN Biomedicals, model 10/600 plus) with a counting efficiency of approximately 80%. The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. The binding data were analyzed by Scatchard plot using the LIGAND computer program. Confluent cells (NIH 3T3, mouse mastocytoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, and fibrosarcoma) grown in six-well plates, were washed with PBS, pH 7.4 and incubated with reduced 125I-UG (3.0 nm) in 2.0 ml of HBSS, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of unlabeled reduced UG (1 μm) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated further with 0.20 mm DSS in 2.0 ml of HBSS, pH 7.6, for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and cells were scraped, collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and lysed in 60 μl of 1% Triton X-100 solution containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm EDTA. The supernatants (30 μl) obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min were suspended in sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). The gels were briefly stained with Coomassie Blue, dried in a Bio-Rad gel dryer, and autoradiographed using Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film. The membrane samples were prepared from bovine heart, spleen, trachea, lung, liver, and the aorta. The membrane samples containing equal amount of total proteins from different tissues were incubated with reduced 125I-UG (3.0 nm) in HBSS, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of unlabeled reduced UG for binding as mentioned above. The samples were cross-linked with DSS, lysed, electrophoresed, and autoradiographed. In separate experiments, the NIH 3T3 cells were treated with different cytokines and other agents. The treated cells were then incubated with reduced 125I-UG (3.0 nm) in HBSS, pH 7.6, for binding, cross-linked, electrophoresed, and autoradiographed as described above. The bovine spleen tissue (10 g) was homogenized in 10 mm NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.0. The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 24,000 ×g for 60 min. The pellets were solubilized with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by stirring at 4 °C for 6 h. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 24,000 ×g for 90 min and applied to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B-coupled UG affinity column. The Sepharose 4B-coupled UG affinity column was prepared according to the instruction of the manufacturer. The UG receptor protein was eluted from the column using 0.1m glycine HCl, pH 3.0. containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and neutralized immediately with 2m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fraction containing the UG-binding proteins was detected by 125I-UG binding and affinity cross-linking assay. The homogeneity of the purified receptor was checked by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Bio-Rad). We have previously demonstrated that recombinant human UG in its natural dimeric conformation binds to a protein on human trophoblast cells with a molecular mass of 190 kDa with high affinity and specificity (55Kundu G.C. Mantile G. Miele L. Cordella-Miele E. Mukherjee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2915-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since UG is a homodimer in which the 70 amino acid subunits are linked by two disulfide bonds, we sought to determine whether both reduced and nonreduced UG interacted with the same 190-kDa UG-binding protein. Thus, we tested both the nonreduced and reduced recombinant human UG on nontransformed NIH 3T3 and cancer (mastocytoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, and fibrosarcoma) cell lines. Scatchard analysis of steady state binding of 125I-UG (reduced) indicates the presence of a single class of specific binding with dissociation constant (Kd) of 20 nm using NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1). We have also examined the125I-UG (reduced) binding on mastocytoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma cells, and the Kd values were 20–25 nm, but there was no such binding when fibrosarcoma cells were used (data not shown). The nonreduced 125I-hUG also bound the receptors with Kd of 30–35 nmin mastocytoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma cells, respectively (data not shown). For further characterization of the UG binding sites on these cells, we performed affinity cross-linking studies with DSS using125I-hUG (reduced) in the absence or presence of unlabeled UG. The results uncovered a radiolabeled 49-kDa protein band (Fig.2) in addition to the previously identified 190-kDa band (55Kun"

In the present study, we have investigated the role of these receptors in the expression of NO2−, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by mouse macrophages. Specific antibody-mediated aggregation of CD120a (p55) induced NO2− accumulation in culture supernatants and iNOS mRNA expression in macrophage lysates, whereas cross-linking of CD120b (p75) had a minimal effect. In contrast, simultaneous cross-linking of both receptors led to a marked augmentation in NO2− and iNOS mRNA expression. Antibody-mediated blockade of CD120a (p55) completely inhibited NO2− expression in response to TNFα, whereas blockade of CD120b (p75) reduced NO2− accumulation by ∼50%. Specific ligation of CD120a (p55) with either (i) human TNFα or (ii) by incubation with mouse TNFα following pretreatment of macrophages with blocking concentrations of anti-CD120b (p75) antibody resulted in a similar reduction in NO2− production in response to TNFα. Quantification of iNOS mRNA, protein, and NO2−expression during independent and co-ligation of CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) indicated that iNOS mRNA and protein expression was transient in nature when CD120a (p55) was cross-linked alone but was prolonged when both receptors were simultaneously cross-linked. In addition, cross-linking both receptors also led to a potentiation of NO2− accumulation in culture supernatants that was more pronounced at later time points. These findings suggest that while cross-linking of CD120a (p55) is necessary and sufficient for iNOS mRNA and NO2− expression, CD120b (p75) participates by (i) increasing the sensitivity of the cells to TNFα, probably by “passing” ligand to CD120a (p55), and (ii) initiating a signaling event that results in a more sustained induction of iNOS mRNA and protein and thereby augments the production of nitric oxide.

The production of NO⋅ is controlled by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) that catalyzes the oxidation of the guanidino nitrogen of l-arginine to form NO⋅and l-citrulline (7Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F.

However, in many situations it is the cytokines IFNγ and TNFα produced during the host inflammatory and immune responses that act cooperatively to induce iNOS expression (12Ding A.H. Nathan C.F.

With the aid of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that can function both as mimics and antagonists of TNFα actions, it has become clear that most functions elicited by TNFα are mediated by cross-linking of CD120a (p55). These functions include cytotoxicity against LM cells (16Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F. Figari I.S. Reynolds C. Palladino M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibody-induced cross-linking of CD120b (p75) has also been shown to induce certain restricted functions such as thymocyte proliferation (16Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F. Figari I.S. Reynolds C.

However, an important function of this receptor appears to be the enhancement of functions initiated by cross-linking of CD120a (p55). Two concepts have been proposed to address the mechanism by which ligation of CD120b (p75) may assist the functions of CD120a (p55). First, by virtue of its higher affinity and more rapid association and dissociation rate constants than CD120a (p55), CD120b (p75) has been proposed to regulate the rate of interaction of TNFα with CD120a (p55) thereby enhancing signaling by CD120a (p55) (20Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 21Tartaglia L.A. Pennica D. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18542-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, cross-linking of CD120b (p75) may generate a signal that may or may not synergize with signals produced during ligation of CD120a (p55). Since both concepts are not mutually exclusive, cross-linking of CD120b (p75) may contribute to the functions elicited by ligation of CD120a (p55) although may not necessarily, by itself, stimulate a cellular response. In this study we have investigated the roles of CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) in the induction of NO2− (a stable oxidation product of NO⋅) and iNOS mRNA expression by mouse macrophages and the mechanisms underlying their involvement. Our findings show that whereas cross-linking of CD120a (p55) is necessary and sufficient for iNOS and NO2−expression, additional cross-linking of CD120b (p75) and signaling by this receptor are required for the optimal and prolonged induction of iNOS and NO2−.

The cultures were maintained under an atmosphere of 10% CO2for 5 days to obtain confluent monolayers of macrophages. The cells were incubated with the various stimuli in growth medium. The accumulation of NO2− in culture supernatants was quantified in 96-well plates using the method described by Dinget al. (12Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar). One hundred-μl aliquots of the culture supernatants were dispensed in duplicate into 96-well plates and were mixed with 100 μl of a solution composed of 1% (w/v) sulfanilamide, 0.1% (w/v) naphthylethylenediamine hydrochloride, and 2.5% (v/v) H3PO4. A standard curve consisting of 0.1–5.0 nmol of NaNO2 per 100-μl sample was prepared in growth medium. After incubation at ambient room temperature for 10 min, the absorbances of the wells were quantified at 550 nm in a Biotek Instruments enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. The number of cells/well was determined by lysing the cell monolayers in “Zapoglobin” and quantifying the number of released nuclei with a model ZM Coulter counter. Concentrations of NO2−were interpolated from the NaNO2 standard curve, corrected for the volume of the culture supernatant, and normalized to the number of cells/well. Results are presented as nanomoles of NO2− per 106 adherent cells per 24 h. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate and was conducted a minimum of three times. The results presented are the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. The expression of iNOS mRNA was determined by Northern analysis. The extraction, purification, electrophoresis, and transfer of the RNA to nylon membranes was carried out as described (22Riches D.W.H. Underwood G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24785-24792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Noble P.W. Lake F.R. Henson P.M. Riches D.W.H. J. Clin.

Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar), and the RNA was purified by centrifugation through 5.7 m cesium chloride at 100,000 × g for 18 h. Fifteen μg of total RNA were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions through a 1.0% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel and then transferred to Nytran membranes. The blots were hybridized with 5 × 106 dpm of 32P-labeled iNOS cDNA probe (8Lowenstein C.J. Glatt C.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6711-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), and autoradiograms were prepared by exposure to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70 °C. The mouse iNOS cDNA probe was kindly provided by Dr. Charles Lowenstein, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore. For the measurement of iNOS protein, macrophages were lysed in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE through a 7.5% gel, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-mouse iNOS antibody as described previously (26Chan E.D.

The activation of JNK was quantified using a solid phase in vitro kinase assay employing a glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun1–79 fusion protein (GST-c-Jun1–79) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (25Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar, 26Chan E.D. Winston B.W. Jarpe M.B. Wynes M.W. Riches D.W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13169-13174Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophage monolayers were stimulated and then lysed at 4 °C with 500 μl of an ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 137 mmNaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm PMSF) (25Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). JNK activity in each sample of lysate was bound to 15 μl of 1:1 slurry of lysis buffer:GST-c-Jun1–79-Sepharose beads and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with JNK buffer (20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm Na3VO4). JNK activity was detected in an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/sample) before being subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by autoradiography. The production of NO2−by mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages was similar to that previously reported for elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages (12Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar) in that both IFNγ and TNFα were either unable or poorly capable of stimulating NO2− when presented alone but induced abundant levels of NO2− when presented together. As can be seen in Fig. 1, NO2− production was initially detected at a TNFα concentration of 0.1 ng/ml, whereas maximal production was achieved at concentrations of TNFα of 30 ng/ml or more. The independent roles of CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) in NO2− production were initially addressed by incubating macrophage monolayers with increasing concentrations of polyclonal antibodies directed against each receptor type in the presence and absence of IFNγ. As can be seen in Fig.2, when macrophages were incubated with anti-CD120a (p55) antibody in the presence of IFNγ (10 units/ml), a concentration-dependent increase in NO2− production was seen that peaked at between 0.5 and 1.0 μg/ml antibody. Further increments in the concentration of the anti-CD120a (p55) antibody were found to result in a decline in NO2− production until at 10 μg/ml NO2− production was not detected. By contrast, incubation of macrophages with anti-CD120b (p75) antibody either in the presence or absence of IFNγ did not result in any significant production of NO2−(Fig. 2). However, when macrophages were simultaneously challenged with equivalent amounts of both anti-CD120a (p55) and anti-CD120b (p75), antibodies in the presence of IFNγ, an augmentation in NO2− production was observed compared to when each antibody was added alone (Fig. 2). Exposure of macrophages to either antibody in the absence of IFNγ failed to stimulate NO2− production (data not shown). Furthermore, incubation of mouse macrophages with non-immune rabbit IgG in the presence or absence of IFNγ did not result in the induction of NO2− production (data not shown). These data suggest that although ligation of CD120a (p55) is sufficient for NO2− production, cross-linking of CD120b (p75) augmented the response initiated by the antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD120a (p55). Given the specificity of the anti-TNF receptor antibodies, it seemed reasonable to assume that the interaction with their respective antigens will result in homologous cross-linking of each receptor type. Thus, the data presented above suggests that during antibody-mediated cross-linking, CD120b (p75) enhanced the signal generated by cross-linking of CD120a (p55). Furthermore, since TNFα was not required in these experiments, hence eliminating any possibility of “ligand-passing,” it seemed likely that cross-linking of CD120b (p75) initiated or augmented an independent signaling event. To determine if this conclusion also applied to TNFα itself, we independently blocked CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) with inhibitory concentrations of the anti-receptor antibodies (10 μg/ml) and quantified the effect on the TNFα-mediated stimulation of NO2− production. Macrophage monolayers were pretreated with either anti-CD120a (p55) antibody or anti-CD120b (p75) antibody for 30 min prior to stimulation with an optimal concentration of TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence of IFNγ (10 units/ml). Fig. 3 shows that under these conditions anti-CD120a (p55) antibody completely inhibited NO2− production. In addition, anti-CD120b (p75) antibody partially, although significantly (p < 0.05), blocked NO2− production by TNFα. Neither antibody stimulated the production of NO2− when added in the absence of IFNγ (Fig. 3). Furthermore, non-immune rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml) had no effect on the production of NO2− in response to challenge with IFNγ (10 units/ml) and TNFα (10 ng/ml) (data not shown). To explore further the possibilities that (i) CD120b (p75) may function to “pass” TNFα to CD120a (p55) and/or (ii) that CD120b (p75) may initiate a signal to enhance the response of CD120a (p55), macrophage monolayers were pretreated with an inhibitory concentration of anti-CD120b (p75) antibody (10 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to stimulation with IFNγ and increasing concentrations of TNFα (0.1–30 ng/ml) to span the entire concentration response curve for NO2− production. If CD120b (p75) was functioning to “pass” ligand to CD120a (p55), the inhibitory effect of the anti-CD120b (p75) antibody should be overcome by increasing the concentration of TNFα since the ligand passing phenomenon is based on the higher affinity of CD120b (p75) for TNFα compared with CD120b (p55). By contrast, if CD120b (p75) was required in a signaling capacity, the inhibitory effect of the anti-CD120b (p75) antibody would not be overcome by excess TNFα under conditions in which both CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) were saturated with ligand. As can be seen in Fig. 4, blocking CD120b (p75) function with an inhibitory concentration of the specific antibody resulted in an almost complete cessation of NO2−production at low concentrations of TNFα. However, importantly, the inhibitory effect of the anti-CD120b (p75) antibody was not overcome with increasing concentrations of TNFα and remained significantly blocked by almost 50% (p < 0.05) when the cells were exposed to a concentration of TNFα (30 ng/ml) that maximally stimulated NO2− production (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that although CD120b (p75) may function to pass TNFα to CD120a (p55) at low ligand concentrations, it directly contributes to TNFα-mediated signaling under saturating ligand concentrations. The results obtained above were confirmed by determining the effect of human TNFα on the production of NO2−since previous studies have shown human TNFα to bind to mouse CD120a (p55) but not to mouse CD120b (p75). Mouse macrophage monolayers were incubated with increasing concentrations of human or mouse TNFα (0.01–500 ng/ml) in the presence of IFNγ (10 units/ml) for 24 h. As can be seen in Fig. 5, incubation of mouse macrophages with mouse TNFα resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in NO2− production that was identical to that seen earlier (Fig. 1). However, the induction of NO2− expression in response to human TNFα was different in two respects as follows: (i) human TNFα was ineffective at low concentrations of ligand and (ii) the magnitude of NO2− production was only about half that seen with mouse TNFα and was not further increased with increasing ligand concentration (p < 0.05). Thus, the pattern of NO2− expression by selective ligation of CD120a (p55) with human TNFα was indistinguishable from that seen in response to mouse TNFα when CD120b (p75) function was blocked with specific antibody. To investigate further the roles of CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) in iNOS induction, we quantified the time course of induction of iNOS expression during independent and concurrent ligation of both receptors to determine the contribution of each receptor to iNOS induction. The results shown in Fig.6 indicate that ligation of CD120a (p55) alone for 3 h stimulated iNOS mRNA expression to a level that was not different to that seen during concurrent ligation of both receptors. However, by 9 and 24 h post-stimulation, it was apparent that although the level of iNOS mRNA expression was relatively sustained in macrophages in which CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) were co-ligated with either the combination of anti-CD120a (p55) and anti-CD120b (p75) antibodies, or with mouse TNFα, the level of expression progressively declined at these later time points in cells in which CD120a (p55) alone was ligated. Thus, while at 3 h, the level of expression of iNOS mRNA was 98.0 and 99.2 densitometer units for macrophages exposed to anti-CD120a (p55) antibody alone or to both CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p55) antibodies, respectively, the levels at 24 h were 76.1 and 33.3 densitometer units, respectively. These findings were also reproduced at the level of iNOS protein expression. Lysates from macrophages stimulated with mouse or human TNFα in the presence of IFNγ (10 units/ml) for time intervals up to 24 h were analyzed for the presence of iNOS protein by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-mouse iNOS antibody. As can be seen in Fig.7, incubation with mouse TNFα, a ligand for both CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75), led to a progressive increase in the expression of iNOS protein that peaked at 9 h and that remained elevated for the remainder of the time course. In contrast, while incubation with human TNFα, a selective ligand for CD120a (p55), led to a similar rate of increase in iNOS protein during the first 6 h, the response peaked at 9 h but then began to decline. Consistent with both the mRNA data shown in Fig. 6, the level of iNOS protein detected at 24 h was approximately half that seen when both receptors were ligated. It can also be seen in Fig. 7that while the amount of NO2− detected in culture supernatants was similar at early time points in response to both mouse and human TNFα, the accumulation was markedly reduced at later time points in cells in which CD120a (p55) had been ligated with human TNFα in the absence of ligation of CD120b (p75). Thus, ligation of CD120a (p55) alone resulted in a transient expression of iNOS mRNA and protein, whereas co-ligation of CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) resulted in a more prolonged induction of the enzyme.Figure 7Time course of the effect of co-ligation of CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) (mouse TNFα) or ligation of CD120a alone (human TNFα) on the expression of iNOS protein and NO2− by mouse macrophages. Cells were co-stimulated with human or mouse TNFα (100 ng/ml) and IFNγ for the times indicated. Culture supernatants were then collected and assayed for NO2−, whereas the cells were lysed and analyzed for iNOS protein expression by immunoblotting.

In previously reported work, we have shown that specific members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, i.e.p42mapk/erk2 , p38mapk , and p46JNK , are activated by TNFα (26Chan E.D.

Although CD120b (p75) plays no apparent role in p42mapk/erk2 and p38mapk activation, other than by the phenomenon of ligand passing at low concentrations of TNFα (27Winston B.W. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1525-1533PubMed Google Scholar, 28Winston B.W. Chan E.D. Johnson G.L. Riches D.W.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4491-4497PubMed Google Scholar), the role of CD120b (p75) in the activation of JNK in macrophages has not been previously investigated. Therefore, to determine the relative role of each receptor in the activation of JNK, we utilized the differential binding properties of human and mouse TNFα to CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) to selectively ligate CD120a (p55) alone or to ligate both receptors, respectively, as described earlier. Mouse macrophages were stimulated with increasing concentrations of human or mouse TNFα (0.1–100 ng/ml) for 10 min and lysed, and the level of JNK activation was quantified using a solid phase in vitro kinase assay. As can be seen in Fig.8, ligation of both CD120a (p55) and CD120b (p75) with mouse TNFα led to a concen"
https://openalex.org/W2321483867,"A subset of male germ cell cancers presenting with advanced stage abundantly express the fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF4). FGF4 expression is restricted in vitro to undifferentiated embryonal carcinomas (ECs). During induced differentiation, FGF4 expression is repressed in maturation sensitive but not resistant human ECs, suggesting FGF4 plays an important role in malignant growth or differentiation of ECs. To explore these FGF4 signals in male germ cell cancers, the multipotent human EC NTERA-2 clone D1 (NT2/D1) cell line was studied. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-treatment of these cells induces a neuronal phenotype and represses tumorigenicity and FGF4 expression. In contrast, RA-treatment of retinoid resistant lines derived from NT2/D1 cells failed to repress FGF4 expression. This implicated FGF4 directly in regulating human EC growth or differentiation. To evaluate further this FGF4 role, FGF4 was constitutively over-expressed in NT2/D1 cells using a CMV-driven expression vector containing the neomycin resistance gene. Three stable transfectants expressing exogenous FGF4 were studied as was a control transfectant only expressing the neomycin resistance gene. RA-treatment repressed endogenous but not exogenous FGF4 expression. RA-treatment of these transfectants induced morphologic and immunophenotypic maturation, changes in RA-regulated genes, and a G1 cell cycle arrest in a manner similar to parental NT2/D1 cells. This indicated FGF4 over-expression did not block RA-mediated differentiation. As expected, RA-treatment repressed tumorigenicity of the control transfectant after subcutaneous injection into athymic mice. Despite RA-treatment, this repressed tumorigenicity was overcome in all the transfectants over-expressing FGF4. The histopathology and neovascularization did not appreciably differ between xenograft tumors derived from FGF4 over-expressing versus control transfectants. FGF4 expression studies were extended to patient-derived germ cell tumors using total cellular RNA Northern analysis and an immunohistochemical assay developed to detect FGF4 protein expression. Germ cell tumors with EC components were significantly more likely to express FGF4 mRNA (P⩽0.0179) than other examined germ cell tumors without EC components. Immunohistochemical results from 43 germ cell tumors demonstrated increased FGF4 expression especially in non-seminomas having EC components. Thus, FGF4 promotes directly malignant growth of cultured ECs, overcomes the anti-tumorigenic actions of RA, and is selectively expressed in specific histopathologic subsets of germ cell tumors. Taken together, these findings indicate how differentiation and anti-tumorigenic retinoic acid signals can be dissociated in germ cell cancer."

We studied the action in vitro of radiolytically generated hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) and superoxide radicals (O⨪2) on the cAMP-dependent protein kinases, I and II (PKAI and -II, respectively). The effects of the gasses O2 and N2O used to produce O⨪2 or⋅OH radicals by γ-radiolysis of the water were also studied. PKAI is more sensitive than PKAII to oxygen gas (10 mmsodium formate) and to hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. Hydroxyl radicals decreased the kinase phosphotransferase activities stimulated either by cAMP or its site-specific analogs for both PKAI and PKAII; however, PKAI was more affected. The binding of [3H]cAMP and of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP to RI regulatory subunits was decreased. ⋅OH caused a loss of tryptophan 260 fluorescence at site A of PKAI and of bityrosine production. Superoxide radicals affected only PKAI. O⨪2 modified both cAMP-binding sites A and B of the regulatory subunit but had a smaller effect on the catalytic subunit.

The elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP and subsequent activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA) are events that contribute to the regulation of a variety of cell functions including gene expression, cellular metabolism, and cell proliferation and differentiation. The inactive PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer consisting of two regulatory (R) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. There are two major types of PKA (PKAI and PKAII), which display different biochemical properties due to differences in their R subunits (RI and RII). RI and RII differ in molecular weight, antigenicity, amino acid sequence of the N-terminal domain, ability to be autophosphorylated, and affinity for cAMP analogs. Genetic studies have revealed numerous types of PKA subunit (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, RIIβ, Cα, Cβ, Cγ). PKA is activated by the binding of four cAMP molecules. They bind to two asymmetric sites (designated A and B), on each monomer in a positive cooperative fashion. This results in the dissociation of the holoenzyme to release active C subunit and dimers of the R subunits (for a review see Refs. 17Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev.

Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 5272-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both 8-N3-[32P]cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits RI and RII and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activities are low (20Raynaud F. Gerbaud P. Enjolras O. Gorin I. Donnadieu M. Anderson W.B. Evain-Brion D. Lancet. 1989; : 1153-1156Abstract PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Indeed, the loss of cAMP binding activity correlates with the severity of the disease (20Raynaud F. Gerbaud P. Enjolras O. Gorin I. Donnadieu M. Anderson W.B. Evain-Brion D. Lancet. 1989; : 1153-1156Abstract PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This alteration of PKA in psoriatic fibroblasts may be due to oxidative modification (21Raynaud F. Evain-Brion D. Gerbaud P. Marciano D. Gorin I. Liapi C. Anderson W.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the oxidative state of psoriatic cells might be modified (22Grossman R.M. Krueger J. Yourish D. Granelli-Piperno A. Murphy D.

Thus, oxidative modifications may modulate PKA activity and be the basis of alteration in key enzyme activities, including PKA, in certain pathological states such as psoriasis. We present an in vitro analysis of the ability of particular oxygen free radicals generated by γ-radiolysis of water to alter the enzymatic properties of PKAI and PKAII. We have also studied the effects of the gasses N2O and O2 (in the presence of 10 mm sodium formate) in aqueous solutions that generate 90% hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) or 100% anion superoxide radicals (O⨪2), respectively. We report specific alterations in cAMP binding to the regulatory subunits and specific changes in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activities in response to the oxygen free radicals studied. PKA type I was extracted from rabbit skeletal muscle, which contains mostly the RIα isoform (25Pariset C. Feinberg J. Dacheux J.-L. Oyen O. Janhsen T. Weinman S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PKA type II and C subunit were extracted from bovine heart muscle. PKA type II contains essentially the RIIα isoform (26Löffner F. Lohmann S.M. Walckhoff B. Walter U. Hamprecht B. Brain Res. 1986; 363: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All of these products were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). Oxygen radical species were homogeneously generated in aqueous protein solutions by γ-radiolysis with a 60Co source (performed at the Laboratoire de Chimie Physique CNRS, URA 400, Université René Descartes, Paris, France). A 1-ml solution of 10 mm-sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 μg of the indicated protein was kept cold on ice, saturated for 30 min with the appropriate gas, and then irradiated in closed vessels. The saturation of the solution with N2O or O2 gas in the absence or in the presence of 10 mm sodium formate allowed the generation of 90% hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH), or 100% anion superoxide radicals (O⨪2), respectively. The doses were delivered at a rate of 2.5 ± 0.1 grays/min, as measured by Fricke's method (27Fricke H. Hart F.J. Attix F.H. Roesh W. Radiation Dosimetry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1966: 167-239Google Scholar). A single dose of 900 grays was delivered to each protein solution, such that the ratio of oxygen radical to protein (nmol of radicals/nmol of protein) was between 2500 (⋅OH) and 5040 (O⨪2), according to the nature of the free radical (in steady-state kinetic conditions). Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activities were measured using kemptide as the phosphate acceptor (a specific substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinases) (28Roskoski R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). One μg of PKAI or PKAII was used to catalyze the transfer of 32P from ATP (5000 pmol; 5 × 105 cpm) to 100 μm of kemptide in the presence of 50 mm MOPS, pH 7, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and the appropriate concentration of cAMP or its analogs (10−9 to 10−3m) in a total volume of 50 μl. C subunit activity was determined in the same reaction mixture in the absence of cAMP and its analogs. The phosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 10 min with continuous agitation. The reaction then was terminated by spotting 25 μl of the reaction mixture onto phosphocellulose P-81 strips (Whatman), which were immediately dropped into ice-cold 0.5% phosphoric acid (10 ml/paper strip). The strips were washed three times in 0.5% phosphoric acid with swirling. Radioactivity retained on the P-81 papers was counted in Ready Safe scintillation solvent (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The background count that was obtained in the absence of enzyme was subtracted from all experimental values. PKA activity was calculated by subtracting the activity measured in the presence of cAMP or its analog from the activity measured in the absence of cAMP. The polyclonal antibodies against bovine skeletal muscle RIα (25Pariset C. Feinberg J. Dacheux J.-L. Oyen O. Janhsen T. Weinman S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and against rat heart RIIα (26Löffner F. Lohmann S.M. Walckhoff B. Walter U. Hamprecht B. Brain Res. 1986; 363: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were prepared as reported previously. The polyclonal antibody against bovine heart catalytic subunit C was a generous gift from Dr. S. Lohmann (Labor für Klinische Biochemie, Medizinische Universitätsklinik, Würzburg, Germany). Protein kinase preparations (5 μg of PKAI or PKAII or 0.25 μg of catalytic subunit solution) were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel (minigel). Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were soaked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk. The blots were probed with the specified antibody (anti-RIα (diluted 1:100), anti-RIIα (1:1000), or anti-C (1:500)) by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk overnight at 4 °C and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min. Bound anti-RI antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ulis, France) after incubation with the anti-rabbit peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. Bound anti-RIIα and anti-C antibodies were revealed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:7500, Promega, Lyon, France) and NBT and BCIP as substrates. RI and RII regulatory subunits were photoaffinity-labeled as described previously (29Raynaud F. Leduc B. Anderson W.B. Evain-Brion D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture (80 μl) containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 μm8-N3-[32P]cAMP, and 10 μg of PKA. Where indicated, 100 μm cAMP was included to block 8-N3-[32P]cAMP binding to determine nonspecific labeling. Mixtures were incubated for 60 min in the dark at 4 °C and then irradiated for 10 min with a UV lamp to allow irreversible photoaffinity binding of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP to the RI and RII subunits. The irradiated samples were pipetted into 20 μl of stop solution (9% SDS, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 6 mm EDTA, 250 mmTris-HCl, pH 8) and heated at 100 °C for 2 min. Then, 2 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol and 5 μl of 0.1% bromphenol blue in 50% (v/v) glycerol was added, and the samples were electrophoresed in 8.75% polyacrylamide slab gels containing SDS. The gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C using Cronex 4 DuPont medical x-ray film. Band intensities on autoradiograms were quantitated by scanning with a microdensitometer. Ten μg of protein labeled with 8-N3-[32P]cAMP was applied to each gel lane to allow comparison between the different lanes and autoradiograms. Care was taken not to overexpose the x-ray films. Under these conditions, peak heights obtained by scanning were proportional to the total radioactivity of the corresponding bands as estimated by scintillation counting as described by Walter (30Walter U. Uno I. Liu A.Y.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6494-6500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of RI and RII regulatory subunits was calculated by integrating the areas under the curves and subtracting nonspecific labeling (in the presence of 0.1 mm cAMP). Cyclic AMP binding activity was determined by the Millipore filtration method (Ref. 31Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, as modified in Ref. 32Gill G.N. Garren L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 39: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The incubation mixtures (225 μl) containing buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 6 mm theophylline, 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), a standard series of concentrations of [3H]cAMP (Centre d'Energie Atomique, Saclay, France, 30 Ci/mmol; 0.2–7 pmol) and 10 μg of the different types of PKA were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 4 ml of buffer A without bovine serum albumin. The samples were immediately loaded onto Millipore filters (0.45 μm, Millipore Corp., HAWPO 2500). The filters were washed twice with 4 ml of buffer A without bovine serum albumin. Radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by counting in Ready Safe scintillation solvent (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The blank value (nonspecific binding in presence of 0.1 mm cAMP) was subtracted from the total binding value. RII was phosphorylated by incubation of 2 μg of PKAII holoenzyme in the presence of 5 nm of the exogenous catalytic subunit of PKA in 20 mm MOPS, 20 mm MgCl2, 84 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 μm ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 15 μl. RII was also phosphorylated by the endogenous catalytic subunit of PKAII in the presence of 0.1 mm cAMP to dissociate the holoenzyme. For RII phosphorylation by casein kinase II, 15 nm of casein kinase II (a generous gift from Claude Cochet, INSERM U.244, Grenoble, France) was added to the incubation reaction, and 50 μm H-89 (Seikagaku Corp., Coger, Paris, France) was also added to inhibit the phosphorylation of RII by the endogenous catalytic subunit. After 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of stop solution (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Fluorescence was measured at 23 °C using 100 μl of 0.1 μm PKAI and PKAII in a quartz cuvette in a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter. For tryptophan fluorescence, the excitation wavelengh was 290 nm with a bandpass of 10 nm. The excited samples were scanned from 300 to 450 nm using an emission bandpass of 2.5 nm. For tyrosine fluorescence, the excitation wavelengh was 280 nm with a bandpass of 2.5 nm, and the excited samples were scanned from 300 to 400 nm using an emission band of 2.5 nm. For bityrosine fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was 325 nm with a bandpass of 2.5 nm, and the excited samples were scanned from 360 to 470 nm using an emission bandpass of 4 nm. Fluorescence was titrated three times independently. For cAMP titrations, PKAI was incubated with each of a series of concentrations of cAMP (0–100 μm) (33Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16343-16350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 341 nm, respectively. Bands on autoradiograms from nonsaturated autoradiography of Western blots were scanned densitometrically. The results are expressed as relative optical density units. The peak heights obtained by scanning were proportional to the amount of protein loaded onto the gel, and values were corrected according to the variations in the controls. To produce superoxide or hydroxyl radicals selectively during H2O radiolysis with γ-irradiation, aqueous solutions of PKA were saturated either with O2 (in the presence of sodium formate) or N2O alone. The phosphotransferase activities of rabbit skeletal muscle PKAI and of bovine heart muscle PKAII holoenzymes exposed to these oxygen free radical-generating systems were measured as the phosphorylation of a specific substrate in the presence and absence of cAMP. The various conditions of free radical generation did not alter the basal transferase activities of PKA in the absence of cAMP. However, the basal phosphotransferase activity of PKAI saturated with O2(in the presence of sodium formate) was higher than that in controls. Incubation of PKAI in water saturated with O2 (in the presence of sodium formate) caused a 50% decrease in theVmax of the cAMP-dependent phosphotransferase activity without modification of theKact (i.e. the concentration of cAMP required for half-maximal kinase activation; control/O2 = 3 × 10−7m) (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the cAMP-dependent phosphotransferase activity of PKAII was increased by the same conditions (Fig. 1 B). A decrease in cAMP-dependent phosphotransferase activity of both type I and type II PKA was observed after incubation in the presence of N2O (Fig. 1, C and D), and the Kact of cAMP for PKAII but not that for PKAI was modified (for PKAII, Kact(C) = 3 × 10−8m/ Kact(N2O)= 3 × 10−7m). We determined the effects of a series of doses of radiation on the cAMP-dependent activities of PKAII. The effect of radiation was dose-dependent. The maximal effect on the cAMP-dependent phosphotransferase activity of PKAII was observed with 900 grays in the presence of 50% of superoxide and 50% of hydroxyl anions (21Raynaud F. Evain-Brion D. Gerbaud P. Marciano D. Gorin I. Liapi C. Anderson W.B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This dose was used for all of the following studies. Under these experimental conditions, incubation of the holoenzymes in aqueous solutions saturated with O2 (in the presence of sodium formate) or N2O and irradiated to produce the ROS (O⨪2 or ⋅OH), respectively, the protein patterns of the holoenzymes were not noticeably modified as ascertained by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). The carboxyl termini of the RI and RII regulatory subunits of PKAI and PKAII contain two tandem homologous cAMP binding domains, called sites A and B. These two cAMP binding sites have different specificities for cAMP analogs. Site A has a faster off-rate and a preference forN 6-substituted analogs, whereas site B has a slower off-rate and exhibits a preference for C-2- and C-8-substituted cAMP analogs. We investigated whether these two cAMP binding sites are differentially altered by ROS. The phosphotransferase activities of PKAI and PKAII both before and after irradiation were measured in the presence of each of a series of concentrations of cAMP or its analogs, the N-6-substitutedN 6-Bnz-cAMP and the C-8-substituted 8-AHA-cAMP (see “Materials and Methods”; Figs.3 and 4). The maximum activity of cAMP-dependent kinase obtained in the presence of gas but without irradiation was taken as the 100% value.Figure 4In vitro effects of hydroxyl radicals generated by γ-radiation on purified rabbit PKAI and bovine PKAII. Preparations of PKA were saturated with N2O in closed vessels without irradiation (hollow squares, A–C for PKAI; D–F for PKAII) or with γ-radiation to generate ⋅OH (solid diamonds; A and D). See the legend to Fig. 2 for further details. The maximal value of cAMP-dependent kinase activity obtained in the presence of N2O without irradiation was used as the 100% value. Results are the mean of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Superoxide radical treatment of PKAI caused a 55% decrease in stimulation of PKAI phosphotransferase activity by both cAMP and 8-AHA-cAMP (Fig. 3, A and C). The apparent activation constant Kact was increased (from Kact(O2) = 3 × 10−7m/ Kact(O2-irr)= 10−6/3 × 10−5m). Interestingly, the ability of the A site-selective analogN 6-Bnz-cAMP to activate PKAI was completely abolished by exposure to superoxide radicals (Fig.3 B). In contrast, exposure of PKAII to superoxide radicals only slightly reduced stimulation of phosphotransterase activity by cAMP and the cAMP analogs (Fig. 3, D–F). Exposure of PKAI to hydroxyl radicals also resulted in a significant increase in phosphotransferase activity in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 4 A), N 6-Bnz-cAMP (Fig.4 B), and 8-AHA-cAMP (Fig. 4 C). Exposure of PKAII to hydroxyl radicals had similar effects to those on PKAI: a significant decrease in phosphotransferase activities (Fig. 4,D–F). The Kact values were also increased under these conditions, most substantially for PKAI activation by N 6-Bnz-cAMP ( Kact(O2) = 10−8m/ Kact(O2-irr)= 3 × 10−7m). The effects of ROS on cAMP binding to the RI and RII regulatory subunits of PKAI and PKAII were determined by Millipore filtration assays with [3H]cAMP or affinity labeling with 8-N3-[32P]cAMP. The first of these techniques only allows determination of affinity and binding capacity of site B. 8-N3-[32P]cAMP binds covalently to both sites A and B on RI but only to site B on RII. We also tried to estimate protein-bound [3H]cAMP by ammonium sulfate precipitation according to the method of Ogreid and Doskeland (34Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but we were unable to discriminate between sites A and B. 3H-Labeled cyclic AMP binding to the regulatory subunits of PKAI was determined in the presence of oxygen (sodium formate) without irradiation (Fig. 5 A,black diamonds), in the presence of N2O alone (Fig. 5 B, black diamonds), and after exposure to superoxide (Fig.4 C, black diamonds) or hydroxyl radicals (Fig. 5 D, black diamonds). The same experiment was performed with PKAII (Fig.6, A–D). The presence of the different gasses did not affect the Kd of PKAII for cAMP binding ( Kd (C) = Kd (O2) = Kd (N2O) = 3.6 × 10−6m; Fig. 6, A andB; Table I). However, incubation of PKAI in the presence of O2 modified cAMP binding to RI ( Kd (C) = 6.2 × 10−7m, Kd (O2) = 1.8 × 10−7m; Fig. 5 A, Table I). Incubation of PKAI in the presence of N2O resulted in decreased cAMP binding to RI ( Kd (N2O) = 9.5 × 10−7m; Fig. 5 B).Figure 6Effects of ROS on the saturation curves of specific [3H]cAMP binding to RII from purified bovine PKAII. The PKAII solutions (A and B, respectively) were saturated with O2 in the presence of 10 mm sodium formate in closed vessels and irradiated (solid diamonds) or not (hollow squares). Solutions of PKAI and PKAII (C andD, respectively) were saturated with N2O in closed vessels and irradiated (solid diamonds) or not (hollow squares). PKAI and PKAII (10 μg of protein) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with various amounts of [3H]cAMP in the absence (total binding) or in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 0.1 mm unlabeled cAMP. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific from total binding. The Scatchard plots derived from each saturation curve are shown in the insets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IThe Kd values of [3 H]cAMP binding for PKAI and PKAII and K values of cAMP transferase activity in various conditionsKact of cAMPCO2O2irr.airr., irradiated.N2ON2O irr.mPKAI3 × 10−73 × 10−710−6/3 × 10−53 × 10−63 × 10−6PKAII3 × 10−83 × 10−710−73 × 10−710−6Kd of [3H]cAMPCO2O2 irr.N2ON2O irr.mPKAI6.2 × 10−71.8 × 10−73.6 × 10−79.5 × 10−713.5 × 10−7PKAII3.6 × 10−64 × 10−62.7 × 10−63.3 × 10−62.4 × 10−6a irr., irradiated. Open table in a new tab The binding of [3H]cAMP to PKAI was reduced by treatment with superoxide radicals (Fig. 5 C). There was no change in the binding capacity under these conditions, but a difference in the affinity of RI for cAMP was observed ( Kd (O2-irr) = 3.6 10−7m, Kd (O2) = 1.8 × 10−7m; Fig. 5 C). There was no significant difference between cAMP binding to RII in the presence and absence of superoxide radicals (Fig. 6 C). Hydroxyl radicals modified [3H]cAMP binding to RI only (Fig. 5 D). Exposure of PKAI to hydroxyl radicals only affected affinity for [3H]cAMP ( Kd (N2O-irr)= 13.5 × 10−7m (RI), Kd (N2O) = 9.5 × 10−7m). Treatment of PKAII with hydroxyl radicals resulted in altered binding capacity for [3H]cAMP, although the affinity was not substantially changed ( Kd (N2O-irr)= 2.4 × 10−6m, Kd (N2O) = 3.3 × 10−6m). RII bound 10 times more [3H]cAMP than RI, as has been previously reported. TheKd values of [3H]cAMP binding for PKAI and PKAII and Kact values of cAMP transferase activity are shown in Table I. Photoaffinity labeling with 8-N3-[32P]cAMP gave different results with RI and RII. Two amino acid residues are affinity-labeled in RI (Trp260 in site A and Tyr371 in site B of RI) (35Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The ligand binds covalently to the RII subunit, which is modified at a single residue (Tyr381 in site B). Thus, the ligand does not bind covalently to the A binding site of RII (35Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I."
https://openalex.org/W2328332662,"We analysed 42 differentiated thyroid tumors including 15 follicular adenomas (FA), 13 papillary thyroid cancers (PTC) and 14 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC) with 13 microsatellite markers specific for the long arm of human chromosome 7 within 7q31; this region is deleted frequently in several other tumor types. Overall, 20 of the 42 samples analysed (48%) displayed LOH with one or more of the markers tested. LOH was detected most frequently (78%) in FTC, the most malignant of the thyroid tumors. A smallest common deleted region (SCDR) was defined in this tumor type flanked by markers D7S480 and D7S490. This SCDR is distinct from D7S522, the most commonly deleted locus in many other tumors, which was deleted in only one FTC. D7S522 did show LOH in two of six informative PTCs. None of the PTC and only two of the FAs showed LOH in the FTC SCDR. Since FA is considered a premalignant stage of FTC, our results suggest that inactivation of a putative tumor suppressor at 7q31.2 may be acquired during adenoma to carcinoma progression. The absence of LOH at this locus amongst PTC suggests that inactivation of this tumor suppressor is specific for FTC. In conclusion, LOH at 7q31 is a frequent event in differentiated thyroid cancer, and we have defined a 2 cM SCDR specific for FTC."
https://openalex.org/W2021446706,"Potassium channels play important roles in shaping the electrical properties of excitable cells. Toward understanding the transcriptional regulation of a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family, we have characterized the genomic structure and 5′-proximal promoter of the murineKcnj2 gene (also referred to as IRK1 and Kir2.1). TheKcnj2 transcription unit is composed of two exons separated by a 5.5-kilobase pair intron. Deletion analysis of 5′-flanking sequences identified a promiscuously active 172-base pair minimal promoter, whereas expression from a construct containing additional upstream sequences was cell type-restricted. The minimal promoter contained an E box, a Y box, and three GC box consensus elements but lacked both TATA and CCAAT box elements. The activity of the minimal promoter was found to be controlled by a combination of the activities of the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and NF-Y. The interplay between Sp1, Sp3, and NF-Y within the architecture of theKcnj2 promoter, the ubiquitous nature of thesetrans-acting factors, and the action of tissue-selective repressor element(s) may combine to enable a wide variety of cell types to differentially regulate Kcnj2 expression through transcriptional control.

Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Since then, at least 11 additional Kir cDNAs have been cloned and molecularly classified into at least 6 distinct subfamilies (2Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 3Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin.

The classical inward rectifier subfamily is represented by at least three members, Kir2.1–2.3. These channels play important roles in setting and maintaining the resting membrane potential, buffering the extracellular K+ concentration, controlling excitability and action potential shape, and allowing the formation of prolonged action potentials (e.g. cardiac myocytes) without excessive K+ depletion (4Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 115-140Google Scholar). Classical inward rectifiers have been electrophysiologically identified in a wide variety of tissues and cell types, ranging from central and peripheral nervous system neurons to glia, muscle, and immune system cells (3Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). As expected from the electrophysiological data, the first member of the classical inward rectifiers to be cloned, Kcnj2 (also called IRK1 and Kir2.1) (5Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), has been shown to be expressed in a variety of cells, including central nervous system neurons (6Morishige K. Takahashi N.

Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), osteoclasts (9Arkett S.A. Dixon J. Yang J.N. Sakai D.D. Minkin C. Sims S.M. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 281-293PubMed Google Scholar), and skeletal and cardiac muscle (5Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar,10Ishii K. Yamagishi T. Taira N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite playing a critical role in determining the electrical properties of a wide variety of cell types, there has been little investigation of the promoter elements that control the expression of Kir channels. Indeed, until recently, there has been only limited characterization of the promoters controlling the expression of any type of ion channel gene. However, of the ion channel gene promoters that have been studied, some common features are apparent. Comparisons of the 5′-promoters of several channel genes revealed general structural features common to the housekeeping-type promoters. The promoters of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels Kv1.5 (11Mori Y. Matsubara H. Folco E. Siegel A. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26482-26493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Kv1.4 (12Wymore R.S. Negulescu D. Kinoshita K. Kalman K. Aiyar J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15629-15634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and Kv3.1 (13Gan L. Perney T.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5859-5865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) lack consensus TATA and CCAAT boxes, are GC-rich with multiple putative Sp1 consensus elements, direct transcriptional initiation from multiple sites, and contain a relatively large number of putative regulatory elements. Initial characterizations of the N-type α1B (14Kim D.S. Jung H.-H. Park S.-H. Chin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5098-5104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and L-type α1D (15Kamp T.J. Mitas M. Fields K.L. Asoh S. Chin H. Marban E. Nirenberg M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) calcium channel promoters, and the skeletal muscle (16Sheng Z.H. Zhang H. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and brain type II (17Maue R.A. Kraner S.D. Goodman R.H. Mandel G. Neuron. 1990; 4: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) sodium channel promoters, also revealed the presence of these same general features. In addition, many of the promoters contained one or more strong silencer elements. In the case of the brain type II sodium channel promoter, it has been shown that binding of the protein REST to an upstream silencer element is critical for directing the highly neuron-specific expression pattern of this channel (18Chong J.A. Tapia Ramı́rez J. Kim S. Toledo Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Similarly, a dinucleotide repeat silencer element (19Mori Y. Folco E. Koren G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27788-27796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and a glucocorticoid response element, found in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) (20Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), may regulate Kv1.5 expression in a tissue-selective manner. An initial characterization of the Kir3.1 promoter, a member of the G-protein-regulated inwardly rectifying potassium channel subfamily, revealed many similarities to the previously described voltage-gated potassium, calcium, and sodium channel gene promoters. The Kir3.1 promoter was found to be GC-rich, lacked a TATA box element, and contained at least two silencer elements in addition to a multitude of potential positive regulatory elements (21Schoots O. Voskoglou T. Van Tol H.H. Genomics. 1997; 39: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast to the housekeeping-type structures of Kir3.1 and the voltage-gated ion channel promoters, the Kir1.1 gene was found to possess a unique multi-promoter structure that utilizes at least three different CCAAT and TATA box-containing promoters to drive the expression of distinct alternatively spliced transcripts (22Bock J.H. Shuck M.E. Benjamin C.W. Chee M. Bienkowski M.J. Slightom J.L. Gene ( Amst .). 1997; 188: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determined the genomic structure of the mouseKcnj2 (Kir2.1) gene and provided a critical analysis of thecis-elements and corresponding trans-acting factors acting at the minimal promoter. We characterized theKcnj2 promoter in the murine C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line because (i) Kcnj2 mRNA is most highly expressed in adult mouse skeletal muscle, and preliminary experiments indicated a robust expression in C2C12 myoblasts as well, and (ii) the C2C12 cell line is a well characterized model system for muscle differentiation, thus allowing the future potential to investigate Kcnj2 promoter regulation during differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes. In addition, we also utilized a non-expressing neuroblastoma cell line, Neuro 2A, to assess the tissue selectivity of various Kcnj2promoter constructs. Our data suggests that the Kcnj2promoter is organized such that the level of mRNA expression in a wide variety of cell types may be controlled by blending the activities of many ubiquitous trans-acting factors acting within the context of a generalized minimal promoter. Determination of expressingversus non-expressing cell types may be accomplished through the activity of tissue-specific silencer element(s) located distal to the non-selective minimal promoter. Titering and screening of a 129SvJ mouse genomic library (λFIXII, Stratagene) was carried out as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The library was screened using a 1.7-kb Kcnj2 cDNA fragment (BstXI ORF) containing the 5′-UTR and open reading frame (ORF) of theKcnj2 cDNA (5Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). The probe was labeled to high specific activity with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) by random primer extension and hybridized overnight at 65 °C in buffer containing 1 × 106 cpm/ml labeled probe, 250 μg/ml herring sperm DNA, 2× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, and 0.5% Na4P2O7. The filters were washed at 65 °C in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to film. Initially, 18 positive clones were identified. Detailed analysis was carried out on two overlapping clones that were determined to carry the entire Kcnj2 ORF and extended the furthest 5′ and 3′ of the coding region. The genomic DNA fragments generated by SacI orSacI/SalI digests of phage DNA were subcloned into pBS SK− (Stratagene) using standard techniques (23, 24). This generated the subclones 1.16pBS 5kb-2, 1.16pBS-3, 1.16pBS-17, 1.16pBS 2kb-2, and 1.8pBS 7kb-2 (Fig. 1). To analyze 5′- and 3′-flanking regions not represented by subclones obtained using the above strategy, two additional plasmids were generated by LA-PCR (25Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). To generate plasmid 1.8pBS 2.2kb-2, a 3.7-kb PCR product was amplified from 1.8A1 phage DNA using oligos T3 (5′-GAAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGG-3′) and 590 (5′-GGTTTCAGCTCTGGGCTCTGGC-3′), digested with SacI, and the resulting 2.2-kb fragment was subcloned into pBS SK−. Plasmid 1.8pBS 5′-proximal was generated by amplification of a 6.5-kb PCR product from 1.8A1 with oligos T7 (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′) and 616 (5′-AATTCCCAAGACACTGCTTGC-3′), digested withXbaI/KspI to yield a 3.1-kb fragment, and directionally ligated into pBS SK−. Amplification reactions were performed using the buffers described (25Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The amplification protocol consisted of 10 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 3 min at 68 °C, followed by 20 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 3 min + 10 s/cycle at 68 °C, with a final extension step of 7 min at 68 °C. The luciferase reporter vector pGL2 Basic (Promega) was used to generate all of the reporter constructs. The parental construct pGL2B Sac/RI was generated by directional ligation of the ∼800-bp SacI/EcoRI (blunted) fragment digested from the plasmid 1.16pBS 5kb-2 into pGL2 Basic at SacI/HindIII (blunted). This placed theKcnj2 promoter fragment −787/+62 immediately upstream of the luciferase gene in the 5′ to 3′ orientation. Sequential 5′ deletion constructs were generated by digestion and intramolecular ligation using the following enzymes: SacI (blunted)/NheI (blunted) to form pGL2B Nhe/RI (−629/+62), SacI (blunted)/ApaI (blunted) to form pGL2B Apa/RI (−418/+62),XmaI to form pGL2B Xma/RI (−109/+62), SacI (blunted)/BbrPI to form pGL2B BbrPI/RI (−85/+62), andSacI (blunted)/BglI (partial digest, blunted) to form pGL2B BglI/RI (−41/+62). To extend constructs beyond −787, plasmid 1.8pBS 5′-proximal was digested withKpnI/KspI, and the resulting 3.1-kb fragment was directionally ligated into pGL2B Sac/RI restricted byKpnI/KspI to generate the construct pGL2B Xba/RI (−3300/+62). A reverse orientation construct, pGL2B RI/SalI (+62/−787), was generated by subcloning the ∼850-bp SalI (blunted)/EcoRI (blunted) fragment from 1.16pBS 5kb-2 into pGL2 Basic linearized with HindIII (blunted). Reverse orientation was confirmed by sequencing. Blunting the 5′ or 3′ overhangs was accomplished by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C with Klenow in the presence or absence, respectively, of 100 μm dNTPs. Construct insertion and deletion junctions were confirmed by sequencing using TaqDyeDeoxyTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing (ABI), or TaqTrack Sequencing (Promega), or by restriction digests. Complementary mutant oligonucleotides (Fig. 4) were synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.) and used in a PCR-based strategy to generate luciferase reporter constructs with point mutations disrupting selected promoter elements. The initial step consisted of two separate PCR reactions that paired oligo 572 (5′-GGGTTTCCACAGTCTACAGGC-3′) with a specific mutant reverse primer and the complementary mutant forward primer paired with oligo 586 (5′-GCAATTGTTCCAGGAACCAGG-3′). Amplifications were carried out using 20 ng of pGL2B Sac/RI DNA in a 50-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.75, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 400 μm dNTPs, 2 μmeach primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase. The reactions were amplified for 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 65 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, with 2.5 °C/s ramps. The PCR products were purified and combined for a second PCR reaction containing oligo 572 and oligo 614 (5′-CTTTCTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC-3′), located internal to oligo 586, using the same protocol substituting 55 °C for annealing. The final PCR product was purified, digested withKspI/BssHII to generate a 173-bp transfer cassette containing the desired point mutation, and ligated in place of the wild-type KspI/BssHII cassette in pGL2B Sac/RI using standard subcloning techniques. To generate multiple point mutations, the strategy outlined above was repeated using the second set of mutant oligos. In this instance, the wild-type pGL2B Sac/RI DNA used in the initial amplification was replaced with the pGL2B Sac/RI construct containing the desired point mutant background. The transfer cassettes of each of the resulting point mutant constructs was sequenced by the dideoxy terminator method to confirm the point mutations and to check for extraneous mutations that may have resulted during the course of the PCR amplifications. C2C12 and Neuro 2A cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Myoblast stage C2C12 cells were plated at 1000–2000/cm2 and maintained at ≤70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2incubator. Neuro 2A cells were plated at 5000 cells/cm2 and maintained in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2incubator. Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen or Quantum (Bio-Rad) DNA purification columns as per manufacturer's instructions. C2C12 myoblasts were transiently transfected in triplicate using the DEAE-dextran method as outlined (23). Kcnj2 reporter constructs, in combination with a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter vector (pBC12/CMV/SEAP, kindly provided by Dr. M. Katze, University of Washington) used as an internal control, were transfected at a ratio of 4:1. C2C12 myoblasts were seeded at 1500 cells/cm2 in 100-mm tissue culture-treated plates and grown for 2 days to approximately 40–60% confluence. The plates were rinsed, drained, and incubated 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 12 μg of the luciferase construct, 3 μg of pBC12/CMV/SEAP, and 200 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. The cells were shocked 1 min with 10% Me2SO, rinsed, and incubated an additional 3 days with 8 ml of fresh media at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow for expression of the reporter proteins. Neuro 2A neuroblastoma cells were plated at 5000 cells/cm2 in 60-mm plates, grown 2 days, and transfected using the calcium phosphate method as outlined (23). For Neuro 2A transfections, the reporter construct to pBC12/CMV/SEAP ratio was 8:1. Cells were incubated in calcium phosphate 6 h, shocked 3 min with 10% Me2SO, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated 24 h with 3 ml of complete media at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to allow for expression of the reporter proteins. One milliliter of the conditioned media was reserved for the secreted alkaline phosphatase assay described previously (26Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), the results of which were later used to correct for transfection efficiency. To measure luciferase activity, the transfected plates were rinsed and lysed in 500 or 200 μl of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mmMgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation, and 50 μl of the resulting supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (23). The luciferase/SEAP activity ratio was used to correct for transfection efficiency between plates. The normalized values were expressed as a relative percentage of the luciferase/SEAP ratio obtained for the pGL2B Sac/RI construct, which was included in each set of experiments as a common reference point. The data shown in Figs. 3 and 8 are the average of the mean ± S.E. of between 3 and 13 experiments, each experiment performed in triplicate. Student's t test was used for statistical comparisons between measurements.Figure 8Effect of point mutations on minimal promoter activity. pGL2B Sac/RI reporter constructs containing point mutations within selected promoter elements were transiently transfected in triplicate into C2C12 myoblasts, and luciferase activity was measured 72 h later. Transfection efficiency was normalized to secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase activity obtained by co-transfection with pBC12/CMV/SEAP. 100% activity was arbitrarily set to the luciferase/SEAP ratio obtained from the wild-type pGL2B Sac/RI construct, which was included in all experiments. For statistical purposes, the Student's t test was used to compare relative activity values. Asterisks indicate at leastp < 0.005 when compared with pGL2B Xma/RI. Pound signs (#) indicate at least p < 0.002 when compared with pGL2B Sac/RI μSp1(N).

The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, counted, and pelleted a final time. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (27Latchman D.S. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Transcription Factors: A Practical Approach The Practical Approach Series. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar), except 400 mm NaCl was used to extract the nuclear proteins (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). The extract was centrifuged 30 min, 24,000 ×g, 4 °C, and the supernatant aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for later use in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) as the nuclear extract fraction. The protein concentration of an aliquot was determined by Bradford assay (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were prepared by annealing equimolar amounts of complementary single-stranded oligos in a thermal cycler (PTC-200, MJ Research) with the following protocol: 5 min at 90 °C, 20 min at 60 °C, 25 min at 45 °C, 30 min at 30 °C, 30 min at 15 °C, ramp between steps at 0.1 °C/s. Typically, 2 pmol of double-stranded oligo probe were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) and diluted to a working concentration of 20 nm with TE (10 mm Tris-base, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). When appropriate, 5′ overhangs were filled in using Klenow in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled dNTPs prior to dilution. Promoter fragment probes were digested from the appropriate wild-type or mutant reporter constructs with eitherSmaI/BssHII, BbrPI/BssHII, or BglI/BssHII, and the resulting fragments (−107/+20, −85/+20, and −41/+20, respectively) were isolated by electrophoresis and purified using GELase (Epicenter) as per manufacturer's instructions. The fragments were labeled by a fill-in reaction of the 5′ BssHII overhang using Klenow in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and diluted to a working concentration of 20 nm with TE. Binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 2 μg of nuclear extract, 1–2 μg of poly[dI·dC] (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% Ficoll, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm monovalent salt, and 20 fmol of labeled probe. Reactions were preincubated 30 min at RT without probe and an additional 30 min at RT after addition of the labeled probe. An additional 30-min incubation at RT was included when unlabeled competitor oligos or antibodies were introduced to the binding reactions. αSp1, αSp3, and αNF-I-specific antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The αNF-Ya antibody was purchased from Rocklin, Inc. The αYB-1 serum was kindly provided by Dr. Jenny P.-Y. Ting, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. αUSF-1 and αUSF-2 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Michele Sawadogo, M.D. Anderson Cancer Research Center. αMyc and αMax antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Eisenman, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. After binding, 0.5 μl of tracking dye (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol) was added, and the reactions were electrophoresed at RT for 3 h, 130 V (∼10 V/cm) on a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE, fixed, dried, and exposed to film. Exposures were typically 4–24 h at −80 °C with an enhancing screen. To map the transcriptional start sites, we used the RNase protection protocol as outlined (30Bordonaro M. Saccomanno C.F. Nordstrom J.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 428-430PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from various mouse tissues and cell lines was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA was hybridized with 5 × 105 cpm antisense probe overnight at 60 °C in 30 μl of hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After processing, the protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7.5m urea, 1× TBE gel, fixed, dried, and exposed to film overnight with an enhancing screen. The Kcnj2 antisense probe plasmid was generated by PCR amplification of a 600-bp PCR product from C3H genomic DNA using oligos 347 (5′-GGGACATGGAGTGGAAGTGG-3′), located within exon 1, and 572 (5′-GGGTTTCCACAGTCTACAGGC-3′), located upstream of the cDNA. The 600-bp product was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega), digested with NcoI and EcoRI, blunted, and re-ligated to generate the plasmid pGEM-T EcoRI/572. pGEM-T EcoRI/572 was linearized with KspI and reverse-transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to generate a 214-bp antisense probe. To determine the structure of theKcnj2 gene, we screened a 129SvJ mouse genomic library with a 1.7-kb Kcnj2 cDNA probe containing the 5′-UTR and ORF. Nine positive phage clones were plaque-purified to homogeneity and classified by restriction digest into five overlapping groups of clones. Each group was determined by Southern blot analysis to contain the entire Kcnj2 ORF. Clones 1.8A1 and 1.16A1, spanning a total of 25-kb genomic DNA, were found to extend the furthest 5′ and 3′, respectively, of the ORF. Extensive characterization of these clones by Southern blot, subcloning, and sequencing confirmed that theKcnj2 ORF is intronless (32Stanfield P.R. Davies N.W. Shelton P.A. Khan I.A. Brammar W.J. Standen N.B. Conley E.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1994; 475: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our analysis extends this finding to the 3′-UTR, which was found to be contiguous with the ORF and also intronless. The 5′-UTR, however, was found to contain a large, approximately 5.5-kb, intron (Fig.1 A). Sequencing of subclones 1.16pBS5kb-2 and 1.16pBS-17 identified consensus 5′ donor and 3′ acceptor splice sites in the genomic sequence that places the exon 1/exon 2 boundary at position +168/+169 in the 5′-UTR of the Kcnj2 mRNA (Fig. 1 C). Sequence comparison of the distal portion of the cDNA clone 3′-UTR with sequence from the genomic clones 1.16pBS-3 and 1.8pBS 7kb-2 identified two putative polyadenylation consensus sequences located approximately 3.8-kb downstream of the stop codon (Fig. 1 D). Immediately 3′ of the polyadenylation consensus sequences in the genomic sequence are a number of GT-rich sequence motifs similar to sequences often found associated with functional polyadenylation sites (33Wahle E.

https://openalex.org/W2038075249,"Activation of protein kinases plays an important role in the Ca2+-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion by nutrients. The aim of the present study was to identify kinase substrates with the potential to regulate secretion because these have been poorly defined. Nutrient stimulation of the rat insulinoma RINm5F cell line and rat pancreatic islets resulted in an increase in the threonine phosphorylation of a 200-kDa protein. This was secondary to the gating of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels because it was reproduced by depolarizing KCl concentrations and blocked by the Ca2+ channel antagonist, verapamil. The peak rises in [Ca2+]i preceded or were coincident with the maximal threonine phosphorylation in response to both glyceraldehyde and KCl. In digitonin-permeabilized RINm5F cells a rise in Ca2+ from 0.1 to 0.15 μm was sufficient to increase phosphorylation. Protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II did not appear to be responsible for the phosphorylation, yet the Ca2+ dependence of the response suggests possible involvement of other members of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase family. The 200-kDa protein was identified as myosin heavy chain by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal nonmuscle myosin antibody. Phosphopeptide mapping indicated that the site of phosphorylation on myosin heavy chain was the same for both KCl- and glyceraldehyde-stimulated cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed a low basal phosphothreonine content of myosin heavy chain, which increased 6-fold in response to KCl. A lesser (2-fold) increase in serine phosphorylation was also detected using this technique. Although myosin IIA and IIB were shown to be present in RINm5F cells and rat islets, myosin IIA was the predominant threonine-phosphorylated species, suggesting that the two myosin species might be independently regulated. Our results identify myosin heavy chain as a novel kinase substrate in pancreatic β-cells and suggest that it might play an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion.

Our results identify myosin heavy chain as a novel kinase substrate in pancreatic β-cells and suggest that it might play an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion. Glucose is a major metabolic regulator of insulin secretion from the β-cell of the pancreas. Intregral to this regulation is the capacity of the β-cell to act as a “fuel sensor” detecting subtle changes in circulating blood nutrients (1Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67 (1124): 1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Glucose, unlike hormones and neurotransmitters, does not bind to a receptor but is rapidly transported into the cell and metabolized, resulting in the generation of coupling factors and other mitochondrially derived signals (1Prentki M. Matschinsky F.M. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67 (1124): 1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol.

One important consequence of glucose metabolism is thought to be an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio, which brings about closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, resulting in cell depolarization, and the consequent opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (5Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Although these initial consequences of glucose metabolism within the β-cell have been well characterized and the distal components of the secretory process are being identified at a molecular level, the intermediate steps still remain poorly understood. One important link between the early stages of glucose metabolism and the exocytosis of insulin is a rise in [Ca2+]i (5Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 6Wollheim C.B. Sharp G.W. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 914-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 7Wollheim C.B. Biden T.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 488: 317-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it may also play a direct role in the docking or fusion of the secretory granules to the plasma membrane (8Lang J.C. Fukuda M. Zhang H. Mikoshiba K. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5837-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), there is much evidence to suggest that a major role of the rise in [Ca2+]i is to activate Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (9Ashcroft S.J.H. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 21-29Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar).

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have been implicated in regulating insulin secretion. In general the substrates for these are still being identified, although one well defined substrate for PKC is the cytoskeleton-associated MARCKS (myristoylatedalanine-rich kinasesubstrate) protein (14Easom R.A. Landt M. Colca J.R. Hughes J.H. Turk J. McDaniel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14938-14946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of PKC, however, in nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion remains controversial (10Zawalich W.S. Rasmussen H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 70: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Howell S.L. Life Sci. 1992; 50: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The importance of CaM kinase is better documented, and it has been widely reported to mediate phosphorylation of a 55-kDa islet cell protein in response to nutrient stimulation (12Harrison D.E. Ashcroft S.J. Christie M.R. Lord J.M. Experientia. 1984; 40: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This protein has not yet been identified; however, tubulin, a cytoskeleton-associated protein, has been suggested as a possible candidate (15Colca J.R. Brooks C.L. Landt M. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently there has been direct evidence to show that MAP2, a microtubule-associated protein, is a major substrate for CaM kinase II in the pancreatic β-cell (16Krueger K.A. Bhatt H. Landt M. Easom R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27464-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggests that proteins associated with the cytoskeleton may be important kinase substrates linking the rise in [Ca2+]i to insulin secretion. protein kinase C Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase A myosin heavy chain myosin light chain Krebs-Ringer buffer 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-β-acetate bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Cytoskeletal proteins have long been suspected to play a role in insulin secretion (17Howell S.L. Tyhurst M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Myosin is one of the major cytoskeletal proteins in eukaryotic cells (18Cheney R.E. Riley M.A. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1993; 24: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It functions primarily as a motor protein and is therefore involved in a diverse range of cellular functions including cytokinesis and cellular movement and has also been postulated to be involved in secretion (19Adelstein R.S. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Cardiol. 1987; 59: 4B-10BAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Spudich J.A. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 21Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

Conventional, Type II myosin forms part of the diverse family of vertebrate myosin proteins. It is a hexameric complex of proteins that consists of two 200-kDa heavy chains noncovalently bound to two pairs of light chains (17–22 kDa), of which one pair is classified as essential and the other pair is classified as regulatory (20Spudich J.A. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Type II myosin heavy chain (MHC) has shown that there are three general classes: smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and nonmuscle myosin (23Sellers J.R. Goodson H.V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1323-1423PubMed Google Scholar). Isoforms of MHC also exist within these groups. Conventional smooth muscle myosin has two alternatively spliced isoforms, MHC 200 and MHC 204 (24Nagai R. Kuro-o M. Babij P. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9734-9737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kelley C.A. Adelstein R.S. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1994; 72: 1351-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas nonmuscle MHC is comprised of two genetically distinct isoforms referred to as MHC-A and MHC-B (26Simons M. Wang M. McBride O.W. Kawamoto S. Yamakawa K. Gdula D. Adelstein R.S. Weir L. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 27Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Regulation of the myosin-actin complex is thought to occur predominantly via the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains at a number of specific sites. It has been shown that MLC kinase phosphorylates MLC sequentially on serine 19 and threonine 18 (28Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8750-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In mast cells, PKC phosphorylates MLC on serine 1 and serine 2 residues (21Ludowyke R.I. Peleg I. Beaven M.A. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12492-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MLC by MLC kinase is thought to help stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the myosin complex and increase the actin-activated ATPase activity (29Moussavi R.S. Kelley C.A. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 128: 219-227Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of MLC with PKC appears to have no obvious effect on myosin contractile activity. Although a number of recent studies have shown that MHC can also undergo phosphorylation in protozoans (30Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16983-16986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 60Sabry J.H. Moores S.L. Ryan S. Zang J.H. Spudich J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2605-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), there are few reports of phosphorylation of this protein in vertebrates. The aim of this study was to define changes in Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation upon nutrient stimulation of rat pancreatic islets and RINm5F cells. The latter are rat insulinoma cells that secrete insulin in response to glyceraldehyde via mechanisms similar to those initiated by glucose in native β-cells (32Praz F. Lesavre P. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 1396-1399PubMed Google Scholar). During the course of this investigation we found that there was an increase in both serine and threonine phosphorylation of MHC, which occurred secondarily to the rise in [Ca2+]i. Our results raise the possibility that myosin function might be controlled through mechanisms in addition to light chain phosphorylation and suggest that phosphorylation of MHC itself may be an important link between the initial rise of [Ca2+]i and the latter steps of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. Reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma, Calbiochem (Alexandria, NSW, Australia), BDH (MERCK Pty Limited, VIC, Australia), or Bio-Rad unless otherwise stated. Tissue culture supplies were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. except the fetal and newborn calf serum, which was purchased from CSL Limited (Parkville, VIC, Australia). Anti-myosin (nonmuscle) antibody was from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, MA). Anti-phosphothreonine and anti-phosphoserine antibodies were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The myosin IIA and myosin IIB antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Robert Adelstein (Laboratory of Molecular Cardiology, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was obtained from Jacksons Immunoresearch Laboratory Inc. (West Grove, PA). Insulin radioimmunoassay kit was purchased from Linco Research Inc. (St. Charles, MO). Fura 2 (free acid) and Fura 2AM were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents for immunoblotting were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid was obtained from Amersham Life Science (Buckinghamshire, UK). Islets were isolated from 230–270-g male Wistar rats by ductal infusion of collagenase and cultured as described previously (33Biden T.J. Davison A.G.M. Prugue M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Batches of 200–300 islets were picked and washed with a modified KRB containing 5 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.8 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 0.5% (w/v) BSA. The islets were preincubated in 0.2 ml BSA-free KRB for 10 min at 37 °C. Stimulating solutions (0.8 ml) were then added, and the islets were incubated at 37 °C for the time periods as stated. The incubation was terminated by gentle centrifugation and rapid removal of the supernatant. Islets were resuspended in 50 μl of RIPA buffer (1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)). Extracts were then sonicated 3 × 10 s using a Branson model 250 sonifier and microtip at power setting 1 and 10% duty cycle. RINm5F cells were maintained in T-75 tissue culture flasks in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin in 5% CO2:95% air at 37 °C. For studies with cell suspensions, monolayers were treated with trypsin/EDTA solution. Cells were then allowed to recover in a spinner medium (containing the same components as the culturing medium with the addition of 10 mm Hepes and 1% newborn calf serum instead of 10% fetal calf serum) for 3 h at 37 °C. RBL-2H3 and COS-7 cells were maintained and used as adherent monolayers as described previously (34Ludowyke R.I. Kawasugi K. French P.W. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 357-367PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested from the spinner medium and resuspended in KRB with 0.1% (w/v) BSA at 1 × 106 cells/ml. 1-ml aliquots were placed into 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes and preincubated at 37 °C. After 15 min, 800 μl of supernatant was removed and pooled to enable measurement of background secretion. Stimulating solutions (800 μl of 1.2× concentrate) were added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for a further 15 min. Incubations were terminated by placing the samples on ice. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was removed to determine insulin content using a radioimmunoassay kit with rat insulin as standard. The fluorescence dye Fura 2AM (1 μm) was added 30 min prior to removing cells from the spinner medium. Cells were then washed three times in spinner medium and resuspended at 5 × 106cells/ml. Aliquots of 0.4 ml (2 × 106 cells) were centrifuged (90 × g for 5 min), and the pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of KRB containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and 200 μm sulfinpyrazone. Cells were activated by the addition of glyceraldehyde (10 mm) or KCl (30 mm), and the fluorescence was measured at 37 °C on a HITACHI F-4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Cells were harvested from spinner medium as described above and resuspended in a potassium glutamate buffer (buffer A: 140 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0)) at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml (36Vallar L. Biden T.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5049-5056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (2 ml) were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Digitonin (final concentration, 10 μm) was added to the cells, and they were incubated for a further 5 min. Permeabilization was terminated with the addition of 30 ml of ice-cold buffer A. Cells were then recovered after gentle centrifugation at 60 × g for 10 min and resuspended at 1.5 × 107 cells/ml in buffer A with the addition of 5 mm Mg-ATP. Efficiency of cell permeabilization was measured using Trypan blue and was routinely 60–70% permeabilized. A 200-μl (3 × 106 cells) aliquot of cells was then incubated on ice for 10 min with Ca2+/EGTA buffer. Defined free Ca2+ concentrations over a range of 10−7 to 10−5m were obtained by mixing 10 mm Ca2+/EGTA with 10 mmCa2+ according to previously calculated ratios (36Vallar L. Biden T.J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5049-5056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as verified by fluorescence spectroscopy with Fura 2-free acid. Residual nonpermeabilized cells are not responsive to Ca2+ over this range. After preincubation with the specific Ca2+ buffer (and kinase inhibitors where stated) permeabilized cells were then placed at 37 °C for a further 5 min. The reaction was terminated by centrifugation of the cells at 13,000 × g. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 μl of RIPA buffer, sonicated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described below. Cells were incubated and stimulated in BSA-free KRB as for the insulin secretion studies. At the end of the incubation period, 1 × 106 to 3 × 106 cells were centrifuged, supernatant was removed, and cells were then lysed by the addition of 50 μl of RIPA buffer and sonicated as described in the islet experiments. A 10–15-μl aliquot of sample was then denatured in Laemmli sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for 5 min at 100 °C prior to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and transfer efficiency was checked by staining of the membrane with Ponceau Red. The membrane was then blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder. Incubation with the primary antibodies was for 2 h at room temperature followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands were visualized using immunoblot chemiluminescence reagents. In the competition experiments the phosphothreonine antibody was preincubated for 2 h at room temperature with differing (phospho)amino acids (1 mm) and then used for immunoblotting as described above. When required, membranes were stripped of antibodies using a buffer containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min. Cells were seeded into a 6-well plate at 3 × 106 cells/well and cultured overnight at 37 °C. Attached RINm5F cells were used in the immunoprecipitation experiments because they showed a similar increase in threonine phosphorylation of all proteins upon stimulation with KCl (data not shown) but were easier to manipulate under these circumstances than those in suspension. Cells were washed twice with 3 ml of KRB and preincubated in 2 ml of KRB at 37 °C for 10 min. Medium (1.6 ml) was then removed, and cells were activated with the addition of 1.6 ml of stimulating solutions. The incubation was terminated by placing the cells on ice and removing the medium. Lysis buffer (450 μl) containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) (38Ludowyke R.I. Scurr L.L. McNally C.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5130-5138PubMed Google Scholar) was added, and the plates were left on ice for 15 min. Cells were scraped off, and the lysate was sedimented at 100,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was precleared with pansorbin (a standardizedStaphylococcus aureus cell suspension) at one-fifth the final lysate volume for 30 min at 4 °C. The pansorbin was sedimented, and the cell lysate was then incubated with 20 μl of anti-myosin IgG (nonmuscle) or 20 μl (10 μg) of anti-phosphothreonine on a nutator at 4 °C for 2 h. A further 90 μl of pansorbin was added for an additional hour of incubation. The mixture was then sedimented by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed three times. The first wash was with lysis buffer as described above; the second was in a 1:1 dilution of lysis buffer with standard phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4); and the third was in phosphate-buffered saline alone. The pellet was then resuspended in 75 μl of preheated (90 °C) Laemmli sample buffer and heated for a further 5 min at 90 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube, and a sample (10 μl) was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The MHC could be detected once the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Relative protein levels were determined by scanning the MHC band on a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer PDSI (Sunnyvale, CA), thereby allowing for correction of protein loading in subsequent immunoblots or phosphoamino acid analysis. Cells were cultured and seeded in 6-well plates as described above. On the day of the experiment, medium was removed, and cells were gently washed twice with a phosphate-free salt solution (119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 4 mm glutamine, and 25 mm PIPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) (38Ludowyke R.I. Scurr L.L. McNally C.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5130-5138PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (200 μCi/well) for 2 h at 37 °C. Radioactive supernatant was removed, and cells were washed once with 3 ml of warmed phosphate-free buffer and once with 3 ml of KRB. Cells were preincubated in 2.5 ml of KRB for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated for 5 min, and the incubation was stopped by aspirating the stimulating solutions and placing cells on ice. Lysis buffer was added, and immunoprecipitation was carried out as above. Myosin immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled cells was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The areas containing the labeled MHC were cut from the gel and washed three times in 25% (v/v) isopropanol followed by two washes in 10% (v/v) methanol. Gel slices were chopped into mm3 pieces and resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 60 μg ofl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (10 units/ml). After incubation on a nutator at 37 °C for 24 h, the gel slice digests were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 1 min. The supernatants were then lyophilized. The residue was twice resuspended in water and lyophilized. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of electrophoresis buffer containing acetic acid:formic acid:deionized water (15:5:80). Samples were then spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate. The peptides were separated by electrophoresis at 1000 V for approximately 60 min at 4 °C in the first dimension using Orange G and Acid Fuchsin as marker dyes. Plates were dried, and peptides were then subjected to ascending chromatography in a solution containing n-butyl alcohol:pyridine:acetic acid:formic acid:deionized water (127.5:22.5:45:15:90) for 6 h. Plates were again dried, and radioactive peptides were identified by autoradiography. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 6 m HCl and incubated at 110 °C for 2.5 h. The hydrolysate was lyophilized, and the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of first dimension electrophoresis buffer (pH 1.9) (formic acid (88% w/v):glacial acetic acid:deionized water (1:3.1:35.9)). Samples (5–10 μl) were spotted onto cellulose TLC plates using 2 μl each of phosphothreonine, phosphoserine, and phosphotyrosine (1 mg/ml) as standards. Green marker dye (5 mg/ml ε-dinitrophenyl-lysine and 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol FF) was used to measure electrophoresis progress. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out on a Pharmacia Biotech Multiphor II. The first dimension was run at 1000 V for 65 min in buffer (pH 1.9). The second dimension was run at 1000 V for 30 min in buffer (pH 3.6) (glacial acetic acid:pyridine:deionized water (10:1:189)). Phosphoamino acid standards were detected by spraying the TLC plate with ninhydrin. The TLC plate was dried, and the radioactivity of the spots corresponding to the relative phosphoamino acids was analyzed by phosphorimaging on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445 SI. Duplicate samples (5 μl) were also subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis (as described above), and the radioactive phosphoamino acids were scraped from the plates and counted on a Beckman LS6000 scintillation counter in 1 ml of deionized water. The initial aim of this study was to investigate changes in threonine and serine phosphorylation in lysates of RINm5F cells that had been stimulated with the nutrient secretagogue glyceraldehyde. Commercial grade serine and threonine antibodies were used to study changes in protein phosphorylation. The serine antibody detected phosphorylated proteins only poorly (Fig. 1 A). The threonine antibody proved to be more efficient. Stimulation of RINm5F cells with 10 mm glyceraldehyde resulted in an increase in threonine phosphorylation of a protein that comigrated with the 200-kDa marker (Fig. 1 B). Although a 66-kDa protein showed higher basal levels of threonine phosphorylation, it was the 200 kDa protein that predominantly increased in threonine phosphorylation upon stimulation of these cells. Competition experiments demonstrated that the phosphothreonine antibody was specific for phosphothreonine residues because preincubation with 1 mm phosphothreonine completely abolished the immunoreactivity of the 200-kDa protein (Fig.1 C, lane 2). In contrast, clearly detectable signals were still obtained after preincubation with 1 mmphosphoserine or threonine itself (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 4). To extend the relevance of this response to nontumoral cells, pancreatic islets were stimulated with glucose (16.7 mm), and threonine phosphorylation was determined over a series of time intervals (Fig.2 A). In islets there was also an increase in threonine phosphorylation of a 200-kDa protein. This response was rapid in onset, reached a maximum by 5 min, and declined toward basal levels by 15 min. Fig. 2 B shows the similar time courses undertaken in RINm5F cells using glyceraldehyde (10 mm) and a depolarizing agent KCl (30 mm), both of which promote Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated ion channels. Stimulation with KCl resulted in a transient increase in threonine phosphorylation very similar to that seen with glucose in islets, except that it approached its peak within 1 min. The glyceraldehyde response showed a slightly different pattern, being slower in onset, peaking at 15 min, and remaining elevated up to 30 min. In RINm5F cells, stimulation wit"

TxA2 receptors are members of the G-protein-coupled class of receptors (5Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S. Nature. 1991; 349: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and exhibit seven transmembrane domains, which are presumed to contain the ligand binding domain. The cDNAs for human TxA2 receptors have been cloned from placenta (5Hirata M. Hayashi Y. Ushikubi F. Yokota Y. Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Narumiya S.

Information concerning the ligand binding site and other functional domains is currently limited and the result of site-directed mutagenesis studies (9Chiang N. Kan W.M. Tai H. Arch. Biochem.

Because, like most G-protein-coupled receptors, TxA2 receptors are natively expressed at low levels, studies employing affinity labeling techniques to determine the ligand binding domain, which require hundreds of picomoles of receptors, have not been conducted. The methods currently developed for purification of TxA2receptors use human platelets as the source (11Ushikubi F. Nakajima M. Hirata M. Okuma M. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J . Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16496-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These procedures suffer from low yields and are time-consuming, requiring as many as 5 days, with small quantities of receptor typically being purified per week. Hexahistidine tagging of proteins for purification by means of immobilized metal ion chromatography has been used for a number of proteins expressed in bacteria (12Wu C. Zhang J. Abu-Soud H.

The hexahistidine tag allows for a fast and efficient one-step purification of the receptors using a nickel ion affinity column (17Porath J.C. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar). Such a small tag does not modify the structure of proteins in a significant way (18Dobeli H. Trekziak A. Gillessen D.

Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and β-adrenergic receptors (19Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have been purified using this approach. Of the various forms of mass spectrometry, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has proven to be very useful for the study of proteins and peptides (20Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). MALDI-MS is highly sensitive and accurate and has a high tolerance for impurities. However, MALDI-MS of hydrophobic membrane proteins has proven to be challenging requiring strong organic solvents (21Schey K.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 61: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the α-isoform of TxA2 receptors were expressed as C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged recombinant fusion proteins in COS-7 cells and CHO cells, characterized by radioligand binding assays and functional studies, and partially purified using nickel ion affinity chromatography. The receptors were purified to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, dissolved in an acetone-based solvent system, and subjected to MALDI-MS. An oligonucleotide encoding the hexahistidine residue and stop codon was synthesized, with aPstI overhang on the 5′ end and an XhoI overhang on the 3′ end. The sequences were as follows: forward strand (P814), 5′-GCATCATCATCATCATCATTAGC-3′; reverse strand (P815), 3′-ACGTCGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAATCGAGCT-5′. The TxA2 receptor cDNA was originally cloned from HEL cells (8Allan C.J. Higashiura K. Martin M. Morinelli T.A. Kurtz D.T. Geoffroy O. Meier G.P. Gettys T.W. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1132-1139PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the BamHI/EcoRV site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant vector pcDNA3-TxA2 receptor was digested with BamHI and PstI. PstI excises the cDNA immediately before the stop codon. The fragment was gel-purified and ligated to the oligonucleotide. The resulting construct was ligated into pcDNA3 that had been digested withBamHI and XhoI. DNA sequencing confirmed the ligation. COS-7 cells and CHO cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FBS and 1% Antibiotic/Antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in CO2 incubators. COS-7 cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3-C-His-TxA2 receptor or pcDNA3-wt-TxA2 receptor using the DEAE-dextran technique. Briefly, cells were grown to approximately 70% confluence in 100 mm dishes, washed twice with PBS, and overlaid with 6 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS containing DEAE-dextran (250 μg/ml), Tris (100 mm, pH 7.3), and plasmid (0.8 μg/ml). Four hours later, the cells were washed twice with PBS, treated with 10% Me2SO in PBS for 3 min, and then incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS containing 0.1 mm chloroquine for 2 h. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 10 ml of DMEM with 10% FBS and harvested after 60–72 h. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes. cDNA (10 μg) and LipofectAMINE (30 μl) were separately diluted in serum-free DMEM to 200-μl volumes, mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and overlaid with 5 ml of serum free DMEM to which the DNA-lipid complexes were added. The cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, the medium replaced with DMEM-10% FBS, and harvested after 60–72 h. COS-7 cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. Dishes were washed twice with PBS and scraped into ice-cold HEPES (25 mm) plus EDTA(2 mm) containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and benzamidine (0.16 mg/ml). Crude membranes were prepared by Dounce homogenization followed by a centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Membranes were resuspended in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitors as mentioned above. Membranes were stored at −80 °C. Tunicamycin (2 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested after another 48 h. Membrane proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the proteins were probed using four different anti-TxA2 receptor peptide antibodies raised against different regions of the TxA2receptor. The antibodies and the sequences they recognized were “PH3” (QHAALFEWHAC; amino acids 88–97), “PH4” (TLCHVYHGQEC; amino acids 221–231), “767” (QPRLSTRPRS; amino acids 320–329), and “794” (RPAVASQRRA; amino acids 141–150). In addition, an anti C-His antibody (Invitrogen) was also used. All Western blots were performed according to standard protocols (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST (0.1% Tween 20) containing 7.5% milk, incubated for 60 min at room temperature in the antisera diluted 1:5000 in TBST, and washed 2 × 5 min with large volumes of TBST. The secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or anti-mouse (Bio-Rad), diluted 1:5000 in TBST. After incubation with the second antibody for 60 min at room temperature, membranes were washed 4 × 5 min with TBST. Detection was performed using the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. Crude membranes were prepared by Dounce homogenization followed by a centrifugation at 100,000 ×g. Membranes were resuspended in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Membrane protein (2–5 μg) was incubated with 50,000–100,000 cpm/tube of [125I]I-BOP (22Morinelli T.A. Oatis J.E. Okwu A.K. Mais D.E. Mayeux P.R. Masuda A. Knapp D.R. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Separation of bound from free ligand was done by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters using a Brandel Harvester (Gaithersburg, MD). Filters were washed three times, and the radioactivity associated with the filters was counted using an LKB γ counter. L-657925 (100 μm), a TxA2 receptor antagonist, was used to determine specific binding. Nonspecific binding was 1–2% of the total bound counts for [125I]I-BOP and 10–15% for [125I]I-SAP. For radioligand binding with detergent-solubilized membranes, polyethyleneimine-soaked filters were used to separate the bound from free ligand. The binding buffer used was HEPES (25 mm), EDTA (2 mm), CHAPS (5 mm), asolectin (100 μg/ml), pH 6.5. The wash buffer was HEPES (25 mm), EDTA (2 mm), CHAPS (0.1 mm), pH 6.5. TxA2 receptor-mediated signaling was studied by measuring I-BOP stimulation of cAMP and inositol phosphate (IP) formation in transiently transfected CHO cells and COS cells (cAMP only), using a method modified from Kosugi et al.

COS-7 and CHO cells in 100-mm dishes were grown to 80% confluence and transfected with wt-TxA2 receptor or C-His-TxA2receptor as described above. After 24 h, the cells were passaged into 12 well plates and grown in inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2.5 μCi of myo-2-[3H]inositol (NEN Life Science Products). After 48 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min with 0.5 ml of PBS containing 10 mm LiCl, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 0–100 nm I-BOP ± 10 or 50 μm SQ29548. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were scraped and centrifuged and the supernatant was divided into two aliquots: 100 μl for cAMP assay and 900 μl for IP assay. cAMP was assayed using a standard radioimmunoassay, modified from Lima (25Lima J.J. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1996; 16: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For measurement of IPs, the supernatants were extracted with ether three times. The upper layer containing ether was discarded and the pH of the lower organic layer was adjusted to between 6.0 and 7.0 with 50 mm Tris base. The samples were loaded on AG1-X8 anion exchange columns, and total IPs were eluted using 1.0 m ammonium formate in 0.1m formic acid. Samples were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). COS-7 membranes were thawed on ice and resuspended in HEPES (25 mm; pH 7.4) buffer at a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml. Glycerol was added at 0.25 ml/ml of resuspended membranes. Protease inhibitors (see above) were added followed by CHAPS (to a final concentration of 10 mm). The membranes were kept on ice for 4 h with occasional mixing. The membranes were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was transferred to a 15-ml conical tube and 0.25 volumes of dilution buffer (25 mm HEPES, 10 mm CHAPS, 20% glycerol, 2.5m KCl, 1 mg/ml asolectin) were added. The solubilized membranes were kept on ice until used. Ni2+-NTA resin (0.5 ml) was equilibrated by washing with double-distilled H2O followed by the equilibration buffer (25 mmHEPES, 10 mm CHAPS, 20% glycerol, 0.5 m KCl, 0.2 mg/ml asolectin; pH 7.4). Solubilized membranes were added to the resin (0.5 ml) in a 15-ml conical tube and nutated at 4 °C for 4 hr. The mixture was transferred to a 10-ml column, and the void was collected. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of equilibration buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. The receptor was then eluted in 0.5-ml fractions in equilibration buffer without the glycerol containing 200 mm imidazole at pH 6.5. Partially purified receptors (25 μl; ∼2 pmol) were added to 62.5 mm MES, 10 mm CHAPS buffer, pH 6.5 containing 2–4 × 106 cpm of [125I]I-SAP-N3 in a total volume of 100 μl. The samples were incubated in the dark for 30 min at 30 °C. Cross-linking was achieved by photolysis with UV light for 10 s. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and heating to 70 °C for 30 s. The samples were electrophoresed on an SDS gel and autoradiographed. The procedure for MALDI-TOF MS analysis was modified from Liang et al. (26Liang X. Bai J. Liu Y.-H. Lubman D.M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Partially purified receptors (∼100 pmol) were electrophoresed on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membrane was stained with Ponceau S (0.5% in 1% acetic acid) for 2 min and destained using distilled water. The band representing C-His-TxA2 receptors was excised with a sharp blade, dried, and dissolved in acetone/trifluoroacetic acid (5%) saturated with sinapinic acid. Hexafluoroisopropanol was added to a final concentration of 12.5%. After thorough mixing, 1 μl of the sample was placed on the sample plates, dried and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Mass spectra were obtained using a Voyager-DE (PerSeptive Biosystems) time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with delayed extraction technology for improved mass resolution. External calibration was performed using insulin and myoglobin as standards. Protein assays were performed using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For very dilute samples, Amido Black protein assay (27Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was used. The following were generous gifts: ONO11113 from Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan; U46619, Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI; L657925 and L657926, Merck Frosst Canada Inc., Point Claire-Dorval, Quebec, Canada; SQ29548, Dr. Martin Ogletree, Squibb Institute for Medical Research, Princeton, NJ. Restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Acrylamide, protein molecular weight standards, and other reagents used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Unless stated, all other reagents were from Sigma. Radioligand binding data were subjected to Scatchard analysis using the programs EBDA and LIGAND for the Macintosh (28Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses (means and standard errors, Student'st test, analysis of variance) were performed using the software package Statview. Membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected using the DEAE-dextran method were assayed for ligand binding to determine the affinities and the level of expression of C-His-TxA2 and wt-TxA2receptors. Saturation-equilibrium binding assays were performed with [125I]I-BOP. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed a Kd of 1.8 ± 0.2 nm and a Bmax of 24 ± 1.8 pmol/mg protein for C-His-TxA2 receptors (n = 26), which are not significantly different from the values obtained for wt-TxA2 receptors (n = 3) (TableI).Table IAgonist and antagonist binding affinities and expression levels of wt-TxA2 receptor and C-His-TxA2 receptorLigandC-His-TxA2receptors (DEAE-dextran transfection)C-His-TxA2receptors (LipofectAMINE transfection)wt-TxA2 receptors (DEAE-dextran transfection)KdBmaxKdBmaxKdBmaxnmpmol/mg proteinnmpmol/mg proteinnmpmol/mg protein[125I]I-BOP1.8 ± 0.324 ± 1.8 (n = 26)1.7 ± 0.195 ± 6 (n = 2)1.8 ± 0.123 ± 3.2 (n = 3)[125I]I-SAP1.9 ± 0.221 ± 4 (n = 3)1.8 ± 0.386 ± 5 (n = 5)1.7 ± 0.225 ± 3 (n = 3)COS-7 cells were transfected with either the wt- or the C-His-TxA2 receptor cDNAs and harvested after 60–72 h. Radioligand binding asays were performed using [125I]I-BOP and [125I]SAP. There were no significant differences in theKd and Bmax values between the two receptors for either the agonist or the antagonist when transfection was performed using either DEAE-dextran or LipofectAMINE.

There were no significant differences in theKd and Bmax values between the two receptors for either the agonist or the antagonist when transfection was performed using either DEAE-dextran or LipofectAMINE. The values are reported as the mean ± S.E. (n). As there have been reports of differences between agonist and antagonist binding to TxA2 receptors under certain conditions (29Mayeux P.R. Morinelli T.A. Williams T.C. Hazard E.S. Mais D.E. Oatis J.E. Baron D.A. Halushka P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13752-13758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), saturation-equilibrium binding assays were also performed using the TxA2 receptor antagonist, [125I]I-SAP. The Kd values of [125I]I-SAP for the C-His-TxA2 receptor and wt-TxA2 receptor were not significantly different (TableI). LipofectAMINE has been reported to give high levels of transfection efficiency. Thus, the LipofectAMINE method was also used to transfect COS-7 cells and the expression levels were determined by radioligand binding assays (Table I). Transfection with LipofectAMINE resulted inBmax values of 95 ± 6 and 86 ± 5 pmol/mg protein for [125I]I-BOP and [125I]I-SAP, respectively. This was a 4-fold higher level of expression for TxA2 receptors compared with the DEAE-dextran method. To determine if the C-terminal hexahistidine tag interferes with agonist or antagonist binding, competition binding studies were performed. Two agonists (ONO11113 and U46619) and three antagonists (SQ29548, L657925, and L657926) were studied. The latter two, L657925 and L657926, are stereoisomers that exhibit a 100–150-fold difference in their affinity for TxA2receptors in platelets. Neither the IC50 values nor the rank order of potency for the compounds were significantly different for the C-His-TxA2 receptors compared with the wt-TxA2 receptors (TableII).Table IIIC50 values of various TxA2 receptor ligands"

The expression of this “linker” histone, the role of which still remains unclear, is a complex process, having both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory components. In particular, the expression of H10 in rat cortical neurons is regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level, and unknown cellular proteins are likely to affect H10 mRNA stability and/or translation. In looking for such factors, we tested the ability of rat brain extracts to protect H10 RNA probe from degradation by T1 RNase. The results reported here demonstrate that rat brain contains at least one major (p40) and two minor (p110 and p70) binding factors, specific for H10 RNA, all of which are much more or exclusively expressed in adult rat brain, when compared with other tissues. The binding of the factors is confined to a portion of the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR), which is highly conserved among murine and human H10 mRNAs. These findings suggest that the proteins identified play a critical role in regulating the expression of H10 histone in the brain of mammals.

During development and differentiation, cells undergo precise sequences of events that imply switching on or off different sets of genes, and even terminally differentiated cells respond to ever changing environmental conditions by modulating the transcriptional activity of many genes. As this often implies the need for remodeling chromatin (for review, see Ref. 1Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 2nd Ed. Academic Press Inc., London1995: 148-234Google Scholar), it is not surprising that non-allelic isotypes of histones are synthesized in differentiated cells and enter chromatin, probably at topologically defined regions of the nucleus. The H1 class of histones, also known as linker histones, are involved in organizing chromatin higher structures as well as in regulating specific gene expression (for discussion, see Ref. 2Pennisi E. Science. 1996; 274: 503-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In addition to a number of other pre-existing H1 subtypes, histone H10appears in cells, during terminal differentiation (3Roche J. Gorka C. Goeltz P. Lawrence J.J. Nature. 1985; 314: 197-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Moorman A.F.M. de Boer P.A.J. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Differentiation. 1987; 35: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or after growth inhibition (5Pehrson J. Cole R.D. Nature. 1980; 285: 43-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Boix J. Ruiz-Castillo A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although the role of this linker histone remains unclear, it has been proposed to localize specifically to the periphery of nucleus (7Banchev T. Srebreva J. Zlatanova J. Tsanev R. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Like other replacement histones, H10 accumulates in postmitotic cells and is synthesized in the absence of DNA replication (8Zlatanova J.S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 112: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Pina B. Martinez P. Simon L. Suau P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Castiglia D. Di Liegro C. Di Liegro I. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 12: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); however, transcription of the H10 gene seems to be a replication-dependent event, at least in some cell types (12Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 194: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Khochbin S. Gorka C. Lawrence J.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Regulation of H10 expression is thus likely to be a complex process with both transcriptional and post-transcriptional components. In maturing brain, H10 accumulation was demonstrated in both neurons (11Cestelli A. Castiglia D. Di Liegro C. Di Liegro I. Cell. Mol.

Commun. 1984; 123: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the role of H10 in gene expression remains unclear. We previously cloned two cDNAs encoding rat histones H10 (17Castiglia D. Gristina R. Scaturro M. Di Liegro I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and H3.3 (14Castiglia D. Cestelli A. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Di Liegro I. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively. We used these cDNAs as probes to study the accumulation of the corresponding messages during rat brain development (14Castiglia D. Cestelli A. Scaturro M. Nastasi T. Di Liegro I. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1531-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and in cultured neurons (18Scaturro M. Cestelli A. Castiglia D. Nastasi T. Di Liegro I. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The effects of transcriptional inhibition by actinomycin D and the results of nuclear run-on experiments suggested that expression of both H10 and H3.3 is regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level (18Scaturro M. Cestelli A. Castiglia D. Nastasi T. Di Liegro I. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

Therefore, it is likely that cellular factors, possibly expressed differentially in development, are involved also in histone mRNA binding and regulation in the brain. The present study aimed, in particular, at the identification of proteins able to bind the mRNA encoding H10 histone. We identified three brain-specific proteins that bind H10 RNA probe with high specificity. Fresh tissues from developing or adult rats were homogenized in nuclei buffer (NB: 0.32m sucrose; 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5; 50 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine; 0.15 mm spermidine; 2 mm EDTA and 0.15 mm EGTA), containing protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.0 mm benzamidine, and 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Sigma) and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then used as such (post-nuclear extracts) or further centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min to collect mitochondria. In the latter case, the new supernatant was finally centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min to separate the microsomal from the postmicrosomal (S-100) cell fraction. All the fractions, in NB, were split into aliquots and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L.

RNA was extracted once with phenol and twice with chloroform and precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate (0.3 m final concentration). The transcripts were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, washed in 75% ethanol, and resuspended in distilled water. Small aliquots were used for counting and/or analysis on denaturing gels. On the basis of these analyses, we calculated the transcript concentration to be used in the next analyses. T1 nuclease protection assay was carried out, with modifications, according to the method described by Zaidi and Malter (43Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Izquierdo and Cuezva (44Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts (10–15 μg) were incubated for 10 min, at room temperature, with 0.5–1.0 × 106 cpm (specific activity: 0.5–2.0 × 107 cpm/pmol of RNA) of radiolabeled RNA, transcribed in vitro. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, with 100 units of T1 RNase (EC3.1.27.3) to degrade the whole of the RNA except the portions protected by bound proteins; the extracts were finally exposed to a Spectroline UV (254 nm) lamp (Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.) for 15–20 min, in ice bath, to cross-link RNA to proteins. The covalent radioactive complexes were analyzed by denaturing electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide slab gels (PAGE), 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisntnucleotide(s)UTRuntranslated region. according to Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar), and the gels were directly exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography, with intensifying screens, for 12–18 h, at −70 °C. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nucleotide(s) untranslated region. At the end of exposure, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) to confirm the loading of equal amounts of proteins per lane. To localize, in the H10 RNA, the regions specifically involved in binding the factors identified, we subcloned different portions of the original pMH10 (EMBL accession number X70685; Ref. 17Castiglia D. Gristina R. Scaturro M. Di Liegro I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) into the Bluescript KS+ plasmid (Stratagene). In the first step, the insert of 1711 nucleotides was excised from the vector by EcoRI digestion and subdivided, by HindIII digestion, into one 1300-nt- and one 411-nt-long fragment (Fig. 5), both of which were subcloned into Bluescript. In the second step, we amplified 3 regions of the insert by polymerase chain reaction: 1) coding region (nt 1–496); 2) from nt 497 to nt 900 of the 3′-UTR; 3) from nt 1015 to nt 1230 of the 3′-UTR. To this aim we used the following primers: 1) 5′-AGCGAATTCATGATCGTGGCTGCCATCCAGGCA-3′; 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCATTTCTTCTTGCTGGCTCTCTT-3′; 2) 5′-AGCGAATTCCAATGAAGGCTTTGCTTGGGGACA-3′; 5′-CCCAAGCTTGTAGATGGGGTATCACCTGCTCAT-3′; 3) 5′-AGCGAATTCGTGACAGCTGGTTAGAGAAGCCAT-3′; 5′-CCCAAGCTTGAGGGGAAAGGAAACGAACAACGT-3′; the 5′- and the 3′-primers used included EcoRI or HindIII site (underlined), respectively, to allow the oriented cloning of the amplified molecules. Subclones were sequenced, from both sides, by the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham). To quantify the affinity of the factors for RNA, identical amounts (15 μg) of post-nuclear lysates from brain at the 18th day of embryonal development (E18) were incubated with increasing amounts of radioactive 1300-nt-long transcript. Samples were then treated and analyzed as described above. After electrophoresis, the gel was exposed in the same cassette with a piece of nylon membrane on which known amounts of the same RNA, used for the binding reaction, had been spotted. After variable times of exposure, the film was scanned in a HP Scan jet 4C/T and analyzed by the Sigmagel program, version 1.0 (Jandel Scientific). The planimetries of scans were finally used to calculate concentrations of RNA. To compare the intensities of bands corresponding to protein-RNA complexes with the known amounts of RNA, we substituted concentration of radioactive incorporated uridine (U) for RNA concentration (each molecule of the 1300-nt-long H10 RNA fragment contains 307 U residues) and assumed an arbitrary size of 40 nt (with an average of 10 U residues) for the fragment of RNA covalently bound to p40. Briefly, from the intensity of each band, it was calculated how many femtomoles of a 10 U-containing RNA fragment were bound; this number was assumed as the number of protein-RNA complexes per 15 μg of protein. Fig.1 shows representative results of T1 RNase protection assays in which H10 and H3.3 in vitro transcripts were incubated with equal amounts (10 μg) of post-nuclear extracts from E18 rat brain. H10 RNA binds to one major (40 kDa: p40) and two minor (about 110 and 70 kDa, respectively: p110 and p70) proteins; these bands are clearly different, both for position and intensity, from those visible in the case of H3.3 RNA. Specificity of the factors identified was confirmed by experiments in which unlabeled H10 RNA (25-fold excess) but not other brain-specific RNAs (such as H3.3 and c-erbAα2) were able to abolish the radioactive bands (Fig.2).Figure 2H10 RNA-specific binding activity of brain factors. The protection assay with 0.5 × 106 cpm of radiolabeled H10 RNA was performed, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in the presence of 10:1 or 25:1 excess of different unlabeled RNAs. One sample incubated in the absence of competitors (nc) was used as internal control. Electrophoretic analysis was performed by denaturing 12.5% SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The H10 RNA-binding proteins were present throughout the investigated period of brain development (Fig.3 A), and they were richest in the brain, compared with other tissues, in adult animals (Fig.3 B). In the adult brain, a fourth protein (of about 90 kDa) is sometimes visible (see the arrowhead in Fig.3 B). The presence of this protein might relate either to aging or to individual variation; however, we have not yet found any clear correlation between this protein and the physiological state of the animal. Concerning localization of the factors identified, we found that the major band was enriched in the microsomal fraction, whereas the minor ones were more concentrated in the cytosolic S-100 fraction (Fig.4). The first step toward the identification of the RNA region involved in binding was to test the binding capacity of two RNAs corresponding, respectively, to the first 1300 and to the last 411 nucleotides of the H10 RNA (Fig.5). As shown in Fig.6 A, only the larger RNA (1–1300, in the figure) was able to bind to all the factors. This finding was also confirmed by experiments in which the binding of the whole H10 RNA was competed by a 10-fold excess of the longer RNA but not by the shorter one (1301–1711) (Fig.6 B). Then we tested the binding capacity of three smaller RNAs corresponding to three different regions of the 1300-nt-long RNA: a) the coding region (nt 1–496); b) from nt 497 to nt 900 of the 3′-UTR, and c) from nt 1015 to nt 1230 of the 3′-UTR (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 5). As shown in Fig.7, the coding region (a) of H10 RNA did not bind to the factors at all (lane 2), while both RNAs (b and c) corresponding to portions of 3′-UTR (lanes 3 and4) recognized the proteins. Scanning of the autoradiographies revealed that the intensity of the 40-kDa band bound to the entire 1300-nt-long RNA (lane 1) is equal to the sum of the intensities of the corresponding 40-kDa band detected with the two smaller RNAs (lanes 3 and4). This finding suggests that p40 has binding sites for both regions of 3′-UTR of the H10 mRNA. On the basis of the intensity of the spots reported in Fig. 8 A (known amounts of the 1300-nt-long RNA: see “Experimental Procedures”) we calculated the amount of RNA bound to p40 (Fig. 8 B). As the RNA concentration in the binding mixture was also known, we could calculate the apparent KD of the complexes by Scatchard analysis (Fig. 8 C). KD values thus calculated, from different experiments, are in the range of 20–30 nm. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we assumed an arbitrary length of 40 nt for the bound RNA. This size roughly represents an upper limit for the real, and still unknown, length of the sequence protected by p40: in the absence of cross-linking treatment, we did not notice, indeed, any radioactive band after denaturing electrophoresis on gels as concentrated as 15% polyacrylamide. On the contrary, p40-bound RNA might be shorter than 40 nt and/or contain less than 10 U residues. Under these latter hypotheses, the number of protein-RNA complexes formed at a given RNA concentration could be underestimated, and the realKD values would be smaller than those reported here. The generation of specific neuronal phenotypes depends on the synthesis and intracellular localization of specific regulatory as well as structural proteins. On the basis of several studies, it appears that the fine control of these aspects of protein metabolism depends largely on post-transcriptional regulation of the metabolism of the corresponding mRNAs (29Steward O.

Among the gene products whose concentration changes during neural cell maturation, differentiation-associated variants of both linker (such as H10) and core histones (such as H3.3) are of great interest, as their entering chromatin may further affect the transcriptional potential of the genome (54Pina B.

In maturing brain, H10 accumulation seems to be regulated mainly at the post-transcriptional level (18Scaturro M. Cestelli A. Castiglia D. Nastasi T. Di Liegro I. Neurochem.

Mikoshiba K. Okano H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 176: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), we used a slightly modified version of the T1 RNase protection assay described by other authors (43Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the goal of identifying RNA-binding proteins that are expressed in developing brain and specific for the mRNA encoding H10. This approach allowed us to identify one major (p40) and two minor (p70 and p110) factors that bind to H10 mRNA with high specificity. Because the expression (and/or the binding ability) of these factors does not change significantly from E18 to adulthood, they are probably requested continuously both in differentiating and mature brain. In particular, one or more of these factors might be directly involved in enhancing H10 mRNA translation and degradation. This latter function would be consistent with the need of maintaining low concentrations of H10 mRNA, without inhibiting transcription of the H10 gene. Interestingly, the factors described here are predominantly or exclusively expressed in the brain. This suggests that the function of these proteins is linked to a pathway of H10 gene regulation specific to the brain. Furthermore this brain-specific function might have been conserved during evolution of mammals, as the factors identified recognize, in the 3′-UTR of H10 RNA, regions that contain blocks of sequences highly conserved among murine and human H10 genes (17Castiglia D. Gristina R. Scaturro M. Di Liegro I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It should be also noted that one (p40) of the H10mRNA-binding factors is enriched in the microsomal subcellular fraction, while the other two proteins remain in the cytoplasm. Presumably, recruitment of H10 mRNA to ribosomes, its translational activation, and perhaps, enhanced degradation are functions managed by a complex formed by both soluble and anchored proteins. Anchoring the complex to membranes (possibly to the nuclear envelope) and/or to the cytoskeleton might have obvious advantages for localizing H10 mRNA to cytoplasmic regions from which newly synthesized H10 histone might easily reach specific chromatin domains. Finally, it should be stressed that, to our knowledge, the factors identified in the present work represent the first example of brain-specific RNA-binding proteins that bind to a highly conserved region of one specific mRNA. The fact that this mRNA is the one encoding H10 protein adds interest to the finding, as further understanding of regulation of H10 synthesis might help to shed light on the role that this linker histone plays in chromatin remodeling in postmitotic cells.
