Several markers have been proposed for gastric corpus stem cells in both isthmus and base regions. However, the identity of isthmus stem cells (IsthSCs) and the interaction between distinct stem cell populations is still under debate. Here, based on unbiased genetic labeling and biophysical modeling, we show that corpus glands are compartmentalized into two independent zones, with slow-cycling stem cells maintaining the base and actively cycling stem cells maintaining the pit-isthmus-neck region through a process of ""punctuated"" neutral drift dynamics. Independent lineage tracing based on Stmn1 and Ki67 expression confirmed that rapidly cycling IsthSCs maintain the pit-isthmus-neck region. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis is used to define the molecular identity and lineage relationship of a single, cycling, IsthSC population. These observations define the identity and functional behavior of IsthSCs."

Induction of the synaptic protein Homer1a mediates the effects of different antidepressant treatments, including the rapid action of ketamine and sleep deprivation (SD). We show here that mimicking Homer1a upregulation via intravenous injection of cell-membrane-permeable TAT-Homer1a elicits rapid antidepressant effects in various tests. Similar to ketamine and SD, in vitro and in vivo application of TAT-Homer1a enhances mGlu5 signaling, resulting in increased mTOR pathway phosphorylation, and upregulates synaptic AMPA receptor expression and activity. The antidepressant action of SD and Homer1a induction depends on mGlu5 activation specifically in excitatory CaMK2a neurons and requires enhanced AMPA receptor activity, translation, and trafficking. Moreover, our data demonstrate a pronounced therapeutic potential of different TAT-fused peptides that directly modulate mGlu5 and AMPA receptor activity and thus might provide a novel strategy for rapid and effective antidepressant treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2969301724,"As agriculture industrializes, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are becoming more common. Feces from CAFOs is often used as fertilizer on fields. However, little is known about the effects manure has on the soil microbiome, which is an important aspect of soil health and fertility. In addition, due to the subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics necessary to keep the animals healthy, CAFO manure has elevated levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Using 16s rRNA high-throughput sequencing and qPCR, this study sought to determine the impact of swine CAFO manure application on both the soil microbiome and abundance of select antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile element genes (erm(B), erm(C), sul1, str(B), intI1, IncW repA) in agricultural soil over the fall and spring seasons. We found the manure community to be distinct from the soil community, with a majority of bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. The soil samples had more diverse communities dominated by Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and unclassified bacteria. We observed significant differences in the soil microbiome between all time points, except between the spring samples. However, by tracking manure associated taxa, we found the addition of the manure microbiome to be a minor driver of the shift. Of the measured genes, manure application only significantly increased the abundance of erm(B) and erm(C) which remained elevated in the spring. These results suggest bacteria in the manure do not survive well in soil and that ARG dynamics in soil following manure application vary by resistance gene."
https://openalex.org/W2969329427,"Leishmaniasis caused by obligate intracellular parasites of genus Leishmania is one of the most neglected tropical diseases threatening 350 million people worldwide. Protein kinases have drawn much attention as potential drug targets due to their important role in various cellular processes. In Leishmania sp. mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 is essential for the parasite survival because of its involvement in various regulatory, apoptotic and developmental pathways. The current study reveals the identification of natural inhibitors of L. donovani mitogen-activated protein kinase-4 (LdMPK4). We have performed in silico docking of 110 natural inhibitors of Leishmania parasite that have been reported earlier and identified two compounds Genistein (GEN) and Chrysin (CHY). The homology model of LdMPK4 was developed, followed by binding affinity studies, and pharmacokinetic properties of the inhibitors were calculated by maintaining ATP as a standard molecule. The modelled structure was deposited in the protein model database with PMDB ID: PM0080988. Molecular dynamic simulation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex along with the free energy calculations over 50 ns showed that GEN and CHY are more stable in their binding. These two molecules, GEN and CHY, can be considered as lead molecules for targeting LdMPK4 enzyme and could emerge as potential LdMPK4 inhibitors."

Previously reported structures of the PSII–LHCII supercomplex of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibit significant structural heterogeneity, but recently improved purification methods employing ionic amphipol A8-35 have enhanced supercomplex stability, providing opportunities for determining a more intact structure. Herein, we present a 5.8 Å cryo-EM map of the C. reinhardtii PSII–LHCII supercomplex containing six LHCII trimers (C2S2M2L2). Utilizing a newly developed nonionic amphipol–based purification and stabilizing method, we purified the largest photosynthetic supercomplex to the highest percentage of the intact configuration reported to date. We found that the interprotein distances within the light-harvesting complex array in the green algal photosystem are larger than those previously observed in higher plants, indicating that the potential route of energy transfer in the PSII–LHCII supercomplex in green algae may be altered. Interestingly, we also observed an asymmetric PSII–LHCII supercomplex structure comprising C2S2M1L1 in the same sample. Moreover, we found a new density adjacent to the PSII core complex, attributable to a single-transmembrane helix.

Surrounding this core complex in land plants and green algae are light-harvesting complex (LHCII) proteins, which bind large amounts of chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoids for absorbing sunlight.

To learn more about the macro- and micro-scale details of the C. reinhardtii PSII–LHCII supercomplex, it is necessary to move from negative stain TEM, which is associated with inherent resolution limitations, to cryo-EM, which provides higher resolution and more biologically relevant conditions. Cryo-EM (13Murata K. Wolf M. Cryo-electron microscopy for structural analysis of dynamic biological macromolecules.Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, cryo-EM is poised to provide sweeping new insights into photosynthetic complexes in an increasingly biologically relevant context across the range of photosynthetic organisms.

This was expanded upon by Su et al. (3Su X. Ma J. Wei X. Cao P. Zhu D. Chang W. Liu Z. Zhang X. Li M.

On the other hand, C. reinhardtii does not possess CP24 (LHCB6) (6Teramoto H. Ono T.-A. Minagawa J. Identification of Lhcb gene family encoding the light-harvesting chlorophyll-a/b proteins of photosystem II in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42 (11522911): 849-85610.1093/pcp/pce115Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the PSII–LHCII supercomplex harbors additional LHCII trimers, L-trimers (10Tokutsu R.

According to previous reports, the C. reinhardtii PSII–LHCII supercomplex exhibited significant heterogeneity when studied by detergent solubilization and negative stain TEM (10Tokutsu R. Kato N.

The recent improvement in purification methodology employing ionic amphipol A8-35 has enhanced the stability of the supercomplex (11Watanabe A. Kim E. Burton-Smith R.N. Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Amphipol-assisted purification method for highly active and stable photosystem II supercomplex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 (31017655): 1072-107910.1002/1873-3468.13394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), thus providing us with the possibility of determining its more intact structure. Herein, we present the cryo-EM structure of the C2S2M2L2 form of PSII–LHCII supercomplex in C. reinhardtii at a resolution of 5.8 Å, when purified according to the newly developed protocol employing nonionic amphipol and using the new processing suite of computational imaging system for TEM (cisTEM) (21Grant T. Rohou A. Grigorieff N. cisTEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing.eLife. 2018; 7 (29513216): e3538310.7554/eLife.35383Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Previously, we developed a procedure for purifying the PSII–LHCII supercomplex of C. reinhardtii employing an ionic amphipol, A8-35 (11Watanabe A. Kim E. Burton-Smith R.N. Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Amphipol-assisted purification method for highly active and stable photosystem II supercomplex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 (31017655): 1072-107910.1002/1873-3468.13394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although the obtained supercomplex showed little LHCII dissociation even 4 days after purification, to maintain the oxygen-evolving activity, betaine addition was required (11Watanabe A. Kim E. Burton-Smith R.N. Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Amphipol-assisted purification method for highly active and stable photosystem II supercomplex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 (31017655): 1072-107910.1002/1873-3468.13394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because the decrease of oxygen-evolving activity was correlated with dissociation of the membrane-extrinsic polypeptides, the ionic nature of A8-35 was likely the cause of this instability. To overcome this problem, we introduced nonionic amphipol NAPol (22Bazzacco P. Sharma K.S. Durand G. Giusti F. Ebel C. Popot J.L. Pucci B. Trapping and stabilization of integral membrane proteins by hydrophobically grafted glucose-based telomers.Biomacromolecules. 2009; 10 (20000638): 3317-332610.1021/bm900938wCrossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in place of ionic amphipol A8-35 in this study. Fig. 1A shows a comparison between n-dodecyl-α-d-maltoside (α-DDM)–solubilized PSII–LHCII supercomplexes from C. reinhardtii (α-DDM) according to the previous method (10Tokutsu R. Kato N. Bui K.H. Ishikawa T. Minagawa J. Revisiting the supramolecular organization of photosystem II in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.J. Biol.

The sucrose density gradient (SDG) profile of the NAPol sample was shifted to higher density, indicating an overall increase in the molecular weight of all isolated components from the thylakoid membrane. SDS-PAGE showed that the polypeptides in the supercomplexes isolated by the two methods were essentially identical, with moderate increases in intensity for the bands of LHCIIs, labeled types I, III, and IV and PsbQ, as well as slight comigration contamination of AtpA/B in the high-molecular-weight region (Fig. 1A). The NAPol-stabilized sample had a low-level PSI contamination as in the α-DDM–solubilized sample (22–24% of the PSI amount contained in the thylakoid membrane when normalized by D1 protein) (Fig. S1), which would not be a problem for single-particle analysis. The NAPol-stabilized PSII–LHCII supercomplex showed a slightly decreased specific oxygen-evolving activity when compared with the α-DDM–solubilized PSII–LHCII supercomplex (Table 1), similarly to another amphipol-stabilized PSII–LHCII supercomplex using ionic amphipol A8-35 (11Watanabe A. Kim E. Burton-Smith R.N. Tokutsu R. Minagawa J. Amphipol-assisted purification method for highly active and stable photosystem II supercomplex from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.FEBS Lett. 2019; 593 (31017655): 1072-107910.1002/1873-3468.13394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These slight reductions of specific activities observed in the amphipol preparations were either due to the increased number of LHCIIs per reaction center or due to the hindrance of the enzyme dynamics by amphipol, which is called the “Gulliver effect” (23Popot J.-L. Membrane Proteins in Aqueous Solutions: From Detergents to Amphipols. Springer, Cham, Switzerland2018: 237-332Crossref Google Scholar). Because the NAPol-stabilized sample showed a lower Chl a/b ratio than the α-DDM–solubilized sample (Table 1), we favored the former hypothesis. We also quantified cytochrome b559 in the NAPol sample: Assuming that two units of cytochrome b559 were in a supercomplex, the PSII–LHCII supercomplex was quantified to bind 354 Chls, suggesting that ∼5.4 LHCII trimers were associated with a supercomplex. As already shown in the A8-35-stabilized preparation, these amphipol-stabilized PSII–LHCII supercomplexes are more stable than the conventional detergent-solubilized preparations in terms of association of the peripheral LHCII (11Watanabe A. Kim E. Burton-Smith R.N. Tokutsu R. Minagawa J.

Moreover, the oxygen-evolving activity of the NAPol-stabilized PSII–LHCII supercomplex after 3 days of incubation at 4 °C was 198 μmol O2 (mg Chl)−1 h−1, which corresponded to 93% of its initial activity (Table 1). We concluded the integrity of the PSII–LHCII supercomplexes were kept intact during the NAPol-based method. The NAPol-stabilized PSII–LHCII supercomplex was then subjected to the following cryo-EM single-particle analysis.Table 1Oxygen-evolving activities and Chl a/b ratios of the NAPol-stabilized PSII–LHCII supercomplexes as compared with the α-DDM–solubilized supercomplexesNAPolα-DDMChl a/b2.07 ± 0.172.48 ± 0.24Oxygen-evolving activity/Chl (O2/mg Chl/h)213 ± 33297 ± 12Oxygen-evolving activity/D1 (%)10099 ± 4 Open table in a new tab The high-resolution images of the ice-embedded NAPol-solubilized PSII–LHCII supercomplex of C. reinhardtii were collected using a 200 kV electron microscope with a cryo-specimen holder, energy filter, and direct detector (see details under “Experimental procedures”). After correcting motion in the frames, 126,744 particles were picked automatically from 498 micrographs (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2, A and B). “Bias-free” particle picking via Gaussian “blob” (21Grant T. Rohou A. Grigorieff N. cisTEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing.eLife. 2018; 7 (29513216): e3538310.7554/eLife.35383Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) is fairly poor at selecting “side views” of the PSII–LHCII or PSI–LHCI complexes. This can be attributed to the nature of the photosystem complexes, which are large and flat, leading to very different 2D projection size and contrast between side and top views (Figs. S2–S4). This is exacerbated by NAPol stabilization, which increases the overall size of the particle from 31 nm (longest dimension) to 36 nm with the thick-surrounding NAPol ring (Fig. 2). Separating the narrow, high-contrast side views from the broader, lower-contrast top views is not difficult; however, cleanly separating the subtypes of top view (C2S2M2L2 and C2S2M1L1) requires finer grain classification. Similarly, side views can also be difficult to cleanly separate; as a result, the different types of view were separated into different groups after the initial classification (Figs. S2, C–E, S3, and S4). The finally selected 14,668 particles were used for 3D reconstruction of the full PSII–LHCII complex (C2S2M2L2) (Fig. S2H), although the angular distribution was slightly dominated in the top views (Fig. S2I). The resolution was estimated as 5.8 Å with gold standard fourier shell correlation (Fig. S2J) by imposing C2 symmetry after several local alignments with a low-pass filtered mask. Fig. 2 (A–C) shows the 5.8 Å reconstruction of C. reinhardtii PSII–LHCII supercomplex with six LHCII trimers bound, viewed from the membrane-perpendicular direction (Fig. 2, A and D) and the membrane parallel directions (Fig. 2, B, C, E, and F). The atomic models of pea PSII core complex and LHCIIs (PDB code PDB code 5XNL; 3) are individually fitted into each density (Fig. 2, D–F) to evaluate the cryo-EM map using “Fit in map” in UCSF Chimera (24Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Ferrin T.E. Visualizing density maps with UCSF Chimera.J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157 (16963278): 281-28710.1016/j.jsb.2006.06.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The NAPol stabilized supercomplex shows the largest dimensions of 31 × 22 nm reported so far (Fig. 2, A and D). The transmembrane edge of the supercomplex was fully surrounded by a NAPol ring of ∼2.5 nm in width. Fig. S3 shows a local resolution map produced by ResMap (25Kucukelbir A. Sigworth F.J. Tagare H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 (24213166): 63-6510.1038/nmeth.2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) of the density map shown in Fig. 2 colored by estimated resolution. This allows visualization of the low-resolution nature of the stabilizing NAPol, particularly in the gap between the extrinsic oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) region (Fig. S3A), which exhibits extra density. Fig. S3 (B, D, and F) shows sliced through equivalents of Fig. S3 (A, C, and E) to permit visualization of the transmembrane helices and internal density, which is much higher resolution than the NAPol envelope. This supports the overall flexibility of the supercomplex and the Gulliver effect envelope nature of amphipol. The slice views demonstrate the structural stability of the core region of the complex with clear α-helices, which achieves ∼5 Å resolution, whereas extrinsic regions such as M- and L-trimers resolve to ∼7 Å and the NAPol envelope at ∼10 Å. The core heterocomplex (Core) is the highest-resolution part of the structure (Fig. S3, B, D, and F), whereas the minor LHCIIs (CP26 and CP29) and S-trimers are also well-resolved given the sampling frequency used (calibrated to 1.992 Å/pixel at the detector). However, the membrane-extrinsic OEC and M-s and L-trimers are not so well-resolved. PsbP and PsbQ, both components of the OEC that were unstable in the detergent-solubilized supercomplex, are evident in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and can be fit to density in the map (Fig. 2). However, their density is less reliable than the membrane components that are stabilized more by NAPol. The extrinsic densities may be easily distorted by the carbon support film or surface tension effects in thinner regions of ice. This is the best exhibited by PsbQ where density fades quickly at increasing σ. Using the criteria laid down by Rosenthal and Rubinstein (26Rosenthal P.B. Rubinstein J.L. Validating maps from single particle electron cryomicroscopy.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 34 (26605834): 135-14410.1016/j.sbi.2015.07.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) describing the resolutions at which various elements of a cryo-EM map are resolved, the model of 5.8 Å should not be overinterpreted; helices are evident, and some β-sheets may be resolved, but side chains are not identifiable (see Movie S1). As shown in Fig. 2D, the 5.8 Å reconstruction of C. reinhardtii PSII–LHCII supercomplex contains three LHCII trimers and two minor LHCs (CP26 and CP29) on both sides of the core dimer. Sixteen membrane intrinsic subunits, PsbA/B/C/D/E/F/H/I/J/K/L/M/Tc/W/X/Z, and three membrane extrinsic subunits, PsbO/P/Q, were identified. Among the membrane intrinsic subunits, C. reinhardtii possesses a plant-specific PSII subunit, PsbW, which is present in photosynthetic eukaryotes but not in cyanobacteria. PsbW binds on the interface between the core complex and the LHCII array and has been shown to be essential to the formation of PSII–LHCII supercomplex in A. thaliana (27García-Cerdán J.G. Kovács L. Tóth T. Kereïche S. Aseeva E. Boekema E.J. Mamedov F. Funk C. Schröder W.P.

A schematic representation of the subunit locations is depicted in Fig. 1C. To evaluate the fitted model, a rigid-body fitting of the coordinates from the spinach PSII–LHCII supercomplex (PDB code 5XNL) was performed. Table S1 contains correlation values for all components. Some individual subunits show higher correlation with the rigid body fit; the correlations of PsbI, PsbJ, and CP29 improved to 0.823, 0.863, and 0.7932, respectively. Many modified tetrapyrrole cofactor densities can be resolved (Fig. S5, B–F) but not to resolutions required for precise fitting and orientation determination (2Mazor Y. Borovikova A. Caspy I. Nelson N. Structure of the plant photosystem I supercomplex at 2.6 Å resolution.Nat. Plants. 2017; 3 (28248295): 1701410.1038/nplants.2017.14Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The overall structure of the purified C. reinhardtii PSII–LHCII complex appears slightly convex when viewed parallel to the membrane (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. S4, side views) with the LHCII trimers slightly out-of-plane when compared with the C2S2M2 structure from pea of Su et al.

The use of compatible biopolymers, such as bacterial cellulose (BC), as well as having interesting mechanical characteristics, presents a slow in vivo degradation rate, and the ability to be chemically modified. To promote better bioactivity towards BC, we synthesized an innovative BC membrane associated to hydroxyapatite (HA) and anti-bone morphogenetic protein antibody (anti-BMP-2) (BC-HA-anti-BMP-2). We present the physical-chemical, biological and toxicological characterization of BC-HA-anti-BMP-2. Presence of BC and HA components in the membranes was confirmed by SEM-EDS and FTIR assays. No toxic potential was found in MC3T3-E1 cells by cytotoxicity assays (XTT Assay and Clonogenic Survival), genotoxicity (Comet Assay) and mutagenicity (Cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus Test). The in vitro release kinetics of anti-BMP-2 antibodies detected gradually reducing antibody levels, reducing approximately 70% in 7 days and 90% in 14 days. BC-HA-anti-BMP-2 increased SPP1, BGLAP, VEGF, ALPL, RUNX2 and TNFRSF11B expression, genes involved in bone repair and also increased mineralization nodules and phosphatase alcalin (ALP) activity levels. In conclusion, we developed BC-HA-anti-BMP-2 as an innovative and promising biomaterial with interesting physical-chemical and biological properties which may be a good alternative to treatment with commercial BMP-2 protein."

In this context, we presented the first report on identifying superior heterotic crosses for yield and commercial traits in cauliflower involving cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) and doubled haploid (DH) lines as parents. We studied the suitability of genomic-SSRs and EST-SSRs based genetic distance (GD) and agronomic trait based phenotypic distance (PD) for predicting heterosis in F1 hybrids using CMS and DH based parents. 120 F1 hybrids derived from 20Ogura based CMS lines and 6 DH based testers were evaluated for 16 agronomic traits along with the 26 parental lines and 4 commercial standard checks. The genomic-SSRs and EST-SSRs based genetic structure analysis grouped the 26 parental lines into 4 distinct clusters. The CMS lines Ogu118-6A, Ogu33A, Ogu34-1A were good general combiner for developing early maturity hybrids. The SCA effects were significantly associated with heterosis suggesting non-additive gene effects for the heterotic response of hybrids. Less than unity value of σ2A/D coupled with σ2gca/σ2sca indicated the predominance of non-additive gene action in the expression of studied traits. The correlation analysis of genetic distance with heterosis for commercial traits suggested that microsatellites based genetic distance estimates can be helpful in heterosis prediction to some extent."
https://openalex.org/W2967653080,"Understanding how cell identity transitions occur and whether there are multiple paths between the same beginning and end states are questions of wide interest. Here we show that acquisition of naive pluripotency can follow transcriptionally and mechanistically distinct routes. Starting from post-implantation epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), one route advances through a mesodermal state prior to naive pluripotency induction, whereas another transiently resembles the early inner cell mass and correspondingly gains greater developmental potency. These routes utilize distinct signaling networks and transcription factors but subsequently converge on the same naive endpoint, showing surprising flexibility in mechanisms underlying identity transitions and suggesting that naive pluripotency is a multidimensional attractor state. These route differences are reconciled by precise expression of Oct4 as a unifying, essential, and sufficient feature. We propose that fine-tuned regulation of this ""transition factor"" underpins multidimensional access to naive pluripotency, offering a conceptual framework for understanding cell identity transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2969961864,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of functional non-coding transcripts that are longer than 200 nt and regulate gene expression via diverse mechanisms in eukaryotes. In fact, they have emerged as critical epigenetic and transcriptional regulators of autophagy in mammals in response to various stressors. Autophagy not only plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, but it is also essential to immunity, targets intracellular pathogens for degradation, modulates inflammation, and participates in adaptive immune responses. However, the expression profile of lncRNA and its role in regulating autophagy in macrophages have been poorly defined. Here, we used transcriptomic and bioinformatics to analysis LncRNA expression profile during autophagy and functional studies to evaluate the function of the metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 (Malat1) lncRNA in macrophages. A total of 1112 putative lncRNAs (240 novel lncRNAs) were identified, including 831 large intergenic, 129 intronic, and 152 anti-sense lncRNA, of which 59 differentially expressed transcripts exhibited a greater than 1.5-fold change under different conditions. The interaction of Malat1 lncRNA with microRNA (mir)-23-3p and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) was found, Malat1 releases inhibition of Lamp1 expression in macrophages through competitive adsorption of mir-23-3p.

Nevertheless, its role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remained unclear and underinvestigated. We thus evaluated carcinogenesis effects of ARID1A knockdown in nonmalignant Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) renal cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against ARID1A (siARID1A). The siARID1A-transfected cells had decreased cell death, increased cell proliferation, and cell cycle shift (from G0/G1 to G2/M) compared with those transfected with controlled siRNA (siControl). Additionally, the siARID1A-transfected cells exhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) shown by greater spindle index, increased mesenchymal markers (fibronectin/vimentin), and decreased epithelial markers (E-cadherin/zonula occludens-1). Moreover, the siARID1A-transfected cells had increases in migratory activity, nuclear size, self-aggregated multicellular spheroid size, invasion capability, chemoresistance (to docetaxel), Snail family transcriptional repressor 1 expression, and TGF-β1 secretion. All of these siARID1A-knockdown effects on the carcinogenic features were reproducible in malignant RCC (786-O) cells, which exhibited a higher degree of carcinogenic phenotypes compared with the nonmalignant MDCK cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed obvious decrease in ARID1A protein expression in human RCC tissues (n = 23) compared with adjacent normal renal tissues (n = 23). These data indicate that ARID1A down-regulation triggers EMT and carcinogenesis features of renal cells in vitro, and its role in RCC could be proven in human tissues.-Somsuan, K., Peerapen, P., Boonmark, W., Plumworasawat, S., Samol, R., Sakulsak, N., Thongboonkerd, V.

https://openalex.org/W2969631047,"Background Despite increasing global attention to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their incorporation into universal health coverage (UHC), the factors that determine whether and how NCDs are prioritized in national health agendas and integrated into health systems remain poorly understood. Childhood cancer is a leading non-communicable cause of death in children aged 0–14 years worldwide. We investigated the political, social, and economic factors that influence health system priority-setting on childhood cancer care in a range of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Methods and findings Based on in-depth qualitative case studies, we analyzed the determinants of priority-setting for childhood cancer care in El Salvador, Guatemala, Ghana, India, and the Philippines using a conceptual framework that considers four principal influences on political prioritization: political contexts, actor power, ideas, and issue characteristics. Data for the analysis derived from in-depth interviews (n = 68) with key informants involved in or impacted by childhood cancer policies and programs in participating countries, supplemented by published academic literature and available policy documents. Political priority for childhood cancer varies widely across the countries studied and is most influenced by political context and actor power dynamics. Ghana has placed relatively little national priority on childhood cancer, largely due to competing priorities and a lack of cohesion among stakeholders. In both El Salvador and Guatemala, actor power has played a central role in generating national priority for childhood cancer, where well-organized and -resourced civil society organizations have disrupted legacies of fragmented governance and financing to create priority for childhood cancer care. In India, the role of a uniquely empowered private actor was instrumental in creating political priority and establishing sustained channels of financing for childhood cancer care. In the Philippines, the childhood cancer community has capitalized on a window of opportunity to expand access and reduce disparities in childhood cancer care through the political prioritization of UHC and NCDs in current health system reforms. Conclusions The importance of key health system actors in determining the relative political priority for childhood cancer in the countries studied points to actor power as a critical enabler of prioritization in other LMIC. Responsiveness to political contexts–in particular, rhetorical and policy priority placed on NCDs and UHC–will be crucial to efforts to place childhood cancer firmly on national health agendas. National governments must be convinced of the potential for foundational health system strengthening through attention to childhood cancer care, and the presence and capability of networked actors primed to amplify public sector investments and catalyze change on the ground."

However, the long-term trends in survival among adult leukemia patients and the associated sex and racial survival disparities are not well understood. We, therefore, evaluated the secular trends in survival improvement of leukemia patients from 1973 through 2014, using Surveillance Epidemiology and End-Result Survey Program (SEER) data. ICD-O-3 morphology codes were used to group leukemia into four types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Survival analysis for each leukemia type stratified by race/ethnicity, age, sex was performed to generate relative survival probability estimates for the baseline time period of 1973 through 1979. Hazard ratios (HR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for survival within subsequent 10-year time periods by race, age and sex were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. Of the 83,255 leukemia patients for the current analysis, the 5-year survival of patients with ALL, AML, CLL, and CML during 1973–1979 were 42.0%, 6.5%, 66.5%, and 20.9%, respectively. Compared to the baseline, there were substantial improvements of leukemia-specific survival in 2010–2014 among African-American (81.0%) and Asian (80.0%) patients with CML and among 20–49 year of age with CLL (96.0%). African-American patients, those with AML and those older than 75 years of age had the lowest survival improvements. Asians experienced some of the largest survival improvements during the study period.

As rates of degradation or chemical leaching of 3D printed models has not been well documented under environmental conditions, it is essential to examine if these objects will alter the behavior or impact the survivorship of the focal species prior to widespread implementation. Here, we explored the efficacy of using 3D printed models in coral reef behavioral research, an area of study where this form of additive manufacturing could offer significant advantages. Coral-associated blue-green chromis (Chromis viridis) individuals were exposed to natural and 3D printed coral habitats, and larval mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides) were offered 3D printed substrate as a settlement surface. Habitat association and behavioral analyses indicated that C. viridis did not discriminate or display modified behaviors between 3D printed and natural coral skeletons or between 3D printed materials. P. astreoides displayed significantly higher settlement when provided with 3D printed settlement surfaces than when provided with no settlement surface and settled at similar rates between 3D printed surfaces of differing materials. Additionally, growth and mortality of P. astreoides settled on different 3D printed surfaces did not significantly differ. Our results suggest that the 3D printed models used in this study are not inherently harmful to a coral reef fish or species of brooding coral, supporting further exploration of the benefits that these objects and others produced with additive manufacturing may offer as ecological research tools."

A reference group of breastfed infants was followed. Both formulae were well accepted without differences in tolerance or occurrence of adverse events. The most common adverse events were common cold, poor weight gain or growth, rash, eczema, or dry skin and respiratory tract infection. Weight gain (the primary outcome) was equivalent in the two groups (95% CI -2.11; 1.68 g/d). In line with this, there was only a small difference in absolute body weight adjusted for birth weight and sex at visit 4 (95% CI -235; 135 g). Equivalence was also shown for gain in head circumference but not for recumbent length gain and increase in calorie intake. Given the nature of the test, this does not indicate an actual difference, and adjusted means at visit 4 were not significantly different for any of these parameters. Infants receiving formula containing L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate had lower mean plasma levels of unmetabolized folic acid (intervention: 0.73 nmol/L, control: 1.15 nmol/L, p<0.0001) and higher levels of red cell folate (intervention: 907.0 ±192.8 nmol/L, control: 839.4 ±142.4 nmol/L, p = 0.0095).

https://openalex.org/W2969505941,"Introduction Demographic and Health Surveys, widely used for estimation of fertility and reproductive health indicators in developing countries, remain underutilized for the study of pregnancy termination. This is partly due to most surveys not reporting the type of pregnancy termination, whether spontaneous or induced. Reproductive calendar data makes it possible to examine termination patterns according to contraceptive use at the time of pregnancy. Contraceptive failure is expected to increase the likelihood of induced abortion helping in the interpretation of reported termination patterns. Materials and methods We use individual-level calendar data regarding 623,966 pregnancies to analyze levels and differentials in reported patterns of pregnancy termination by age, union status, and contraceptive use in 107 DHS surveys from 50 countries. From the estimates of the probability of pregnancy termination, we compute derived reproductive health indicators providing an assessment of what is driving the differences by comparison to the few surveys reporting the type of pregnancy termination. Results From our estimates, 10.9% of pregnancies do not end in live-birth and 63.7% of them are spontaneous terminations. Reported pregnancy termination is higher among women using contraceptives, consistent with expectations. Very low levels of reported PT in some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, suggests possible underreporting. Differential patterns emerging from cluster analysis and regional rates indicate high rates of pregnancy termination driven by induced abortion in countries from the Former Soviet Union and Asian countries with liberal laws. Most countries with restrictive abortion laws have low levels of reported termination. While the probabilities of pregnancy termination are higher at older ages, termination rates generally peak at younger ages due to higher conception rates. Discussion This is the first large comparative study of the patterns of reported pregnancy termination in DHS surveys. While we have explored the extent to which differences arise from spontaneous terminations or induced abortion, more research is needed regarding the determinants of reported pregnancy termination."

We estimated diversity, distribution and species compositions of AMF by cloning and Sanger sequencing the 18S rDNA (the section between AML1 and AML2) and subsequent derivation of fungal OTUs based on 99% sequence similarity. In addition, we analyzed the phylogenetic structure of the sites by computing the mean pairwise distance (MPD) and the mean nearest taxon difference (MNTD) for each elevation level. It revealed that AMF species compositions at 1000 and 2000 masl differ from 3000 and 4000 masl. Lower elevations (1000 and 2000 masl) were dominated by members of Glomeraceae, whereas Acaulosporaceae were more abundant in higher elevations (3000 and 4000 masl). Ordination of OTUs with respect to study sites revealed a correlation to elevation with a continuous turnover of species from lower to higher elevations. Most of the abundant OTUs are not endemic to South Ecuador. We also found a high proportion of rare OTUs at all elevations: 79–85% of OTUs occurred in less than 5% of the samples. Phylogenetic community analysis indicated clustering and evenness for most elevation levels indicating that both, stochastic processes and habitat filtering are driving factors of AMF community compositions."
https://openalex.org/W2788242015,"Introduction There is evidence demonstrating that certain lifestyle factors have a detrimental effect on fertility. Since such factors often coexist, possible synergistic effects merit further investigation. Thus we aimed to examine the cumulative impact of lifestyle factors on in vitro fertilization (IVF) early reproductive treatment outcomes and their interaction with measures of ovarian reserve. Materials and methods By following women who were starting their first fresh IVF cycle in 2 cohorts, the “Lifestyle study cohort” (hypothesis generating cohort, n = 242) and the “UppSTART study” (validation cohort, n = 432) in Sweden, we identified two significant risk factors acting independently, smoking and BMI, and then further assessed their cumulative effects. Results Women with both these risk factors had an Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) of 0.75 [(95% CI 0.61–0.94)] regarding the number of aspirated oocytes compared to women without these risk factors. Concerning the proportion of mature oocytes in relation to the total number of aspirated oocytes, the interaction between BMI and Antral Follicle Count (AFC) was significant (p-value 0.045): the lower the value of AFC, the more harmful the effect of BMI with the outcome. Conclusions Data shows that there is an individual as well as a cumulative effect of smoking and BMI on the number of aspirated and mature oocytes in fresh IVF treatment cycles. AFC might modify associations between BMI and the proportion of mature oocytes in relation to the total number of aspirated oocytes. These results highlight the importance of lifestyle factors on IVF early reproductive outcomes and provide additional evidence for the importance of preconception guidance for the optimization of IVF cycle outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2969604214,"The pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is an important plant-parasitic nematode that can cause severe mortality of pine trees. This PWN-induced harm to plants may be closely related to the abundance and diversity of the symbiotic microorganisms of the parasitic nematode. In this study, nematodes were divided into untreated and antibiotic-treated groups. Nematodes were treated by fumigation with different amounts of α-pinene, and the resultant mortality rates were analyzed statistically. Concentrations of symbiotic bacteria were calculated as colony-forming units per nematode. High-throughput sequencing was used to investigate the bacterial community structure. The results showed that the mortality of nematodes increased slightly with an increasing concentration of α-pinene, and nematodes untreated with antibiotics were more sensitive to α-pinene than those treated with antibiotics. The highest abundance of symbiotic bacteria was obtained via medium and low levels of α-pinene, but for which community diversity was the lowest (Shannon and Simpson indexes). The proportion of Pseudomonas spp. in the symbiotic bacteria of nematodes without antibiotics was relatively high (more than 70%), while that of Stenotrophomonas spp. was low (6%-20%). However, the proportion of Stenotrophomonas spp. was larger than that of Pseudomonas spp in the symbiotic bacteria associated with the antibiotic-treated nematodes. Pseudomonas sp. increased after pinene treatment, whereas Stenotrophomonas spp. decreased. These results indicate that although α-pinene has low toxicity to PWNs over a short time period, α-pinene ultimately influences the abundance and community diversity of the symbiotic bacteria of these nematodes; this influence may potentially disturb the development and reproduction of nematodes in the process of infecting pine trees."
https://openalex.org/W2968122707,"While treatment of serious infectious diseases may require high-dose amoxicillin, continuous infusion may be limited by lack of knowledge regarding the chemical stability of the drug. Therefore, we have performed a comprehensive study so as to determine the chemical stability of high-dose amoxicillin solutions conducive to safe and effective continuous intravenous administration using portable elastomeric pumps. First, amoxicillin solubility in water was assessed within the range of 25 to 300 mg/mL. Then, amoxicillin solutions were prepared at different concentrations (25, 50, 125, 250 mg/mL) and stored in different conditions (5±2°C, 25±1°C, 30±1°C and 37±1°C) to investigate the influence of concentration and temperature on the chemical stability of amoxicillin. Finally, its stability was assessed under optimized conditions using a fully validated HPLC-UV stability-indicating method. Degradation products of amoxicillin were investigated by accurate mass determination using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Amoxicillin displayed limited water solubility requiring reconstitution at concentrations below or equal to 150 mg/mL. Amoxicillin degradation were time, temperature as well as concentration-dependent, resulting in short-term stability, in particular at high concentrations. Four degradation products of amoxicillin have been identified. Among them, amoxicilloic acid and diketopiperazine amoxicillin are at risk of allergic reaction and may accumulate in the patient. Optimized conditions allowing for continuous infusion of high-dose amoxicillin has been determined: amoxicillin should be reconstituted at 25 mg/mL and stored up to 12 hours at room temperature (22 ± 4°C) or up to 24 hours between 4 and 8°C."
https://openalex.org/W2968623989,"miR-29b has been identified as a rapamycin-induced microRNA (miRNA) in Tsc2-deficient, mTORC1-hyperactive cells. The biological significance of this induction of miR-29b is unknown. We have found that miR-29b acts as an oncogenic miRNA in Tsc2-deficient cells: inhibition of miR-29b suppressed cell proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, cell migration, invasion, and the growth of Tsc2-deficient tumors in vivo. Importantly, the combination of miR-29b inhibition with rapamycin treatment further inhibited these tumor-associated cellular processes. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which miR-29b promotes tumorigenesis, we used RNA sequencing to identify the tumor suppressor retinoid receptor beta (RARβ) as a target gene of miR-29b. We found that miR-29b directly targeted the 3′UTR of RARβ. Forced expression of RARβ reversed the effects of miR-29b overexpression in proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating that it is a critical target. miR-29b expression correlated with low RARβ expression in renal clear cell carcinomas and bladder urothelial carcinomas, tumors associated with TSC gene mutations. We further identified growth family member 4 (ING4) as a novel interacting partner of RARβ. Overexpression of ING4 inhibited the migration and invasion of Tsc2-deficient cells while silencing of ING4 reversed the RARβ-mediated suppression of cell migration and invasion. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel miR-29b/RARβ/ING4 pathway that regulates tumorigenic properties of Tsc2-deficient cells, and that may serve as a potential therapeutic target for TSC, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and other mTORC1-hyperactive tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2969602763,"Recent technical developments have resulted in robotic-assisted pedicle screw placement techniques. However, the use of robotic-assisted navigational techniques is still subject to controversy. This study aims to assess the accuracy and safety of a self-developed navigation system, the point spine navigation system (PSNS), for robotic-assisted pedicle screw placement surgery. Fifty-nine pedicle screws were implanted in three porcine vertebrae at the T6–T10 and L1–L5 levels, with the assistance of the PSNS. The navigation and planning system provides virtual surgical guide images, including sagittal, coronal, axial, oblique planes, and customized three-dimensional reconstructions for each vertebra to establish accurate pedicle screw trajectories and placement tracts. After pedicle screw placement, post-operative spiral computer tomographic scans were performed and screws were evaluated using the Gertzbein–Robbins classification. Differences between the actual pedicle screw position and pre-operative planning paths, including the angle, shortest distance, and entry trajectory were recorded. The 59 pedicle screw placements were all within a safe zone, and there was no spinal canal perforation or any other damage under postoperative computed tomography image data. Fifty-one screws were categorized as group A, seven screws were noted as group B, and one screw was identified as group E under the Gertzbein–Robbins classification. The mean entry point deviation was 2.71 ± 1.72°, mean trajectory distance was 1.56 ± 0.66 mm, and average shortest distance between two paths was 0.96 ± 0.73 mm. Pedicle placement remains a challenging procedure with high reported incidences of nerve and vascular injuries. The implementation of a robotic-assisted navigational system yields an acceptable level of accuracy and safety for the pedicle screw placement surgery."

As countermeasures, the Japanese government prioritized the promotion of local comprehensive care systems and collaboration in medical care and social (long-term) care. Development of a system to connect medical and social services in the community is necessary for the increasing older people, especially for the people in the stage of end of life. Objective This study aimed to assess the effect of a multidisciplinary end-of-life educational intervention program on confidence in inter-professional collaboration and job satisfaction among health and social care professionals. Design a cluster-randomized controlled trial Setting/Participants Three professional groups (home care nurses, care managers, and heads of care workers) in an urban area participated in this trial. Intervention We implemented a multidisciplinary end-of-life educational intervention program comprising two educational workshops and an educational booklet to support multidisciplinary care for end-of-life patients during the 7-month study period. Main outcome measure Confidence in improved interactions among professionals and job satisfaction were assessed with the Face-to-Face Cooperative Confidence Questionnaire and the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire at T1 (before intervention) and T2 (7 months after the intervention). Results In total, 291 professionals participated in this study (experimental group n = 156; control group n = 135). Multivariate regression analyses showed significant between-group increases on all of seven subscales in participants’ face-to-face cooperative confidence over the study period; no effect was evident regarding job satisfaction. Conclusions A multidisciplinary end-of-life educational intervention program increased confidence in multidisciplinary collaboration among health and social care professionals.

https://openalex.org/W2969789957,"Introduction Cardiovascular disease is among the leading causes of death in Kenya and type II diabetes (T2D) is a growing chronic health concern in the country. However, a gap exists in examining how demographic and social characteristics coalesce to identify individuals at high risk for hypertension and/or T2D in Kenya. The current study examined demographic typologies associated with self-report diagnoses. Methods Nationally representative cross-sectional study using 43,898 individuals from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2014. Main Outcome Measures were self-reported Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis. Descriptive analyses were conducted using STATA 14. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted using Mplus 7.4. Results Approximately 5% reported hypertension and 1% reported T2D. Latent class analysis suggested a 4-class solution. The class with the highest likelihood to report previous diagnosis of hypertension (10.4%), consisted of high proportion of married adult women. The second highest prevalence of previous diagnosis of hypertension (4.4%) consisted of a high proportion of married middle aged men with high probability of being smokers. The results suggest that Kenyan women over 30 years may be at increased risk of hypertension compared to men. Future studies should include additional socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics to better understand gender differences in correlates for hypertension to be used for targeted and tailored health promotion-interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2968235068,"Aeromonas sobria is a pathogen causing food-borne illness. In immunocompromised patients and the elderly, A. sobria can leave the intestinal tract, and this opportunistically leads to severe extraintestinal diseases including sepsis, peritonitis, and meningitis. To cause such extraintestinal diseases, A. sobria must pass through the intestinal epithelial barrier. The mechanism of such bacterial translocation has not been established. Herein we used intestinal (T84) cultured cells to investigate the effect of A. sobria serine protease (ASP) on junctional complexes that maintain the intercellular adhesion of the intestinal epithelium. When several A. sobria strains were inoculated into T84 monolayer grown on Transwell inserts, the strain with higher ASP production largely decreased the value of transepithelial electrical resistance exhibited by the T84 monolayer and markedly caused bacterial translocation from the apical surface into the basolateral side of T84 monolayer. Further experiments revealed that ASP acts on adherens junctions (AJs) and causes the destruction of both nectin-2 and afadin, which are protein components constituting AJs. Other studies have not revealed the bacterial pathogenic factors that cause the destruction of both nectin-2 and afadin, and our present results thus provide the first report that the bacterial extracellular protease ASP affects these molecules. We speculate that the destruction of nectin-2 and afadin by the action of ASP increases the ability of A. sobria to pass through intestinal epithelial tissue and contributes to the severity of pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2969951425,"Magnetic resonance imaging studies typically use standard anatomical atlases for identification and analyses of (patho-)physiological effects on specific brain areas; these atlases often fail to incorporate neuroanatomical alterations that may occur with both age and disease. The present study utilizes Parkinson's disease and age-specific anatomical atlases of the subthalamic nucleus for diffusion tractography, assessing tracts that run between the subthalamic nucleus and a-priori defined cortical areas known to be affected by Parkinson's disease. The results show that the strength of white matter fiber tracts appear to remain structurally unaffected by disease. Contrary to that, Fractional Anisotropy values were shown to decrease in Parkinson's disease patients for connections between the subthalamic nucleus and the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the pre-supplementary motor, collectively involved in preparatory motor control, decision making and task monitoring. While the biological underpinnings of fractional anisotropy alterations remain elusive, they may nonetheless be used as an index of Parkinson's disease. Moreover, we find that failing to account for structural changes occurring in the subthalamic nucleus with age and disease reduce the accuracy and influence the results of tractography, highlighting the importance of using appropriate atlases for tractography."
https://openalex.org/W2968093058,"Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID) is a non-psychotic condition wherein individuals desire amputation or paralysis of one or more healthy, fully-functioning limbs (predominantly the legs). Individuals with BIID have been suggested to have a mismatch between the perceived mental representation of the body and its actual physical structure, such that their desired identity matches that of a lower-limb amputee. Accordingly, studies have reported an altered central network involving body representation of the legs in BIID, but its relationship to behavior remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the integrity of body representation in individuals with BIID, acquired lower-limb amputees, and normally-limbed controls using an online mental rotation task. Participants judged the laterality of left and right foot images presented from different views, orientations, and of different types. We expected BIID participants to be slower for mentally rotating images that corresponded to their affected legs than lower-limb amputees and normally-limbed participants. We found that the groups did not significantly differ in their performance. All participants were slower at judging feet presented in awkward postures than natural postures, replicating previous studies and validating our online paradigm. The results are discussed in terms of the robust nature of visual and sensorimotor lower-limb representations, whether related to the self or as prototype, in the context of disturbed lower-limb integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2968844317,"The bacterial species, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, beneficial to humans and animals and found in mammalian and avian gut, is also occasionally found in dairy cow milk. It is one of the butyrate-producing bacteria of the colon, has anti-inflammatory properties and its abundance in the gut is negatively correlated with obesity in humans. Several strains differing in their functional capability, have been identified. It is important therefore, milk being a potential source of F. prausnitzii as a novel probiotic, to investigate the diversity of this species in bovine milk. Using 16s rRNA gene amplicons we find 292 different dereplicated Faecalibacterium-related amplicons in a herd of 21 dairy cows. The distribution of the 20 most abundant amplicons with >97% identity to a Greengenes OTU varies from cow to cow. Clustering of the 292 pooled sequences from all cows at 99.6% identity finds 4 likely Faecalibacterium phylotypes with >98.5% identity to an F. prausnitzii reference sequence. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis shows these phylotypes are distinct from 34 other species from the Ruminococcaceae family and displaying the sequence clusters as a network illustrates how each cluster is composed of sequences from multiple cows. We conclude there are several phylotypes of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (the only species so far defined for the genus) in this dairy herd with cows being inoculated with a mixture of several strains from a common source. We conclude that not only can Faecalibacterium be detected in dairy cow milk (as noted by others) but that there exist multiple different strains in the milk of a dairy herd. Therefore milk, as an alternative to faeces, offers the opportunity of discovering new strains with potential probiotic application."
https://openalex.org/W2969023520,"The sponging of microRNAs by a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) away from their coding gene targets is a conceptually-simple, yet biologically-complex method of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation. Currently, predictions of genes that participate in sponge-based regulation are largely based on sequence homology alone, which may not adequately reflect the cellular environment in which lncRNA:miRNA pairs interact. The vast number of potential interactions generated by these predictions impedes the identification of functional gene regulatory relationships, which necessitates an approach that considers biological context. XIST, the female-specific lncRNA canonically involved in silencing the X chromosome, has been suggested by many studies to act as a miRNA sponge. The sex-specificity of XIST provides the opportunity to study the biological feasibility of proposed XIST-miRNA interactions. Here we take a comprehensive approach by considering factors that affect possible regulation through XIST-miRNA sponging.To identify the most feasible candidates in a particular tissue (lung adenocarcinomas), we considered protein-coding genes that (1) were positively correlated with XIST expression within sexes, (2) were targeted by miRNAs shared with XIST, and (3) expressed in lung adenocarcinoma. This revealed a robust set of 124 genes potentially positively regulated by XIST through the sequestration of 804 shared miRNAs. We then used the basic sex-specific nature of XIST to compare the changes in miRNA-target gene relationships in endogenously high-XIST and low-XIST systems to discover a high-confidence set of only 13 miRNA-gene pairs. As XIST is expressed exclusively in the nucleus, we validated the nuclear presence of several of these high-confidence miRNAs using RT-qPCR, confirming the co-localization required for XIST to interact with these species.We use a biology-driven approach to identify genes defended from miRNA-based inhibition by the lncRNA XIST. Importantly, we identify that only a small subset of miRNAs predicted by sequence homology alone have the capacity to mediate the XIST-target gene axis, as they are enriched in the nucleus and able to co-localize with XIST for sponging. Our results reinforce the necessary consideration of biological features in future studies of lncRNA:miRNA interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2967334891,"ND7/23 cells are gaining traction as a host model to express peripheral sodium channels such as NaV1.8 and NaV1.9 that have been difficult to express in widely utilized heterologous cells, like CHO and HEK293. Use of ND7/23 as a model cell to characterize the properties of sodium channels requires clear understanding of the endogenous ion channels. To define the nature of the background sodium currents in ND7/23 cells, we aimed to comprehensively profile the voltage-gated sodium channel subunits by endpoint and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and by whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that untransfected ND7/23 cells express endogenous peak sodium currents that average –2.12nA (n = 15) and with kinetics typical of fast sodium currents having activation and inactivation completed within few milliseconds. Furthermore, sodium currents were reduced to virtually nil upon exposure to 100nM tetrodotoxin, indicating that ND7/23 cells have essentially null background for tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) currents. qRT-PCR profiling indicated a major expression of TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) NaV1.6 and NaV1.7 at similar levels and very low expression of TTX-R NaV1.9 transcripts. There was no expression of TTX-R NaV1.8 in ND7/23 cells. There was low expression of NaV1.1, NaV1.2, NaV1.3 and no expression of cardiac or skeletal muscle sodium channels. As for the sodium channel auxiliary subunits, β1 and β3 subunits were expressed, but not the β2 and β4 subunits that covalently associate with the α-subunits. In addition, our results also showed that only the mouse forms of NaV1.6, NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 sodium channels were expressed in ND7/23 cells that was originally generated as a hybridoma of rat embryonic DRG and mouse neuroblastoma cell-line. By molecular profiling of auxiliary β- and principal α-subunits of the voltage gated sodium channel complex, our results define the background sodium channels expressed in ND7/23 cells, and confirm their utility for detailed functional studies of emerging pain channelopathies ascribed to mutations of the TTX-R sodium channels of sensory neurons."

Predictive hospital admission models have been developed to help reduce the number of these patients. Aim To develop and internally validate a model to predict hospital admission in one-year for any non-programmed cause in heart failure patients receiving primary care treatment. Design and setting Cohort study, prospective. Patients treated in family medicine clinics. Methods Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the predictors and the outcome, i.e. unplanned hospitalization over a 12-month period. The predictive model was built in several steps. The initial examination included a set of 31 predictors. Bootstrapping was used for internal validation. Results The study included 251 patients, 64 (25.5%) of whom were admitted to hospital for some unplanned cause over the 12 months following their date of inclusion in the study. Four predictive variables of hospitalization were identified: NYHA class III-IV, OR (95% CI) 2.46 (1.23–4.91); diabetes OR (95% CI) 1.94 (1.05–3.58); COPD OR (95% CI) 3.17 (1.45–6.94); MLHFQ Emotional OR (95% CI) 1.07 (1.02–1.12). AUC 0.723; R2N 0.17; Hosmer-Lemeshow 0.815. Internal validation AUC 0.706.; R2N 0.134 Conclusion This is a simple model to predict hospitalization over a 12-month period based on four variables: NYHA functional class, diabetes, COPD and the emotional dimension of the MLHFQ scale. It has an acceptable discriminative capacity enabling the identification of patients at risk of hospitalization."

Schools have been identified as a setting to tackle physical inactivity. Economic evidence of school-based physical activity programmes is limited, and the costs of these programmes are not always collected in full. This paper describes a micro-costing and cost-consequence analysis of the ‘Girls Active’ secondary school-based programme as part of a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Micro-costing and cost-consequence analyses were conducted using bespoke cost diaries and questionnaires to collect programme delivery information. Outcomes for the cost-consequence analysis included health-related quality of life measured by the Child Health Utility-9D (CHU-9D), primary care General Practitioner (GP) and school-based (school nurse and school counsellor) service use as part of a cluster RCT of the ‘Girls Active’ programme. Overall, 1,752 secondary pupils were recruited and a complete case sample of 997 participants (Intervention n = 570, Control n = 427) was used for the cost-consequence analysis. The micro-costing analysis demonstrated that, depending upon how the programme was delivered, ‘Girls Active’ costs ranged from £1,054 (£2 per pupil, per school year) to £3,489 (£7 per pupil, per school year). The least costly option was to absorb ‘Girls Active’ strictly within curriculum hours. The analysis demonstrated no effect for the programme for the three main outcomes of interest (health-related quality of life, physical activity and service use).Micro-costing analyses demonstrated the costs of delivering the ‘Girls Active’ programme, addressing a gap in the United Kingdom (UK) literature regarding economic evidence from school-based physical activity programmes. This paper provides recommendations for those gathering cost and service use data in school settings to supplement validated and objective measures, furthering economic research in this field.

Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) to HDL-C ratio, triglyceride (TG), glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) score and CRF, were standardized according to international age-and sex-specific reference values.The Norwegian children had significantly more favorable WC, DBP, glucose, HDL-C and CRF levels compared to the international reference values, but similar or less favorable levels of other cardiometabolic risk factors. CRF was the variable that differed the most from the international values (mean (95% CI) 1.20 (1.16 to 1.24) SD). The clustered risk score (excluding CRF) was higher in the Norwegian children, but decreased to below international levels when including CRF (mean (95% CI) - 0.08 (- 0.12 to -0.05) SD). CRF had a significant inverse association with the clustered risk score (excluding CRF) (β - 0.37 SD, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.31).Norwegian children have substantially higher CRF levels than international standards, and including CRF in clustered risk scores reduces overall risk in Norwegian children below that of international levels.

Populations at range margins or transitions between biomes can be particularly instructive for observing changes in biological communities that may be driven by climate change. Avian communities in lowland boreal habitats in the Adirondack Park, located at the North American boreal-temperate ecotone, have been the focus of long-term monitoring efforts since 2007. By documenting long-term changes in community structure and composition, such datasets provide an opportunity to understand how boreal species are responding differently to climate change, and which habitat characteristics may be best able to retain boreal avian communities. We examined three specific questions in order to address how well current biological communities in Adirondack boreal wetland habitats are being maintained in a changing climate: (1) how do trends in occupancy vary across species, and what guilds or characteristics are associated with increasing or decreasing occupancy? (2) how is avian community composition changing differently across sites, and (3) what distinguishes sites which are retaining boreal birds to a higher degree than other sites? Our analysis revealed that (1) boreal species appear to exhibit the largest changes in occupancy among our study locations as compared to the larger avian community, (2) dynamics of community change are not uniform across sites and habitat structure may play an important role in driving observed changes, and (3) the particular characteristics of large open peatlands may allow them to serve as refugia for boreal species in the context of climate change."

The proposed method is based on the comparison of the peak intensity of spectral components. These components correspond to the inherent structured illumination spectral content and the residual component that appears from wrongly estimated phase-shifts. The estimation of the phase-shifts is carried out by finding the absolute maximum of a function defined as the normalized peak intensity difference in the Fourier domain. This task is performed by an optimization method providing a fast estimation of the phase-shift. The algorithm stability and robustness are tested for various levels of noise and contrasts of the structured illumination pattern. Furthermore, the proposed approach reduces the number of computations compared to other existing techniques. The method is supported by the theoretical calculations and validated by means of simulated and experimental results."

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis showed that FexOy@TiO2-0.5 has the smallest crystallite size (16.8 nm), followed by FexOy@TiO2-0.5 (18.4 nm), FexOy/TiO2-0.35 (21.0 nm) and FexOy/TiO2-0.5 (19.0 nm), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested the decreasing percentage of Fe3O4 from 52.1% to 36.7%-47.2% after Ti-deposition treatment. The saturated magnetisms followed the order: FexOy@TiO2-0.5 > FexOy@TiO2-0.35 > FexOy/TiO2-0.5 > FexOy/TiO2-0.35. R6G photodegradation followed the first order kinetics and was slightly influenced by pH but significantly affected by initial photocatalyst concentration. FexOy/TiO2-0.35 achieved the highest removal efficiency for R6G (92.5%), followed by FexOy@TiO2-0.35 (88.97%), FexOy@TiO2-0.5 (60.49%) and FexOy/TiO2-0.5 (48.06%). Additionally, all these magnetic-TiO2-nanocomposites had satisfied magnetic recoverability and exhibited laudable reusability after 5-times reuse, even achieving higher R6G removal efficiencies from 97.30% to 98.47%. Our one-step method took only 75 min for nanocomposite synthesis, 90 min less than conventional two-step method, showing its feasibility as a practical method for magnetic-TiO2-nanocomposite synthesis in industrial application."
https://openalex.org/W2969356044,"The internal phenotypes of netted muskmelon (Cucumis melo L. var. eticulates Naud.) are always associated with its external phenotypes. In this study, the parameters of external phenotypic traits were extracted from muskmelon images captured by machine vision, and the internal phenotypes of interest to us were measured. Pearson analysis showed that most external phenotypic traits were highly correlated with these internal phenotypes in muskmelon fruit. In this study, we used the random forest algorithm to predict muskmelon fruit internal phenotypes based on the significantly associated external parameters. Carotenoids, sucrose, and total soluble solid (TSS) were the three most accurately monitored internal phenotypes with prediction R-squared (R2) values of 0.947 (root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.019 mg/100 g), 0.918 (RMSE = 3.233 mg/g), and 0.916 (RMSE = 1.089%), respectively. Further, a simplified model was constructed and validated based on the top 10 external phenotypic parameters associated with each internal phenotype, and these parameters were filtered with the varImp function from the random forest package. The top 10 external phenotypic parameters correlated with each internal phenotype used in the simplified model were not identical. The results showed that the simplified models also accurately monitored the melon internal phenotypes, despite that the predicted R2 values decreased 0.3% to 7.9% compared with the original models. This study improved the efficiency and accuracy of real-time fruit quality monitoring for greenhouse muskmelon."
https://openalex.org/W2969582314,"Humans depend on microbial communities for numerous ecosystem services such as global nutrient cycles, plant growth and their digestive health. Yet predicting dynamics and functioning of these complex systems is hard, making interventions to enhance functioning harder still. One simplifying approach is to assume that functioning can be predicted from the set of enzymes present in a community. Alternatively, ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species, which depend on how enzymes are packaged among species, might be vital for predicting community functioning. I investigate these alternatives by extending classical chemostat models of bacterial growth to multiple species that evolve in their use of chemical resources. Ecological interactions emerge from patterns of resource use, which change as species evolve in their allocation of metabolic enzymes. Measures of community functioning derive in turn from metabolite concentrations and bacterial density. Although the model shows considerable functional redundancy, species packaging does matter by introducing constraints on whether enzyme levels can reach optimum levels for the whole system. Evolution can either promote or reduce functioning compared to purely ecological models, depending on the shape of trade-offs in resource use. The model provides baseline theory for interpreting emerging data on evolution and functioning in real bacterial communities."

Aims We evaluated leptin and adiponectin levels in RC patients compared to healthy population and their dynamics after surgery. Material and methods Serum leptin and adiponectin were evaluated before surgery in 59 RC consecutive patients (38 males and 21 females), and in age and weight matched healthy controls. Measurements were repeated at 24, 72 hours and 7 days after surgery. Results Adipokine levels were higher in women. Controls had higher leptin (32.±4.34 vs 9.51±1.73 ng/ml in women and 11±2.66 vs 2.54±0.39 ng/ml in men, p = 0.00048 and 0.0032) and lower adiponectin (9±0.64 vs 11.85±1.02 μg/ml in women and 7.39±0.51 vs 8.5±0.62 μg/ml in men, p = 0.017 and 0.019) than RC patients. Surgery caused an increase of leptin from 5.11±0.8 to 18.7±2.42 ng/ml, p = 6.85 x 10¨8, and a decrease of adiponectin from 9.71±0.58 to 7.87±0.47 μg/ml, p = 1.4 x 10¨10 for all RC patients and returned thereafter to the initial range at 7 days. Adipokines were correlated with body weight (BW). The significance of correlation persisted after surgery only in males, but disappeared in females. Adipokines were not modified by tumor position, presurgical chemoradiotherapy or surgical technique. Women with RC experiencing weight loss had higher adiponectin than women without weight modifications (p<0.05 at all time points). Conclusions Adipokine levels of patients with RC differ from the healthy population, possibly reflecting an adaptation to disease. Adipokine modifications after surgery may be related to acute surgical stress. Whether leptin and adiponectin directly interact is not clear. Women have higher adipokine levels, more so after significant weight loss, but the strength of their correlation with BW decreases after surgery. These data suggest gender differences in the adipokine profile of RC patients which may find clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2966416680,"It is well accepted that, at the global scale, the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law describing the distribution of earthquake magnitude or seismic moment has to be modified at the tail to properly account for the most extreme events. It is debated, though, how much additional time of earthquake recording will be necessary to properly constrain this tail. Using the global CMT catalog, we study how three modifications of the GR law that incorporate a corner-value parameter are compatible with the size of the largest observed earthquake in a given time window. Current data lead to a rather large range of parameter values (e.g., corner magnitude from 8.6 to 10.2 for the so-called tapered GR distribution). Updating this estimation in the future will strongly depend on the maximum magnitude observed, but, under reasonable assumptions, the range will be substantially reduced by the end of this century, contrary to claims in previous literature."

The needle-to-post ion source includes asymmetric electrode comprised of a copper post with a diameter of 2 mm and a stainless-steel needle with 200-μm tip radius and length of 28 mm. With the discharge voltage of -5.6 kV and N2 gas flow, glow discharge was realized at atmospheric pressure. The mass spectra of ionized ions about acetone, ethanol and ethyl acetate were gotten by Thermo Scientific LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer (MS). The MS experimental results show that the main ions are protonated and dimer ions. The needle-to-post ion source was mounted on the FAIMS system and FAIMS spectra are gotten successfully. Separation of p-xylene, o-xylene and m-xylene was realized. It shows that the needle-to-post electrode could be used as the ion source in a FAIMS system."

In response to recent anti-Chinese sentiment in the US, Sunney Xie uses his own experiences to assert that American ideals should not be replaced by nationalism and populism and that everybody wins in Sino-US scientific collaborations, contrary to what Americans are led to believe: that China is the sole beneficiary. After 20 years of being a tenured professor at Harvard, I relocated to Peking University (PKU) in July of 2018, bridging my past with my future (Xie, 2019Xie X.S. Xiaoliang Sunney Xie: Setting Sail and Journeying Home. Peking University, 2019http://newsen.pku.edu.cn/news_events/news/people/8751.htmGoogle Scholar). Little did I expect that, only 6 days after I began my tenure at PKU, the United States would implement the first China-specific tariffs. Things escalated beyond simple economics in November, when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ordered hundreds of US institutions to investigate many US-based and NIH-supported scientists, primarily of Chinese descent, who conducted collaborative research in China. This led to the closing of several laboratories and hardships for many researchers in US institutions. Many Chinese scientists are denied visas to the United States to attend international meetings. These events portended unsettling times to come. Many people have asked why I decided to leave Harvard for PKU. It was by no means an easy decision; it involved many considerations, such as my love for my parents, my alma mater PKU, the motherland, and so forth. What really tipped the balance, in the end, was science. I simply would have better research opportunities in Beijing, which is a true reflection of what China has achieved during my years spent in America. My own life has taken shape from two of the world’s greatest cultures: one that I inherited through my roots, the other where I chose to spend most of my adulthood. When I first arrived in America, I was greatly inspired by the Founding Fathers’ ideals for freedom and democracy. As an international student from China, I was embraced by my American professors. In my 20 years at Harvard as an immigrant and now a US citizen, support from my colleagues helped me to realize my dreams as a scientist and rise in academia. Such inclusiveness, in a broader sense, helped make America a great country. Thus, while I was deeply offended by the perception that Chinese students and collaborators are spies, I was emotionally touched by recent declarations of support made by many of America's top universities, among them UC Berkley, Stanford, Yale, Columbia University, MIT, University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins University, and Caltech, to their international communities. The resounding message put forth by these universities is that America, and its universities, must remain open. My personal experience is an example of how US-China collaboration benefits the whole world, not just China. While still on the Harvard faculty, I shuttled between Boston and Beijing and collaborated with my PKU colleagues Jie Qiao and Fuchou Tang on a new approach to improve the genetic testing of embryos during in vitro fertilization. Using a high-precision single-cell whole-genome amplification method (multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles, MALBAC) originally developed by my Harvard group (Zong et al., 2012Zong C. Lu S. Chapman A.R. Xie X.S. Genome-wide detection of single-nucleotide and copy-number variations of a single human cell.Science. 2012; 338: 1622-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), my PKU colleagues and I achieved the first successful demonstration of a birth of a “MALBAC baby” in 2014 (Yan et al., 2015Yan L. Huang L. Xu L. Huang J. Ma F. Zhu X. Tang Y. Liu M. Lian Y. Liu P. et al.Live births after simultaneous avoidance of monogenic diseases and chromosome abnormality by next-generation sequencing with linkage analyses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 15964-15969Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since then, China has had more than a thousand MALBAC babies come into the world free from the genetic disorders of their parents, which exemplifies the power of precision medicine. Diseases have no borders, and neither should research! We did not do the research to serve China alone. There are thousands of monogenetic diseases in the world, suffered by people of all ethnic groups. I am thrilled that this technology has been adopted in the United States so that families worldwide can now benefit from the fruits of this international effort. Since last year, I have been able to continue performing medically impactful research via US-China collaborations, but making contributions from the China side. Recently, my research team has been collaborating with Dr. Catherine Racowsky at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, one of the most prestigious hospitals in the United States, on the development of a noninvasive version of genetic testing. In lieu of embryo biopsy, our method detects DNA leaked from an embryo to the spent culture, which is not only noninvasive but also holds promise to be more precise and reliable, and clinical trials are now under way in both countries (Huang et al., 2019Huang L. Bogale B. Tang Y. Lu S. Xie X.S. Racowsky C. Noninvasive preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy in spent medium may be more reliable than trophectoderm biopsy.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2019; (Published online June 24, 2019)https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1907472116Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Once again, the collaboration is mutually beneficial, contrary to what Americans are often led to believe—that China is the sole beneficiary in Sino-US scientific and technological collaborations. During my years at Harvard, one of the most inspiring commencement speeches was given by Bill Gates, who represented some of the American ideals that helped shaped me. As the most successful Harvard dropout, Gates led the revolution of information technology, which helped globalize the world. While this represents his own personal realization of the American Dream, the information technology revolution helped to propagate the American Dream worldwide. Gates went on to found the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in order to use science and technology to save millions of lives in Africa and around the world, which exemplifies the American ideal of helping the world. It is my hope that such dreams and ideals will not be replaced by nationalism and populism in any country. Chinese scientists are beginning to contribute world-class science in many fields, thanks to China’s reform and economic growth. However, science is international. To pursue new knowledge, understand nature, and tackle the truly important issues facing our time, Chinese scientists and scientists around the world must collaborate. In doing so, everyone wins. Science transcends politics. As the French chemist Louis Pasteur famously said, “Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world.” The author thanks his groups and collaborators, both in the United States and China, and NIH for financially supporting his Harvard group on the initial technical development on single-cell genomics and Peking University, Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, National Key Technologies Research and Development program, Yikon Genomics, and Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics for financially supporting the translational research in China.
