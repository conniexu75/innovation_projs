https://openalex.org/W2030701238,"Glioblastoma tumour cells release microvesicles (exosomes) containing mRNA, miRNA and angiogenic proteins. These microvesicles are taken up by normal host cells, such as brain microvascular endothelial cells. By incorporating an mRNA for a reporter protein into these microvesicles, we demonstrate that messages delivered by microvesicles are translated by recipient cells. These microvesicles are also enriched in angiogenic proteins and stimulate tubule formation by endothelial cells. Tumour-derived microvesicles therefore serve as a means of delivering genetic information and proteins to recipient cells in the tumour environment. Glioblastoma microvesicles also stimulated proliferation of a human glioma cell line, indicating a self-promoting aspect. Messenger RNA mutant/variants and miRNAs characteristic of gliomas could be detected in serum microvesicles of glioblastoma patients. The tumour-specific EGFRvIII was detected in serum microvesicles from 7 out of 25 glioblastoma patients. Thus, tumour-derived microvesicles may provide diagnostic information and aid in therapeutic decisions for cancer patients through a blood test."
https://openalex.org/W2053319140,"Nanobodies, single-domain antigen-binding fragments of camelid-specific heavy-chain only antibodies offer special advantages in therapy over classic antibody fragments because of their smaller size, robustness, and preference to target unique epitopes. A Nanobody differs from a human heavy chain variable domain in about ten amino acids spread all over its surface, four hallmark Nanobody-specific amino acids in the framework-2 region (positions 42, 49, 50, and 52), and a longer third antigen-binding loop (H3) folding over this area. For therapeutic applications the camelid-specific amino acid sequences in the framework have to be mutated to their human heavy chain variable domain equivalent, i.e. humanized. We performed this humanization exercise with Nanobodies of the subfamily that represents close to 80% of all dromedary-derived Nanobodies and investigated the effects on antigen affinity, solubility, expression yield, and stability. It is demonstrated that the humanization of Nanobody-specific residues outside framework-2 are neutral to the Nanobody properties. Surprisingly, the Glu-49 → Gly and Arg-50 → Leu humanization of hallmark amino acids generates a single domain that is more stable though probably less soluble. The other framework-2 substitutions, Phe-42 → Val and Gly/Ala-52 → Trp, are detrimental for antigen affinity, due to a repositioning of the H3 loop as shown by their crystal structures. These insights were used to identify a soluble, stable, well expressed universal humanized Nanobody scaffold that allows grafts of antigen-binding loops from other Nanobodies with transfer of the antigen specificity and affinity.

Minimizing the size of antigen-binding entities from a multidomain protein such as a monoclonal antibody to a single-chain variable fragment or even a single domain has been one of the primary goals of antibody engineering. For drug therapy, these smaller formats can be beneficial in various aspects such as immunogenicity, biodistribution, renal clearance, serum half-life, tissue penetration, and target retention. However, the minimal sized antibody fragments need to retain sufficiently high antigen specificity and affinity, be expressed in high yields, and should have a low tendency to aggregate so as to maintain maximal potency and reduce possible risks of immunogenicity. Moreover functionality in adverse environments such as high concentrations of denaturant or elevated temperatures, and a concomitant increased shelf-life are additional assets. A significant proportion of the functional antibodies within species of the Camelidae are devoid of light chains. These immunoglobulins are referred to as heavy-chain antibodies (1Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Nature.. 1993; 363: 446-448Google Scholar), and their antigen-binding fragment is reduced to a single domain (referred to as VHH or Nanobody), with a molecular size of only ∼15 kDa, which is smaller in comparison to single-chain variable fragment fragments (30 kDa), Fab fragments (60 kDa), and whole antibodies (150 kDa). All Nanobodies belong to the same sequence family, closely related to that of the human VH 3The abbreviations used are: VH, heavy chain variable domain; LDA, ligation during amplification protocol; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CDR, complementarity determining region.3The abbreviations used are: VH, heavy chain variable domain; LDA, ligation during amplification protocol; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CDR, complementarity determining region. of family III, although different subfamilies can be distinguished in dromedary based on the CDR2 length and the position of an additional cysteine in the CDR1 or the framework-2 (2Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 921-930Google Scholar). Because extra cysteines are rare in llama VHH sequences, they cannot be used as a subfamily hallmark and alternative subfamily divisions had to be proposed for llama VHHs (3Achour I. Cavelier P. Tichit M. Bouchier C. Lafaye P. Rougeon F. J. Immunol... 2008; 181: 2001-2009Google Scholar, 4Harmsen M.M. Ruuls R.C. Nijman I.J. Niewold T.A. Frenken L.G. de Geus B. Mol. Immunol... 2000; 37: 579-590Google Scholar). Following immunization of a llama or dromedary, VHH genes can be easily cloned in a phagemid vector and antigen-specific VHHs can then be selected via phage display against virtually any antigen (5Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett... 1997; 414: 521-526Google Scholar). Their small size, natural soluble behavior, and unique ability to target alternative epitopes make Nanobodies very attractive tools for tumor targeting, diagnostics, or even for in vivo therapy (6Baral T.N.

Chem... 2005; 77: 7547-7555Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the Nanobodies obtained from immunized camelids revealed frequent substitutions in regions that are conserved in the VH domain of conventional antibodies. These Nanobody hallmark amino acids, located mainly in framework-2, are essential adaptations to avoid the association with the variable light chain domain (11Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A. Hamers R. Protein Eng.. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Google Scholar). Most of these mutations are substitutions from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic residue and are considered to increase the solubility of the isolated Nanobody (12Davies J. Riechmann L. FEBS Lett... 1994; 339: 285-290Google Scholar, 13Conrath K. Vincke C. Stijlemans B. Schymkowitz J. Decanniere K. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Loris R. J. Mol. Biol... 2005; 350: 112-125Google Scholar). In some cases, several of these residues at the “former VL-side” may also affect the antigen specificity of the Nanobody (13Conrath K. Vincke C. Stijlemans B. Schymkowitz J. Decanniere K. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Loris R. J. Mol. Biol... 2005; 350: 112-125Google Scholar). These differences between VHH and VH conserved residues are Phe/Tyr-42 → Val, Glu-49 → Gly, Arg-50 → Leu, and Gly-52 → Trp (numbers refer to the International ImMunoGeneTics information system amino acid numbering (imgt.cines.fr)). Additionally, in ∼10% of the Nanobodies, Trp-118 is substituted by an Arg (14Harmsen M.M. de Haard H.J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol... 2007; 77: 13-22Google Scholar). The Trp-118 → Arg substitution was proposed as an alternative option to further increase the solubility of single-domain antibody fragments (15Desmyter A. Decanniere K. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 26285-26290Google Scholar). Because mouse antibody fragments require a humanization step to be accepted as human therapeutics, it is likely that Nanobodies from camelid origin should also pass a humanization process. It is our objective in this work to assess the biochemical properties of several Nanobodies after such humanization effort. We investigated therefore the humanization of a couple of representative Nanobodies into more human-like antibody fragments and tested their retention of antigen-binding specificity. Two Nanobodies, members of subfamily-2, were chosen for this analysis: NbHuL6 (16Dumoulin M. Conrath K. Van Meirhaeghe A. Meersman F. Heremans K. Frenken L.G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Matagne A. Protein Sci... 2002; 11: 500-515Google Scholar) and NbBcII10 (17Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Google Scholar). Subfamily-2 is the most frequently occurring of the seven VHH subfamilies accounting for 75% of all isolated dromedary antigen-specific Nanobodies (2Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 921-930Google Scholar). We first focused on the framework-2 residues, because those mutations are expected to have the largest impact on expression, solubility, and antigen affinity of the isolated domain. We then analyzed the effect of the Trp-118 → Arg mutation on these antibody formats. Subsequently, we substituted the remaining “non-human” residues in the framework and resurfaced NbBcII10 to obtain a humanized Nanobody scaffold (h-NbBcII10FGLA) so as to exhibit the closest possible amino acid identity to a human VH (Fig. 1). It was previously demonstrated that the NbBcII10 accepts the CDR loops from a whole range of Nanobodies with transfer of the antigen specificity of the loop donor (18Saerens D. Pellis M. Loris R. Pardon E. Dumoulin M. Matagne A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Conrath K. J. Mol. Biol... 2005; 352: 597-607Google Scholar). Therefore, the CDR loops of two Nanobodies, NbHuL6 and NbHSA, were grafted on the resurfaced framework h-NbBcII10FGLA, to assess whether this framework can indeed be used as a universal humanized Nanobody scaffold. We determined and compared the antigen specificity, kinetic binding rate constants (kon/koff), the thermal (Tm), and conformational (Cm/ΔG0) stability parameters of multiple variants, humanized to different extents. To evaluate the impact of humanization on the scaffold architecture of Nanobodies, we solved the crystal structure of a partially humanized NbHul6 mutant (Phe-42, Gly-49, Leu-50, and Trp-52) in complex with its antigen and of the maximally humanized NbBcII10 (h-NbBcII10FGLA). Based on this knowledge, a general strategy is proposed to generate a humanized version of any Nanobody with maximal retention of stability and antigen-binding characteristics. Finally, a universal humanized Nanobody scaffold was identified that accommodates antigen-binding loops from Nanobodies, even those from other subfamilies or species. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced by phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotides using the ligation during amplification protocol (LDA) (19Chen Z. Ruffner D.E. Nucleic Acids Res... 1998; 26: 1126-1127Google Scholar). Multiple mutations were introduced simultaneously using multiple mutagenic primers, designed so as to add or eliminate a particular restriction enzyme site. The introduction of the different mutations was analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI prism 3100 genetic analyzer, Applied Biosystems). Expression and Purification of Nanobodies—The plasmid constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli WK6 cells. The expression in the periplasm and purification of recombinant His6-tagged Nanobodies was performed as described previously (17Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Google Scholar). The purity of the proteins was evaluated by Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the computed extinction coefficient of each Nanobody, as calculated from their amino acid sequence (20Gasteiger E. Gattiker A. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res... 2003; 31: 3784-3788Google Scholar). Affinity Measurements—Different concentrations ranging from 500 nm to 7.8 nm of the NbHuL6, NbBcII10, and their respective variants were flown over a CM5 chip (Biacore) to which respectively human lysozyme (200 relative units) and BcII (800 relative units) had been coupled using the amine coupling chemistry (N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide/N-hydroxy succinimide) according to the manufacturer's descriptions. All measurements were performed at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20) and 10 mm glycine/HCl, pH 1.5, was used for regeneration. Data were fitted with the help of the BIAevaluation software version 4.1 (Biacore), on the basis of a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, with simultaneous fitting of the dissociation (koff) and association (kon) rate constants. The kinetic parameters kon and koff were subsequently used to calculate the KD values. Temperature-induced Unfolding—CD measurements were performed with a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter in the far-UV (205-250 nm) region, using a protein concentration of 0.166 mg/ml and 0.1 cm cell path length. A total volume of 300 μl of each sample was heated in 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0). Heat-induced unfolding was monitored by increasing the temperature from 35 °C to 95 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min, and recording the fluorescence intensity at 205 nm as a function of temperature. Data were acquired with a reading frequency of 1/20 s-1, a 1-s integration time, and a 2 nm bandwidth. Data analysis was performed assuming two-state unfolding mechanisms (21Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure, A practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 299-321Google Scholar). The reversibility of the unfolding was assessed by recording wave-length scans of the protein at 35 °C, 95 °C and again after cooling down the sample to 35 °C. At each temperature five spectra were measured and averaged. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—To test the residual binding activity after thermal unfolding, the different mutants were incubated at concentrations between 250 nm and 2 μm for 4 h at 90 °C. Maxisorb 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with human lysozyme or BcII at a concentration of 2 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Residual protein-binding sites in the wells were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 1% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation with either untreated or heat-treated and subsequently refolded His-tagged Nanobody, bound protein was detected using a mouse anti-histidine tag antibody (Serotec) followed by an alkaline phosphatase anti-mouse-IgG conjugate (Sigma) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. The percentage of binding activity restored after temperature unfolding was calculated using triplicates at four different concentrations of Nanobody. Equilibrium Denaturation Experiments—GdmCl-induced unfolding followed by intrinsic fluorescence measurements was employed to determine the thermodynamic stability. Protein-GdmCl mixtures containing a final protein concentration of 25 μg/ml and denaturant concentrations ranging from 0 to 6.0 m GdmCl were prepared by adding a GdmCl stock solution (7.2 m, in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0) to the purified protein (stock 2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). After overnight incubation at room temperature, the intrinsic fluorescence was measured at 25 °C on an Aminco-Bowman spectrofluorometer from 300 to 400 nm after excitation at a wavelength of 280 nm. The center of spectral mass of each spectrum was calculated as the center of spectral mass =Σνi × Fi/ΣFi, where νi is the wave number (i.e. inverse wavelength) and Fi is the fluorescence intensity at νi (22Royer C.A. Methods Mol. Biol... 1995; 40: 65-89Google Scholar). Thermodynamic parameters for chemical unfolding were computed on the assumption of a two-state model for the unfolding reaction, as observed for Nanobodies studied so far (16Dumoulin M. Conrath K. Van Meirhaeghe A. Meersman F. Heremans K. Frenken L.G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Matagne A. Protein Sci... 2002; 11: 500-515Google Scholar, 23Ewert S. Cambillau C. Conrath K. Pluckthun A. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 3628-3636Google Scholar). On this basis, a first data analysis was performed to obtain the ΔG0 and m values using a six-parameter equation as previously described by Pace (24Pace C.N. Trends Biotechnol... 1990; 8: 93-98Google Scholar) and Santoro and Bolen (25Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry.. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Google Scholar). The concentration of denaturant at which half of the protein is denatured (Cm) has been shown to be the most reproducible value when comparing the stability of wild-type and mutant proteins, because it can be determined quite accurately and is largely insensitive to the unfolding mechanism (26Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol.. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar). Transition curves were also analyzed according to Clarke and Fersht (27Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry.. 1993; 32: 4322-4329Google Scholar) and Kellis et al. (28Kellis J.T.J. Nyberg K. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry.. 1989; 28: 4914-4922Google Scholar) to obtain the Cm and m values. ΔG0 can then simply be calculated from ΔG0 = m·Cm. Both fitting procedures resulted in very similar ΔG0 values, we therefore report only the latter. Generation of Chimeric Nanobody Constructs—The CDR-H loops from loop donor Nanobodies NbHuL6 (dromedary) and NbHSA (llama) were transferred to the scaffold of h-NbBcII10FGLA (humanized recipient Nanobody) by PCR-based mutagenesis. The sequence of each CDR-H loop from the loop donor Nanobody was encompassed by two primers, one back and one forward primer, containing at the 5′ and the 3′ ends the sequences corresponding to the framework residues of the recipient Nanobody. The chimeras were constructed as described previously with some minor modifications (18Saerens D. Pellis M. Loris R. Pardon E. Dumoulin M. Matagne A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Conrath K. J. Mol. Biol... 2005; 352: 597-607Google Scholar). The chimeric Nanobody construct of NbHuL6 on h-NbBcII10FGLAwas digested with NcoI and NotI, whereas the chimeric construct with NbHSA as donor Nanobody was digested with Hind-III and NotI. Both fragments were cloned in the expression vector pHEN6 (17Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Google Scholar). The expression yield of both chimeras is comparable to the level of the humanized recipient Nanobody (2 mg/liter of culture). Crystal Structure Determination—Data for the free form of NbBcII10 (pdb entry 3DWT) were collected at ESRF beamline ID14-2 under cryogenic conditions. The crystals diffract to 2.9-Å resolution. Data were reduced using the HKL suite of programs (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). Molecular replacement was done with the maximum-likelihood based program PHASER (30McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr... 2005; 61: 458-464Google Scholar, 31Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr... 2004; 60: 432-438Google Scholar), which allowed the unambiguous positioning of all eight VHH domains in the asymmetric unit. The framework region of crystal structure of NbBcII10 grafted with the CDR loops from NbLys3 (pdb entry 1ZMY) (18Saerens D. Pellis M. Loris R. Pardon E. Dumoulin M. Matagne A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S.

Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 71-78Google Scholar). NCS restraints were used throughout the refinement, and the mli target function was used. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The final R and Rfree factors were 0.245 and 0.304, respectively, with the model fitting the electron density very well. Attempts to reduce the R factors by relaxing the NCS restraints or to build different CDR conformations in different monomers were unsuccessful.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statistics for NbHuL6FGLW, NbBcII10, and h-NbBcII10FGLANbHuL6FGLWNbBcII10h-NbBcII10FGLASpace groupP61P21212P21212Unit cella = b = 63.67 Åa = 76.72 Åa = 75.59 Åc = 119.51 Åb = 174.71 Åb = 70.75 Åc = 115.53 Åc = 50.37 ÅResolution (highest resolution shell)20.0-1.85 (1.92-1.85) Å20.0-2.9 (3.0-2.9)50.0-1.95 (2.02-1.95)Data collection temperature100 K100 K100 KNumber of measured reflections107,299 (10208)238,144 (23075)129,288 (13187)Number of unique reflections23,285 (2320)34,579 (3402)20,171 (1998)Completeness (highest resolution shell)99.9 (99.9)%99.9 (100.0)%99.9 (100.0)I/σ (I) (highest resolution shell)14.3 (3.6)11.4 (2.7)9.99 (2.3)Rmerge (highest resolution shell)0.069 (0.402)0.127 (0.485)0.196 (0.607)R-factor (highest resolution shell)0.211 (0.283)0.245 (0.331)0.215 (0.237)Rfree-factor (highest resolution shell)0.255 (0.335)0.305 (0.492)0.252 (0.265)Ramachandran plotCore region87.5%82.5%87.7%Additional allowed12.0%16.9%12.3%Generously allowed0.5%0.6%0.0%Disallowed0.0%0.0%0.0%r.m.s.d.Bond lengths0.0058 Å0.0075 Å0.0058 ÅBond angles1.325°1.523°1.37°pdb entry3EBA3DWT3EAK Open table in a new tab X-ray data for the maximally humanized mutant of NbBcII10 (h-NbBcII10FGLA, pdb entry 3EAK) were collected at beamline BW7A of the DESY synchrotron, Hamburg, to a resolution of 1.85 Å and processed as for the wild-type data. The same starting model was used for molecular replacement and refinement as for the wild-type NbBcII10 structure to minimize bias. Refinement was carried out using the same protocol as for the wild-type NbBcII10, except that no NCS restraints were applied. The same protocol was also applied to the partly humanized NbHul6 complex (NbHul6FGLW, pdb entry 3EBA), for which the data were also collected on beamline BW7A. The wild-type NbHuL6:HuL complex (pdb entry 1OP9) was used as the starting model for molecular replacement and refinement. All details of data collection and refinement are presented in Table 1. Humanizing the Framework-2 Region of Nanobodies—Two Nanobodies, NbHuL6 and NbBcII10, with specificity for human lysozyme (HuL) and the β-lactamase BcII of Bacillus cereus, respectively, have been selected to determine the involvement of the VHH hallmark amino acid residues in framework-2 on expression yield, affinity, and stability. The NbHuL6 was chosen for this study because of its potential therapeutic relevance, because it stabilizes an unstable human lysozyme mutant that forms fibrils and amyloids (35Dumoulin M. Last A.M. Desmyter A. Decanniere K. Canet D. Larsson G. Spencer A. Archer D.B. Sasse J. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Redfield C. Matagne A. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. Nature.. 2003; 424: 783-788Google Scholar). The high stability (50.9 kJ mol-1) of NbBcII10 (17Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Google Scholar) and the successful use of its framework to graft the antigen specificity loops from donor Nanobodies of the VHH subfamily-2 (18Saerens D. Pellis M. Loris R. Pardon E. Dumoulin M. Matagne A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Conrath K. J. Mol. Biol... 2005; 352: 597-607Google Scholar), makes it a logical candidate as universal Nanobody scaffold. The two Nanobodies were mutated by LDA-PCR at the framework-2 hallmark amino acid positions 42, 49, 50, and 52 to the amino acids occurring at those positions in human VH domains, i.e. Val42, Gly49, Leu50 and Trp52, [ImMunoGeneTics numbering (imgt.cines.fr)]. These mutants, referred to as NbHuL6VGLW and NbBcII10VGLW, respectively, were expressed in the periplasm of E. coli and purified by immobilized metal ion chromatography and gel filtration.

The amount of wild-type protein recovered after size-exclusion chromatography corresponded to 3 mg/liter of culture for NbHuL6 and NbBcII10. The expression yields of the framework-2 humanized proteins were lower: 1 mg/liter of culture for NbHuL6VGLW and 1.8 mg/liter of culture for NbBcII10VGLW, probably due to the lower cell density attained after overnight growth or to cell lysis. Both mutant proteins are monomeric, as observed by size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). However, a delay in elution time from the column is noticed for both framework-2-humanized formats, suggesting nonspecific interaction of the humanized proteins with the gel matrix. This feature was also noted for isolated VH domains of conventional antibodies (13Conrath K. Vincke C. Stijlemans B. Schymkowitz J. Decanniere K. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Loris R. J. Mol.

Positively acting transcription factors and negatively acting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling control stomatal development in Arabidopsis ; however, it is not known how the opposing activities of these regulators are integrated. We found that a unique domain in a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) stomatal initiating factor, SPEECHLESS, renders it a MAPK phosphorylation target in vitro and modulates its function in vivo. MAPK cascades modulate a diverse set of activities including development, cell proliferation, and response to external stresses. The coupling of MAPK signaling to SPEECHLESS activity provides cell type specificity for MAPK output while allowing the integration of multiple developmental and environmental signals into the production and spacing of stomata."
https://openalex.org/W2039171339,"The Myc oncogene regulates the expression of several components of the protein synthetic machinery, including ribosomal proteins, initiation factors of translation, RNA polymerase III and ribosomal DNA. Whether and how increasing the cellular protein synthesis capacity affects the multistep process leading to cancer remains to be addressed. Here we use ribosomal protein heterozygote mice as a genetic tool to restore increased protein synthesis in Emu-Myc/+ transgenic mice to normal levels, and show that the oncogenic potential of Myc in this context is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate that the ability of Myc to increase protein synthesis directly augments cell size and is sufficient to accelerate cell cycle progression independently of known cell cycle targets transcriptionally regulated by Myc. In addition, when protein synthesis is restored to normal levels, Myc-overexpressing precancerous cells are more efficiently eliminated by programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a new mechanism that links increases in general protein synthesis rates downstream of an oncogenic signal to a specific molecular impairment in the modality of translation initiation used to regulate the expression of selective messenger RNAs. We show that an aberrant increase in cap-dependent translation downstream of Myc hyperactivation specifically impairs the translational switch to internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent translation that is required for accurate mitotic progression. Failure of this translational switch results in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous IRES-dependent form of Cdk11 (also known as Cdc2l and PITSLRE), which leads to cytokinesis defects and is associated with increased centrosome numbers and genome instability in Emu-Myc/+ mice. When accurate translational control is re-established in Emu-Myc/+ mice, genome instability is suppressed. Our findings demonstrate how perturbations in translational control provide a highly specific outcome for gene expression, genome stability and cancer initiation that have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer formation at the post-genomic level."

Metagenomic analysis of flow cytometry–sorted cells shows that unicellular N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria in “group A” (UCYN-A) lack genes for the oxygen-evolving photosystem II and for carbon fixation, which has implications for oceanic carbon and nitrogen cycling and raises questions regarding the evolution of photosynthesis and N 2 fixation on Earth."

Although lymphocytic-choriomeningitis-virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are essential for disease, their mechanism of action is not known. To gain insights into disease pathogenesis, we observed the dynamics of immune cells in the meninges by two-photon microscopy. Here we report visualization of motile CTLs and massive secondary recruitment of pathogenic monocytes and neutrophils that were required for vascular leakage and acute lethality. CTLs expressed multiple chemoattractants capable of recruiting myelomonocytic cells. We conclude that a CD8(+) T-cell-dependent disorder can proceed in the absence of direct T-cell effector mechanisms and rely instead on CTL-recruited myelomonocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2158535651,"Motor adaptation is usually defined as the process by which our nervous system produces accurate movements while the properties of our bodies and our environment continuously change. Many experimental and theoretical studies have characterized this process by assuming that the nervous system uses internal models to compensate for motor errors. Here we extend these approaches and construct a probabilistic model that not only compensates for motor errors but estimates the sources of these errors. These estimates dictate how the nervous system should generalize. For example, estimated changes of limb properties will affect movements across the workspace but not movements with the other limb. We provide evidence that many movement-generalization phenomena emerge from a strategy by which the nervous system estimates the sources of our motor errors."
https://openalex.org/W1978194271,"Discovery of efficient catalysts is one of the most compelling objectives of modern chemistry. Chiral catalysts are in particularly high demand, as they facilitate synthesis of enantiomerically enriched small molecules that are critical to developments in medicine, biology and materials science. Especially noteworthy are catalysts that promote-with otherwise inaccessible efficiency and selectivity levels-reactions demonstrated to be of great utility in chemical synthesis. Here we report a class of chiral catalysts that initiate alkene metathesis with very high efficiency and enantioselectivity. Such attributes arise from structural fluxionality of the chiral catalysts and the central role that enhanced electronic factors have in the catalytic cycle. The new catalysts have a stereogenic metal centre and carry only monodentate ligands; the molybdenum-based complexes are prepared stereoselectively by a ligand exchange process involving an enantiomerically pure aryloxide, a class of ligands scarcely used in enantioselective catalysis. We demonstrate the application of the new catalysts in an enantioselective synthesis of the Aspidosperma alkaloid, quebrachamine, through an alkene metathesis reaction that cannot be promoted by any of the previously reported chiral catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W2059959576,"Pentraxins are a family of ancient innate immune mediators conserved throughout evolution. The classical pentraxins include serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein, which are two of the acute-phase proteins synthesized in response to infection. Both recognize microbial pathogens and activate the classical complement pathway through C1q (refs 3 and 4). More recently, members of the pentraxin family were found to interact with cell-surface Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaR) and activate leukocyte-mediated phagocytosis. Here we describe the structural mechanism for pentraxin's binding to FcgammaR and its functional activation of FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. The complex structure between human SAP and FcgammaRIIa reveals a diagonally bound receptor on each SAP pentamer with both D1 and D2 domains of the receptor contacting the ridge helices from two SAP subunits. The 1:1 stoichiometry between SAP and FcgammaRIIa infers the requirement for multivalent pathogen binding for receptor aggregation. Mutational and binding studies show that pentraxins are diverse in their binding specificity for FcgammaR isoforms but conserved in their recognition structure. The shared binding site for SAP and IgG results in competition for FcgammaR binding and the inhibition of immune-complex-mediated phagocytosis by soluble pentraxins. These results establish antibody-like functions for pentraxins in the FcgammaR pathway, suggest an evolutionary overlap between the innate and adaptive immune systems, and have new therapeutic implications for autoimmune diseases."

To determine the molecular basis of such transfers, we analyzed a natural polymorphism for flower-head development in Senecio. We show that the polymorphism arose by introgression of a cluster of regulatory genes, the RAY locus, from the diploid species S. squalidus into the tetraploid S. vulgaris. The RAY genes are expressed in the peripheral regions of the inflorescence meristem, where they promote flower asymmetry and lead to an increase in the rate of outcrossing. Our results highlight how key morphological and ecological traits controlled by regulatory genes may be gained, lost, and regained during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1987549963,"Tauopathies are sporadic and genetic neurodegenerative diseases characterized by aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Tau pathology occurs in over 20 phenotypically distinct neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia. The molecular basis of this diversity among sporadic tauopathies is unknown, but distinct fibrillar wild-type (WT) Tau conformations could play a role. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and electron microscopy, we show that WT Tau fibrils and P301L/V337M Tau fibrils have distinct secondary structures, fragilities, and morphologies. Furthermore, P301L/V337M fibrillar seeds induce WT Tau monomer to form a novel fibrillar conformation, termed WT*, that is maintained over multiple seeding reactions. WT* has secondary structure, fragility, and morphology that are similar to P301L/V337M fibrils and distinct from WT fibrils. WT Tau is thus capable of conformational diversity that arises via templated conformation change, as has been described for amyloid beta, beta2-microglobulin, and prion proteins."

Functional annotation of the chromosome (1,114,206 base pairs) unveiled its ability to fix dinitrogen and recycle putative host nitrogen wastes for biosynthesis of diverse amino acids and cofactors, and import glucose and xylose as energy and carbon sources.

https://openalex.org/W2077728054,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial morphological event that occurs during the progression of epithelial tumors. EMT can be induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in some tumor cells. Here, we demonstrate the molecular mechanism whereby Snail, a key regulator of EMT, is induced by TGF-β in tumor cells. Snail induction by TGF-β was highly dependent on cooperation with active Ras signals, and silencing of Ras abolished Snail induction by TGF-β in pancreatic cancer Panc-1 cells. Transfection of constitutively active Ras into HeLa cells led to induction of Snail by TGF-β, while representative direct targets of TGF-β, including Smad7 and PAI-1, were not affected by Ras signaling. Using mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors or Smad3 or Smad2 mutants, we found that phosphorylation at the linker region of Smad2/3 was not required for the induction of Snail by TGF-β. Taken together, these findings indicate that Ras and TGF-β-Smad signaling selectively cooperate in the induction of Snail, which occurs in a Smad-dependent manner, but independently of phosphorylation at the linker region of R-Smads by Ras signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2093256171,"TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a key component of Toll-like receptor-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. In response to microbial components, TBK1 activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and cytokine expression. Here we show that TBK1 is a novel target of the gamma(1)34.5 protein, a virulence factor whose expression is regulated in a temporal fashion. Remarkably, the gamma(1)34.5 protein is required to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and the induction of antiviral genes in infected cells. When expressed in mammalian cells, the gamma(1)34.5 protein forms complexes with TBK1 and disrupts the interaction of TBK1 and IRF3, which prevents the induction of interferon and interferon-stimulated gene promoters. Down-regulation of TBK1 requires the amino-terminal domain. In addition, unlike wild type virus, a herpes simplex virus mutant lacking gamma(1)34.5 replicates efficiently in TBK1(-/-) cells but not in TBK1(+/+) cells. Addition of exogenous interferon restores the antiviral activity in both TBK1(-/-) and TBK(+/+) cells. Hence, control of TBK1-mediated cell signaling by the gamma(1)34.5 protein contributes to herpes simplex virus infection. These results reveal that TBK1 plays a pivotal role in limiting replication of a DNA virus."

Intracellular BH4 levels are regulated by the activity of the de novo biosynthetic pathway. Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH) catalyzes the formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP, and BH4 is generated by two further steps through 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase. GTPCH appears to be the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 biosynthesis, and overexpression of GTPCH is sufficient to augment BH4 levels in cultured endothelial cells (7Cai S. Khoo J. Channon K.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have shown that BH4 both stabilizes and donates electrons to the ferrous-dioxygen complex in the oxygenase domain, as the initiating step of l-arginine oxidation (8Vasquez-Vivar J.

However, this may be due to nonspecific scavenging of superoxide by high dose BH4 treatment. The mechanisms that relate BH4 availability to eNOS activity in vivo are not fully understood, and approaches to develop BH4 as a therapeutic target remain speculative unless a better understanding of the BH4-eNOS stoichiometric relationship can be gained. Indeed, no study has demonstrated that diminished BH4 availability is solely sufficient to induce eNOS uncoupling in vivo. Accordingly, we sought to address these questions by developing novel stably transfected cell lines with both doxycyline-regulated expression of human GCH cDNA and expression of eNOS-GFP fusion protein. Using these cells lines we investigated the role of intracellular BH4 availability in eNOS coupling and report that both intracellular eNOS:BH4 reaction stoichiometry with the intracellular BH4:BH2 ratio are key determinants of eNOS uncoupling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Cells with tet-regulatable GTPCH and eNOS Expression—We used NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts stably transfected with a tet-off transactivator construct. In the presence of doxycycline, binding of the transactivator is blocked, and gene expression is prevented. These initial 3T3-tet-off cells, previously shown to express neither eNOS nor GTPCH (20Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Robbins P.D. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11771-11775Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and also confirmed to be devoid of neuronal NOS, inducible NOS, and eNOS protein as tested by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S1), were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding hemagglutinin (HA) antigen-tagged-human GCH1 under the control of a tetracycline-responsive element, as shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Individual colonies were isolated and analyzed for GCH1 expression and a cell line, termed “GCH cells,” was established from expansion of a single colony. GCH cells were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding a human eNOS-eGFP fusion protein (21McDonald D.M. Alp N.J. Channon K.M. Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 14: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Clones were picked that expressed either low (GCH/eNOS-LOW) or high (GCH/eNOS-HIGH) levels. All of the cell lines underwent three rounds of clonal selection.Cell Culture—The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine (2 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Additionally GCH cells were maintained using media containing the antibiotics hygromycin (200 μg/ml) and genetecin (200 μg/ml), whereas eNOS-eGFP cell media also included puromycin (2 μg/ml). Where appropriate, doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was added to cell culture media to abolish transcription of GCH1 mRNA.Biopterin Quantification by HPLC with Electrochemical Detection—BH4, BH2, and biopterin levels in cell lysates were determined by HPLC followed by electrochemical and fluorescent detection, as described previously (22Heales S. Hyland K. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 494: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown to confluency and harvested by trypsinization. Sample pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (50 mmol/liter), pH 7.4, containing dithioerythritol (1 mmol/liter) and EDTA (100 μmol/liter) and subjected to three free-thaw cycles. Following centrifugation (15 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C), the samples were transferred to new, cooled microtubes and precipitated with cold phosphoric acid (1 mol/liter), trichloroacetic acid (2 mol/liter), and dithioerythritol (1 mmol/liter). The samples were vigorously mixed and then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C. The samples were injected onto an isocratic HPLC system and quantified using sequential electrochemical (Coulochem III, ESA Inc.) and fluorescence (Jasco) detection. HPLC separation was performed using a 250 mm, ACE C-18 column (Hichrom) and mobile phase comprising of sodium acetate (50 mmol/liter), citric acid (5 mmol/liter), EDTA (48 μmol/liter), and dithioerythritol (160 μmol/liter) (pH 5.2) (all ultrapure electrochemical HPLC grade) at a flow rate of 1.3 ml/min. Background currents of +500 μA and -50 μA were used for the detection of BH4 on electrochemical cells E1 and E2, respectively. 7,8-BH2 and biopterin were measured using a Jasco FP2020 fluorescence detector. Quantification of BH4, BH2, and biopterin was done by comparison with authentic external standards and normalized to sample protein content.GTPCH Activity Assay—GTPCH activity was assessed by HPLC, as described previously (23Werner-Felmayer G. Gross S.S. Feelish M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 271-299Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Cells were suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter Na2EDTA, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4), including a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Western blotting was carried out using standard techniques and anti-eNOS, -inducible NOS, -neuronal NOS (BD Transduction Laboratories), -HA, -DHFR, -SOD, and -GAPDH antibodies. The rabbit anti-rat GTPCH antibody was kindly provided by Prof. Steven S. Gross of Weill Medical College of Cornell University.Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Reverse transcription was carried out using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) on 1 μg of total cell RNA obtained by TRIzol extraction. Quantitative PCR was performed with an iCycler IQ real time detection system (Bio-Rad) with primers and probes from the gene expression assays system as supplied by Applied Biosystems.Measurement of eNOS Protein Levels by eGFP Fluorescence—Cell pellets were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing dithioerythritol (1 mmol/liter) and EDTA (100 μmol/liter) as for BH4 analysis. Sample fluorescence was quantified using a TEKAN fluorescence plate reader and a standard curve generated using recombinant eGFP. Because recombinant eNOS was expressed as an eNOS-eGFP fusion protein, eGFP fluorescence and eNOS levels were directly proportional. Importantly, determination of both eGFP fluorescence and BH4 levels was done on identical cell samples, allowing accurate determination of the BH4:eNOS ratio.Quantification of Superoxide Production by HPLC—Measurement of 2-hydroxyethidium formation by HPLC was used to quantify superoxide production, by methods adapted from those described previously (24Zhao H. Joseph J. Fales H.M. Sokoloski E.A. Levine R.L. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5727-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 25Fink B. Laude K. McCann L. Doughan A. Harrison D.G. Dikalov S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C895-C902Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in Krebs-Hepes buffer in the presence or absence of l-NAME (100 μmol/liter). After 1 h, dihydroethidium (25 μmol/liter) was added, and the cells were then incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested by scraping, centrifuged, and lysed in ice-cold methanol. Hydrochloric acid (100 mmol/liter) was added (1:1 v/v) prior to loading into the autosampler for analysis. All of the samples were stored in darkened tubes and protected from light at all times. Separation of dihydroethidium, 2-hydroxyethidium, and ethidium was performed using a gradient HPLC system (Jasco) with an ODS3 reverse phase column (250 mm, 4.5 mm; Hichrom) and quantified using a fluorescence detector set at 510 nm (excitation) and 595 nm (emission). A linear gradient was applied from Mobile phase A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to Mobile phase biopterin (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 23 min (30–50% acetonitrile).Nitrite and Nitrate Determination—Following preincubation for 1 h in the presence or absence of l-monomethylarginine (100 μmol/liter) in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (consisting of 120 mmol/liter NaCl, 4.7 mmol/liter KCl, 1.2 mmol/liter MgSO4, 1.2 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 25 mmol/liter NaHCO3, and 5.5 mmol/liter glucose), the cells were exposed to A23187 (1 μmol/liter) for 30 min. Total nitrite and nitrate accumulation was measured using the CLD88 NO analyzer (Ecophysics).Analysis of NO Synthesis by eNOS—Cellular NO synthesis by eNOS was assessed by measuring the conversion of 14C l-arginine to citrulline with HPLC detection, in the presence and absence of N-monomethyl-L-arginine, as described previously (26de Bono J. Warrick N. Bendall J. Channon K.M. Alp N. Nitric Oxide. 2007; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Accumulation of 3-NT by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Intracellular accumulation of 3-NT as an indicator of peroxynitrite production was done using a specific 3-NT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Millipore) as in the manufacturer's instructions.GCH Knockdown by RNA Interference—GCH-specific, ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon Thermo Scientific. The siRNAs were used as a pool of four specific siRNA duplexes with the following sequences: Duplex 1, GGUAGAAUGCUAAGUACGU; Duplex 2, CGAGAAGUGUGGCUACGUA; Duplex 3, GAGAAGGGAGAAUCGCUUU; and Duplex 4, AGUAGUGAUUGAAGCGACA. sEnd.1 endothelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine (2 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). 24 h prior to transfection, the cells were seeded into 6-well plates. The cells were then transfected with GCH-specific siRNA (100 nmol/liter), GAPDH-positive (100 nmol/liter) or nonspecific pooled duplex negative control siRNA (100 nmol/liter). The cells were cultured for 72 h, and gene silencing was detected by analysis of GTPCH protein expression by Western blotting using GTPCH-specific antibodies.Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. The data were subjected to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine distribution. Groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data or the Student's t test for parametric data. When comparing multiple groups data were analyzed by analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post test for parametric data or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post test for nonparametric data. Correlation testing was performed using the Pearson test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSCharacterization of Doxycycline-induced BH4 Deficiency—We first investigated the response of the stably transfected cell lines to doxycycline exposure. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed maximal inhibition of GCH1 mRNA production following 3 h of doxycycline exposure (Fig. 1A) and confirmed that GCH1 transgene expression was equal in GCH and GCH/eNOS cells (Fig. 1B). Quantification of intracellular GTPCH activity by HPLC revealed greater than 98.5% inhibition following doxycycline exposure of GCH, GCH/eNOS-LOW, and GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells (Fig. 1C). Immunoblotting showed abundant eNOS protein in GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells, comparable with sEnd.1 endothelial cells and 5-fold greater than GCH/eNOS-LOW cells, whereas GCH cells expressed no detectable eNOS protein. Using anti-HA and anti-human GCH antibodies, transgenic GCH protein was undetectable following incubation with doxycycline for 10 days. Murine GCH protein was detected only in sEnd.1 murine endothelial cells, as expected (Fig. 1D). To determine whether doxycycline exposure induced compensatory or confounding alterations in anti-oxidant enzymes that might alter measurements of superoxide, we measured the protein levels of relevant enzymes by immunoblotting. Importantly, we observed that neither eNOS expression nor treatment of cells with doxycycline induced changes in the levels of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and dihydrofolate reductase (Fig. 1E). Cellular levels of both GTPCH and eNOS protein in the presence and absence of doxycycline was confirmed by immunocytochemistry with fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). eNOS-eGFP fluorescence was observed in GCH/eNOS, but not in GCH cells. eNOS-eGFP fluorescence appeared to be localized to the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus, and fluorescence intensity was markedly increased in GCH/eNOS-HIGH versus GCH/eNOS-LOW cells, consistent with the results from immunoblotting. Interestingly, eNOS-eGFP localization in GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells appeared to be localized in the cytoplasm as well as to the Golgi and plasma membrane. Similar anti-HA immunoreactivity, detecting GTPCH protein, was demonstrated in GCH, GCH/eNOS-LOW, and GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells, and this was no longer detectable following incubation with doxycycline. Doxycycline exposure had no effect on eNOS-GFP fluorescence among all cell types.FIGURE 2Immunostaining and eNOS-GFP fluorescence. Immunostaining for human GCH and eNOS-GFP protein expression. HA-immunoreactive GCH cells (red) counterstained with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue) in the absence and presence of doxycycline following 10 days of treatment. eNOS-GFP levels were assessed by fluorescence microscopy (green). Representative images are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate the effects of reduced GTPCH activity on biopterin generation, we compared BH4 levels in GCH and GCH/eNOS cells with and without exposure to doxycycline. Intracellular BH4 levels were markedly suppressed following 3 days of treatment with doxycycline (p < 0.001) and remained suppressed thereafter (Fig. 3A). To assess the oxidative state of BH4-deficient cells, we quantified the BH4 oxidation product, BH2. A 3-fold increase in BH2 levels was observed in GCH/eNOS-LOW, compared with GCH cells in the presence of doxycycline (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the ratio of reduced to oxidized biopterins (BH4:BH2+B) was markedly diminished (p < 0.05), suggesting increased BH4 oxidation in eNOS-expressing cells in conditions of BH4 deficiency (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3Analysis of intracellular biopterin levels. Production and relative redox state of intracellular biopterins were assessed by HPLC with electrochemical detection. A, time course of BH4 production following exposure of GCH cells to doxycycline. The cells were cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) and harvested at specific time points between 0.5 h and 7 days. BH4 production was significantly attenuated following 2 days of treatment with doxycycline and was totally abolished after 3 days (*, p < 0.001). B, effect of doxycycline on the relative oxidative state of intracellular biopterins following treatment of GCH and GCH/eNOS-LOW cells for 10 days. Marked accumulation of BH2 and oxidation of BH4 was observed following doxycycline-induced BH4 deficiency (*, p < 0.05, n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)eNOS-BH4 Interaction Stoichiometry—The stably transfected doxycycline-responsive GCH/eNOS cells enable manipulation of the intracellular eNOS:BH4 ratio and, hence, alteration of the BH4 saturation state of eNOS protein. We compared cell lines with four different eNOS:BH4 ratios, as shown in Table 1. Treatment of GCH/eNOS-LOW cells with doxycycline changed the eNOS:BH4 ratio from 0.17 ± 0.02 to 2.36 ± 0.21 (p < 0.001). In GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells, doxycycline altered the eNOS:BH4 ratio from 1.18 ± 0.18 to 7.10 ± 2.17 (p < 0.01). We now compared the eNOS:BH4 stoichiometry obtained in these conditions with eNOS enzymatic function by determination of NO versus superoxide generation.TABLE 1Relative ratios of eNOS/BH4 and BH4/eNOS in each of our three experimental cell linesDoxycyclineeNOS/BH4BH4/eNOSGCH/eNOS-LOW–0.17 ± 0.026.08 ± 0.82+2.36 ± 0.210.43 ± 0.04GCH/eNOS-HIGH–1.18 ± 0.180.86 ± 0.15+7.10 ± 2.170.15 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab eNOS Enzymatic Activity: Nitric Oxide and Superoxide Generation—To investigate whether the reduced BH4:eNOS ratio led to enzymatic uncoupling of eNOS, we measured superoxide production by the quantification of 2-hydroxyethidium fluorescence formed following exposure of cells to dihydroethidium. Low level superoxide production was detected in all cell types. Interestingly, a modest decrease in BH4 levels induced by doxyxycline was sufficient to increase superoxide production from GCH cells lacking eNOS (Fig. 4A). Importantly, this was not observed in control cells that do not contain tetracycline-regulated GCH expression, therefore suggesting that BH4 plays a general antioxidant role in our model. eNOS-dependent superoxide production, determined by co-incubation with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME, was markedly elevated from GCH/eNOS-LOW and was further exacerbated in GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells in the presence of doxycycline, suggesting eNOS uncoupling (p < 0.01). Moreover, l-NAME inhibitable 2-hydroxyethidium fluorescence (indicative of eNOS-derived superoxide production) positively correlated with increased ratios of eNOS:BH4 and the formation of BH2. By comparing NOS-dependent superoxide generation with the eNOS:BH4 stoichiometry, we observed that superoxide generation is initiated from eNOS when the eNOS:BH4 ratio exceeds one (Fig. 4C). 3-Nitrotyrosine accumulation, indicative of peroxynitrite formation, is shown to be significantly increased in GCH/eNOS-LOW and GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells in the presence of doxycycline, indicating increased oxidative stress in BH4-deficient cells consistent with eNOS uncoupling (Fig. 4D).FIGURE 4Quantification of superoxide production by 2-hydroxyethidium fluorescence HPLC. Following exposure to doxycycline (10 days), the cells were exposed to dihydroethidium (25 μmol/liter) for 20 min, and accumulation of 2-hydroxyethidium was measured by HPLC with fluorescence detection. A, superoxide production was significantly elevated in GCH cells following doxycycline treatment alone (*, p < 0.01). Further elevation was observed in GCH/eNOS-LOW and GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells (*, p < 0.05), which was inhibitable by the addition of l-NAME (100 μmol/liter; †, p < 0.05) (n = 5/6). B, superoxide production from control, 3T3-tet cells, lacking tetracycline-regulatable GCH protein, remained unchanged following exposure to doxycycline in the presence or absence of l-NAME (100 μmol/liter). C, a significant correlation of l-NAME inhibitable superoxide production and eNOS:BH4 ratio is observed (**, p < 0.01). D, 3-nitrotyrosine accumulation, indicative of peroxynitrite formation is elevated in GCH/eNOS-LOW and GCH/eNOS-HIGH cells in the presence of doxycycline as shown by 3-NT-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (*, p < 0.01, n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W2038870603,"We present a model to estimate intracellular force variations from live-cell images of actin filament (F-actin) flow during protrusion-retraction cycles of epithelial cells in a wound healing response. To establish a mechanistic relationship between force development and cytoskelal dynamics, force fluctuations were correlated with fluctuations in F-actin turnover, flow and F-actin-vinculin coupling. Our analyses suggest that force transmission at focal adhesions requires binding of vinculin to F-actin and integrin (indirectly), which is modulated at the vinculin-integrin but not the vinculin-F-actin interface. Force transmission at focal adhesions is colocalized in space and synchronized in time with transient increases in the boundary force at the cell edge. Surprisingly, the maxima in adhesion and boundary forces lag behind maximal edge advancement by about 40 s. Maximal F-actin assembly was observed about 20 s after maximal edge advancement. On the basis of these findings, we propose that protrusion events are limited by membrane tension and that the characteristic duration of a protrusion cycle is determined by the efficiency in reinforcing F-actin assembly and adhesion formation as tension increases."
https://openalex.org/W2007856267,"Chromosomal organization is sufficiently evolutionarily stable that large syntenic blocks of genes can be recognized even between species as distantly related as mammals and puffer fish (450 million years (Myr) of divergence). In Diptera, the gene content of the X chromosome and the autosomes is well conserved: in Drosophila more than 95% of the genes have remained on the same chromosome arm in the 12 sequenced species (63 Myr of divergence, traversing 400 Myr of evolution), and the same linkage groups are clearly recognizable in mosquito genomes (260 Myr of divergence). Here we investigate the conservation of Y-linked gene content among the 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We found that only a quarter of the Drosophila melanogaster Y-linked genes (3 out of 12) are Y-linked in all sequenced species, and that most of them (7 out of 12) were acquired less than 63 Myr ago. Hence, whereas the organization of other Drosophila chromosomes traces back to the common ancestor with mosquitoes, the gene content of the D. melanogaster Y chromosome is much younger. Gene losses are known to have an important role in the evolution of Y chromosomes, and we indeed found two such cases. However, the rate of gene gain in the Drosophila Y chromosomes investigated is 10.9 times higher than the rate of gene loss (95% confidence interval: 2.3-52.5), indicating a clear tendency of the Y chromosomes to increase in gene content. In contrast with the mammalian Y chromosome, gene gains have a prominent role in the evolution of the Drosophila Y chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2071500241,"A prominent feature of thalamocortical circuitry in sensory systems is the extensive and highly organized feedback projection from the cortex to the thalamic neurons that provide stimulus-specific input to the cortex. In lightly sedated rats, we found that focal enhancement of motor cortex activity facilitated sensory-evoked responses of topographically aligned neurons in primary somatosensory cortex, including antidromically identified corticothalamic cells; similar effects were observed in ventral posterior medial thalamus (VPm). In behaving rats, thalamic responses were normally smaller during whisking but larger when signal transmission in brainstem trigeminal nuclei was bypassed or altered. During voluntary movement, sensory activity may be globally suppressed in the brainstem, whereas signaling by cortically facilitated VPm neurons is simultaneously enhanced relative to other VPm neurons receiving no such facilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2067801310,"The integrin α6β4 is associated with carcinoma progression by contributing to apoptosis resistance, invasion, and metastasis, due in part to the activation of select transcription factors. To identify genes regulated by the α6β4 integrin, we compared gene expression profiles of MDA-MB-435 cells that stably express integrin α6β4 (MDA/β4) and vector-only-transfected cells (MDA/mock) using Affymetrix GeneChip® analysis. Our results show that integrin α6β4 altered the expression of 538 genes (p < 0.01). Of these genes, 36 are associated with pathways implicated in cell motility and metastasis, including S100A4/metastasin. S100A4 expression correlated well with integrin α6β4 expression in established cell lines. Suppression of S100A4 by small interference RNA resulted in a reduced capacity of α6β4-expressing cells to invade a reconstituted basement membrane in response to lysophosphatidic acid. Using small interference RNA, promoter analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that S100A4 is regulated by NFAT5, thus identifying the first target of NFAT5 in cancer. In addition, several genes that are known to be regulated by DNA methylation were up-regulated dramatically by integrin α6β4 expression, including S100A4, FST, PDLIM4, CAPG, and Nkx2.2. Notably, inhibition of DNA methyltransferases stimulated expression of these genes in cells lacking the α6β4 integrin, whereas demethylase inhibitors suppressed expression in α6β4 integrin-expressing cells. Alterations in DNA methylation were confirmed by bisulfate sequencing, thus suggesting that integrin α6β4 signaling can lead to the demethylation of select promoters. In summary, our data suggest that integrin α6β4 confers a motile and invasive phenotype to breast carcinoma cells by regulating proinvasive and prometastatic gene expression.

In summary, our data suggest that integrin α6β4 confers a motile and invasive phenotype to breast carcinoma cells by regulating proinvasive and prometastatic gene expression. Integrins are receptors for the extracellular matrix, which have two major functions. The first is an adhesive function that secures cells to the surrounding extracellular matrix or, in the case of cell motility, provides traction for locomotion. Their second function is to transduce signals that are essential for cells to sense and integrate cues from the extracellular matrix, which include signals for directed cell motility, anchorage-dependent survival, and growth (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). As a result, integrin signaling and function are critical for most biological events in higher eukaryotes, both under normal and pathological conditions. In recent years, one integrin species, the α6β4 integrin, has garnered much attention for its ability to promote an invasive and metastatic phenotype in carcinomas. In cells of epithelial origin, the integrin α6β4 nucleates the formation of hemidesmosomes that link the cytokeratin cytoskeleton to the laminins found in the basement membrane, which are essential for epithelial integrity (2Borradori L.

Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Increased expression of the α6β4 integrin is a poor prognostic factor for breast cancer (5Tagliabue E. Ghirelli C.

Tumor invasion can be controlled by a number of factors. A growing list of these factors converge on the α6β4 integrin to mediate an invasive phenotype, including androgen independence (16Bonaccorsi L. Carloni V. Muratori M. Adriana S. Giannini A.

Dissecting the signaling pathways enhanced by α6β4 has revealed that the α6β4 integrin promotes the signaling from several proinvasive molecules (21Lipscomb E.A. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2005; 24: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of particular interest here is the observation that the α6β4 integrin can affect gene transcription through the activation of proinvasive transcription factors, such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) (22Jauliac S.

To determine the effect of integrin α6β4 on gene expression, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip® analysis on MDA-MB-435 clones that stably express the α6β4 integrin and compared these cells to vector-only-transfected clones. We find that several hundred genes are regulated by integrin α6β4 by more than 2-fold (99% confidence level). Of these genes, autotaxin/ENPP2 (25Chen M. O'Connor K.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5125-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and S100A4/metastasin, genes associated with breast cancer metastasis, are highly up-regulated. Here, we examine how the α6β4 integrin controls the expression of S100A4 and how this regulation extends to other genes. Cell Lines, Immunoblotting, and Reagents—MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells that were stably transfected with vector only (MDA/mock, clones 6D2 and 6D7) or the integrin β4 subunit cDNA (MDA/β4, clones 5B3 and 3A7) were obtained from Arthur M. Mercurio (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worchester, MA) (10Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H.-F. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar); MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 cells from Janet Price (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX); and all other breast cancer cell lines from ATCC. Cells were cultured as described previously (12O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Chen M. Towers L.N. O'Connor K.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C1927-C1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For all studies, cells were given fresh growth medium the day prior to harvest and harvested at 70% confluence. For stable knockdown of β4 integrin expression, cells were stably transfected with pLKO.1-puro lentiviral constructs (Sigma) containing one of two short hairpin RNAs targeting β4 (number 4, CCGGGAGGGTGTCATCACCATTGAACTCGAGTTCAATGGTGATGACACCCTCTTTTTG; number 5, CCGGCGAGGTCACATGGTGGGCTTTCTCG AGAAAGCCCACCATGTGACCTCGTTTTTG) or a control sequence (number 2, CCGGCCCATGAAGAAAGTGCTGGTTCTCGAGAACCAGCACTTTCTTCATGGGTTTTTG). For DNA methylation studies, cells were treated with 0.1 or 1 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) or 80 μm S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in fresh medium daily, as noted. Tricostatin A (1 μm) treatment was given 24 h before harvest. For protein analysis, cells were harvested using radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 15 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Total protein was then electrophoresed on a gel with the appropriate percentage of acrylamide (SDS-PAGE, reducing conditions), transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, and probed with the indicated antibody. Stripping solution (Pierce) was utilized to clear antibodies for reprobing membranes. Antibodies used in this study are myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS; catalog number sc-6454; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), CAPG (capping protein G; Genway; catalog number A22527), Elmo (catalog number sc20965; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), integrin β4 clone 439-9B (Chemicon-Millipore), integrin α6 clone GoH3 (Chemicon-Millipore), NFAT1 (catalog number sc-7296; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NFAT5 (catalog number PA1-023; Affinity Bio-Reagents), and S100A4 (27Li Z.H. Bresnick A.R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5173-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Actin (catalog number A5441; Sigma) was used as a loading control. RNA Isolation and Affymetrix GeneChip Analysis—For routine quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis, RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), purity was confirmed by OD 260:280 ratio, and RNA was analyzed using 0.7% agarose with formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. For GeneChip analysis, the RNAqueous kit from Ambion was used for RNA purification. Gene profiling was performed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A and -B oligonucleotide arrays. Final statistical analyses are reported only on the U133A chip. Bioinformatic Processing of Affymetrix GeneChip Data—The results from the Affymetrix GeneChip arrays were processed using the statistical package S-PLUS® Array Analyzer (Insightful Corp., Seattle, WA) (S-PLUS). Expression of each gene was determined by first converting the raw probe level intensities to expression summaries by correcting overall background and probe-specific background prior to normalization. Normalization was performed using G-C content Robust Multichip Analysis, as published previously (28Bao X. Sinha M. Liu T. Hong C. Luxon B.A. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Virology. 2008; 374: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Differential expression testing was determined using the local pooled error test, a statistical test designed for low replicates (three to five replicates), to determine genes differentially expressed to a 99% confidence level. Multitest comparison tests were then performed using both the Benjamin and Hochberg and the more stringent Bonferroni methods of filtering out false positives. Q-PCR—cDNA was prepared using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) prior to Q-PCR analysis. Expression of various genes was then assessed using ABI70000 sequence detector, reagents, and commercially available probes, as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The expression level of each gene was normalized by 18 S RNA and reported as relative level. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS)—Suspended cells were treated with 1 μg of primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then analyzed on a FACS Canto analytical cell sorter (BD Biosciences). As a control, primary antibody was omitted. Data are reported as the -fold difference in mean fluorescence compared with secondary antibody alone control for that cell line. Invasion Assays—Matrigel (5 μg; BD Biosciences) was dried onto the upper side of Transwell chambers (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size; Corning Glass). One hour before the assay, Matrigel was rehydrated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the bottom surface was coated with 10 μg/ml laminin-1. 100 nm LPA or 50 ng/ml HGF in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/bovine serum albumin or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/bovine serum albumin was added to the lower chamber. Cells (5 × 104) were placed in the top chamber and allowed to invade for 4 h. Noninvading cells in the top chamber were removed using a cotton swab, and cells in the bottom chambers were fixed with methanol, stained with 1% crystal violet, and quantified visually. Values for triplicate membranes are reported as a mean ± S.D., as described previously (12O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Small Interference RNA Treatment—Cells from 70% confluent cultures were suspended by trypsinization and rinsed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells (3 × 106) were electroporated with 200 nm siRNAs specific for an individual target or a control (nontargeting) sequence (Dharmacon, Inc.), as reported previously (25Chen M. O'Connor K.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5125-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Individual sequences for NFAT5 are CAACAUGCCUGGAAUUCAAUU (sequence 3) and CAGAGUCAGUCCACAGUUUUU (sequence 5). Dharmacon SMARTPool siRNAs were used for all other targets. Cells were then kept in normal growth medium for 24–96 h and then assessed for target gene expression using Q-PCR and immunoblot analysis as indicated. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells under normal culturing conditions were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, which was then terminated with 0.125 m glycine. Nuclei were isolated, sonicated to fragment DNA (average length of 500–700 bp), and centrifuged to pellet debris. Extracts were incubated with 1 μg of control rabbit IgG or anti-NFAT5 rabbit polyclonal Ab and protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. Washed immunoprecipitates were digested with proteinase K, followed by a 65 °C incubation to reverse the cross-linking. DNA was then purified and assessed for the S100A4 promoter using PCR and the following primers: GAGATCCAGATGTGAGATTC (+208/+227) and GGGTTGGAAGAGAAGCTGCA (+565/+584). Bisulfate Sequencing—Identification of methylated CpG residues was determined by bisulfate conversion and pyrosequencing of the first intron region of the S100A4 promoter (+203 to +662; accession number Z33457). This procedure was performed by EpigenDx. NFAT and AP-1 are transcription factors that can promote tumor invasion that are known to signal downstream from the α6β4 integrin (15Guo W. Pylayeva Y.

Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). However, the extent of the changes in gene transcription and what genes are altered as a result of integrin α6β4 signaling have not been established. We hypothesized that the α6β4 integrin can regulate the expression of genes that can promote a motile and invasive phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip® analysis on MDA-MB-435 clones that were mock-transfected (MDA/mock, clones 6D2 and 6D7) or stably transfected with the β4 integrin (MDA/β4, clones 3A7 and 5B3). Two sets of RNA were prepared for each clone on separate occasions and processed for Affymetrix GeneChip® analysis (n = 4 for each condition, +α6β4 or –α6β4). The results were then processed using the statistical package S-Plus Array Analyzer (S-PLUS), as published previously (28Bao X. Sinha M. Liu T. Hong C. Luxon B.A. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Virology. 2008; 374: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Differential expression testing was determined using the local pooled error test, a statistical test designed for low replicates (three to five replicates), to determine genes differentially expressed to a 99% confidence level. Multitest comparison tests were performed using both the Benjamin and Hochberg and Bonferroni methods of filtering out false positives. Concentrating on the data from the Affymetrix HG-U133A chip, we found that 538 genes are regulated by integrin α6β4 expression using the local pooled error t test with Benjamin and Hochberg corrections and 239 genes using the Bonferroni corrections. A partial list of these genes is found in Table 1, with the full list of genes located in Tables S1 and S2.TABLE 1Genes regulated by the expression of the α6β4 integrin in MDA-MB-435 cellsFunctionNumberUp-regulatedDown-regulatedMotility36SFRP1, MARCKS, ENPP2, CAPG, FST, PTPRZ1, PDLIM4, S100A4, ARHGEF3, CHL1, KIF5C, MYH10, CTGF, FSCN1, SEMA3A, PTPN22, ELMO1, NRCAM, EDG2, HMGCRMYLK, FOS, MAP1B, ADM, IL8, S100A2, EGR1, FGF13, RAC2, LIF, GADD45A, ITGB1BP1, FOSL1, SDC1, Cortactin, CYR61Apoptosis56SFRP1, CRYAB, FST, PEG10, S100A4, MAP2K6, DMD, HDAC4, GPR37, DNAJB6, RAD51C, CHL1, SATB1, QKI, IVNS1ABP, CTGF, TXNIP, TPD52L1, SEMA3A, SGCD, NRCAM, PRKD1, HELLS, EDG2, CFDP1, PTGER4BCL2A1, CSNK1E, GADD45B, CCND1, RIPK2, SPP1, BCL6, FOS, MYLK, TGFBI, TNFAIP3, MAP1B, ADM, IL8, FN1, EGR1, MMP1, THBS1, RAC2, LIF, GADD45A, FOSL1, CARD10, NGFRAP1, IGFBP7, DKK1, UCP2, CEBPD, CYR61, IL7RTranscription regulation10SOX4, NKX2-2, HDAC4, TCFL5, CSRP2, TRIM9, MEF2CFOS, FOSL1, CEBPDExtracellular matrix, cell adhesion, cytoskeleton32CHRDL1, SPARCL1, DSG2, COL9A3, DMD, HAPLN1, HS3ST3A1, TUBB6, COL6A2, CHL1, ANK2, COL1A2, CALD1, FSCN1, TUBB4, ITGA10, NRCAM, COL5A2, CDH19MUC1, TNC, EVL, MCAM, FN1, THBS1, RAC2, TUBA1, SDC1, CDC42EP1, MYL9, COL13A1, CYR61Proteases, inhibitors9ADAMTS1, PRSS11, MMP14, CAPN3, CTSBMMP1, PRSS7, SERPINB1, SERPINA3Metabolism29TYRP1, MAOA, BCHE, DCT, ENO2, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, ASPA, GALNT11, ALDH1A1, TDG, EPHX1, LOXL2, AGPAT5, TNKS, CA8, NMT2, MRPS6, SLC5A3, ATP5I, MTUS1ASNS, KYNU, PDE2A, GLUL, GSTT2, WARS, NNMTOther signaling molecules17PHACTR1, EPHA3, PRKCBP1, PTPLA, BMP1, FZD7, SKP2AKAP2, SHB, RAB27A, PPM2C, IL1RAP, KCNS3, KDELR3, DUSP5, P2RX5, KCTD14Antigen presentation8HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4Protein stability8CRYAB, DNAJB6, DNAJC12, USP9X, HSPA1AUBE2H, SMURF2, TMAP1 Open table in a new tab We identified several classes of genes that are altered by expression of the α6β4 integrin, including extracellular matrix and cell adhesion, transcription, metabolism, antigen presentation, and protein stability, including several ubiquitin ligases. The integrin α6β4 has been well documented to promote tumor cell invasion and survival. Accordingly, genes governing these processes represent the major classes of genes that are altered by integrin α6β4 expression. These include 36 genes reported to affect cell motility and 56 genes that control apoptosis and cell survival, such as the down-regulation of the death matrix CYR61 (Table 1). Here, we chose the genes associated with cell motility, invasion, and metastasis for further investigation. As shown in Fig. 1, we validated changes in expression for several of the genes regulated by integrin α6β4 by Q-PCR and/or immunoblot analysis. A comparison of the -fold differences from the Q-PCR results with those computed from the Affymetrix/Ingenuity pathway analysis (Table S3) shows that the data from the GeneChips are in close agreement with our Q-PCR and immunoblot results, although very high inductions are generally underrepresented in the GeneChip analyses. Of those genes, the most highly up-regulated are S100A4, PTPRZ1, PDLIM4, CAPG, and FST (follistatin). S100A4, also known as fibroblast-specific protein or metastasin, is a metastasis-associated protein documented to promote the metastatic process in several types of cancer, including breast, gastric, pancreatic, and thyroid cancers (29Garrett S.C. Varney K.M. Weber D.J. Bresnick A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, S100A4 expression in the β4-expressing cells is over 140-fold higher than nonexpressers, as determined by Q-PCR. This overexpression extends to both increased intracellular and extracellular protein levels. To determine if S100A4 expression correlated with integrin α6β4, we assessed various breast carcinoma cell lines for S100A4 by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A) and the cell surface expression of the β4 integrin by FACS (Fig. 2B). Notably, expression of S100A4 is found in all cell lines that express the α6β4 integrin with the exception of MCF7 cells. Of these cells, MCF7 is the only cell line that does not display a mesenchymal phenotype. Interestingly, some cell lines showed higher molecular weight bands that run at a molecular mass equivalent to a trimer (∼35 kDa) or tetramer (∼47 kDa) of S100A4. To confirm conclusively that these bands are specific for S100A4, we electroporated BT-20 cells with siRNA specific for S100A4 or a nontargeting control prior to immunoblot analysis for S100A4. As shown in Fig. 2B, the S100A4 siRNA effectively reduced the expression of the higher molecular weight bands, thus confirming that these bands represent S100A4. Therefore, these data demonstrate that expression of S100A4 correlates well with expression of integrin α6β4. Next we sought to determine whether S100A4 contributes to the invasive phenotype mediated by the α6β4 integrin. For these experiments, we utilized MDA-MB-231, which are highly invasive breast carcinoma cells that have been previously shown to utilize the α6β4 integrin for chemoinvasion. S100A4 expression was suppressed using specific siRNAs, and the chemoinvasion of treated cells to nontargeting or untreated cells was compared. LPA and HGF, two chemoattractants that cooperate with the α6β4 integrin (12O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 32287-32293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), were used as chemoattractants. The loss of S100A4 expression (Fig. 3A) reduced the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells toward LPA by ∼70% compared with untreated or nontargeting siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with HGF (data not shown). These data indicate that S100A4 is important for tumor cell invasion, an activity that can predispose cells for metastasis. Although the biochemical mechanisms governing how S100A4 contributes to an invasive and metastatic phenotype are becoming clear (27Li Z.H. Bresnick A.R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5173-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 29Garrett S.C. Varney K.M. Weber D.J. Bresnick A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), how S100A4 expression is regulated on the transcriptional level is poorly understood. Using bioinformatic analysis of the promoter region, we find that the S100A4 promoter contains multiple NFAT consensus binding sites. Since NFAT is known to function downstream of the α6β4 integrin, we tested the potential role of NFAT1 and NFAT5 in the regulation of S100A4 expression using specific siRNAs to target their down-regulation in the MDA/β4 transfectants. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, effective silencing of NFAT5, but not NFAT1, by specific siRNAs reduced S100A4 expression in the MDA/β4 cells. The reduction in S100A4 expression due to loss of NFAT5 was confirmed using two individual siRNAs to target NFAT5 (Fig. 4, C and D). Of note, reduction of NFAT1 expression with the siRNA used here was shown previously to reduce autotaxin expression (25Chen M. O'Connor K.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5125-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, we find that PTPRZ1, but not Nkx2.2, is also an NFAT5 target gene (data not shown). To verify the results with the MDA/β4 cells, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells, which endogenously express the α6β4 integrin, with siRNA targeting NFAT1, NFAT5, or a nontargeting siRNA. Previous studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-231 cells exhibit α6β4 integrin-dependent migration and invasion (13Lipscomb E.A. Dugan A.S. Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2003; 20: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a process facilitated by NFAT molecules (22Jauliac S. Lopex-Rodriguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We find that S100A4 expression is reduced by siRNA targeting of NFAT5 in the MDA-MB-231 cells but not by targeting NFAT1 using both Q-PCR (Fig. 5A) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5B). These data were confirmed using single duplexes targeting NFAT5 as performed with the MDA/β4 cells (Fig. 5C). To confirm the role of integrin α6β4 in mediating S100A4 expression, we"

The bioactivity of chemerin is post-translationally regulated; the attractant circulates in blood in a relatively inactive form (prochemerin) and is activated by carboxyl-terminal proteolytic cleavage. We discovered that plasma carboxypeptidase N (CPN) and B (CPB or activated thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor, TAFIa) enhanced the bioactivity of 10-mer chemerin peptide NH2-YFPGQFAFSK-COOH by removing the carboxyl-terminal lysine (K). Sequential cleavages of either a prochemerin peptide (NH2-YFPGQFAFSKALPRS-COOH) or recombinant full-length prochemerin by plasmin and CPN/CPB substantially increased their chemotactic activities. Endogenous CPN present in circulating plasma enhanced the activity of plasmin-cleaved prochemerin. In addition, we discovered that platelets store chemerin protein and release it upon stimulation. Thus circulating CPN/CPB and platelets may potentially contribute to regulating the bioactivity of leukocyte chemoattractant chemerin, and further extend the molecular link between blood coagulation/fibrinolysis and CMKLR1-mediated immune responses.

In their capacity as antigen-presenting cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages can influence the activation of many other cell types, including monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells, B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells; thus chemerin appears to be an important chemoattractant in both innate and adaptive immune responses (2Zabel B.A. Silverio A.M.

Of interest, staphopain B, a cysteine protease secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, also cleaves prochemerin and converts it into a potent chemoattractant (9Kulig P. Zabel B.A. Dubin G. Allen S.J.

Interestingly, the cleavage sites in the labile carboxyl terminus (NH2-YFPGQFAFSKALPRS-COOH) are not conserved, and the cleavage products generated by chemerin-activating proteases display different potencies in bioactivity assays. Based on synthetic peptides, the 9-mer NH2-YFPGQFAFS-COOH is the most active, but it is still not as active as intact cleaved chemerin protein, indicating that the amino-terminal part of chemerin is required for maximal activity (4Zabel B.A. Ohyama T.

Plasma carboxypeptidases CPN and CPB cleave the basic amino acids arginine or lysine from the carboxyl terminus of proteins or peptides such as bradykinin and complement proteins C3a and C5a. CPN is a constitutively active zinc metalloprotease present in plasma at a concentration of about 100 nm and is considered the major anaphylatoxins inhibitor (11Matthews K.W. Mueller-Ortiz S.L. Wetsel R.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), generating inactive “desArg” forms of C3a and C5a. In contrast, CPB exists in plasma as a proenzyme, proCPB, or thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) at a concentration of about 50 nm and is activated by thrombin in complex with thrombomodulin on the vascular endothelial surface. CPB inhibits fibrin degradation by removing carboxyl-terminal lysines from partially digested fibrin, which prevents further incorporation of fibrinolytic plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (12Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 2534-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 13Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol.

We have shown that CPB also has broad substrate reactivity and is able to cleave and inactivate bradykinin, C3a, C5a, and thrombin-cleaved osteopontin (15Myles T. Nishimura T. Yun T.H. Leung L.L.K.

CPN and CPB may play complementary roles, with the former being constitutively active and capable of regulating systemic anaphylatoxins, and the latter activated locally at sites of vascular injury to provide site-specific anti-inflammatory control. Peptidases can also modulate the biological activity of certain chemokines (4Zabel B.A. Ohyama T. Zuniga L. Kim J.Y. Johnston B. Allen S.J. Guido D.G. Handel T.M. Butcher E.C. Exp. Hematol. 2006; 34: 1021-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For example, dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP-IV/CD26), a serine protease, inactivates CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL12 by cleaving these chemokines in the amino terminus (18Hildebrandt M. Schabath R.

Platelet degranulation products, particularly the leukocyte chemoattractants, which include CXCL4 (platelet factor 4), β-thromboglobulin, CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (monocyte chemotactic protein 3), and CXCL12 (stromal-derived factor 1), may contribute to host defense and also play a role in pathophysiologic conditions (20Boehlen F. Clemetson K.J. Transfus. Med. 2001; 11: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Brandt E. Ludwig A. Petersen F. Flad H.D. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 177: 204-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For example, platelet factor 4 forms complexes with heparin in blood or some glycosaminoglycans on platelet surfaces to form the major antigen implicated in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (22Warkentin T.E.

Apher. 2007; 22: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Platelets not only store CXCL12 but also express its receptor CXCR4, a coreceptor for cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, suggesting that platelets may be involved in host defense (24Clemetson K.J. Clemetson J.M. Proudfoot A.E. Power C.A. Baggiolini M. Wells T.N. Blood. 2000; 96: 4046-4054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we found that plasma CPN or CPB can function in concert with plasmin to elicit and augment the chemotactic activity of prochemerin. Furthermore, we show that platelets could store and release partially active chemerin upon activation. Thus circulating CPN/CPB and platelets may contribute to regulating the bioactivity of leukocyte chemoattractant chemerin and further extend the molecular link between blood coagulation/fibrinolysis and CMKLR1-mediated immune responses. Materials—Recombinant human chemerin21–157, polyclonal goat anti-human chemerin antibodies, and biotinylated polyclonal goat anti-human antibodies were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Peptides 9-mer, YFPGQFAFS (chemerin149–157); 10-mer, YFPGQFAFSK (chemerin149–158); and 15-mer, YFPGQFAFSKALPRS (chemerin149–163) were synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals (Hayward, CA). Human plasmin and α-thrombin were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). dl-2-Mercaptomethyl-3 guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (MGTA) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Collagen and ADP were from Chrono-log (Havertown, PA). Human plasma-derived CPB (TAFIa) and a CPB activity kit were from American Diagnostica (Stamford, CT). Thrombin receptor-activating peptide (SFLLRN peptide), d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK), heparin-agarose, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Human soluble thrombomodulin and recombinant CPN were kind gifts from Drs. John Moser and Mariko Nagashima (Berlex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). Hep3B and MEG-01 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Preparation of Recombinant Prochemerin—Recombinant prochemerin was purified as previously published (8Zabel B.A. Allen S.J. Kulig P. Allen J.A. Cichy J. Handel T.M. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34661-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, prochemerin with a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag was cloned into pACGP67 (BD Biosciences) and transfected into Sf-9 cells. The mature prochemerin protein has the amino acid sequence NH2-ADPELTEAQ...FAFSKALPRSPHHHHHH-COOH, where the underlined residues are not native. After viral amplification, prochemerin was expressed by adding high titer virus to shaker flasks containing Hi-5 insect cells in Ex-cell 420 medium (JRH Biosciences). After incubation for 2–3 days at 27.5 °C, the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation, filtered to 0.22 μm, and concentrated at 4 °C using a tangential flow concentrator with a 3-kDa cut-off filter (Filtron). Prochemerin was purified by nickel-Sepharose affinity chromatography (American Biosciences) and C-18 reverse phase HPLC (Vydac). The protein was lyophilized and checked for purity using electrospray mass spectrometry. Tissue Culture—Murine pre-B lymphoma L1.2 cells were stably transfected with human CMKLR1 or empty vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). In Vitro Transwell Chemotaxis Assay—24-well plates with 5-μm pore size Transwell inserts (Costar) were used for the chemotaxis assays. 200 μl of cells (106 cells/ml) in 0.3% bovine serum albumin/Hank's solution were added to the top well, and test samples were added to the bottom well in 500 μl of solution. The cells that migrated to the lower chamber after 3 h at 37 °C were counted by flow cytometry, and the results are reported as cells/ml in the lower chamber. Preparation of Platelet-rich Plasma, Platelet-poor Plasma, Washed Platelets, and Platelet Lysates—Blood was drawn into tubes containing 3.8% sodium citrate (9:1 v/v) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared following standard procedure (25Du X.Y. Clemetson J.M. Navdaev A. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35124-35132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Platelet-poor plasma was prepared by spinning the PRP at 1200 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The platelets were washed with PIPES buffer (25 mm PIPES, 137 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, and 0.1% glucose) at pH 6.4 as previously described (25Du X.Y. Clemetson J.M. Navdaev A. Magnenat E.M. Wells T.N. Clemetson K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35124-35132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Platelet lysates were obtained by lysing washed platelets with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (Upstate, NY) with protease inhibitors. The mixture was spun at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant protein concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from human washed platelets and Hep3B and MEG-01 cells by using TRIzol reagent. Total RNA (∼1 μg) was converted to cDNAs using the oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen). The specific primers used for cloning a 229-bp chemerin fragment were GAAGAAACCCGAGTGCAAAG (forward) and CTTGGAGAAGGCGAACTGTC (reverse) (the annealing temperature was 57 °C, 35 cycles). HPLC Analysis of Chemerin Peptides Cleavage—To evaluate the efficiency of synthetic chemerin 10-mer cleavage by CPN or CPB, 50 μl of 10-mer (1 μm) was treated with either CPN or CPB (30 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a Waters C18 (4.6 × 150 mm) column and separated with a 0–35% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) by HPLC. For 15-mer cleavage, 15-mer (1 μm) was incubated with plasmin (1 μm) at 37° for 30 min; the reaction was then terminated by PPACK (serine protease inhibitor) (10 μm). CPN or CPB (30 nm) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. 40 μl of each reaction mixture (15-mer, 15-mer plus plasmin, 15-mer plus plasmin and CPN/CPB) was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC as described above. Kinetic Analysis of Hydrolysis of 10-mer Chemerin Peptides by CPB and CPN—Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to determine the Km and kcat for the hydrolysis of 10-mer peptide (YFPGQFAFSK) by CPB and CPN. The concentrations of 10-mer peptides ranged from 20 to 320 μm and were digested with 50 nm CPB or 5 nm CPN for 5 min at 37 °C in assay buffer. The reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min. Cleaved peptide was resolved by HPLC, and the nmol of peptide generated was determined from the peak area of cleaved peptide. The values for Km and kcat were determined by plotting the initial velocities of cleavage against the different substrate concentrations and then fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis as previously described (15Myles T. Nishimura T. Yun T.H. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51059-51067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in duplicate, and the data were pooled for analysis. CPB Activity Assays—100 μl of CPN (10 nm) and CPB (15 nm) were added to a 96-well plate in the presence or absence of MGTA at the indicated concentrations. 50 μl of chromogenic CPB (TAFIa) substrate was used in each well as described in the Actichrome CPB kit. Activated CPB (TAFIa) ranging from 0.125 to 2 μg/ml was used to construct the standard curve. All of the tests were performed in duplicate. The plate was placed in an ELISA plate reader at 37 °C with constant mixing, and the absorbance at 420 nm was read 30 min after sample addition. Development of Sandwich ELISA for Chemerin—Polyclonal goat anti-human chemerin antibodies were used to coat 96-well plates at a concentration of 4 μg/ml. Biotinylated polyclonal goat anti-human chemerin antibodies (0.2 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin was used to detect bound chemerin protein. The lower limit of detection of chemerin in this assay was ∼0.5 ng/ml. For the determination of chemerin levels in plasma, the samples were diluted 10-fold before assay. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed by the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Core Facility. Statistical Analyses—The data are expressed as the means ± S.D., and statistical evaluation was performed using Student's t test. Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05 (*) or 0.005 (**). CPN and CPB Up-regulate Chemerin 10-mer Activity by Removing the Carboxyl-terminal Lysine Residue—The synthetic 9-mer chemerin peptide YFPGQFAFS (chemerin149–157) induced substantial, dose-dependent migration of human CMKLR1-L1.2 transfectants (Fig. 1A) with a peak response occurring at 10–100 nm. Empty vector transfected controls did not migrate to the 9-mer (data not shown), The 10-mer peptide YFPGQFAFSK (chemerin149–158) did not induce any significant CMKLR1-dependent chemotaxis even at 10 μm concentration (Fig. 1A). Treatment of the 10-mer peptide with CPN or CPB, however, substantially enhanced the chemotactic activity of the peptide (Fig. 1B). CPN and CPB alone (tested at 100 nm) did not induce CMKLR1/L1.2 transfectant migration (Fig. 1B). We analyzed the mixtures of 10-mer treated with either CPN or CPB by HPLC and found that the 10-mer/CPN mixture had a major peak with a retention time of 28.25 min, which is almost identical to that of the purified 9-mer (28.26 min), and different from the 10-mer (25.90 min). For the 10-mer treated with CPB, we detected two major fractions corresponding to the 10-mer (25.90 min) and 9-mer (28.28 min) (Fig. 1C). The efficiency of 10-mer cleavage by CPB at 30 nm was about 60%, likely because CPB is thermolabile under the experimental conditions used. In this work, CPN was also used at 30 nm to compare with CPB enzymatic activity. Of note, the plasma levels of proCPB and CPN are ∼50 and 100 nm, respectively (11Matthews K.W. Mueller-Ortiz S.L. Wetsel R.A. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14Ceresa E. Van de Borne K. Peeters M. Lijnen H.R. Declerck P.J. Gils A. J. Biol.

Determination of the Kinetic Parameters for the Hydrolysis of 10-mer Peptide (Chemerin149–158) by CPB and CPN—The hydrolysis of chemerin149–158 by CPB gave estimates for Km (122.8 ± 6.4 μm), kcat (2.7 ± 0.1 s–1), and kcat/Km (2.2 × 104 m–1 s–1) (Table 1). The concentrations of chemerin149–158 ranged from 20 to 320 μm, and chemerin was digested with 50 nm CPB. The kcat/Km for chemerin cleavage was about 10-fold less efficient compared with bradykinin and C5a66–74, C3a69–77 but comparable with fibrinopeptide γ-Lys77–85. Meanwhile, the kcat/Km of 10-mer cleavage by CPN is 4.7 × 105 m–1 s–1, which is about 20-fold faster than CPB, and is about 20-fold faster than bradykinin and C5a peptide but similar to that of C3a peptide.TABLE 1Hydrolysis of chemerin 10-mer peptides by CPB and CPNSubstrateEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1m-1 s-1ChemerinCPB122.8 ± 6.42.7 ± 0.12.2 × 104BradykininCPB70.6 ± 4.819.7 ± 4.82.8 × 105C5a66-74CPB219.0 ± 16.229.5 ± 0.71.3 × 105C3a69-77CPB35.9 ± 6.68.4 ± 0.62.3 × 105FBα-Arg96-104CPB361.4 ± 69.21.5 ± 0.14.2 × 103FBβ-Lys125-133CPB14.3 ± 0.713.6 ± 0.29.5 × 105FBγ-Lys54-62CPB34.0 ± 4.12.6 ± 0.17.6 × 104FBγ-Lys77-85CPB238.9 ± 24.25.9 ± 0.32.5 × 104ChemerinCPN170.6 ± 27.280.35 ± 5.04.7 × 105BradykininCPN302.7 ± 29.19.1 ± 0.23.0 × 104C5a66-74CPN602.2 ± 74.39.3 ± 0.41.5 × 104C3a69-77CPN77.1 ± 11.257.9 ± 2.17.5 × 105FBα-Arg96-104CPN448.9 ± 43.82.9 ± 0.16.5 × 103FBβ-Lys125-133CPN53.2 ± 4.9109.1 ± 3.62.1 × 106FBγ-Lys54-62CPN657.6 ± 20.53.5 ± 0.15.3 × 103FBγ-Lys77-85CPN3727.0 ± 408.611.8 ± 0.83.2 × 103 Open table in a new tab Sequential Proteolysis of Prochemerin 15-mer Peptide by Plasmin and Carboxypeptidases Synergistically Enhances Bioactivity—The synthetic chemerin 15-mer peptide, YFPGQFAFSKALPRS (chemerin149–163) is chemotactically inert (Fig. 2A). Treatment of the 15-mer with CPN or CPB alone had no effect on chemerin bioactivity. However, sequential treatment of the 15-mer with plasmin and CPN or CPB dramatically enhanced its chemotactic activity. The proteolytic products were evaluated by HPLC to determine processing sites. Plasmin first cleaved the 15-mer (retention time, 29.96 min) to 10-mer (retention time: 25.3 min; the peak with the retention time at 12.4 min is the carboxyl-terminal plasmin-generated 5-mer). CPN or CPB then converted the 10-mer to the 9-mer (retention time, ∼27.6 min) (Fig. 2B). Sequential Proteolysis of Prochemerin by Plasmin and Carboxypeptidases Synergistically Enhances Bioactivity—We next asked whether sequential treatment of chemotactically inert concentrations of prochemerin by plasmin and CPN or CPB could activate the attractant and generate the NH2-YFPGQFAFS-COOH form. Plasmin alone cleaved prochemerin and increased its chemotactic bioactivity (Fig. 3A). Sequential treatment of prochemerin with plasmin and CPN or CPB, however, dramatically enhanced its chemotactic activity (Fig. 3B). The proteolytic products were evaluated by mass spectrometry to determine the processing sites (Fig. 3C). Plasmin first cleaved prochemerin (17730.12 Da) to the NH2-YFPGQFAFSK-COOH form (16301.13 Da), and then CPN or CPB removed the terminal lysine to generate a desLys form (16156.22/16156.36 Da) with enhanced activity. Prochemerin treated with CPN and CPB alone did not induce CMKLR1-mediated chemotaxis (data not shown). Endogenous Plasma CPN Is Critical for the Increased Activity of Plasmin-cleaved Prochemerin—Prochemerin was incubated with plasmin and then treated with PPACK to inhibit serine protease activity. Plasmin-treated prochemerin was added to normal platelet-poor plasma (PPP) as well as PPP treated with MGTA, a specific inhibitor for CPN but not CPB (Fig. 4A). Plasmin-cleaved prochemerin did not induce CMKLR1-mediated chemotaxis (Fig. 4B). Incubation with PPP, however, dramatically increased its bioactivity, which was inhibited by MGTA, indicating that endogenous plasma CPN is critical for activating low concentrations of plasmin-cleaved chemerin (Fig. 4B). Identification of Chemerin in Platelet—Platelets store various coagulation proteins as well as inflammatory factors. To determine whether platelets are also involved in chemerin expression, Western blot analysis and RT-PCR were performed. Chemerin was detected by Western blot in total platelet lysates, with a molecular mass of ∼16 kDa, similar to recombinant chemerin21–157 (Fig. 5A). Although platelets are anuclear, long lived mRNAs are present in the cytosol, including messages for certain chemokines (26Power C.A. Clemetson J.M. Clemetson K.J. Wells T.N. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We detected chemerin mRNA in platelets by RT-PCR. An expected 229-bp PCR product was amplified from cDNAs of platelets, as well as from Hep3B (hepatic carcinoma cell line) and MEG-01 (megakaryotic cell line) cells (Fig. 5B). Identity of the amplified chemerin PCR product was confirmed by direct sequencing. Platelets Release Chemerin upon Activation—As quantified by ELISA, the concentration of chemerin in PRP was 48 ± 1.1 ng/ml. The addition of thrombin (5 units/ml) to PRP increased the chemerin level to 78 ± 0.7 ng/ml (p < 0.005) (Fig. 6A). The addition of thrombin to PPP, on the other hand, had no effect on chemerin activities (Fig. 6B). Thrombin itself did not induce the chemotaxis of CMKLR1-transfected cells, and thrombin does not cleave and activate prochemein (8Zabel B.A. Allen S.J. Kulig P. Allen J.A. Cichy J. Handel T.M. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34661-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus we conclude that the increased chemerin bioactivity in thrombin-treated PRP was not due to proteolysis of circulating plasma prochemerin by thrombin but rather was dependent on the release of chemerin from platelets following thrombin activation. Furthermore, platelet-activating agonists such as thrombin receptor-activating peptide, collagen, and, to a lesser extent, ADP induced the release of chemerin from washed platelets (Fig. 6C), which corresponded with an increase in chemerin bioactivity as determined by CMKLR1 transfectant migration (Fig. 6D). We next investigated whether the chemerin released from activated platelets is a prochemerin form or an active isoform. The same amount of prochemerin and active chemerin21–157 were used as controls for platelet-derived chemerin (as quantified by ELISA) in transwell assays using CMKLR1/L1.2 transfectants. Chemerin activity released from activated platelets is higher than prochemerin but substantially less active than chemerin21–157 (Fig. 7A). The specific response of platelet-derived chemerin to CMKLR1 transfectants was confirmed in the chemotaxis assay using nontransfected cells as controls (Fig. 7B). This suggested that platelets might release chemerin in a partially active form, or platelet-derived chemerin is a mixture of different forms of chemerin, which probably could undergo further proteolysis to fully express its biological activities. With the addition of plasmin/CPB or plasmin/CPN to platelet releasates, no enhanced chemerin activities were observed, which is likely due to the presence of various plasmin inhibitors, including α2-antiplasmin, which is known to be released from activated platelets (27Plow E.F. Collen D. Blood. 1981; 58: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). When platelet-derived chemerins were partially purified by heparin-agarose chromatography as previously described (8Zabel B.A. Allen S.J. Kulig P. Allen J.A. Cichy J. Handel T.M. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34661-34666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), a significantly increased chemerin activity was detected after adding plasmin, plasmin/CPB, and plasmin/CPN (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, chemerin activity was also enhanced even in the presence of CPN or CPB alone (Fig. 7C), indicating that at least a portion of the chemerins released from activated platelets has been already cleaved to a form that is accessible to CPN or CPB cleavage. In this study, we report that plasma-derived CPN and CPB substantially up-regulated the bioactivity of plasmin-cleaved prochemerin via the removal of the carboxyl-terminal lysine residue, adding a novel mechanism to prochemerin processing and activation by proteases (Table 2). We demonstrated this in three different in vitro scenarios: 1) CPN and CPB removed the carboxyl-terminal lysine from a 10-mer chemerin peptide and converted it to a bioactive 9-mer; 2) plasmin cleaved prochemerin 15-mer to 10-mer, which was subsequently converted to the bioactive 9-mer by CPN or CPB; and 3) sequential proteolysis of recombinant prochemerin protein by plasmin followed by CPN or CPB generated a chemerin isoform with potent chemoattractant activity (carboxyl-terminal sequence NH2-YFPGQFAFS-COOH). These data show that CPN and CPB generate a highly active “desLys” form of plasmin-cleaved chemerin. Interestingly, we also found that platelets can regulate chemerin bioactivity by storing and releasing it upon stimulation. We have therefore identified additional circulating factors (Table 2) that contribute to the regulation of chemerin bioactivity and further link the processes of blood coagulation/fibrinolysis with mediators that regulate leukocyte migration.TABLE 2Prochemerin cleavages by various proteasesProteaseC-terminal sequenceAmino acid orderUnprocessed...YFPGQFAFSKALPRS21-163Plasmin/CPB...YFPGQFAFS21-157Plasmin/CPN...YFPGQFAFS21-157Plasmin...YFPGQFAFSK21-158Elastase...YFPGQFAFS21-157...YFPGQFA21-155...YFPG21-152Tryptase...YFPGQFAFSK21-158...YFPGQFA21-155Cathepsin G...YFPGQFAF21-156Staphopain B...YFPGQFAFS21-157FVIIaNDFXIIaND Open table in a new tab There is a growing appreciation for the role of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteases such as DPP-IV/CD26 and cathepsin G in regulating the activity of chemokines at the post-translational level (1Zabel B.A. Zuniga L.

These enzymes are particularly adept at modifying chemokines to dampen immune responses. For example, CCL7 is a physiological substrate of matrix metalloproteinase 2; matrix metalloproteinase 2-cleaved CCL7 acts as a general chemokine antagonist by binding to but not activating the CC-chemokine receptors-1, -2, and -3, thereby blocking leukocyte recruitment and dampening inflammation (28McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidases CPN and CPB are well known for their ability to inactivate a number of pro-inflammatory mediators including C5a, C3a, bradykinin, and thrombin-cleaved osteopontin (15Myles T.

Chem. 2008; 283: 17789-17796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the case of plasmin-cleaved prochemerin, CPN/CPB enhances, rather than diminishes, the chemotactic activity of the attractant under the current experimental conditions. Cells that are chemerin-responsive include plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages, leukocytes capable of functioning as “immune interpreters”; in the absence of “danger signals,” chemerin-recruited plasmacytoid dendritic cell and macrophages may play an immune suppressive role, dampening inflammation through interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor β secretion and regulating T cell responses. Thus CPN/CPB may serve to dampen inflammatory responses by inactivating anaphylatoxins and by recruiting immune suppressive CMKLR1-positive leukocytes to sites of sterile tissue injury. The regulation of chemerin bioactivity at a site of tissue injury in vivo appears to involve a complex interplay among many enzymatic components. In our study, plasmin at 1 μm efficiently cleaves prochemerin in vitro. Although this is a substantial concentration of plasmin, human platelets have well defined plasminogen binding sites, and these binding sites are further increased by ∼5-fold upon platelet activation (29Miles L.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4303-4311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Miles L.A. Ginsberg M.H. White J.G. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that thrombin stimulation specifically induces plasminogen activation that is mediated by endogenous urokinase-type plasminogen activator (31Lenich C. Liu J.N. Gurewich V. Blood. 1997; 90: 3579-3586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus given the substantial plasma concentration of plasminogen (∼2.2 μm), it is entirely plausible that prochemerin, upon release from activated platelets, will be efficiently cleaved to chemerin by plasmin generated locally at the site of vascular inflammation in vivo. Plasmin-cleaved prochemerin can be further activated by CPB and CPN. CPB is activated locally by endothelial cell bound thrombin/thrombomodulin and enhances the chemotactic activity of plasmin-cleaved prochemerin via removal of the carboxyl-terminal lysine. At the same time, CPB, in its role as a fibrinolysis inhibitor, blocks plasmin generation, which would diminish the initial activation of circulating prochemerin. Thus CPB may limit the extent of prochemerin activation but enhance the activity of the plasmin-cleaved chemerin that has already been formed. Our study provides further evidence that CPB functions not only as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, but also as a mediator of inflammatory responses. CPB may be important for local and specific action at sites of tissue damage, whereas constitutively active CPN may regulate its targets systemically. Platelets are critical in maintaining normal hemostasis (32Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Thromb. Res. 2004; 114: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Clemetson K.J. Clemetson J.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Activated platelets release granular proteins that include platelet agonists, adhesive proteins, and chemoattractants at the site of vascular injury, which may play a role in tissue inflammation and remodeling (34Du X.Y. Sim D.S. Lee W.H. Zhang Y. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2006; 36: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35von Hundelshausen P. Petersen F. Brandt E. Thromb.

In our study, we found that platelets store chemerin. Upon activation, platelets release a mixture of chemerin isoforms with different levels of bioactivity. Some of them would undergo further proteolysis to fully express its biological activity. Our future work will investigate the role of chemerin in platelet biology and tissue remodeling."

Specifically, nascent BACE1 is transiently acetylated in seven lysine residues clustered in a highly disordered region of the protein that faces the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER Golgi intermediate compartment (ER/ERGIC). The acetylation protects the nascent protein from degradation by PCSK9/NARC-1 in the ERGIC and allows it to reach the Golgi apparatus. Here we report the identification of two ER/ERGIC-based acetyltransferases, ATase1 and ATase2. Both proteins display acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity, can interact with and acetylate BACE1, and display an ER/ERGIC localization with the catalytic site facing the lumen of the organelle. Both ATase1 and ATase2 regulate the steady-state levels of BACE1 and the rate of amyloid β-peptide generation. Finally, their transcripts are up-regulated by ceramide treatment. In conclusion, our studies have identified two new enzymes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer disease.

The biochemical characterization of the above events could lead to the identification of novel pharmacological strategies for the prevention of this form of dementia. The efficiency of folding, conformational maturation, and molecular stability of nascent membrane and secretory proteins is greatly affected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, ER Golgi intermediate compartment; APP, amyloid precursor protein; BACE1, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1; AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; siRNA, short interfering RNA; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HAT, histone acetyltransferase. by post-translational events that modify, either temporally or definitively, the protein (1Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2003; 19: 649-676Google Scholar). One of the best characterized forms of transient modification is the attachment of a glucose residue to improperly folded nascent glycoproteins by the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (2Dempski Jr., R.E. Imperiali B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol.. 2002; 6: 844-850Google Scholar, 3Kleizen B. Braakman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.. 2004; 16: 343-349Google Scholar). This transient event regulates the interaction of the nascent protein with the chaperone calnexin and its ability to leave the early secretory pathway. The mechanism works in such a way that successfully folded proteins dissociate from the calnexin/calreticulin cycle and advance toward the Golgi apparatus, whereas misfolded intermediates are directed toward the ER-associated degradation system (1Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 2003; 19: 649-676Google Scholar, 4Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol.. 2005; 7: 766-772Google Scholar). We have recently reported the identification of a novel form of post-translational regulation of BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar), a membrane protein that acts as the rate-limiting enzyme in the generation of the Alzheimer disease amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Specifically, nascent BACE1 is transiently acetylated in seven lysine residues clustered in a highly disordered region of the protein that faces the lumen of the ER and ER Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). The lysine acetylation of nascent BACE1 regulates its ability to advance toward the Golgi apparatus, where a Golgi-based deacetylase removes the acetyl groups. Nonacetylated intermediates of the nascent protein are retained in the early secretory pathway and degraded by a mechanism that involves the serine protease PCSK9/NARC-1 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin-type 9/neural apoptosis-regulated convertase-1) (6Jonas M.C. Costantini C. Puglielli L. EMBO Rep.. 2008; 9: 916-922Google Scholar). The acetylation of nascent BACE1 in the lumen of the ER and/or ERGIC requires a membrane transporter that translocates acetyl-CoA, the donor of the acetyl group, from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the ER, and one or more ER/ERGIC-based acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferases (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). The acetylation/deacetylation process is tightly regulated by the lipid second messenger ceramide (5Costantini C.

EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 1997-2006Google Scholar, 10Puglielli L. Neurobiol. Aging.. 2008; 29: 795-811Google Scholar). Ceramide, the last output of the above pathway, regulates both efficiency of acetylation in the lumen of the ER/ERGIC and rate of deacetylation in the Golgi apparatus (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). As a result, the hyperactivation of ceramide signaling that occurs during normal aging (8Costantini C. Weindruch R. Della Valle G. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2005; 391: 59-67Google Scholar) or in progeroid-like animal models (9Costantini C. Scrable H. Puglielli L. EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 1997-2006Google Scholar) leads to increased acetylation and steady-state levels of BACE1 and to increased production of Aβ (8Costantini C. Weindruch R. Della Valle G. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2005; 391: 59-67Google Scholar, 9Costantini C. Scrable H. Puglielli L. EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 1997-2006Google Scholar). The relevance of the above events for AD neuropathology is stressed by the fact that aging is the single most important risk factor for late-onset AD and that AD patients have very high levels of ceramide in the brain, when compared with age-matched controls (reviewed in Ref. 10Puglielli L. Neurobiol. Aging.. 2008; 29: 795-811Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of two ER/ERGIC-based acetyltransferases, which we named ATase1 and ATase2. Both proteins display acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity in vitro and under native conditions can interact with and acetylate BACE1 in vitro and in vivo, and show an ER/ERGIC localization. They both regulate the steady-state levels of BACE1 and the generation of Aβ, and are up-regulated by ceramide treatment of cultured cells. The following experimental procedures, which have been extensively described in our previous work, are in the supplemental Methods: cell cultures and cell treatment; cell extraction, immunoprecipitation, and affinity purification; subcellular fractionation; Aβ determination; and siRNA treatment. cDNA, Antibodies, and Western Blot Analysis—The cDNA for ATase1 and ATase2 was obtained from Origene (catalog number SC311351 and catalog number SC108791, respectively). Western blotting was performed on a 4-12% BisTris SDS-PAGE system (NuPAGE; Invitrogen) as described (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem.

The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-BACE1 N-terminal (monoclonal, R&D Systems); anti-BACE1 C-terminal (polyclonal, Abcam); anti-acetylated lysine (monoclonal, Abcam; polyclonal, Cell Signaling); anti-calreticulin (ER marker; polyclonal, Abcam); anti-ERGIC-53 (ERGIC marker; polyclonal, Sigma); anti-syntaxin (Golgi marker; monoclonal, Abcam); anti-EEA1 (endosomal marker; monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-Myc (polyclonal, Sigma); anti-C99 (monoclonal, MBL); flotillin 2 (polyclonal; Cell Signaling); and anti-actin (polyclonal, Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a 1:6000 dilution. Binding was detected by chemiluminescence (LumiGLO kit; Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). In some cases, the bands corresponding to BACE1 were also validated with the BACE1-Cat1 antibody (generous gift from Dr. Robert Vassar (13Zhao J. Fu Y. Yasvoina M. Shao P. Hitt B. O'Connor T. Logan S. Maus E. Citron M. Berry R. Binder L. Vassar R. J. Neurosci.. 2007; 27: 3639-3649Google Scholar)). Pixel densities (for signal area) of scanned images were calculated with Adobe Photoshop; densitometry (for signal-density) was analyzed with the EpiChemi3 Darkroom™ (UVP Bioimaging Systems) using Labworks Image Acquisition and Analysis Software 4.5. Additionally, samples were also imaged and quantified using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). For infrared imaging, IRDye 680 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number 926-32221, LI-COR Biosciences) and IRDye 800CW conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (catalog number 926-32210, LI-COR Biosciences) were used instead of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For quantification, values were normalized to appropriate loading controls. Acetyl-CoA:Lysine Acetyltransferase Activity—For the analysis of the acetyltransferase activity, we employed affinity-purified BACE1 as acceptor of the acetyl group and [3H]acetyl-CoA as donor of the acetyl group. The acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferases (ATase1 and/or ATase2) were provided either as pure enzymes following affinity purification with the ProFound kit (see supplemental Methods) or as membrane extracts of stably transfected CHO cells. The reaction was performed in 150-200 μl of acetylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 20 μm acetyl-CoA) and let run for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold buffer and immediate immersion in ice; BACE1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti BACE1 N-terminal monoclonal antibody and then counted on a liquid scintillation counter. The experimental controls are described in the appropriate figure legends. Additionally, the acetyltransferase activity of affinity-purified ATase1 and ATase2 was assayed with commercially available colorimetric (catalog number K332-100, BioVision Inc.) and fluorescent kits (catalog number 10006515, Cayman Chemicals). The assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Real Time PCR—Total RNA from H4 (human neuroglioma) and SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) cells was extracted and purified using the RNeasy plus mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen) and then PCR-amplified. Primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: GAPDH, forward 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′, reverse 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′; ATase1, forward 5′-CGATTACTGAAGCTGCCTCGA-3′, reverse 5′-GGTTTTTTGGCAAGGAACCA-C-3′; and ATase2, forward 5′-TCCTTGCCAAAAAACCCTGG-3′, reverse 5′-ATGCCCACCACCTTCTCTTCA-3′. RNA quantification was performed by real time PCR in a ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were generated at 2 min at 52 °C and 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturations at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing, and synthesis (30 s at 61 °C and 30 s at 72 °C). ΔΔCt values (14Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego).. 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar) were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of GAPDH and were expressed as fold-change over control. The assay was repeated three times, with each assay containing triplicate reactions and with each assay including an independent amplification of the probes. Statistical Analysis—Results are always expressed as mean ± S.D. of the indicated number of determinations. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Student's t test comparison, using GraphPad InStat3 software. Statistical significance was reached at p < 0.05. Identification of ATase1 and ATase2 as Two Putative ER/ER-GIC Acetyl-CoA:Lysine Acetyltransferases—Our studies previously demonstrated the presence of acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity in the ER/ERGIC. They also demonstrated that the catalytic site of the putative ER/ERGIC-based acetyltransferase(s) faced the lumen of the organelle (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). To identify the corresponding gene(s), we searched in the human genome for proteins displaying structural similarities to the histone acetyltransferase catalytic domain. The search yielded 46 possible candidates, 2 of which were predicted to function in the ER/ERGIC. The candidates had unknown biochemical function and were initially named Camello-like 2 (accession number NM_016347; also called putative N-acetyltransferase 8B) and Camello-like 1 (accession number NM_003960; also called putative N-acetyltransferase 8). They appear to have orthologs in Xenopus laevis (15Popsueva A.E. Luchinskaya N.N. Ludwig A.V. Zinovjeva O.Y. Poteryaev D.A. Feigelman M.M. Ponomarev M.B. Berekelya L. Belyavsky A.V. Dev. Biol.. 2001; 234: 483-496Google Scholar) but not in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster. The biochemical activity of both proteins was explored, and based on the results reported here they were re-named acetyltransferase 1 (ATase1) and 2 (ATase2) to indicate their biochemical function rather than the domain organization. Both ATase1 and ATase2 have a high probability of being ER/ERGIC-resident proteins (k-NN prediction using the PSORT II software of the University of Tokyo, Japan and available on line) (16Horton P. Park K.J. Obayashi T. Fujita N. Harada H. Adams-Collier C.J. Nakai K. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2007; 35: W585-W587Google Scholar, 17Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci.. 1999; 24: 34-36Google Scholar). Alignment of the amino acid sequences of ATase1 and ATase2 reveals an 88% sequence identity between the two proteins (Fig. 1A); the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity plot (Fig. 1B) indicates the presence of one single hydrophobic segment, corresponding to the membrane-spanning domain. In both cases the putative catalytic site is situated in the C-terminal domain and is predicted to face the lumen of the ER/ERGIC. ATase1 Is an ER/ERGIC Resident Acetyl-CoA:Lysine Acetyltransferase—We initially targeted ATase1, which was cloned and inserted into a mammalian expression vector containing a Myc tag at the C terminus, to allow subcellular localization and affinity purification for the in vitro studies. Stable transfection in CHO cells yielded several colonies overexpressing ATase1 (Fig. 2A). Membrane extracts from nontransfected control and ATase1-expressing cells were analyzed in vitro for acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity. The assay was performed in the presence of affinity-purified BACE1, which served as acceptor of the acetyl group, and radiolabeled acetyl-CoA, which served as donor of the acetyl group. Fig. 2B shows that the expression of ATase1 increased the acetyltransferase activity recovered from membrane extracts by ∼2-fold. No activity was observed when the assay was performed in the absence of extracts (source of the enzymatic activity) or in the presence of extracts that had been boiled prior to the incubation (Fig. 2B). Subcellular fractionation studies indicated a predominant ERGIC localization that extended to ER, but not to Golgi, fractions (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with our previous localization of the ER/ERGIC-based acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of ATase1 overlaps with the compartments where the acetylation of nascent BACE1 occurs and the nonacetylated mutants of BACE1 are retained (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). In fact, we have previously demonstrated that the Lys-to-Ala (BACE1Ala) and the Lys-to-Arg (BACE1Arg) mutant forms of BACE1 cannot be acetylated in vivo and in vitro, are retained in the ER/ERGIC system, and rapidly degraded by a proteasome-independent system (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar, 6Jonas M.C. Costantini C. Puglielli L. EMBO Rep.. 2008; 9: 916-922Google Scholar). Next, we analyzed the acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity of the individual fractions from the gradient shown in Fig. 2C and found that the distribution pattern of ATase1 completely overlapped with the acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity (Fig. 2D). Finally, when compared with control (nontransfected) cells, ERGIC fractions from ATase1-expressing cells displayed increased (∼2-fold) acetyltransferase activity (Fig. 2E). The above results indicate that ATase1 is localized in the compartments where the acetylation of nascent BACE1 normally occurs. They also indicate that the overexpression of ATase1 results in increased acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity. However, they do not rule out the possibility that ATase1 is only a co-factor in the reaction of lysine acetylation. To address this issue, we used affinity-purified ATase1 (instead of membrane extracts) for the in vitro acetylation of BACE1. As control, we used BACE1Arg, which does not act as acceptor of the acetyl groups in vitro or in vivo (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that purified ATase1 was able to acetylate BACE1WT but not BACE1Arg proving that it is an acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase. The results obtained with BACE1Arg are particularly important because they indicate that ATase1 can only acetylate the lysine residues that are found acetylated under physiological conditions (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). Next, we incubated ATase1 with BACE1 in the presence of nonradiolabeled acetyl-CoA. Both BACE1 and ATase1 were purified by affinity chromatography prior to the incubation. BACE1 was then immunoprecipitated at the end of the reaction and analyzed by classical immunoblotting. In the absence of ATase1 only the immature form of BACE1 could be detected with an anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Fig. 3B, left panel,-ATase1, indicated by 1). However, incubation with ATase1 allowed detection of two additional bands corresponding to the fully mature and a biosynthetic intermediate form of BACE1 (Fig. 3B, left panel, +ATase1, indicated by 2 and 3). These results confirm those performed with radiolabeled acetyl-CoA (Fig. 3A) and clearly indicate that ATase1 can acetylate BACE1. The normal migration of the mature and biosynthetic intermediate forms of BACE1 is shown in the middle panel of Fig. 3B and in supplemental Fig. 1. The anti-acetylated lysine antibody also detected a lower band migrating with the predicted molecular mass of the cleaved ectodomain of BACE1 (Fig. 3B, left panel, indicated by *). The same band could be detected with an antibody against the N-terminal domain of BACE1 (data not shown) but not with antibodies raised against the C-terminal domain of BACE1 or the Myc tag (Fig. 3B, middle and right panels, indicated by *). The band was never observed immediately after purification of BACE1 and appeared only after the 6-h incubation required for the in vitro acetylation assay, suggesting that it corresponds to the cleaved N-terminal ectodomain of BACE1 and most likely results from in vitro autocatalytic cleavage, as described previously (18Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the anti-acetylated lysine antibody recognized a band of ∼28 kDa, which corresponds to ATase1 (Fig. 3B, left panel, +ATase1). In fact, the same band could be observed with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3B, right panel, +ATase1) but not with antibodies against the N-terminal (data not shown) or C-terminal domain (Fig. 3B, middle panel) of BACE1. Therefore, these results indicate that ATase1 can interact with BACE1 in vitro and can undergo acetylation in one or more lysine residues, most likely through an autocatalytic mechanism (discussed below). ATase2 Is an ER/ERGIC Resident Acetyl-CoA:Lysine Acetyltransferase—We next cloned ATase2 into a mammalian expression vector containing a Myc tag at the C terminus. This construct was used to generate cells stably expressing ATase2 and ATase1 + ATase2 (Fig. 4A). Similarly to ATase1, the expression of ATase2 alone increased (by ∼3-fold) the acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity recovered from total membrane extracts (Fig. 4B). In addition, the subcellular distribution of ATase2 (Fig. 4C), even though slightly different, appeared to overlap with ATase1 (Fig. 2C) and with the normal distribution of the acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity (Fig. 2D). Finally, ER/ERGIC fractions generated from ATase2-expressing cells displayed increased acetyltransferase activity, when compared with corresponding fractions from control nontransfected cells (Fig. 4D). As with ATase1-expressing cells (Fig. 2D), no activity was found in fractions corresponding to the Golgi apparatus (data not shown, see also Ref. 5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). When affinity-purified ATase2 was incubated with BACE1 and nonradiolabeled acetyl-CoA, we found a marked increase in the acetylation of both biosynthetic intermediates of BACE1 (Fig. 5A, left panel). Interestingly, the acetylation pattern produced by ATase2 seems somehow different from the one observed with ATase1 (compare Fig. 5A to Fig. 3B) suggesting potential differences in substrate recognition activities of the two enzymes. Similarly to ATase1, the immunoprecipitation of BACE1 resulted in the pulldown of ATase2, suggesting physical interaction, at least in vitro (Fig. 5A, right panel). However, in contrast to ATase1, we could not clearly resolve a band corresponding to ATase2 with an anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Fig. 5A, left panel). This occurred even though ATase2 could clearly be identified with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 5A, right panel). These results might indicate potential differences in the biochemical properties and functional regulation of ATase1 and ATase2 (discussed below). Finally, incubation of ATase2 with BACE1 and radiolabeled acetyl-CoA resulted in acetylation of BACE1WT but not BACE1Arg (Fig. 5B) proving that ATase2 can only acetylate the lysine residues that are found acetylated under physiological conditions (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). We next used a commercially available colorimetric assay that employs a recombinant peptide corresponding to the N-terminal tail of the histone protein, as acceptor of the acetyl group, and a highly concentrated nuclear histone acetyltransferase (HAT) preparation, as enzyme. The assay was partially modified to employ our affinity-purified ATases, instead of HAT, as source of the enzymatic activity. Fig. 5C shows that both ATase1 and ATase2 displayed robust acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity, which was in the same range of that observed with HAT. Finally, when ATase1 and ATase2 were included together in the assay, we detected a clear additive effect indicating that the two enzymes can act independently of each other, at least in vitro. It remains to be determined whether the additive effect is caused by their ability to target different lysine residues of the substrate-peptide or by the presence of excess substrate in the assay. The ability of ATase1 and ATase2 to acetylate an appropriate substrate was also confirmed by using a fluorescent assay that employs the histone H3-(5-23) peptide as acceptor and acetyl-CoA as donor (supplemental Fig. 2). Catalytic C-terminal Domain of ATase1 and ATase2 Faces the Lumen of the ER/ERGIC System—We have previously shown that the transient acetylation of the N-terminal and globular domain of nascent BACE1 occurs in the lumen of the ER/ERGIC system (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the acetyltransferase activity responsible for the lysine acetylation of the nascent protein was positioned in the luminal face of the secretory compartment (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar). The hydrophilic/hydrophobic plot (Fig. 1B) together with the apparent topology (using the MTOP prediction model (19Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Google Scholar)) of ATase1 and ATase2 predicts the C-terminal domain, which contains the acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase homology domain, to face the lumen of the ER/ERGIC system. We decided to assess whether this was indeed the case by assaying in vitro the acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity recovered from ERGIC vesicles of ATase1- or ATase2-expressing cells under two different experimental conditions as follows: in the presence or absence of mild concentrations (0.2-0.5%) of Triton X-100 (Fig. 6A). When prepared, vesicles are sealed and of the same membrane topographical orientation as in vivo (5Costantini C. Ko M.H. Jonas M.C. Puglielli L. Biochem. J.. 2007; 407: 383-395Google Scholar, 20Carey D.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1981; 256: 989-993Google Scholar, 21Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 12665-12669Google Scholar, 22Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 4474-4479Google Scholar). Therefore, under normal conditions (Fig. 6A, Sealed) the acetylation of affinity-purified BACE1 can occur only if the catalytic site of the enzyme (ATase1 or ATase2) is facing the outside/cytosolic face of the vesicles. Conversely, if the catalytic site of the enzyme resides in the luminal face of the vesicles, the reaction will only occur in the presence of mild concentrations of detergent, which will allow access of both the acceptor (purified BACE1) and donor (radiolabeled acetyl-CoA) to ATase1 or ATase2 (Fig. 6A, Opened). Fig. 6B clearly shows that the acetyltransferase activity of native ATase1 and ATase2 could only be observed in the presence of Triton X-100, indicating that the catalytic site is facing the lumen of the organelle in its native conditions. The activity recovered in the absence of Triton X-100 was in the normal range of latency (3-5%) observed with the glucose-6-phosphatase and sialyltransferase methods (see supplemental Methods). Next, we took advantage of the fact that both ATase1 and ATase2 have a Myc tag at the C terminus, which is predicted to face the lumen of the ER/ERGIC system. Therefore, the above vesicles were incubated with an anti-Myc antibody covalently attached to aldehyde-activated agarose beads (ProFound system) for immunoprecipitation. The experiment was performed under both the “opened” and “sealed” conditions (Fig. 6A) to determine the topology of the enzymes. Fig. 6C shows that ATase1 and ATase2 could be immunoprecipitated only when the vesicles were used under the opened condition, which allowed the anti-Myc antibody to interact with the C-terminal Myc tag. Therefore, when taken together, the above results indicate that both ATase1 and ATase2 have the predicted topology, with the catalytic C-terminal domain facing the lumen of the ER/ERGIC system, where the lysine acetylation of nascent BACE1 normally occurs.

https://openalex.org/W2010958659,"Neurologic disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is ultimately refractory to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because of failure of complete virus eradication in the central nervous system (CNS), and disruption of normal neural signaling events by virally induced chronic neuroinflammation. We have previously reported that HIV-1 Tat can induce mitochondrial hyperpolarization in cortical neurons, thus compromising the ability of the neuron to buffer calcium and sustain energy production for normal synaptic communication. In this report, we demonstrate that Tat induces rapid loss of ER calcium mediated by the ryanodine receptor (RyR), followed by the unfolded protein response (UPR) and pathologic dilatation of the ER in cortical neurons in vitro. RyR antagonism attenuated both Tat-mediated mitochondrial hyperpolarization and UPR induction. Delivery of Tat to murine CNS in vivo also leads to long-lasting pathologic ER dilatation and mitochondrial morphologic abnormalities. Finally, we performed ultrastructural studies that demonstrated mitochondria with abnormal morphology and dilated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in brain tissue of patients with HIV-1 inflammation and neurodegeneration. Collectively, these data suggest that abnormal RyR signaling mediates the neuronal UPR with failure of mitochondrial energy metabolism, and is a critical locus for the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 in the CNS."

Recent studies indicate that MT1-MMP expression is elevated in human AAA tissues and that infiltrating macrophages are the primary source of the proteinase in aortic lesions (11Hayashi K.

Using a murine model of AAA and mice with a targeted deletion of MT1-MMP in myelogenous cell populations, we now demonstrate that macrophage-derived MT1-MMP is required for elastin degradation and aneurysm formation. Importantly, macrophages are not dependent on MT1-MMP for infiltrating aortic tissues but instead use the protease to directly regulate their elastolytic potential in an MMP-2- and MMP-9-independent fashion. These studies define a new and unexpected role for MT1-MMP in controlling macrophage elastolytic activity in the in vitro and in vivo settings.

Bone marrow cell suspensions were prepared from the femurs of MT1-MMP-/- mice or wild-type littermates, and 5 × 106 cells were infused via the lateral tail veins. Isolation and Infusion of Peritoneal Macrophages and Lymphocytes—For macrophage isolation, wild-type littermates of MT1-MMP-/- mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 3% Brewer thioglycollate medium. One week later, peritoneal macrophages were collected and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline. For lymphocyte isolation, wild-type spleens were removed, and cells were isolated, resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer, and washed with RPMI 1640. Macrophages were depleted by allowing the cells to adhere to a plastic substratum, and the non-adherent lymphocytes were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. WT/MT1-MMP-/- mice were injected with 5 × 107 peritoneal macrophages (n = 6) or macrophage-depleted splenic lymphocytes (n = 6, as a control group) via the tail vein 1 day before AAA induction. A second cell infusion was repeated 1 week later. Aneurysm Induction—Mice at 9 weeks of age underwent surgery as described previously (7Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N. Baxter B.T.

Briefly, the abdominal aorta between the renal arteries and bifurcation of the iliac arteries was isolated, and the diameter was measured in triplicate in the mid-infrarenal aorta. After base-line measurements, 0.25 mol/liter CaCl2 was applied to the external surface of the aorta for 15 min, and the incision was closed. NaCl (0.9%) was substituted for CaCl2 in sham control mice. After 6 weeks, the mice underwent laparotomy, and dissection and aortae were collected for analysis. Histology and Immunohistochemistry—For Masson's trichrome staining, abdominal aortic tissues were embedded in paraffin and stained as described (7Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N.

RT-PCR—Total RNA from mouse aortic tissues, macrophages, lymphocytes, and aortic smooth muscle cells was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). White blood cells from WT/MT1-MMP-/- and WT/WT mice were isolated by centrifugation through a Histopaque (Sigma) density gradient, and total RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCR was performed using Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) with β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal reference. Gelatin Zymography—Aortae were extracted for gelatin zymography as previously described (7Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N. Baxter B.T. J. Clin.

The intensity of each band was quantified by densitometry (Amersham Biosciences). Elastin Preparation and Elastolytic Assay—Elastin (type E60; Elastin Product Co., St Louis, MO) was reductively labeled (1300 dpm/μg of elastin) as described (19Banda M.J. Werb Z. McKerrow J.H.

Peritoneal macrophages from WT/WT, WT/MT1-MMP-/-, C57/BL6, MMP-2-/-, and MMP-9-/- mice were isolated as above and activated by incubating with 2 units/ml IFN-γ for 4 h and 10 ng/ml LPS for 1 h. After further stimulating cells with 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h, 1 mg of [3H]elastin was added to each well in the presence of the cysteine protease inhibitor, E64 (20 μm, Sigma), and the serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), in serum-free RPMI 1640 at 37 °C for 5 days. Solubilized [3H]elastin was quantitated by β-scintillation counting. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. of three experiments. Statistical Analysis—Measurements of aortic diameter and gelatinolytic activity are expressed as the mean value ± S.E. A paired Student’s t test was used to compare original and final diameters. Student’s t test was used to compare final aortic diameter between groups. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the proportion of mice developing aneurysms. Statistical significance was accepted at a p < 0.05. Aortae were scored aneurysm-positive when the diameter increased by 50% or more from the base-line measurement (20Yoshimura K. Aoki H. Ikeda Y.

Role of MT1-MMP in AAA Formation—After the direct application of CaCl2 to the external surface of the aorta, a localized inflammatory response is initiated which recapitulates key features of the human AAA, including macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration, increased MMP expression, elastin degradation, and progressive vessel wall dilatation (7Longo G.M.

To examine the potential contribution of MT1-MMP to AAA, expression levels of MT1-MMP in the aneurysm tissue of CaCl2-treated wild-type mice were compared with aortic tissue from sham, NaCl-treated controls by RT-PCR. Consistent with reports documenting increased MT1-MMP levels in human aneurysm tissue (21Nollendorfs A. Greiner T.C. Nagase H. Baxter B.T. J. Vasc.

As infiltrating macrophages contribute the bulk of the MT1-MMP found in human AAA lesions (21Nollendorfs A. Greiner T.C. Nagase H. Baxter B.T. J. Vasc.

After recovery from bone marrow transplantation, mice underwent CaCl2 aneurysm induction. RT-PCR confirmed minimal expression of MT1-MMP in myeloid cells from the WT/MT1-MMP-/- chimeras (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, whereas CaCl2-treated tissues isolated from WT/WT mice processed endogenous proMMP-2, similarly treated tissues recovered from WT/MT1-MMP-/- chimeras display a pronounced defect in zymogen processing (Fig. 1C). Given results demonstrating that marrow-derived cells likely serve as a major source of active MT1-MMP in the CaCl2-treated aorta wall, the relative ability of WT-versus MT1-MMP-/--derived myeloid cells to support AAA formation was assessed in the respective chimeric mice. As observed previously (7Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N. Baxter B.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xiong W. Zhao Y. Prall A. Greiner T.C. Baxter B.T. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2607-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), WT/WT mice developed aneurysms (4 of 5) at a rate similar to that reported for WT mice using the standard clinical definition of a 50% increase in diameter (Fig. 1D; i.e. aortic diameter in the WT/WT chimeric mice increased by 63 ± 8%) (7Longo G.M.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 2607-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, however, only 1 of 11 WT/MT1-MMP-/- mice developed an aneurysm (Fig. 1D and Table 1). Furthermore, although the CaCl2-treated WT/WT mice exhibit significant disruption of the elastic lamellae of the aortic wall (Fig. 1F), the CaCl2-treated WT/MT1-MMP-/- chimeras revealed only minor distortion of lamellar architecture (Fig. 1H). As expected, the aortic walls of the NaCl-treated sham control mice from both groups are intact (Fig. 1, E and G).TABLE 1Changes in aortic diameter in WT and MT1-MMP-/- bone marrow transplantation to WT γ-irradiated mice after treatment of NaCl and CaCl2Bone marrow transferWTWTMT1-MMP-/-MT1-MMP-/-TreatmentNaClCaCl2NaClCaCl2Number55711AAA development0/5 (0%)4/5 (80%)0/7 (0%)1/11 (9%)Pre-treatment (μm)542 ± 16567 ± 14.1572 ± 11.7551 ± 6.2Post-treatment (μm)611 ± 18.5924 ± 53ap < 0.01, Paired Student’s t test, compared to pre-treatment value.,bp < 0.05, compared to CaCl2-treated MT1-MMP-/-.614 ± 19731 ± 14.5ap < 0.01, Paired Student’s t test, compared to pre-treatment value.% Increase13.363.37.432.9a p < 0.01, Paired Student’s t test, compared to pre-treatment value.b p < 0.05, compared to CaCl2-treated MT1-MMP-/-. Open table in a new tab Role of Macrophage MT1-MMP in AAA Formation—Infusion of bone marrow from MT1-MMP knock-out mice into sub-lethally γ-irradiated wild-type mice results in deletion of MT1-MMP expression in all myelogenous cells. As AAA lesions are dominated by macrophages as well as lymphocytes and both cell populations can express MT1-MMP (Fig. 2A), WT/MT1-MMP-/- chimeric mice were tailvein-injected with either macrophages or lymphocytes harvested from wild-type mice 24 h before CaCl2 aneurysm induction. A second infusion of macrophages or lymphocytes was performed 1 week after CaCl2 induction as per protocols established in previous studies where the ability of infused cells to infiltrate aortic tissue has been documented (7Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N. Baxter B.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Xiong W. Zhao Y. Prall A. Greiner T.C. Baxter B.T. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2607-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, infusion of MT1-MMP+/+ macrophages into WT/MT1-MMP-/- chimeric mice resulted in reconstitution of proMMP-2 processing (Fig. 2A) and the induction of aneurysm formation (Fig. 2B and Table 2) as well as degradation of the elastin matrix in vivo (Fig. 2C). By contrast, neither proMMP-2 processing nor aneurysm formation was reconstituted when wild-type lymphocytes were infused into WT/MT1-MMP-/- mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, although vascular smooth muscle cells express MT1-MMP in aorta recovered from WT/MT1-MMP-/- mice (Fig. 2B), these cells process only small amounts of proMMP-2 (Fig. 2A) and are unable to mediate significant elastin fiber degradation or aneurysm formation (Fig. 1H). Taken together, these studies confirm a central role of macrophage-derived MT1-MMP in supporting aneurysm formation and elastin degradation.TABLE 2Changes in aortic diameter in MT1-MMP-/- mice with macrophage InfusionCell transferMφTreatmentCaCl2Number6AAA development (%)5/6 (83%)Pre-treatment (μm)523 ± 8.2Post-treatment (μm)821 ± 16.6ap < 0.05, paired Student’s t test, compared to CaCl2-treated control.Percent of increase (%)57.2Range of increase (%)42-68a p < 0.05, paired Student’s t test, compared to CaCl2-treated control.

Med. 2005; 202: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As such, the attenuated damage observed in the WT/MT1-MMP-/- chimeric mice might occur as a consequence of a defect in the ability of MT1-MMP-deficient macrophages to invade the aortic wall matrix. To this end sections from WT/WT and WT/MT1-MMP-/- mice were examined for their respective content of Mac-3-positive macrophages. Importantly, no differences in macrophage number were observed in CaCl2-treated WT/MT1-MMP-/- aorta (2.6 ± 0.3 macrophages/high power field; n = 7) compared with WT/WT mice (2.7 ± 0.2 macrophages/high power field; p = 0.8; n = 9) (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, macrophages were distributed similarly within the medial layer of WT/WT and WT/MT1-MMP-/- mouse aortas (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these studies establish a novel role for macrophage-derived MT1-MMP. Macrophages infiltrating aortic tissue during AAA formation are presumed to play an important role in degrading the elastic lamina that maintains vessel wall integrity in pressure-bearing circuits (6Curci J.A.

Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Filippov S. Caras I. Murray R. Matrisian L.M. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S. Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the role of MT1-MMP in this process has not been characterized previously. As such, wild-type or MT1-MMP-null macrophages were cultured with [H3]elastin in the presence of a mixture of serine and cysteine proteinase inhibitors to specifically monitor MMP-dependent elastolytic activity. Under these conditions, MT1-MMP-deficient macrophages demonstrated a 64% ± 9 decrease in elastin-degradative activity relative to wild-type macrophage (Fig. 3C). As MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been shown to play important, but mechanistically undefined roles in AAA formation in vivo, the potential impact of these proteinases on macrophage-mediated elastolysis was likewise assessed. In a fashion distinct from that observed with MT1-MMP-/- cells, macrophages isolated MMP-2-null retained wild-type elastolytic activity (Fig. 3C). Similarly, consistent with the fact that MMP-9 expression is unaffected in MT1-MMP-/- macrophages (Fig. 3D), MMP-9-null macrophages also degrade elastin at normal rates (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that MT1-MMP plays a critical role in AAA formation and that the metalloproteinase directly regulates the elastolytic activity of intact macrophages. In human AAA tissues, MT1-MMP expression is increased markedly and localized primarily to infiltrating macrophages (21Nollendorfs A. Greiner T.C. Nagase H. Baxter B.T. J. Vasc. Surg. 2001; 34: 316-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the potential role of macrophage MT1-MMP in AAA formation have remained unexplored largely as a consequence of the fact that MT1-MMP-/- mice are moribund shortly after birth, display multiple musculoskeletal and metabolic defects, and die by 1-3 months of age (16Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4052-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). To circumvent this limitation, we have assessed the role of MT1-MMP in AAA formation in a newly developed chimeric mouse model. Using this protocol, irradiated mice reconstituted with WT marrow (WT/WT chimeras) developed aneurysms at the same rate and mean diameter as CaCl2-treated WT mice. By contrast, only 1/11 mice reconstituted with MT1-MMP-deficient bone marrow developed an aneurysm. The histology correlated with changes in aortic diameter, showing relative elastin preservation in WT/MT1-MMP-/- compared with WT/WT mice. Myeloid cells recovered from WT/MT1-MMP-/- mice express low residual levels of MT1-MMP transcripts by RT-PCR, possibly the result of a fraction of native cells surviving the irradiation (29Chute J.P. Fung J. Muramoto G. Erwin R. Exp. Hematol. 2004; 32: 308-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, neither the low levels of myeloid cell-derived MT1-MMP nor vessel wall-derived MT1-MMP (largely associated with vascular smooth muscle cells or the endothelium (23Chun T.H. Sabeh F.

Indeed, infusion of WT macrophages alone successfully reconstituted aneurysm formation in WT/MT1-MMP-/- mice, confirming the specific role of macrophage MT1-MMP. A number of recent studies have concluded that MT1-MMP can regulate monocyte migration, raising the question of whether MT1-MMP deletion would influence macrophage infiltration into the aortic wall (14Matias-Roman S. Galvez B.G. Genis L. Yanez-Mo M. de la Rosa G. Sanchez-Mateos P. Sanchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. Blood. 2005; 105: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Sithu S.D. English W.R.

Although these studies were confined to in vitro analyses, we now demonstrate that the macrophage content of CaCl2-treated aortae was unaffected by MT1-MMP deficiency. These results support a model where wild-type as well as MT1-MMP-/- monocytes invade the aortic wall in comparable fashion where they then differentiate into macrophages. Interestingly, similar results were obtained recently where MT1-MMP-/- monocytes were shown to infiltrate atherosclerotic plaques at rates comparable with those exhibited by wild-type cells (30Schneider F. Sukhova G.K. Aikawa M. Canner J. Gerdes N. Tang S.M. Shi G.P. Apte S.S. Libby P. Circulation. 2008; 117: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although Libby and co-workers (30Schneider F. Sukhova G.K. Aikawa M. Canner J. Gerdes N. Tang S.M. Shi G.P. Apte S.S. Libby P. Circulation. 2008; 117: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have suggested a role for MT1-MMP in effecting the activation of the secreted collagenase, MMP-13, within atherosclerotic lesions, we detect only low levels of active MMP-13 in aneurysm tissue (data not shown). Furthermore, we find that wild-type as well as MT1-MMP-/- macrophages display only low levels of collagenolytic activity. 3R. Shimizu-Hirota and S. J. Weiss, unpublished observation. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that monocytes or macrophages use other proteolytic systems to invade the vessel wall matrix, but it should be noted that myeloid cell populations can traverse collagen-rich tissues by protease-independent processes that depend on the ability of the cell to adopt an amoeboid-type of invasive activity (31Wolf K. Muller R. Borgmann S. Brocker E.B. Friedl P. Blood. 2003; 102: 3262-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Given the ability of MT1-MMP to degrade collagen types I, II, and III, fibronectin, laminin, and fibrin as well as other extracellular matrix substrates (10Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that MT1-MMP might influence aneurysm formation by regulating macrophage elastolytic activity. Indeed, MT1-MMP-/- macrophages display a profound defect in their ability to degrade insoluble elastin. As MMP-2-/- macrophages did not share a similar loss in elastolytic potential, these results are consistent with a model wherein MT1-MMP directly regulates macrophage elastolytic potential. Interestingly, we have previously reported that macrophage-derived MMP-9 plays a key role in AAA formation in vivo (7Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N. Baxter B.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based, however, on the fact that (i) MMP-9-/- macrophages can now be shown to retain full elastolytic activity in vitro and (ii) MT1-MMP-/- macrophage express MMP-9 at normal, if not heightened levels, these combined findings suggest that MMP-9 must indirectly regulate aneurysm formation. With the increased appreciation that MMP-9 can exert multiple effects on cell behavior ranging from the release of soluble kit-ligand and the regulation of VEGF bioavailability to modulating cell migration and tight junction function (32Heissig B. Hattori K. Dias S. Friedrich M. Ferris B. Hackett N.R. Crystal R.G. Besmer P. Lyden D. Moore M.A. Werb Z. Rafii S.

Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the role of macrophage-derived MMP-9 is likely complex in the in vivo setting. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that MMP-9 does not play a direct or required role in supporting macrophage-mediated elastolytic activity. From this perspective, caution must also be exercised in terms of speculating the mechanisms by which MT1-MMP controls macrophage-elastin interactions. In the simplest scenario, MT1-MMP might directly display elastolytic activity. In preliminary studies, however, purified transmembrane-deleted, soluble MT1-MMP did not degrade elastin under standard culture conditions. 4W. Xiong, R. Knispel, J. MacTaggart, T. C. Greiner, S. J. Weiss, and B. Timothy Baxter, unpublished observation. Importantly, the soluble enzyme is unlikely to recapitulate the high protease-substrate concentrations found at the macrophage-elastin interface or the specific conditions operative within this specialized microenvironment (e.g. acidic pH) (26Punturieri A. Filippov S. Allen E. Caras I. Murray R. Reddy V. Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Filippov S. Caras I. Murray R. Matrisian L.M. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S. Weiss S.J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MT1-MMP may additionally control macrophage-mediated elastolytic activity by affecting macrophage signaling pathways (10Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although further studies are needed to characterize the global impact of MT1-MMP activity on macrophage function, our findings demonstrate that macrophages are incapable of exhibiting their full elastolytic potential in the absence of MT1-MMP. In vivo, we have demonstrated that macrophage-derived MT1-MMP plays a critical role in modulating elastin degradation and aneurysm formation. Although our findings stress a direct role for MT1-MMP in regulating macrophage-mediated proteolysis, cooperative interactions with other cell populations likely occur within the confines of the vessel wall. For example, levels of active MMP-2 are elevated in aneurysm tissues excised during operative repair (9Davis V. Persidskaia R. Baca-Regen L. Itoh Y. Nagase H. Persidsky Y. Ghorpade A. Baxter B.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and as demonstrated in the current study, macrophage-derived MT1-MMP plays a dominant role in activating MMP-2 in our AAA model system. Given the fact that MMP-2-/- mice are resistant to CaCl2-induced aortic damage (7Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N. Baxter B.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we posit that macrophage MT1-MMP plays additional roles in AAA by locally activating vessel wall-derived MMP-2. In this scenario, macrophage-derived MT1-MMP would play both MMP-2-dependent and independent roles in driving AAA formation in vivo despite the fact that macrophages can directly degrade elastin in the complete absence of MMP-2 (i.e. Fig. 3C). Nevertheless, given the central role assumed by MT1-MMP in orchestrating elastolytic processes, the proteinase likely represents an important therapeutic target in elastin-destructive disease states ranging from AAA and atherosclerosis to emphysema. We sincerely thank Dr. Henning Birkedal-Hansen for providing MT1-MMP+/- mice."

Using cells deficient in different Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome complexes, we identified that BLOC-1, but not BLOC-2 or BLOC-3, deficiencies affect PI4KIIα inclusion into AP-3 complexes. BLOC-1, PI4KIIα, and AP-3 belong to a tripartite complex, and down-regulation of either PI4KIIα, BLOC-1, or AP-3 complexes led to similar LAMP1 phenotypes. Our analysis indicates that BLOC-1 complex modulates the association of PI4KIIα with AP-3.

The best understood vesicle formation machinery in mammalian cells is the one organized around the adaptor complex AP-2 (5Schmid E.M. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2007; 448: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This complex generates vesicles from the plasma membrane using clathrin. Our present detailed understanding of AP-2 vesicle biogenesis mechanisms and interactions emerged from a combination of organellar and in vitro binding proteomics analyses together with the study of binary interactions in cell-free systems (5Schmid E.M.

PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e262Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast, the vesicle biogenesis pathways controlled by AP-3 are far less understood. AP-3 functions to produce vesicles that traffic selected membrane proteins from endosomes to lysosomes, lysosome-related organelles, or synaptic vesicles (10Danglot L. Galli T. Biol.

AP-3 is one of the protein complexes affected in the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS; 3The abbreviations used are: HPS, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome; PI4KIIα, phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase type II α; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TrfR, transferrin receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting; BLOC, biogenesis of liposome-related organelles complex.3The abbreviations used are: HPS, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome; PI4KIIα, phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase type II α; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TrfR, transferrin receptor; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); HOPS, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting; BLOC, biogenesis of liposome-related organelles complex. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 203300). So far, mutations in any of 15 mouse or eight human genes trigger a common syndrome. This syndrome encompasses defects that include pigment dilution, platelet dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, and occasionally neurological phenotypes (14Di Pietro S.M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Traffic. 2005; 6: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Wei M.L. Pigm. Cell Res. 2006; 19: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). All forms of HPS show defective vesicular biogenesis or trafficking that affects lysosomes, lysosome-related organelles (for example melanosomes and platelet dense granules), and, in some of them, synaptic vesicles (11Newell-Litwa K. Seong E. Burmeister M. Faundez V. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Raposo G. Marks M.S. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Most of the 15 HPS loci encode polypeptides that assemble into five distinct molecular complexes: the adaptor complex AP-3, HOPS, and the BLOC complexes 1, 2, and 3 (14Di Pietro S.M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Traffic. 2005; 6: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recently binary interactions between AP-3 and BLOC-1 or BLOC-1 and BLOC-2 suggested that arrangements of these complexes could regulate membrane protein targeting (16Di Pietro S.M. Falcon-Perez J.M. Tenza D. Setty S.R. Marks M.S. Raposo G. Dell'Angelica E.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4027-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Despite the abundance of genetic deficiencies leading to HPS and genetic evidence that HPS complexes may act on the same pathway in defined cell types (17Gautam R. Novak E.K. Tan J. Wakamatsu K. Itoh S. Swank R.T. Traffic. 2006; 7: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we have only a partial picture of protein interactions organizing these complexes and how they might control membrane protein targeting. In this study, we took advantage of cell-permeant and reversible cross-linking of HPS complexes followed by their immunoaffinity purification to identify novel molecular interactions. Cross-linked AP-3 co-purified with BLOC-1, BLOC-2, HOPS, clathrin, and the membrane protein PI4KIIα. We previously identified PI4KIIα as a cargo and regulator of AP-3 recruitment to endosomes (1Craige B. Salazar G. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Salazar G. Craige B. Wainer B.H. Guo J. De Camilli P. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3692-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using mutant cells deficient in either individual HPS complexes or a combination of them, we found that BLOC-1 facilitates the interaction of AP-3 and PI4KIIα. Our studies demonstrate that subunits of four of the five HPS complexes co-isolate with AP-3. Moreover BLOC-1, PI4KIIα, and AP-3 form a tripartite complex as demonstrated by sequential co-immunoprecipitations as well as by similar LAMP1 distribution phenotypes induced by down-regulation of components of this tripartite complex. Our findings indicate that BLOC-1 complex modulates the recognition of PI4KIIα by AP-3. These data suggest that AP-3, either in concert or sequentially with BLOC-1, participates in the sorting of common membrane proteins along the endocytic route. Antibodies—Antibodies used in these studies are listed in Table 1 except for the vps33b antibodies. An antiserum was prepared against rat vps33b peptide DTLTAVENKVSKLVTDKAAGKITDAFSSL (amino acids 450-478 of the NCBI record NP_071622.1). This peptide is conserved in human and mouse vps33b.

Human vps41 (SC111791) was obtained from the TrueClone collection (Origene, Rockville, MD). vps41 was Myc-tagged by PCR at the carboxyl terminus and subcloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-HIS-TOPO expression vector. The full open reading frame sequence was confirmed by sequencing. HA-tagged human PI4KIIα and the dileucine sorting mutant PI4KIIαL61A/L62A were described previously (1Craige B. Salazar G. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's recommendations. Cell Lines—Cells used are listed in Table 2. Mouse fibroblast and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA; 4.5 g/liter glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Hygromycin (200 μg/ml) was used for cells carrying retroviruses. ZnT3-transfected PC12 cell lines were cultured as described previously (20Salazar G. Love R. Werner E. Doucette M.M. Cheng S. Levey A. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml 35[S]methionine (>1000 Ci (37.0 TBq)/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 12 h.TABLE 2Cells usedCell typeDefective complexGenotypeSourceFibroblastAP-3Ap3dmh/mh empty retrovirusA.

Cell. 2008; 19: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were washed twice in cold PBS plus CaCl2 and MgCl2 (PBS-CM) and incubated with 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)(DSP) (Pierce) or DMSO alone in PBS-CM for 2 h on ice. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for 15 min on ice and washing twice in PBS. Cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), 0.5% Triton X-100, and Complete™ antiprotease mixture (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were clarified by sedimentation at 16,100 × g for 10 min. 500-800 μg of supernatant were immunoprecipitated using Dynal magnetic beads M450 (Invitrogen) covered with monoclonal antibodies against AP-3 δ subunit, γ-adaptin (AP-1), or transferrin receptor for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed six times in buffer A plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min each and incubated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min at 75 °C. Samples were loaded on 4-20% PAGE-SDS Criterion precast gels (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by immunoblot. Sucrose Sedimentation and Mass Spectrometry—Clarified Triton-soluble supernatants from PC12 cells either treated with DSP or DMSO alone were sedimented in a 5-20% sucrose gradient prepared in buffer A plus 0.5% Triton X-100 during 13 h at 187,000 × g in an SW55 rotor (1.5 mg per gradient) (20Salazar G. Love R. Werner E. Doucette M.M. Cheng S. Levey A. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). 20 samples were collected from the bottom (250 μl each) and analyzed by Western blots. The following standards were used to calibrate the gradients: horse spleen apoferritin (443 kDa, 16.5 S), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, 4.6 S), sweet potato β-amylase (200 kDa, 9.4 S), and bovine erythrocytes carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa, 2.9 S). A total of ∼58 mg of clarified Triton-soluble supernatant from DSP-treated PC12 cells was fractionated by sucrose gradient sedimentation (∼20 gradients per preparation). AP-3 migration in the gradient was determined by immunoblot. Two preparations were performed. In one preparation sucrose fractions 1-8 (from the bottom) were pooled. In a second preparation, fractions 3-5 were pooled and further analyzed. Pooled fractions containing cross-linked AP-3 complexes were diluted in buffer A, and samples were subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography with AP-3 δ antibodies bound to Dynal M450 magnetic beads. Binding was performed for 3 h at 4 °C. After six washes in buffer A plus Triton X-100, AP-3 cross-linked complexes were eluted with a 50 μm concentration of a peptide corresponding to the epitope recognized by the anti-δ SA4 monoclonal antibody (AQQVDIVTEEMPENALPSDEDDKDPNDPYRA) corresponding to the amino acids 680-710 of human δ-adaptin (NCBI:AAD03777; gi:1923266). Elution was performed for 2 h at 0 °C. Peptide eluted material was precipitated on ice with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min, and protein pellets were washed twice with 1:1 ethanol/ether (-20 °C), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 n NaOH. Solubilized protein pellets were incubated in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) at 75 °C for 5 min, and proteins were resolved in a single lane of a 4-20% PAGE-SDS Criterion gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were stained with SYPRO Ruby (Bio-Rad), and the lane was divided into 18 fractions. Each fraction was subjected to in-gel digestion with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C overnight, and the peptides were extracted as described previously (21Li G. Waltham M. Anderson N.L. Unsworth E. Treston A. Weinstein J.N. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Protein identification was performed with nano-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis (for details, see Ref. 22Khwaja F.W. Reed M.S. Olson J.J. Schmotzer B.J. Gillespie G.Y. Guha A. Groves M.D. Kesari S. Pohl J. Meir E.G. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); a QSTAR XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) hybrid quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer interfaced with an Ultimate nano-HPLC system (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) was used. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode using information-dependent acquisition to acquire a single MS scan (m/z 400-1900 scan range) followed by up to two MS/MS scans (m/z 50-1900 scan range). A rolling collision energy was used for the MS/MS scans. The data were analyzed using the ProID (Applied Biosystems) and Mascot (Matrix Science) search algorithms. We defined the following criteria to consider probable positive protein identification. Proteins were included for analysis 1) if represented by at least one peptide with a Mascot score >45 unless the proteins was already known to interact with AP-3 and/or 2) if represented in at least two of three spectrometry analyses. Peptides identified in a single MS run were also included if the corresponding proteins were part of a complex in which other subunits were identified in a distinct MS run. Membrane Preparation—HEK293T cells, either treated or not with DSP, were washed in PBS and homogenized by 18 passages in a cell cracker in buffer A containing Complete antiprotease mixture. Homogenate was sedimented at 27,000 × g for 40 min to generate a P1 membrane fraction and an S1 supernatant. Cytosol free of membranes was obtained by centrifugation of S1 at 210,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Coulter TLA120.2 rotor. Membrane fractions or cytosol was solubilized in buffer A plus 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice. Triton extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated followed by Western blot analysis. Clathrin-coated Vesicle (CCV) Isolation—Clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared according to Girard et al. (23Girard M. Allaire P.D. Blondeau F. McPherson P.S. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. 2004: 3.13.1-3Google Scholar). Briefly PC12 cells were homogenized in buffer B (100 mm MES, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2) plus Complete antiprotease mixture. Homogenates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min in a Sorvall SS-34 fixed angle rotor to obtain a supernatant (S1) and a pellet (P1). S1 was centrifuged at 56,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman Type 40 ultracentrifuge fixed angle rotor to generate P2 and S2 fractions. P2 pellets were resuspended in buffer B plus antiprotease mixture and laid over a layer of 8% (w/v) sucrose in buffer B prepared in 50% (v/v) deuterium oxide. After 2 h of centrifugation at 116,000 × g in a Beckman SW55 rotor, the pellet of CCVs was resuspended in buffer B and kept at -80 °C. siRNA Treatment—siRNA oligos for PI4KIIα and its control have been described previously (1Craige B.

Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool was used to silence expression of human AP-3 δ subunit (NCBI:L-016014-00-0005, NM_003938) at 50 nm and the BLOC1 subunit pallidin (NCBI:L-009637-01-0005, NM_012388) at 100 nm. The siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA 2 (5′-UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUAC-3′) was used as a control. Oligonucleotide sequences for δ were the following: Sense Sequence 1, CUACAGGGCUCUGGAUAUUUU; Antisense Sequence 1, 5′-PAAUAUCCAGAGCCCUGUAGUU; Sense Sequence 2, GGACGAGGCAAAAUACAUAUU; Antisense Sequence 2, 5′-PUAUGUAUUUUGCCUCGUCCUU; Sense Sequence 3, GAAGGACGUUCCCAUGGUAUU; Antisense Sequence 3, 5′-PUACCAUGGGAACGUCCUUCUU; Sense Sequence 4, CAAAGUCGAUGGCAUUCGGUU; Antisense Sequence 4, 5′-PCCGAAUGCCAUCGACUUUGUU. Oligonucleotide sequences for pallidin were the following: Sense Sequence 1, CAAAAGAGGCAGCGUGAUAUU; Antisense Sequence 1, 5′-PUAUCACGCUGCCUCUUUUGUU; Sense Sequence 2, CAAAGGUAGUACAGCGUUUUU; Antisense Sequence 2, 5′-PAAACGCUGUACUACCUUUGUU; Sense Sequence 3, CAAACAAACAAACAACGUAUU; Antisense Sequence 3, 5′-PUACGUUGUUUGUUUGUUUGUU; Sense Sequence 4, GAACCAAGUUGUAUUGUUAU; Antisense Sequence 4, 5′-PUAACAAUACAACUUGGUUCUU. HEK293T cells were transfected twice on alternate days with siRNA-CONTROL 1 or 2 oligos or with siRNA oligos to silence the human PI4KIIα, the BLOC1 subunit pallidin, or the AP-3 δ subunit. Twenty-four hours after the second transfection cells were reseeded in 12-well plates for Western blots or on coverslips for immunofluorescence analysis. Samples were processed the next day. Identification of Proteins Co-purifying with Cross-linked AP-3 Complexes—We used chemical cross-linking to stabilize labile protein interactions followed by purification of cross-linked protein complexes containing HPS gene products. We chose DSP, a homobifunctional cell-permeable cross-linker with a 12-Å spacer arm. This reagent contains a disulfide bond that allows cleavage of cross-linked products (25Alloza I. Martens E. Hawthorne S. Vandenbroeck K. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Lomant A.J. Fairbanks G. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e185Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previously we demonstrated that the interaction of AP-3 with its cargo/regulator PI4KIIα on membranes could be structurally and functionally explored in vivo using DSP whole-cell cross-linking (1Craige B. Salazar G. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we focused on the adaptor complex AP-3, which is affected in HPS2 syndrome (28Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), because it shows the most severe systemic and neurological phenotype of all HPS affected loci (29Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carskadon S.L. Kapfhamer D. Sufalko D. Robinson M.S. Noebels J.L. Burmeister M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We first sought non-saturating in vivo DSP incubation conditions that could stabilize a small fraction of known AP-3-interacting proteins into high molecular weight complexes, “in vivo controlled cross-linking.” Triton-soluble extracts of control and DSP-treated PC12 cells were fractionated by sucrose sedimentation. We determined the sedimentation of AP-3 and its membrane protein cargoes, ZnT3 and PI4KIIα (1Craige B. Salazar G. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1415-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18Salazar G. Craige B. Wainer B.H. Guo J. De Camilli P. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3692-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Salazar G. Love R. Werner E. Doucette M.M. Cheng S. Levey A. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After DSP treatment, a fraction of AP-3 exhibited a slightly increased sedimentation coefficient above 9.4 S (Fig. 1A). Similarly a discrete pool of ZnT3 and PI4KIIα was incorporated into complexes with a sedimentation coefficient between 9.4 and 16.5 S (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-7). The sedimentation of a non-AP-3 cargo synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin (20Salazar G. Love R. Werner E. Doucette M.M. Cheng S. Levey A. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), remained unaffected by DSP treatment. Moreover the total protein sedimentation pattern between control and DSP-treated samples remained identical (Fig. 1B). These results show that a limited set of protein-protein interactions are stabilized in vivo by DSP treatment. We independently confirmed these findings by immunoprecipitation of AP-3 complexes from [S35]methionine-labeled whole-cell Triton extracts from control and DSP-treated PC12 cells. Because the majority of AP-3 remains uncross-linked in whole cell extracts of DSP-treated cells, we predicted that major radiolabeled polypeptides precipitated with AP-3 antibodies should be similar between DSP-treated and untreated cells. In fact, radiolabeled bands immunoprecipitated with AP-3 δ antibodies were identical irrespective of whether cells were treated or not treated with DSP (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 5 and 6). Moreover these bands differed from those immunoprecipitated with transferrin receptor (TrfR) antibodies (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). These experiments show that AP-3 complexes are selectively immunoisolated from cross-linked cells without background due to excessive cross-linking or nonspecific binding. AP-3 bound to putative interactors was isolated from sucrose-fractionated Triton extracts of in vivo controlled cross-linked PC12 cells (Fig. 1D). Triton-soluble extracts were clarified by sedimentation, and supernatants were fractionated by sucrose sedimentation to resolve cross-linked AP-3 complexes (Fig. 1A, fractions 3-5) from the majority of non-cross-linked material (migrating under 9.4 S; Fig. 1A, fractions 6-21). AP-3 complexes sedimenting between 9.4 and 16.5 S were further purified by affinity chromatography with a monoclonal antibody against the AP-3 δ subunit. Bead-bound cross-linked AP-3 complexes were selectively eluted with a 31-mer δ antigenic peptide (Fig. 1D). Two independent purifications generated ∼5-6 μg of peptide eluate each from ∼58 mg of cell homogenate (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-5). The identity of the proteins co-purifying with cross-linked AP-3 complexes was determined by nano-liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Three independent mass spectrometry analyses identified 51 proteins (Fig. 2A and Table 3).

https://openalex.org/W1974363114,"Oxidative folding drives the import of proteins containing twin CXnC motifs into the intermembrane space of mitochondria. This import pathway employs a disulfide relay system whose key components are the redox-regulated import receptor Mia40 and the thiol oxidase Erv1. Mia40 contains six cysteine residues in a CPC-CX9C-CX9C arrangement in a highly conserved domain. We show that this domain is sufficient for the function of Mia40. By analysis of Mia40 cysteine mutants we demonstrate that the cysteine residues have distinct roles and are not equally important for Mia40 function. The second cysteine residue is essential for viability of yeast cells. It is required for the interaction of Mia40 with Erv1 in a disulfide intermediate and forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond with the first cysteine residue. Both cysteine residues are required for the oxidation of the substrate, Tim10, in a reconstituted system comprised of Mia40 and Erv1. Mutants with amino acid exchanges in the third and sixth cysteine residues have severe defects in growth and in the import of intermembrane space proteins. These Mia40 variants are not tightly folded. We conclude that the cysteine residues of the twin CX9C motif have a structural role and stabilize Mia40. In particular, the disulfide bond formed by the third and sixth cysteine residues apparently supports a conformation crucial for the function of Mia40.

Upon transport across the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM), the substrate proteins bind to Mia40 via disulfide bonds indicating a receptor function for Mia40 (14Mesecke N. Terziyska N.

Subsequently, the substrate proteins are released in an oxidized state (23Muller J.M. Milenkovic D. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Chacinska A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mia40 interacts with the thiol oxidase Erv1, which has the ability to oxidize Mia40 in vitro (24Grumbt B. Stroobant V. Terziyska N. Israel L. Hell K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37461-37470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In mitochondria, Erv1 is required to keep Mia40 in an oxidized state promoting further rounds of import (14Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C. Baumann F. Neupert W. Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Finally, reoxidation of Erv1 appears to occur by transfer of electrons to cytochrome c and then either to the cytochrome c oxidase complex or to cytochrome c peroxidase linking the disulfide relay system to the respiratory chain (25Bihlmaier K.

J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In fungi, Mia40 is anchored with its N terminus into the inner membrane exposing the major part of the protein into the IMS (17Naoe M. Ohwa Y. Ishikawa D. Ohshima C. Nishikawa S. Yamamoto H. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47815-47821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 18Terziyska N. Lutz T. Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Mesecke N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Hell K. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This part comprises a domain with six cysteine residues forming a CPC-CX9C-CX9C motif which is highly conserved in all homologues of Mia40. These invariant cysteine residues play a crucial role for the function of Mia40 (17Naoe M. Ohwa Y. Ishikawa D. Ohshima C. Nishikawa S. Yamamoto H. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47815-47821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Studies with a purified C-terminal fragment of Mia40 assigned three disulfide bonds to the oxidized state of Mia40 in vitro (24Grumbt B. Stroobant V. Terziyska N. Israel L. Hell K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37461-37470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The role of the various cysteine residues, however, is not understood at all. In particular, an analysis in vivo is required to elucidate the mechanism of Mia40 function. We expressed in yeast a series of mutants of Mia40 to characterize the structural requirements and the role of the various cysteine residues of Mia40. Within the highly conserved C-terminal domain, the second cysteine residue is essential for viability of yeast cells. This residue is crucial for the interaction of Mia40 with Erv1 via a mixed disulfide bond and, together with the first cysteine residue, for the disulfide transfer to substrate proteins. Exchange of the first or the second cysteine residue in Mia40 to a serine residue renders Mia40 inactive in the oxidation of the substrate Tim10 in a reconstituted system comprised of Mia40 and Erv1. We suggest that a redox-sensitive catalytic disulfide bond between the first and the second cysteine residue and the stabilization of Mia40 by disulfide bonds made up of the cysteine residues of the twin CX9C motif are crucial for the disulfide transfer-driven protein import pathway. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—A heterozygous deletion strain of Mia40 was generated by replacing one allele of the MIA40 gene by the HIS3 gene in the diploid yeast strain YPH501 by homologous recombination as previously described (28Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Transformation of the plasmid pRS316 containing the MIA40 gene into this heterozygous deletion strain of MIA40 followed by sporulation and tetrad dissection generated a strain that carries a chromosomal deletion of MIA40 and contains the MIA40 and URA3 genes on a plasmid. To test for complementation, plasmids expressing the Mia40 mutants or wild-type Mia40 were transformed into this strain or the GAL-MIA40 strain previously described (18Terziyska N. Lutz T. Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Mesecke N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Hell K. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected, and growth was analyzed on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates to counter-select against the URA3-containing MIA40 plasmid. The yeast strains harboring MIA40 gene under GAL promoter and expressing the Mia40 mutants were grown on selective lactate-containing medium supplemented with glucose or galactose. For repression of the chromosomal Mia40 allele, cells were grown in glucose-containing media for 27 h. For drop dilution tests, the strains were grown in liquid culture for 2 days, diluted to A578 of 0.5, and then a series of 1:10 dilutions were made for each strain. From each dilution, 3.5 μl were spotted under sterile conditions on plates with the adequate medium containing 2% of glucose. Plates were incubated for 2–5 days at 30 °C. To generate truncation constructs of MIA40, the promoter and the sequences coding for the mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) and the transmembrane segment (TM) of Mia40 (nucleotides –400 to 210) were amplified with the primers SacI-Mia40Prom and Mia40Rev210-BamHI using genomic DNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a template. Similarly, the sequence of the MIA40 terminator (360 nucleotides after the stop codon) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction with the primers PstI-Mia40Term and Mia40 Term Rev-XhoI. These PCR products were cut with the enzymes SacI and BamHI or PstI and XhoI, respectively and subsequently ligated into the plasmid pRS314 generating pRS314-promMia40-MTS-TM-term. The plasmid pGEM4-Mia40 was used as a template for amplification of sequences coding for different amino acid segments of Mia40: amino acid residues 75–403, amino acid residues 258–403, amino acid residues 284–403, and amino acid residues 284–352. Specific primers harboring the restriction sites BamHI and PstI were used in these PCR reactions. Following digestion with the enzymes BamHI and PstI, the amplified fragments were cloned behind the sequence coding for the transmembrane segment in plasmid pRS314-promMia40-MTS-TM-term. Finally, the resulting plasmids were transformed into the Δmia40 yeast strain and tested for complementation as described above. The MIA40 alleles encoding for the wild type and the cysteine mutants fused to a C-terminal octahistidine tag were subcloned into the plasmid pGEM4. The fragment containing the wild-type sequence was transferred from the plasmid pVTU102-Mia40-His8 (18Terziyska N. Lutz T. Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Mesecke N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Hell K. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to pGEM4 using the restriction sites BamHI and HindIII, generating pGEM4-Mia40-His8. The mutant alleles mia40-C1S and mia40-C2S were subcloned in the pGEM4-Mia40-His8 plasmid via the restriction sites SpeI and NcoI. The inserted nucleotide sequences carrying the mutations were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primer Mia40For571SpeI and Mia40Rev-C1S or Mia40Rev-C2S and the plasmid pVTU102-Mia40-His8 as template. To obtain the pGEM4-Mia40-C3S-His8 plasmid a fragment was amplified by PCR using the primers Mia40-For906 and Mia40–8HIS-Rev and subcloned into pGEM4-Mia40-His8with NcoI and HindIII. To generate the plasmid pGEM4-Mia40-C4S-His8 the same steps were performed using instead of the primer Mia40-For906 primer C4S-Nco-Mia40. The nucleotide exchanges to obtain the mia40-C5S and mia40-C6S alleles were introduced by QuikChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the plasmid pGEM4-Mia40-His8 as template and the primer pairs NT5 and NT6 and NT7 and NT8, respectively. The C3,6S, the C5,6S and the C4,5S mutations in MIA40 were generated similarly using primers introducing the C6S (NT7 and NT8) or the C5S mutation (NT5 and NT6) and pGEM4-Mia40-C3S-His8, pGEM4-Mia40-C5S-His8 or pGEM4-Mia40-C4S-His8 plasmids, respectively, as a template. The coding sequence of each Mia40 cysteine mutant was finally cloned from the pGEM4 plasmid into pYX142 vector using the restriction sites EcoRI and HindIII. The mia40-C1, 2S mutant was obtained by PCR using pYX142-Mia40-C1S-His8 as a template and the primers Mia40For571SpeI and NT22. The mia40-CGC mutant was amplified by PCR using primer Mia40For571SpeI and NT40. Both amplified fragments were cloned into plasmid pYX142-Mia40-His8 using restriction sites SpeI and NcoI. The resulting plasmids were transformed into Δmia40 and GAL-MIA40 yeast strains. These strains were grown on selective medium lacking leucine and containing glucose (Δmia40) or galactose (GAL-Mia40). The plasmids for expression of the cysteine variants of Mia40C in Escherichia coli were cloned as described for the expression plasmid for the recombinant wild-type Mia40C (24Grumbt B. Stroobant V. Terziyska N. Israel L. Hell K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37461-37470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To generate pGEX-6P-1-Tim10, the open reading frame of Tim10 was amplified by PCR using pGEM4-Tim10 as template. The PCR fragment was cloned into the vector pGEX-6P-1 using the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI. Co-isolation of Substrates with Mia40 Variants—Radiolabeled Tim13 or Tim9 was incubated with isolated mitochondria (200 μg) from strains expressing the C-terminally His8-tagged wild type or cysteine mutant Mia40. Mitochondria were reisolated and solubilized in 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% (w/v) SDS for 10 min at room temperature. Following 20-fold dilution with lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and a clarifying spin, mitochondrial extracts were added to 30 μl of pre-equilibrated NiNTA-agarose beads (Qiagen). After incubation for 60 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The samples were analyzed with non-reducing SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Modification of Free Thiol Groups—For modification of proteins with iodoacetamide or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), isolated mitochondria were incubated with 80 mm iodoacetamide or 50 mm NEM in buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) for 20 min at 25 °C. To analyze the redox-state of Mia40 or the His-tagged variants of Mia40 mitochondria were reisolated and the samples were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against Mia40 or the octahistidine tag. M-poly-(ethylene glycol)-maleimide-5000 (PEG-Mal) (Nektar, Huntsville, AL) is a thiol-specific agent, which attaches one PEG moiety (MW = 5 kDa) to each free cysteine residue of a protein. To modify Mia40 and Mia40 variants with PEG-Mal, mitoplasts were generated by resuspension of mitochondria in 100 μl 100 mm Hepes pH 7.4. Mitoplasts were treated with or without 5 mm TCEP (Tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride) for 3 min on ice or at 95 °C and then incubated with or without PEG-Mal for 90 min on ice. The samples were loaded on a non-reducing SDS gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and Mia40 and modified Mia40 was detected by immunodecoration. Due to the additional mass of bound PEG-Mal modified proteins had a reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE gels. In Vitro Reconstitution Experiments—Recombinant Mia40C, consisting of amino acid residues 284–403, and the cysteine variants of Mia40C were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (24Grumbt B. Stroobant V. Terziyska N. Israel L. Hell K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37461-37470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Tim10 was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) containing the plasmid pGEX-6P-1-Tim10 and purified essentially as described using Precission Protease instead of thrombin for proteolytic release of Tim10 (15Lu H. Woodburn J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Erv1-His6 was expressed and purified as described (22Lee J. Hofhaus G. Lisowsky T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Tim10 was reduced with 10 mm DTT for 10 min at 95 °C. DTT was removed by gel filtration using a NAP5 column (GE Healthcare). The reduced Tim10 was incubated in the absence or presence of Mia40C or Mia40C variants and Erv1 as indicated in the figure legends. Following modification with 15 mm AMS for 1 h at 25 °C the reduced and oxidized form of Tim10 could be distinguished in a non-reducing Tricine SDS-PAGE. Both forms were detected by immunodecoration with antibodies against Tim10. Miscellaneous—Isolation of mitochondria from yeast cells, in vitro transcription and translation of radiolabeled preproteins and import of preproteins into isolated mitochondria were applied as published (14Mesecke N. Terziyska N. Kozany C. Baumann F. Neupert W. Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Cell. 2005; 121: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Partially reduced Mia40C was generated as described previously or by incubation in the presence of 2mm β-mercaptoethanol (24Grumbt B. Stroobant V. Terziyska N. Israel L. Hell K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37461-37470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The Highly Conserved Domain of Mia40 Is Sufficient to Fulfill the Function of Mia40—To determine the structural features important for the function of Mia40, we generated variants of S. cerevisiae Mia40. These variants comprised of different parts of the hydrophilic IMS domain of Mia40, ranging from the complete IMS segment (Mia40 WT) to the shortest segment consisting of amino acid residues 284–352 that represents the conserved domain (Fig. 1A). All variants contained the N-terminal import signal and the transmembrane anchor of Mia40 to target them to the inner membrane with the hydrophilic part facing into the IMS. Plasmids encoding the variant proteins were transformed into a chromosomal MIA40 disruption strain expressing wild-type Mia40 protein from a URA3-containing plasmid. The ability of the mutant proteins to functionally replace wild-type Mia40 in vivo was tested by plasmid shuffling. All mutant proteins were able to complement the deletion of the Mia40 protein (Fig. 1B). This shows that the domain comprising amino acid residues 284–352 is sufficient to fulfill the function of Mia40 in vivo when targeted to the IMS. In addition, all IMS segments rescued the deletion, when they were fused to the first 220 amino acid residues of cytochrome b2, instead of the authentic targeting signal plus transmembrane anchor, to sort the variants as soluble proteins to the intermembrane space (data not shown). Thus, also in soluble form the conserved domain comprising amino acid residues 284–352 of Mia40 is sufficient to be fully active. The results are consistent with a recent study in which a C-terminal domain of Mia40 (amino acid residues 226–403) was shown to be sufficient to target the protein to mitochondria and to fulfill the function of Mia40 (29Chacinska A. Guiard B. Muller J.M. Schulze-Specking A. Gabriel K. Kutik S. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29723-29729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Conserved Cysteine Residues in Mia40 Are Not Equally Important for the Function of Mia40—Within the highly conserved domain six invariant cysteine residues are present. Mutations of pairs of neighboring cysteine residues in Mia40 have been previously shown to be lethal, but the functions of the individual cysteine residues have remained elusive (17Naoe M. Ohwa Y. Ishikawa D. Ohshima C. Nishikawa S. Yamamoto H. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47815-47821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To study the role of the various cysteine residues, mutants of Mia40 with a C-terminal His8-tag were expressed in which the cysteine residues were replaced by serine residues. Complementation of the deletion of wild-type protein by these variants was tested by plasmid shuffling as described above (Fig. 2A). Replacement of the second (C2S) and of the third cysteine residue (C3S) in Mia40 was lethal for yeast cells. A severe growth defect was observed upon change of the first cysteine residue (C1S), whereas the variants Mia40-C4S, Mia40-C5S, or Mia40-C6S were able to complement the depletion of the wild-type protein. In a next step, we characterized double cysteine mutants of Mia40 with regard to their ability to rescue the respective depletion (Fig. 2B). The mia40-C1,2S mutant was not able to rescue suggesting an important functional role of these cysteine residues (Fig. 2B). In view of the lethal phenotype of the mia40-C3S mutant, it was surprising that the mia40-C3,6S mutant was able to support growth in the absence of wild-type Mia40. The growth rate, however, was strongly reduced compared with that of wild type cells. Thus, the third cysteine residue appears not to be essential for the function of Mia40. The mia40-C5,6S mutant cells were not viable, whereas the mia40-C4,5S mutant cells showed growth rates comparable to those of wild type cells. The results indicate that only the second cysteine residue is absolutely essential for the function of the protein. In addition to the cysteine mutants, we generated a strain expressing a variant in which the proline residue between the first two cysteine residues of the CPC segment was exchanged to a glycine residue. This proline is also conserved and might be crucial for the function of the neighboring cysteine residues. However, the strain expressing the Mia40 variant containing the CGC segment grew like wild type indicating that this proline residue does not play an important role for the protein (Fig. 2C). Because some of the mutations in Mia40 are lethal in the mia40 deletion strain and thus not applicable for further functional studies, we expressed the variants in a GAL-MIA40 strain, in which the chromosomal MIA40 gene is under control of the GAL promoter (18Terziyska N. Lutz T. Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Mesecke N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Hell K. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Growth of these strains in the presence of glucose allows to successively deplete the wild-type Mia40 and to assess the growth phenotypes of the mutants. In general, the phenotypes observed for the mutant cells reflected those obtained in the disruption background (Fig. 2, D and E). Cells harboring the Mia40-C2S or the Mia40-C3S variant protein were not viable, whereas cells expressing the Mia40-C4S or the Mia40-C5S variant protein grew similarly to the wild-type control. Cells containing the Mia40-C6S variant showed a reduction in growth and also the mutation at the first position (Mia40-C1S) led to slow growth rates (Fig. 2D). The exchange of the first two cysteine residues, as well as the exchange of the fifth and sixth cysteine residue in Mia40 was lethal for the cells. The fourth and fifth cysteine residue could be exchanged without effects on the growth rate. Again, viability of the mia40-C3,6S mutant cells was observed upon depletion of Mia40 in the GAL-MIA40 strain. In summary, mutations of the single cysteine residues in Mia40 affect growth of yeast cells to different extents. Thus, the cysteine residues within Mia40 are not equally important. This strongly supports distinct functions for the single cysteine residues. The Growth Defects Correlate with Defects in the Import of Substrates of Mia40—Next, we analyzed whether the mutations in Mia40 affect the import of small proteins and Erv1 into the IMS, the crucial function of Mia40 (16Chacinska A.

https://openalex.org/W1967040341,"Covalent modifications of histone tails have critical roles in regulating gene expression. Previously, we identified the jumonji (jmj, Jarid2) gene, the jmjC domain, and a Jmj family. Recently, many Jmj family proteins have been shown to be histone demethylases, and jmjC is the catalytic domain. However, Jmj does not have histone demethylase activity because the jmjC domain lacks conserved residues for binding to cofactors. Independently of these studies, we previously showed that Jmj binds to the cyclin D1 promoter and represses the transcription of cyclin D1. Here, we show the mechanisms by which Jmj represses the transcription of cyclin D1. We found that a protein complex of Jmj had histone methyltransferase activity toward histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9). We also found that Jmj bound to the H3-K9 methyltransferases G9a and GLP. Expression of Jmj recruited G9a and GLP to the cyclin D1 promoter and increased H3-K9 methylation. Inactivation of both G9a and GLP, but not of only G9a, inhibited the methylation of H3-K9 in the cyclin D1 promoter and repression of cyclin D1 expression by Jmj. These results suggest that Jmj methylates H3-K9 and represses cyclin D1 expression through G9a and GLP, and that Jmj family proteins can regulate gene expression by not only histone demethylation but also other histone modification."
https://openalex.org/W2003719795,"A growing number of arenaviruses are known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever (HF), a severe and life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever, malaise, and increased vascular permeability. Ribavirin, the only licensed antiviral indicated for the treatment of certain arenaviral HFs, has had mixed success and significant toxicity. Since severe arenaviral infections initially do not present with distinguishing symptoms and are difficult to clinically diagnose at early stages, it is of utmost importance to identify antiviral therapies effective at later stages of infection. We have previously reported that T-705, a substituted pyrazine derivative currently under development as an anti-influenza drug, is highly active in hamsters infected with Pichinde virus when the drug is administered orally early during the course of infection. Here we demonstrate that T-705 offers significant protection against this lethal arenaviral infection in hamsters when treatment is begun after the animals are ill and the day before the animals begin to succumb to disease. Importantly, this coincides with the time when peak viral loads are present in most organs and considerable tissue damage is evident. We also show that T-705 is as effective as, and less toxic than, ribavirin, as infected T-705-treated hamsters on average maintain their weight better and recover more rapidly than animals treated with ribavirin. Further, there was no added benefit to combination therapy with T-705 and ribavirin. Finally, pharmacokinetic data indicate that plasma T-705 levels following oral administration are markedly reduced during the latter stages of disease, and may contribute to the reduced efficacy seen when treatment is withheld until day 7 of infection. Our findings support further pre-clinical development of T-705 for the treatment of severe arenaviral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2036066516,"Background This study uses surveillance, survey and program data to estimate past trends and current levels of HIV in Botswana and the effects of treatment and prevention programs. Methods/Principal Findings Data from sentinel surveillance at antenatal clinics and a national population survey were used to estimate the trend of adult HIV prevalence from 1980 to 2007. Using the prevalence trend we estimated the number of new adult infections, the transmission from mothers to children, the need for treatment and the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and adult and child deaths. Prevalence has declined slowly in urban areas since 2000 and has remained stable in rural areas. National prevalence is estimated at 26% (25–27%) in 2007. About 330,000 (318,000–335,000) people are infected with HIV including 20,000 children. The number of new adult infections has been stable for several years at about 20,000 annually (12,000–26,000). The number of new child infections has declined from 4600 in 1999 to about 890 (810–980) today due to nearly complete coverage of an effective program to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). The annual number of adult deaths has declined from a peak of over 15,500 in 2003 to under 7400 (5000–11,000) today due to coverage of ART that reaches over 80% in need. The need for ART will increase by 60% by 2016. Conclusions Botswana's PMTCT and treatment programs have achieved significant results in preventing new child infections and deaths among adults and children. The number of new adult infections continues at a high level. More effective prevention efforts are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W1964664181,"Mast cells are implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, but the mechanism by which they contribute to disease progression is not clarified. Here we investigated whether mouse mast cell protease-4 (mMCP-4), a chymase present in the mast cell secretory granule, contributes to experimental arthritis. Two models of arthritis were investigated in mMCP-4(+/+) and mMCP-4(-/-) DBA/1 mice: collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced by immunization with collagen II (CII) in Freund's complete adjuvant, and a passive model of arthritis was induced by administration of anti-CII antibodies. The clinical scores were significantly reduced in the mMCP-4(-/-) animals as compared to mMCP-4(+/+) controls in both arthritis models. In CIA, the number of affected paws was lower in the CII-immunized mMCP-4(-/-) mice, with less cartilage destruction, pannus formation, and mononuclear cell and mast cell influx in the mMCP-4(-/-) joints. Interestingly, the lower clinical scores in the CII-immunized mMCP-4(-/-) mice coincided with lower serum levels of immunoglobulin G anti-CII antibodies. Our findings identify a pathogenic role of mMCP-4 in autoimmune arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2014229794,"Prostaglandin D2 activation of the seven-transmembrane receptor CRTH2 regulates numerous cell functions that are important in inflammatory diseases, such as asthma. Despite its disease implication, no studies to date aimed at identifying receptor domains governing signaling and surface expression of human CRTH2. We tested the hypothesis that CRTH2 may take advantage of its C-tail to silence its own signaling and that this mechanism may explain the poor functional responses observed with CRTH2 in heterologous expression systems. Although the C terminus is a critical determinant for retention of CRTH2 at the plasma membrane, the presence of this domain confers a signaling-compromised conformation onto the receptor. Indeed, a mutant receptor lacking the major portion of its C-terminal tail displays paradoxically enhanced Gαi and ERK1/2 activation despite enhanced constitutive and agonist-mediated internalization. Enhanced activation of Gαi proteins and downstream signaling cascades is probably due to the inability of the tail-truncated receptor to recruit β-arrestin2 and undergo homologous desensitization. Unexpectedly, CRTH2 is not phosphorylated upon agonist-stimulation, a primary mechanism by which GPCR activity is regulated. Dynamic mass redistribution assays, which allow label-free monitoring of all major G protein pathways in real time, confirm that the C terminus inhibits Gαi signaling of CRTH2 but does not encode G protein specificity determinants. We propose that intrinsic CRTH2 inhibition by its C terminus may represent a rather unappreciated strategy employed by a GPCR to specify the extent of G protein activation and that this mechanism may compensate for the absence of the classical phosphorylation-dependent signal attenuation.

In contrast, no study has yet addressed structure function relationships of CRTH2 in recombinant cells, and only a single report addresses this topic for the mouse CRTH2 receptor (23Hata A.N. Lybrand T.P. Breyer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32442-32451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, molecular determinants that govern expression, regulation, signaling, or trafficking of human CRTH2, knowledge that could aid in the development of novel therapeutic principles to combat allergic diseases, have yet to be fully elucidated. We suggest that this dearth of information may be due, at least in part, to the poor functional performance of CRTH2 in recombinant expression systems, which are required to study receptor behavior of wild type and genetically engineered variants. During the course of our study, we were intrigued by the poor efficacy of PGD2 causing rather miniscule receptor activation as compared with other bona fide Gi/o-selective receptors. In an attempt to understand the regulatory mechanisms that define the extent of CRTH2 signaling, we have identified the C-terminal tail region of CRTH2 as a key molecular determinant that constrains G protein-dependent signaling events. We propose that CRTH2 utilizes its C-terminal tail to limit acute or chronic overstimulation and that this mechanism might compensate for the absence of the classical negative feedback regulation, which is dependent on the concerted action of G protein-coupled receptor kinases, second messenger-dependent kinases, and arrestin proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Reagents—Tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.

Correctness of the constructs was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing in both directions (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany).Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. To facilitate functional analysis of CRTH2 wild type (WT) and CRTH2 ΔCtail, respectively, stable HEK293 cell clones were established using media containing 500 μg/ml G418 and the FLAG-tagged versions of the receptors. For transient transfections, the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method was used as previously described (7Mathiesen J.M. Ulven T. Martini L. Gerlach L.O. Heinemann A. Kostenis E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For functional inositol phosphate assays, HEK293 cells were transiently cotransfected with CRTH2 WT or CRTH2 ΔCtail and a promiscuous Gα protein facilitating inositol phosphate production by a Gi-selective CRTH2 receptor (25Kostenis E. Martini L. Ellis J. Waldhoer M. Heydorn A. Rosenkilde M.M. Norregaard P.K. Jorgensen R. Whistler J.L. Milligan G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 313: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Membrane Preparation—48 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were harvested, and cell pellets were resuspended in an ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES and 10 mm EDTA. Then cells were ruptured using Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were pelleted (800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the post-nuclear supernatant was then fractionated (30,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) into membrane pellets and supernatants. Pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and stored at -80 °C. Membrane protein concentrations were quantified with protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Whole Cell Binding Experiments—24 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded into poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells/well. Competition binding experiments on whole cells were then performed ∼18-24 h later using 1.0 nm [3H]PGD2 (172 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a binding buffer consisting of HBSS and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Total and nonspecific binding were determined in the absence and presence of 10 μm PGD2, respectively. Binding reactions were conducted for 3 h at 4 °C and were terminated by two washes (100 μl each) with ice-cold binding buffer. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in a TopCount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (27% counting efficiency) after overnight incubation in MicroScint 20. Binding assays using stable HEK293 cell clones were performed as described above. Saturation binding analysis on stable HEK293 cell clones was performed essentially as described previously (7Mathiesen J.M. Ulven T. Martini L. Gerlach L.O. Heinemann A. Kostenis E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing concentrations of [3H]PGD2 (specific activity 172 Ci/mmol) were incubated with cells for 3 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 10 μm unlabeled PGD2.Membrane Binding Experiments—Cell membranes from transiently transfected HEK293 cells (15 μg of protein) were incubated with 1.0 nm [3H]PGD2 (172 Ci/mmol) in a binding buffer consisting of HBSS and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) under continuous shaking at 4 °C for 3 h. Total and nonspecific binding were determined in the absence and presence of 10 μm PGD2, respectively. For inhibition of binding by GTP, varying concentrations of GTP were added to the binding mixture. The receptor-bound radioligand was filtered on a Tomtech 96-well Mach III Harvester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using filters presoaked with 0.1% polyethyleneimine (Filtermat A; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Filtration was immediately followed by three rinses with ice-cold 100 mm NaCl. Thereafter, scintillation wax (Meltilex A; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was melted onto the dried Filtermat. The filters were placed in sample bags (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and filter-bound radioactivity was measured using a Microbeta Trilux-1450 scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Determinations were made in triplicates in two independent experiments.[35S]GTPγS Binding Assays—Scintillation proximity assays were carried out using 15 μg of membrane protein in GTPγS binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 μg/ml saponin) with 50 nCi of [35S]GTPγS, 1 μm GDP, and 0.4 mg of wheat germ agglutinin-coupled scintillation proximity assay beads (RPNQ0001; GE Healthcare), as described before (29Mathiesen J.M. Christopoulos A. Ulven T. Royer J.F. Campillo M. Heinemann A. Pardo L. Kostenis E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1441-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Inositol Phosphate (IP) Accumulation Assays—24 h after transfection, cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well tissue culture plates and loaded with 0.5 μCi of [2-3H]myo-inositol (TRK911; Amersham Biosciences). The next day, cells were washed twice in HBSS buffer (including CaCl2 and MgCl2) and stimulated with the respective agonists in HBSS buffer supplemented with 10 mm LiCl for 45 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by aspiration and the addition of 50 μl of 10 mm ice-cold formic acid/well. After a 90-min incubation on ice, 20 μl of the resulting cell extract was transferred to 80 μl of yttrium silicate scintillation proximity assay beads (12.5 mg/ml; Amersham Biosciences), and shaken for 60 min at 4 °C. Yttrium silicate beads were centrifuged to settle and incubated overnight at 4 °C before counting on a TopCount microplate scintillation counter.cAMP Accumulation Assays—Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells stably expressing either CRTH2 WT or CRTH2 ΔCtail was performed using the HTRF®-cAMP dynamic kit (CIS Bio International, Gif-sur-Yvette cedex, France). In brief, cells were resuspended in assay buffer (HBSS, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and dispensed in 384-well microplates at a density of 50,000 cells/well. After preincubation in assay buffer for 30 min, cells were stimulated with PGD2 in the presence of 5 μm forskolin for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 m KF, and 1.25% Triton X-100 containing HTRF® assay reagents. The assay was incubated 60 min at room temperature, and time-resolved FRET signals were measured after excitation at 320 nm using the Mithras LB 940 multimode reader (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Data analysis was made based on the fluorescence ratio emitted by labeled cAMP (665 nm) over the light emitted by the europium cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP (620 nm). Levels of cAMP were normalized to the amount of cAMP elevated by 5 μm forskolin alone.Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) Assay—BRET assays were performed on HEK293 cells transiently transfected to co-express human CRTH2-Rluc or CRTH2 ΔCtail-Rluc and β-arrestin2-GFP2 (green fluorescent protein 2) fusion proteins, using the Mithras LB 940 microplate reader (Berthold Technologies), as described previously (29Mathiesen J.M. Christopoulos A. Ulven T. Royer J.F. Campillo M. Heinemann A. Pardo L. Kostenis E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1441-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 s after the simultaneous addition of agonist and Deep Blue C, light output was measured sequentially at 400 and 515 nm, and the BRET signal (mBRET ratio) was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence emitted by β-arrestin2-GFP2 (515 nm) over the light emitted by the receptor-Rluc (400 nm).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—24 h after transfection, cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 48-well tissue culture plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well. The next day, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with blocking buffer (3% dry milk, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). For cells expressing the untagged CRTH2 WT or CRTH2 ΔCtail, the primary monoclonal rat anti-CRTH2 antibody (BM16, sc-21798; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and the secondary goat anti-rat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (sc-2006; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Cells expressing the N-terminally FLAG-tagged CRTH2 WT or CRTH2 ΔCtail were incubated with the monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M1 antibody (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies were used as 1:500 dilutions and secondary antibodies as 1:2500 dilutions in blocking buffer. Colorimetric readings were obtained using the horseradish peroxidase-substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) on the Tecan Sunrise reader (Tecan, Switzerland) at 450 nm.Immunocytochemistry—Cells stably expressing either CRTH2 WT or CRTH2 ΔCtail were grown on poly-d-lysine-treated coverslips. When reaching ∼50% confluence, the cells were incubated with M1 antibody directed against the N-terminal FLAG-epitope (1:1,000) for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. A subset of cells were treated with 10 μm PGD2 or left untreated for another 30 min before fixation. Following three washes in TBSC (137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-base, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2), the cells were permeabilized in blotto (3% milk, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b antibody (1:500, 20 min), washed three times in TBSC, and mounted on glass microslides using Vectashield mounting medium.Biotin Protection Degradation Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing CRTH2 WT or CRTH2 ΔCtail were grown to confluence in poly-d-lysine-pretreated 10-cm plates. Cells were treated with 0.3 mg/ml disulfide-cleavable biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min and washed in TBSC (137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-base, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20 min before adding 10 μm PGD2 or left untreated for another 30 min. The two control plates, 100% and strip, remained at 4 °C in TBSC. Except for the 100% plate, all plates were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and remaining cell surface bound biotin was removed in strip buffer (50 mm glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, 1% fetal bovine serum) at 4 °C for 30 min. All plates were then quenched in buffer containing 9 mg/ml iodoacetamide and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by cell lysis in IPB (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, with added protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) and 1 mg/ml iodoacetamide). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies linked with rabbit anti-mouse linker antibodies to Protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C, washed extensively, and treated with peptide:N-glycanase F at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were denatured in nonreducing SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% Tris-glycine precast gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, overlaid with streptavidin (Vectastain ABC immunoperoxidase reagent; Vector Laboratories), and developed with ECL plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences).Dynamic Mass Redistribution (DMR) Assays (Corning Epic® Biosensor Measurements)—A beta version of the Corning® Epic® system was used, consisting of a temperature control unit, an optical detection unit, and an on-board robotic liquid handling device. Briefly, each well in the 384-well Epic® microplate contains a resonant wave guide grating biosensor. The system measures changes in the local index of refraction upon mass redistribution within the cell monolayer grown on the biosensor. Ligand-induced DMR in living cells is manifest as a shift in the wavelength of light that is reflected from the sensor. The magnitude of this wavelength shift is proportional to the amount of DMR. Increase of mass contributes positively and decrease contributes negatively to the overall response. For the Epic® system, the penetration depth is 150 nm (i.e. DMR that takes place within penetration depth can be detected) (30Fang Y. Ferrie A.M. Fontaine N.H. Yuen P.K. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Fang Y. Ferrie A.M. Fontaine N.H. Mauro J. Balakrishnan J. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2080419671,"Apoptosis is induced by caspases, which are members of the cysteine protease family. Caspases are synthesized as inactive zymogens and initiator caspases first gain activity by associating with an oligomeric complex of their adaptor proteins, such as the apoptosome. Activated initiator caspases subsequently cleave and activate effector caspases. Although such a proteolytic cascade would predict that a small number of active caspases could irreversibly amplify caspase activity and trigger apoptosis, many cells can maintain moderate levels of caspase activity to perform non-apoptotic roles in cellular differentiation, shape change and migration. Here we show that the Drosophila melanogaster apoptosome engages in a feedback inhibitory loop, which moderates its activation level in vivo. Specifically, the adaptor protein Apaf-1 lowers the level of its associated initiator caspase Dronc, without triggering apoptosis. Conversely, Dronc lowers Apaf-1 protein levels. This mutual suppression depends on the catalytic site of Dronc and a caspase cleavage site within Apaf-1. Moreover, the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (Diap1) is required for this process. We speculate that this feedback inhibition allows cells to regulate the degree of caspase activation for apoptotic and non-apoptotic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2149060393,"The urokinase receptor (uPAR/CD87) is highly expressed in malignant tumours. uPAR, as a GPI anchored protein, is preferentially located at the cell surface, where it interacts with its ligands urokinase (uPA) and the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin, thus promoting plasmin generation, cell-matrix interactions and intracellular signalling events. Interaction with a complex formed by uPA and its inhibitor PAI-1 induces cell surface down regulation and recycling of the receptor via the clathrin-coated pathway, a process dependent on the association to LRP-1.In this study, we have found that along with the ligand-induced down-regulation, uPAR also internalizes and recycles constitutively through a second pathway that is independent of LRP-1 and clathrin but shares some properties with macropinocytosis. The ligand-independent route is amiloride-sensitive, does not require uPAR partitioning into lipid rafts, is independent of the activity of small GTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, and does not require PI3K activity. Constitutively endocytosed uPAR is found in EEA1 positive early/recycling endosomes but does not reach lysosomes in the absence of ligands. Electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of uPAR in ruffling domains at the cell surface, in macropinosome-like vesicles and in endosomal compartments.These results indicate that, in addition to the ligand-induced endocytosis of uPAR, efficient surface expression and membrane trafficking might also be driven by an uncommon macropinocytic mechanism coupled with rapid recycling to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2019178031,"To understand the mechanism by which amyloid fibrils form, we have been making real-time observations of the growth of individual fibrils, using total internal fluorescence microscopy combined with an amyloid-specific fluorescence dye, thioflavin T (ThT). At neutral pH, irradiation at 442 nm with a laser beam to excite ThT inhibited the fibril growth of β2-microglobulin (β2-m), a major component of amyloid fibrils deposited in patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis. Examination with a 22-residue K3 fragment of β2-m showed that the inhibition of fibril growth and moreover the destruction of preformed fibrils were coupled with the excitation of ThT. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the excited ThT transfers energy to ground state molecular oxygen, producing active oxygen, which causes various types of chemical modifications. The results imply a novel strategy for preventing the deposition of amyloid fibrils and for destroying preformed amyloid deposits.

The results imply a novel strategy for preventing the deposition of amyloid fibrils and for destroying preformed amyloid deposits. Amyloid fibrils are associated with the pathogenesis of more than 20 serious diseases, including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases, and dialysis-related amyloidosis (1Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3815) Google Scholar, 2Cohen F.E. Kelly J.W. Nature. 2003; 426: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Moreover, various proteins and peptides that are not related to diseases can also form amyloid-like fibrils, implying that the formation of fibrils is a generic property of proteins and peptides (1Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3815) Google Scholar). In basic structure, amyloid fibrils are long and often twisted, a few nanometers in diameter, and predominantly composed of cross β-sheets (1Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3815) Google Scholar, 3Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1698: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils are formed spontaneously with a lag phase or seed-dependently without a lag time, indicating that they are formed by nucleation and extension. Further understanding of the structure, mechanism of formation, and roles in amyloidosis is one of the most important issues of protein science today. To study amyloid fibrils, we developed a unique technique for their direct observation in which total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) 2The abbreviations used are: TIRFM, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; β2-m, β2-microglobulin; ThT, thioflavin T; PVS, polyvinylsulfonate; PEI, polyethyleneimine; HPLC, high-pressure liquid chromatography; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; AFM, atomic force microscopy; PDT, photodynamic therapy. is combined with amyloid-specific thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence (4Ban T.

This technique provides important information about the morphology, growth rate, and extension direction of fibrils in real time at the single fibril level.

Yamada T. Odani S. Nakagawa Y. Arakawa M. Kunitomo T. Kataoka H. Suzuki M. Hirasawa Y. Shirahama T. Cohen A.S. Schmid K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1753: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). β2-m, a typical immunoglobulin domain made of 99 amino acid residues and seven β-stands, is present as the nonpolymorphic light chain of the class I major histocompatibility complex (12Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). Renal failure disrupts the clearance of β2-m from the serum and, moreover, β2-m does not pass through the dialysis membrane, resulting in an increase in the concentration of β2-m in blood by up to 50-fold. Although an increase in the concentration of β2-m is the most important risk factor for fibrillation, how β2-m forms amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions is unknown. In vitro at acidic pH, the incubation of β2-m in the presence or absence of seed fibrils results in high yields of amyloid fibrils with a range of different morphologies (13Kad N.M. Thomson N.H.

We have started examining the fibrillation process under these neutral pH conditions with TIRFM combined with ThT. We also compare the formation of K3 fibrils with that of whole β2-m fibrils. When we performed real time observations of β2-m and K3 fibrils at neutral pH, fibril extension stopped during TIRFM. Furthermore, preformed K3 fibrils tended to disappear during the observation period. In this report, we focused on clarifying the effects of the laser beam on K3 fibrils. The results showed that the fibrils were decomposed by the irradiation in which ThT molecules bound to fibrils play critical roles. Our results suggest that it may be possible to selectively breakdown amyloid fibrils coupled with amyloid-specific dyes like ThT, suggesting a new strategy for destroying amyloid fibrils ultimately leading to the prevention and treatment of amyloidosis. Materials—Recombinant human β2-m was expressed with an Escherichia coli expression system and purified as described previously (27Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A Met residue was always present at the N-terminal position of the recombinant β2-m. In this report, chemically synthesized K3 peptides were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan), its purity being >95% according to the elution pattern from reverse phased high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Chemical Modification of Surfaces—Polyvinylsulfonate (PVS: Mr unknown) was purchased from Sigma. Polyethyleneimine (PEI: Mr 60,000) was obtained from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan). The surface of quartz slides was modified by adsorbing polyelectrolytes as described before (6Ban T. Morigaki K. Yagi H. Kawasaki T. Kobayashi A. Yuba S. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33677-33683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The slides were first cleaned with 0.5% (v/v) Hellmanex (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany)/water and then treated with a solution of acetone for 15 min, rinsed extensively with distilled water, and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C. Positively charged surfaces were prepared by the adsorption of PEI by incubating quartz in aqueous solutions of PEI (0.1% w/v). Negatively charged surfaces were prepared by layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes. The former type was created by the adsorption of PVS onto positively charged surfaces of PEI. Direct Observation of Amyloid Fibrils—The TIRFM system used to observe individual amyloid fibrils was developed based on an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) as described (4Ban T. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16462-16465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 5Ban T. Hoshino M. Takahashi S. Hamada D. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The ThT molecule was excited at 442 nm by a helium-cadmium laser (IK5552R-F, Kimmon, Tokyo, Japan). The laser power was 4–80 milliwatt, and the observation period was 3–5 s. The fluorescence image was filtered with a bandpass filter (D490/30, Omega Optical, Bratteboro, VT) and visualized using a digital steel camera (DP70, Olympus). In the case of β2-m, seeds of β2-m were prepared by fragmentation of amyloid fibrils with a TAITEC (Saitama, Japan) VP-30S sonicator equipped with a microtip. The seeds were added at a final concentration of 30 μg/ml to 25 μm (0.30 mg/ml) β2-m in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm SDS. ThT solution was then added at a final concentration of 5 μm. In the case of K3, K3 (100 μm, 0.25 mg/ml) was incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 100 mm NaCl. ThT was added at a final concentration of 10 μm. An aliquot (14 μl) of each sample solution was deposited on each microscopic slide, and an image of the fibrils was obtained with TIRFM. The formation of β2-m fibrils and K3 fibrils on various surfaces was also examined. After the mixing of the solutions of seeds, monomeric proteins, and ThT at the same final concentrations as above, the mixture was immediately deposited on the microscopic slide, tightly sealed with a coverslip, and incubated at 37 °C. Effect of Laser Beam on Preformed K3 Fibrils—To examine the effect of laser irradiation, intermittent irradiation on K3 fibrils was performed. The fibrils formed on the PEI/PVS surface were irradiated by a helium-cadmium laser. The irradiation time was 3–5 s, and the laser power was 40–60 milliwatt. It is noted that the laser irradiation points were also the observation points. Then, the relation between laser power and disappearance of fibrils were examined by observing the fibrils at various laser powers. The fibrils were irradiated for 3 s every 15 min. Fluorescence images of amyloid fibrils visualized with TIRFM were quantified to obtain the time course of fibril destruction. For each TIRFM picture, we calculated the average signal intensity of background (<Ibkg>) and its standard deviation (σbkg) from several parts of the picture where fibrils are absent. Then, we counted the number of pixels whose intensity was larger than the threshold value, which was set <Ibkg>+ 5σbkg. The number of pixels containing fibrils was normalized by that at time 0 under the same laser power. ThT Assay and Light Scattering—To make K3 fibrils, K3 (100 μm) was incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 100 mm NaCl in a test tube at 37 °C. The prepared K3 fibrils were diluted 4-fold with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 100 mm NaCl. ThT was added at a final concentration of 10 μm. The sample was introduced into a glass cell with a 10-mm light path, and then irradiated with a helium-cadmium laser at 442 nm or a helium-neon laser (05LHP928, MELLES GRIOT, Albuquerque, NM) at 632.8 nm continuously under agitation. The laser powers were 30–40 milliwatt and 20 milliwatt for the helium-cadmium laser and helium-neon laser, respectively. To examine the participation of oxygen, the above samples were initially purged with nitrogen or oxygen. When the dissolved oxygen of the sample decreased down to 1 mg/l under nitrogen purging or increased more than 30 mg/l under oxygen purging, the samples were started to irradiate with a laser beam under the purging of nitrogen or oxygen. The laser-irradiated K3 fibrils were monitored by fluorescence analysis with ThT and light scattering. For measurements of ThT assay, the wavelengths for excitation and emission were 445 nm and 485 nm, respectively. For measurements of light scattering, the wavelengths were both set at 350 nm. ThT fluorescence and light scattering were measured using a Hitachi F-7000 spectrofluorometer (Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C. Detection of Singlet Oxygen—To detect singlet oxygen (1O2), singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (Molecular Probes) was used. The reagent was added at a final concentration of 10 μm to the same samples as described in the procedure of “ThT Assay and Light Scattering.” For the measurements of green fluorescence of the sensor reagent, the wavelengths for excitation and emission were 504 nm and 525 nm, respectively. Ultracentrifuge Measurements—Sedimentation velocity of the K3 fibrils after laser irradiation for 48 h was measured using a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Fullerton, CA) with an An-60 rotor and two-channel charcoal-filled Epon cells. The experiments were performed at 4 °C. The data were analyzed using the software Ultrascan 8.0. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography and Mass Analysis—The laser-irradiated K3 fibrils were lyophilized and then dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). The sample was subjected to reverse-phased HPLC performed on a liquid chromatograph (GILSON, Middleton, WI) equipped with a 5C4-AR-300 (4.6 mm × 150 mm; Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan). The sample was eluted with a gradient beginning with solvent A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and an increasing percentage of solvent B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. All peaks were collected and lyophilized. Samples dissolved in TA buffer (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile = 2:1) were mixed with a matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxy acid in TA buffer) at a ratio of 1:1, and then 2 μl was deposited onto a target plate. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics) was used for identification. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)—A sample solution was spotted on freshly cleaved mica. After standing for 1 min, the residual solution was blown off with compressed air. AFM images were acquired using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIa scanning microscope at 25 °C (Veeco, Tokyo, Japan). Measurements were performed in an air-tapping mode. Amino Acid Analysis—Amino acid analysis was performed on a Hitachi L-2000 amino acid analyzer after hydrolysis with constant boiling point HCl (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at 110 °C for 24 h in an evacuated sealed tube. HPLC was carried out on a cation ion exchange column. The amino acids were detected by the reaction with ninhydrin. Effects of Various Surfaces on β2-m and K3 Fibrils—To observe individual amyloid fibrils with TIRFM, it is necessary to investigate the best conditions for fibril growth. First, β2-m and K3 fibrils were grown in test tubes at pH 7.0 and pH 6.0, respectively, based on the conditions established in our previous studies (23Ohhashi Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10814-10821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Yamamoto K. Yagi H. Ozawa D. Sasahara K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 258-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). TIRFM images indicated the presence of short fibrils in each sample (data not shown), confirming that amyloid-specific fluorescence from ThT enables to the visualization of both β2-m and K3 fibrils. Then, we examined the growth of β2-m and K3 fibrils on the surface of various chemically modified slides. TIRFM images taken after incubation for 12 h often showed radial extensions to both fibrils (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the growth of β2-m fibrils was independent of the properties of the surface (Fig. 1, A–C), although that of K3 fibrils varied depending on the surface (Fig. 1, D–F). The growth of K3 fibrils on the negatively charged PEI/PVS surface was explosive (Fig. 1F), while that on the positively charged PEI surface was less extensive (Fig. 1E). The results indicate that the effects of the surface differ depending on the fibrils. It should be noted that both β2-m and K3 are negatively charged at neutral pH: the net charge at pH 7.0 is -3 for β2-m and that at pH 6.0 is -1 for K3 peptide (23Ohhashi Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10814-10821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To observe the fast growth of these two types of fibrils under optimal conditions, in subsequent experiments, β2-m fibrils were extended seed-dependently on the quartz surface and K3 fibrils, on the PEI/PVS surface. Real-time Observations of β2-m and K3 Fibril Growth—First, we observed the seed-dependent growth of β2-m fibrils at neutral pH (Fig. 2A). The laser power was 40–60 milliwatt, and the duration of each irradiation was 3 s. Immediately after the growth was initiated, fluorescent spots of seeds were observed. However, the growth of β2-m fibrils seized during the observation period. Because extensively elongated fibrils were observed in the absence of the laser beam (Fig. 1, A–C), we assumed that the growth was inhibited with time by the laser irradiation. In support of this assumption, β2-m fibrils grew normally under a weaker laser power of 4–6 milliwatt (data not shown). Therefore, the growth of β2-m fibrils critically depended on the laser beam and its intensity. Next, real-time observation of the spontaneous fibrillation of K3 was carried out at neutral pH (Fig. 2B and supplemental Movie S1). The laser power was 40–60 milliwatt, and the duration was 3 s. At time 0, the fibrils of K3 occurred concomitantly at many sites, implying that the short fibrils had already formed in the sample when K3 peptides were dissolved. Although K3 fibrils extended for a while, producing fibrils as long as several micrometers (see image at 15 min), the growth stopped at 30 min. Moreover, the extended fibrils disappeared with time (images from 45–90 min). However, K3 fibrils also grew under weaker laser irradiation (data not shown). This seizing of fibril growth and moreover the vanishing of preformed fibrils were unexpected events. We assumed that the laser beam caused the inhibition of fibril growth and decomposition of preformed fibrils. It is noted that the laser beam was applied to the sample for duration of 3 s when we simultaneously obtained TIRFM images. The rest of the time, the sample was incubated in dark. As described below, another possibility is that the apparent fading of fibril images was caused by photobleaching of ThT retaining the fibrils intact. However, no recovery of fibril images during incubation in dark suggests that the disappearance was in fact caused by the destruction of fibrils. Disappearance of K3 Fibrils with Irradiation—To verify the laser-induced inhibition and decomposition, we studied in detail the molecular mechanism involved using K3 peptide, which showed more dramatic effects than the whole β2-m molecule. In particular, we are interested in the apparent vanishing of K3 fibrils from the TIRFM images. First, we examined the effect of laser irradiation on preformed K3 fibrils. The fibrils formed on the PEI/PVS surface without any irradiation. Following intermittent irradiation, the fibrils slowly disappeared with time (Fig. 3A and supplemental Movie S2). The disappearance occurred locally and discontinuously. These results suggested that K3 fibrils were destroyed by the irradiation coupled with the excitation of ThT. During the laser beam-induced destruction, fibrils vanished concomitantly at various sites in the view (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, radially extended fibrils started to disappear in the vicinity of the growing ends of fibrils (Fig. 3C). However, the cores of clustered fibrils resisted destruction. In these single fiber fluorescence images, the diameters of fibrils cannot be determined exactly. The previous study with electron microscopy indicated that K3 fibrils formed under similar conditions at pH 6.5 are made of two types: one with a diameter of ∼10 and the other with a diameter of ∼5 nm (23Ohhashi Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10814-10821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The former are likely to consist of two latter filaments associated laterally. TIRFM images at various periods were quantified to characterize the time course of the laser beam-dependent fibril disappearance (Fig. 3D, see “Experimental Procedures”). The data points represent all of the irradiation events applied, the duration of which was 3–5 s for each. Overall fluorescence intensity estimated for TIRFM image decreased with time (i.e. with the number of exposure to the laser beam). Next, to examine the dependence on the laser power, the laser power was varied between 8 and 80 milliwatt. The duration of laser irradiation was 3 s every 15 min. The destruction was faster and more extensive with an increase in the laser power (Fig. 3E and supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicated that the disappearance of K3 fibrils is caused by the laser beam irradiation of ThT bound to fibrils. Effects of Laser Irradiation on K3 Fibrils in Bulk Solution—Although TIRFM images suggested the destruction of K3 fibrils triggered by laser irradiation (Figs. 2 and 3), another possibility is that the apparent fading of images is caused by photobleaching of ThT bound to fibrils. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the structure of irradiated K3 fibrils in bulk solution. We first prepared K3 fibrils in a test tube. The fibrils were introduced into a glass cell with a 10-mm light path, and then irradiated with a laser beam at 442 nm by a helium-cadmium laser at a power of 30–40 milliwatt continuously under agitation. As the irradiation proceeded, the intensity of the ThT fluorescence decreased (Fig. 4A). Although the intensity of the light scattering increased temporarily, it slightly decreased after about 10 h. Because of the possible fluctuation of the concentration and length of fibrils, it was difficult to reproduce exactly the intensities of light scattering and ThT fluorescence. However, the difference among the different experimental conditions as shown in Fig. 4 was reproducible, indicating that we can address the effects of laser irradiation on the basis of the relative intensities of light scattering and ThT fluorescence. The transient increase of the light scattering is likely attributable to the aggregation of K3 fibrils induced by the stirring because notable increase was observed for the samples without ThT or laser irradiation. After a long period of irradiation, the light scattering intensity was stable as the decrease in ThT intensity ceased. Although the concentration of ThT we used (10 μm) is close to its CMC (29Khurana R. Coleman C. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Krishna V. Grover R.K. Roy R. Singh S. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), the similar light scattering for the sample with ThT and without laser and that without ThT and with laser (Fig. 4, A and B) suggests that the possible self-aggregation of ThT does not affect the results. It was thought that the saturation of photobleaching of ThT also stopped the decrease in light scattering intensity. However, the results raise the possibility that the agitation during laser irradiation broke the K3 fibrils. Thus, the same experiment was carried without laser irradiation. The intensity of neither the ThT fluorescence nor light scattering decreased notably, confirming that the effects depend on the irradiation (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, when laser excitation at different wavelength (632.8 nm by a helium-neon laser) was used, the results were similar to those without laser irradiation at 442 nm by a helium-cadmium laser (Fig. 4B). Then, to examine the participation of ThT, the experiment was carried in the absence of ThT. The light scattering intensity did not decrease (Fig. 4A), indicating that ThT is directly involved in the decrease. In other words, ThT plays a critical role in the laser irradiation-dependent damage of K3 fibrils. To further investigate the possibility of ThT photobleaching, we added extra ThT (10 μm) to the irradiated samples after 24 h (Fig. 4C). The intensity of ThT fluorescence increased to some extent. However, it was much lower than the level before laser irradiation, confirming that the laser irradiation destructed K3 fibrils. The results also indicated that photobleaching of ThT bound to fibrils partly contribute to the apparent disappearance of ThT fluorescence. As expected, the addition of 10 μm ThT to the sample irradiated in the absence of ThT brought the high fluorescence value of ThT revealing the minimal damage in the absence of ThT. We the"

The current study investigated the impact of this extracellular environment on scleral cell phenotype and cellular biomechanical characteristics. Scleral cell phenotype was investigated in vivo in a mammalian model of myopia using the myofibroblast marker, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). In eyes developing myopia α-SMA levels were increased, suggesting increased numbers of contractile myofibroblasts, and decreased in eyes recovering from myopia. To understand the factors regulating this change in scleral phenotype, the competing roles of TGF-β and mechanical stress were investigated in scleral cells cultured in three-dimensional collagen gels. All three mammalian isoforms of TGF-β altered scleral cell phenotype to produce highly contractile, α-SMA-expressing myofibroblasts (TGF-β3 > TGF-β2 > TGF-β1). Exposure of cells to the reduced levels of TGF-β found in the sclera in myopia produced decreased cell-mediated contraction and reduced α-SMA expression. These findings are contrary to the in vivo gene expression data. However, when cells were exposed to both the increased stress and the reduced levels of TGF-β found in myopia, increased α-SMA expression was observed, replicating in vivo findings. These results show that although reduced scleral TGF-β is a major contributor to the extracellular matrix remodeling in the myopic eye, it is the resulting increase in scleral stress that dominates the competing TGF-β effect, inducing increased α-SMA expression and, hence, producing a larger population of contractile cells in the myopic eye. Reduced extracellular matrix accumulation in the sclera of myopic eyes leads to increased ocular extensibility and is related to reduced levels of scleral transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). The current study investigated the impact of this extracellular environment on scleral cell phenotype and cellular biomechanical characteristics. Scleral cell phenotype was investigated in vivo in a mammalian model of myopia using the myofibroblast marker, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).

These results show that although reduced scleral TGF-β is a major contributor to the extracellular matrix remodeling in the myopic eye, it is the resulting increase in scleral stress that dominates the competing TGF-β effect, inducing increased α-SMA expression and, hence, producing a larger population of contractile cells in the myopic eye. Myopia is a highly prevalent ocular condition, the major symptom of which is blurred distance vision. The primary structural cause of myopia is increased axial length of the eye, and a significant number of myopes (∼15% of myopes or 3% of the general population) have high degrees of myopia and excessively long eyes (>25.5 mm). The outer coat of the eye, the sclera, becomes pathologically thin in highly myopic eyes, the resultant biomechanical instability in turn resulting in damage to the retina and choroid, causing irreversible loss of vision (1Curtin B.J. The Myopias: Basic Science and Clinical Management. Harper and Row, Philadelphia1985Google Scholar).The mammalian sclera is a typical fibrous connective tissue, predominantly constructed of heterotypic collagen fibrils rich in type I collagen (2Norton T.T. Miller E.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 1995; 3517 (Abstr. 3517): 760Google Scholar, 3Zorn N. Hernandez M.R. Norton T.T. Yang J. Ye H.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 1992; 1811 (Abstr. 1811): 1053Google Scholar). Scleral biomechanical changes in pathological myopia are well documented both in humans and in animal models, with the sclera of myopic eyes demonstrating increased extensibility with increasing levels of myopia (4Phillips J.R. Khalaj M. McBrien N.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 2000; 41: 2028-2034Google Scholar, 5Siegwart J.T. Norton T.T. Vision Res.. 1999; 39: 387-407Google Scholar). It is now widely accepted that although the thinner sclera in high myopia contributes to increased extensibility, changes in the biochemical structure of the sclera make an independent contribution to this increased extensibility. The major biochemical contributors to altered scleral biomechanics are reduced scleral collagen content, thinner collagen fibrils, and reduced amounts of sulfated and non-sulfated scleral glycosaminoglycans (6Avetisov E.S. Savitskaya N.F. Vinetskaya M.I. Iomdina E.N. Metab. Pediatr. Syst. Ophthalmol.. 1984; 7: 183-188Google Scholar, 7McBrien N.A. Cornell L.M. Gentle A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 2007; 48: 2947-2956Google Scholar). The overall effect of these changes is a weakened collagen matrix with increased internal stresses.There is substantive evidence of the contribution of extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β. 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β. factors to increased scleral extensibility in myopia. However, data from other connective tissue systems highlight the contribution of contractile cellular elements to tissue biomechanics (10Kasza K.E. Rowat A.C. Liu J. Angelini T.E. Brangwynne C.P. Koenderink G.H. Weitz D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.. 2007; 19: 101-107Google Scholar), suggesting that factors other than the ECM might contribute to scleral biomechanical properties. Indeed two findings demonstrate that scleral mechanical properties may partly be a function of scleral cell physiology. First, rapid (<1 h) shortening of eye length has been shown to counteract high intraocular pressures, a time frame that is not easily explainable by matrix remodeling. Second, scleral cells were shown to express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a cytoskeletal protein characteristic of contractile myofibroblasts (11Phillips J.R. McBrien N.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 2004; 45: 758-763Google Scholar).Myofibroblasts are cells that express a variety of cytoskeletal proteins, most importantly α-SMA, that afford the cell contractile properties (12Hinz B. Celetta G. Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Chaponnier C. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2001; 12: 2730-2741Google Scholar). This contractile capability makes myofibroblasts important in ECM repair and wound contraction (13Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2002; 3: 349-363Google Scholar). There is debate regarding the origin of myofibroblast cells; however, it seems that these cells may arise from a variety of sources, either directly from embryonic mesenchyme through differentiation from fibroblasts or through differentiation from other cell types such as epithelium (14Hinz B. Phan S.H. Thannickal V.J. Galli A. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Am. J. Pathol.. 2007; 170: 1807-1816Google Scholar). The proportion of myofibroblasts within the sclera and their permanence remains to be demonstrated; however, it has been suggested that their numbers increase with age, and it is assumed that they differentiate from scleral fibroblasts (15Poukens V. Glasgow B.J. Demer J.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 1998; 39: 1765-1774Google Scholar). If a permanent population of myofibroblasts exists in the sclera, this would be a rarity in the body and probably occurs because the intraocular pressure puts the scleral matrix under constant tension, one factor that is known to promote myofibroblast differentiation. The process of differentiation of myofibroblasts has been relatively well characterized in other tissue systems, and along with biomechanical stresses, the growth factor transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been shown to play a major role (14Hinz B. Phan S.H. Thannickal V.J. Galli A. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Am. J. Pathol.. 2007; 170: 1807-1816Google Scholar).TGF-β is of primary importance in the regulation of ECM turnover, and the three mammalian isoforms of TGF-β have been shown to regulate collagen production by scleral cells. Furthermore, TGF-β isoform changes, which occur within 24 h of the initiation of myopia development, have been linked to the altered regulation of ECM production found in the sclera of eyes developing myopia (16Jobling A.I. Nguyen M. Gentle A. McBrien N.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 18121-18126Google Scholar).The current study sought to investigate the link between scleral TGF-β levels, the changing scleral extracellular matrix, and the presence and function of myofibroblasts in the sclera during myopic eye growth. The study had three specific aims: 1) to characterize the expression of α-SMA in eyes developing myopia and in eyes starting to recover from induced myopia, thus elucidating changes in the scleral myofibroblast population during altered eye growth; 2) to investigate the capacity of TGF-β to control scleral cell phenotype and contractile properties and determine the cellular capacity to contribute to the overall biomechanical characteristics of the sclera; 3) to investigate the competing influences of TGF-β and stress on scleral myofibroblast differentiation and biomechanical properties, thus determining the mechanism(s) of phenotypic change in scleral cells during myopic eye growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Animals—In all experimental studies, tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) pups were used, with treatment beginning 15 days after natural eye opening. This period is optimal for inducing changes in eye size (17McBrien N.A. Norton T.T. Vision Res.. 1992; 32: 843-852Google Scholar). This mammalian animal model is well established in eye growth studies and has similar ocular anatomy to human (18McBrien N.A. Gentle A. Prog. Retin. Eye Res.. 2003; 22: 307-338Google Scholar). In animals where experimental myopia was induced, they underwent a small surgical procedure to attach a head-mounted goggle, enabling a translucent occluder to be placed over one eye (19Siegwart J.T. Norton T.T. Lab. Anim. Sci.. 1994; 44: 213-215Google Scholar). The unoccluded eye (contralateral control eye) served as a within-animal control for gene expression studies. Right and left eyes were randomized as treated and contralateral control eyes throughout the study. Myopia was induced for 24 h (n = 5) or 5 days (n = 5) during which time the animals were exposed to a 14/10 light/dark cycle, and food and water were available ad libitum. In a separate group of animals (n = 5) myopia was induced for 5 days, after which the occluder was removed, and unoccluded vision was restored for 24 h (recovery group). A group of visually un-manipulated animals (n = 5) was also included to provide normative base-line data. Animals used for cell culture studies were age-matched to the 5-day treatment group (i.e. scleral cells were isolated 20 days post-eye opening). All of the procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia's Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals in Research.Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and trypsin were obtained from Invitrogen; fetal bovine serum was obtained from JRH (Melbourne, Australia); cell culture vessels were obtained from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark) and Flexcell International Corp. (Hillsborough NC); recombinant human TGF-β proteins were obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); collagen type I matrix was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Cellagen; Aurora, OH); PCR primers were obtained from Sigma-Proligo; guanidine thiocyanate, DNase I, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, dNTPs, and RNasin were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI); Fast-Start DNA Master Mix was obtained from Roche Applied Science; RNeasy mini extraction and QIAquick PCR purification kits were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); protein estimation kits were purchased from Bio-Rad (Dc Protein); fluorescent goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, film, and the ECL detection kit were obtained from GE Healthcare; vimentin antibody (H-84) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), whereas the α-SMA monoclonal antibody clone 1A4, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Tissue Collection—After the designated treatment periods, animals were terminally anesthetized (90 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine followed by 120 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital), and the eyes were enucleated. The left eye was always removed first in those animals that had myopia induced to randomize the processing of the treated and contralateral control eye tissue. The isolation of scleral tissue was performed as previously described (20Gentle A. McBrien N.A. Exp. Eye Res.. 1999; 68: 155-163Google Scholar). For gene expression studies, a 7-mm surgical trephine was used to isolate the posterior sclera, which was immediately placed in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at –80 °C until use. For Western blot and cell culture studies, whole sclera was isolated and processed as detailed below.Primary Cell Culture—Primary tree shrew scleral fibroblast cells were established and maintained (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin solution, and 10% fetal calf serum) in culture as previously described (16Jobling A.I. Nguyen M. Gentle A. McBrien N.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 18121-18126Google Scholar). Only cells from passage numbers 2–6 were used, as previous unpublished work had shown these cells to exhibit stable growth curves and morphology.To characterize scleral fibroblast differentiation, scleral fibroblasts were seeded (5 × 104 cells) into 24-well plates and grown until confluent. Cells were subsequently washed and placed in low serum media (growth medium containing 1% serum) for 24 h. The medium was then replaced and supplemented with a combination of TGF-β isoforms (ratio, 2 β1:33 β2:1 β3) at a final concentration of 0.55 ng/ml. This combination matches the observed in vivo TGF-β isoform levels, as described in a previous publication (16Jobling A.I. Nguyen M. Gentle A. McBrien N.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 18121-18126Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for a further 48 h and then isolated for gene expression studies.Collagen Gel Contraction—Scleral cells were seeded in a three-dimensional collagen type I matrix to achieve a final collagen concentration of 2.1 mg/ml, with cell densities ranging from 1 × 105 to 5 × 105 cells/cm3. The cell-populated matrix was added to 24 well plates and polymerized at 37 °C for 15 min, and 1 ml of growth media was overlaid. In a subset of experiments, collagen matrices containing 5 × 105 cells/cm3 were exposed to growth medium containing TGF-β combinations that modeled those found in normal and myopic eye sclerae. The matrices remained attached to the culture vessel walls for 5 days to increase stresses. After this time, the matrix was released from the culture vessel, and the reduction in matrix surface area was quantified over 96 h using a high resolution scanner.Stress Manipulation in Collagen Gels—Matrix stress was manipulated in vitro using the TissueTrain cell culture system (Flexcell Int. Corp.). Using the specialized culture plates, scleral cells (2 × 105) were seeded into a collagen type I matrix (200 μl) and polymerized, and 3 ml of growth media were added. After 48 h, the three-dimensional matrices were washed and placed in low serum media (1% serum) for 24 h. The medium was then replaced and supplemented with a combination of TGF-β isoforms (ratio, 2 β1:33 β2:1 β3) modeling those found in normal and myopic eye sclerae. The matrices were then exposed to either no stress or a static stress (8.5% elongation) for 5 days. The calculated level of static stress was based on normal intraocular pressure (15 mm Hg) and was scaled for volumetric differences between the sclera and three-dimensional gel. After 5 days, the matrices were collected, and total cellular RNA was extracted.Total RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription—For gene expression and stress manipulation studies, total RNA was isolated using phenol chloroform extraction (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem.. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar), whereas commercial silica columns were used for isolation from cultured cells. During extraction, total RNA was treated with DNase I to remove residual genomic contamination, then re-purified and quantified spectrophotometrically. Reverse transcription was carried out using 0.5 μg of total RNA, random hexamer primers (12.5 ng/ml), and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, as per manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was diluted to ∼5 ng/ml and stored at –20 °C until use.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Changes in α-SMA and TGF-β isoform gene expression were quantified using the LightCycler real time PCR machine (Roche Diagnostics) and SYBR Green. mRNA copy numbers were calculated relative to external standards and the housekeeping transcripts hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and ribosomal 18 S. The external standards were produced using tree shrew-specific primers, and the products were purified and quantified at 260 nm. A serially diluted four-point standard curve was included in every amplification protocol, and all samples were amplified in triplicate (Table 1, TGF-β amplification conditions as per the previous publication (16Jobling A.I. Nguyen M. Gentle A. McBrien N.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 18121-18126Google Scholar)). Amplification curves were analyzed using the fit points method (Roche Diagnostics), and group mean data were expressed as the percentage difference between treated eye and contralateral control eye (±S.E.). Differences in gene expression were assessed with paired t tests.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers and quantitative real-time PCR conditionsGenePrimer sequencePCR conditionsForwardReverse[MgCl2]Ann. tempExt. timeSignal temp°Cs°Cα-SMAccgaccgaatgcagaaggacagagctttggctaggaatga3 mm601287HPRTggaggccatcacatcgtagccgacaatcaagacattctttcc4 mm72 → 55128018 Stcgaagacgatcagataccgcgctccaccaactaagaacg3 mm72 → 601585 Open table in a new tab Immunocytochemistry—Tree shrew scleral fibroblasts were grown on collagen type I-coated slides, exposed to the TGF-β combination (as above) for 5 days, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Cell monolayers were treated with the α-SMA and vimentin antibodies (as per manufacturer's protocol) and subsequently incubated with a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 594, respectively). Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the specific staining was visualized on an Axiophot II microscope (Carl Zeiss). Negative controls (minus α-SMA and vimentin antibodies) were performed in parallel.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Sclerae from 24-h treated and contralateral control eyes, and scleral cells treated with or without TGF-β combinations were isolated and homogenized in a tissue lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2)). Insoluble material was removed after centrifugation (10 min at 13 000 × g). Protein content was estimated, identical amounts (40 μg) were loaded onto a denaturing 12.5% acrylamide gel, and the constituents were separated using SDS-PAGE. The method of Towbin and Gordon (22Towbin H. Gordon J. J. Immunol. Methods.. 1984; 72: 313-340Google Scholar) was used for Western blotting. The α-SMA antibody was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1 in 2500 from the manufacturer's stock solution. Bands representing α-SMA were visualized through chemiluminescence.RESULTSScleral α-SMA Expression in Eyes Developing and Recovering from Myopia—Myopia was induced monocularly in tree shrews for 24 h, at which point no changes in eye size were apparent, and 5 days, by which time animals developed high levels of myopia. A subset of the 5-day myopic animals had the myopia-inducing occluder removed and were allowed to start recovering from induced myopia for 24 h, a process that involved a reversal of the axial elongation of the eye.Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of α-SMA protein (myofibroblast marker) in the sclera. Scleral samples from the treated and control eyes of an animal that had had myopia induced for 24 h generated bands at 43 kDa, the expected size for α-SMA, with greater band density in the eye developing myopia (Fig. 1A). The gene expression data confirmed an up-regulated in α-SMA expression in eyes developing myopia; however, this was not significant, and there was substantial inter-animal variability (24 h, +242 ± 172%, p = 0.23; 5 days, +58 ± 74%, p = 0.48; Fig. 1B). In eyes recovering from the induced myopia, there was a rapid and significant decrease in α-SMA expression (–58 ± 5%, p < 0.0005; Fig. 1B). All gene expression data were re-analyzed with reference to a second housekeeping gene (18 S; data not shown), and the results were consistent with the data in Fig. 1B, with no significant difference between the results normalized to either of the two housekeeping genes.Contractile Capabilities of Scleral Cells—To examine the intrinsic mechanical properties of scleral cells, primary cultures of scleral fibroblasts were seeded into attached three-dimensional collagen gels, and the contraction parameters were measured upon release. The composition of the gel was formulated to approximate the in vivo scleral matrix, which is principally (>89%) collagen type 1 (2Norton T.T. Miller E.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 1995; 3517 (Abstr. 3517): 760Google Scholar, 3Zorn N. Hernandez M.R. Norton T.T. Yang J. Ye H.O. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.. 1992; 1811 (Abstr. 1811): 1053Google Scholar). Increasing scleral cell density (1 × 105 cells/cm3 to 5 × 105 cells/cm3) resulted in both an increased initial rate of contraction and a greater maximum contraction after 4 days (two-way analysis of variance F = 8.82; p < 0.0001 for both cell density and time; Bonferroni post-tests showed that 5 × 105 cells was significantly different (p < 0.05 or greater) from 1 × 105 cells at every time point except 0 h; see Fig. 2). The initial exponential increase in matrix contraction (<24 h) exhibited the greatest density-dependent effect, whereas the latter rate of contraction (>24 h) was relatively consistent across the different cell densities. Although there was a progressive decrease in the rapid contractile phase with reducing cell density, the lowest density (1 × 105 cells/cm3) showed no rapid contraction but exhibited a 24-h lag period before any reduction in matrix area could be quantified. This lag period has been previously reported in three-dimensional gel contraction experiments and likely represents the time taken for generation of tractional force and matrix reorganization, among other factors (23Ehrlich H.P. Rittenberg T. J. Cell. Physiol.. 2000; 185: 432-439Google Scholar, 24Redden R.A. Doolin E.J. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim.. 2006; 42: 70-74Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Contractile properties of tree shrew scleral fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were cultured from scleral explants and seeded into attached collagen type I matrices at varying densities (1–5 × 105 cells/cm3). After 5 days the matrix was released, and the reduction in surface area quantified and converted to % contraction of the matrix. Two-way analysis of variance F = 8.82, p < 0.0001 for cell number and p < 0.0001 for time. Bonferroni post-tests showed that 5 × 105 cells was significantly different (p < 0.05 or greater) from 1 × 105 cells at every time point except 0 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TGF-β Influence on Scleral Cell Contraction and α-SMA Expression—Numerous modulators of cell-mediated matrix contraction have been identified in other tissue systems, with TGF-β a consistent key regulator. This growth factor is present within the sclera and has been shown to have an important role in ECM remodeling during myopia development (16Jobling A.I. Nguyen M. Gentle A. McBrien N.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 18121-18126Google Scholar). The capacity of TGF-β to influence the scleral cell contractile properties was determined by adding a physiologically relevant TGF-β isoform combination (see “Experimental Procedures”) to a three-dimensional collagen gel containing 1 × 105 cells/cm3 scleral fibroblasts. This cell density was chosen because it resulted in only limited matrix contraction under normal conditions (Fig. 2). The addition of TGF-β greatly increased the initial rate of contraction (>650%) and maximal contraction (>700%) achieved by scleral cells relative to the limited contraction observed in the no TGF-β control (two-way analysis of variance F = 6.2, p < 0.0001 for TGF-β and time; Bonferroni post-tests showed that the difference between no TGF-β and TGF-β was significant at the p < 0.001 level from the 24-h time point onwards; see Fig. 3).FIGURE 3TGF-β regulation of scleral fibroblast contraction. Collagen matrices containing low cell densities (1 × 105 cells/cm3) were incubated either with or without TGF-β isoform combinations (final 0.55 ng/ml) calculated from in vivo TGF-β concentrations (isoform ratio, 2 β1:33 β2:1 β3; (16Jobling A.I. Nguyen M. Gentle A. McBrien N.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 18121-18126Google Scholar)). After 5 days the matrix was released, and the reduction in surface area was quantified and converted to % contraction. Two-way analysis of variance F = 6.2, p < 0.0001 for TGF-β and p < 0.0001 for time. Bonferroni post-tests showed that the difference between no TGF-β and TGF-β was significant at p < 0.001 from the 24-h time point onward.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The mechanism whereby TGF-β promoted this increase in contraction was investigated through the immunocytochemical identification of α-SMA (myofibroblast marker). Cells were co-labeled with vimentin, a more general cytoskeletal marker of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Although extensive vimentin (red) staining was observed in scleral cells that had not been exposed to TGF-β, limited α-SMA staining (green) was apparent (Fig. 4A). α-SMA was greatly increased in cells that had been exposed to the TGF-β isoform combination, indicative of fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation (Fig. 4, B and D). The α-SMA and vimentin staining was frequently found in the same cytoskeleton, with both being predominantly arranged in linear patterns throughout the cytoplasm of the cell, consistent with labeling of stress fibers within these cells (Fig. 4B). The number of nuclei (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; blue) remained relatively constant in all sections, suggesting that TGF-β had not greatly increased cell numbers. The negative control for the TGF-β-treated cells is also shown (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4TGF-β regulation of scleral fibroblast differentiation. Scleral fibroblasts were seeded onto collagen type I-coated slides and incubated with (B) or without (A) the TGF-β isoform combination (2 β1:33 β2:1 β3; final 0.55 ng/ml; (16Jobling A.I. Nguyen M.

The expression of the myofibroblast-marker, α-SMA (green), and vimentin (red) was assessed using fluorescent immunocytochemistry (×400), and bars represent 50 μm. Cell nuclei were stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the negative control for the TGF-β treatment is shown (C). D, cultured scleral cells either treated with TGF-β or without added TGF-β were homogenized and α-SMA protein expression investigated through Western blots. 40 μg of total protein was loaded, and the protein expression was assessed using anα-SMA monoclonal antibody (clone 1A4).

https://openalex.org/W2070394525,"The NS3 helicase from hepatitis C virus is a prototypical DEx(H/D) RNA helicase. NS3 has been shown to unwind RNA in a discontinuous manner, pausing after long apparent steps of unwinding. We systematically examined the effects of duplex stability and ionic conditions on the periodicity of the NS3 unwinding cycle. The kinetic step size for NS3 unwinding was examined on diverse substrate sequences. The kinetic step size (16 bp/step) was found to be independent of RNA duplex stability and composition, but it exhibited strong dependence on monovalent salt concentration, decreasing to ∼11 bp/step at low [NaCl]. We addressed this behavior by analyzing the oligomeric state of NS3 at various salt concentrations. Whereas only NS3 oligomers are capable of processive unwinding, we found that monomeric NS3 is an active helicase that unwinds with low processivity. We demonstrate that low salt conditions enhance unwinding by monomeric NS3, which is likely to account for the reduction in apparent step size under low salt conditions. Based on results reported here, as well as available structural and single molecule data, we present an unwinding mechanism that addresses the apparent periodicity of NS3 unwinding, the magnitude of the step size, and that integrates the various stepwise motions observed for NS3. We propose that the large kinetic step size of NS3 unwinding reflects a delayed, periodic release of the separated RNA product strand from a secondary binding site that is located in the NTPase domain (Domain II) of NS3. These findings suggest that the mechanism of product release represents an important and unexplored feature of helicase mechanism.

These findings suggest that the mechanism of product release represents an important and unexplored feature of helicase mechanism. The DEx(H/D) proteins represent a large and ubiquitous family of putative RNA helicases (1Gorbalenya A. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol.. 1993; 3: 419-429Google Scholar, 2Pyle A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys.. 2008; 37: 317-336Google Scholar). The members of this highly conserved protein family are present in the vast majority of organisms, from viruses to humans, and are involved in virtually every known aspect of RNA metabolism (3Jankowsky E. Jankowsky A. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2000; 28: 333-334Google Scholar). Despite the importance of these proteins, only a small fraction of them has been well characterized, and the mechanism of their action is poorly understood. Although they are usually called “RNA helicases” because of the NTP-dependent RNA unwinding activity displayed by many DEx(H/D) proteins in vitro, other activities, such as ribonucleoprotein remodeling and RNA strand annealing, have been described for several proteins of the family, and these activities may be relevant to their functions in vivo (2Pyle A.M.

The physiological functions and targets of most DEx(H/D) proteins remain unknown.The nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) from hepatitis C virus (HCV) 3The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide; RNS, randomly nicked substrate; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA. 3The abbreviations used are: HCV, hepatitis C virus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide; RNS, randomly nicked substrate; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA. possesses robust RNA and DNA unwinding activities and is a prototypical member of the DEx(H/D) family of ATPase proteins (7Pang P.S. Jankowsky E. Planet P.J. Pyle A.M. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 1168-1176Google Scholar). NS3 is an essential component of the HCV replication machinery, and it is an important drug target for anti-HCV therapy. NS3 is one of the most exhaustively studied RNA helicases, and a wealth of structural and biochemical information is available for this enzyme (8Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure (Lond.).. 1998; 6: 89-100Google Scholar, 9Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct.

Ensemble and single molecule studies have established that NS3 is a processive helicase, capable of making multiple unwinding steps of well defined size without dissociating from the substrate (11Dumont S. Cheng W. Serebrov V. Beran R.K. Tinoco Jr., I. Pyle A.M. Bustamante C. Nature.. 2006; 439: 105-108Google Scholar, 12Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature.. 2004; 430: 476-480Google Scholar). This stepping behavior involves alternating pauses and rapid unwinding events and is similar to the behavior displayed by cytoskeletal motor proteins. Despite these important findings, the molecular mechanism of NS3 unwinding remains largely obscure. The pauses are likely to be caused by the necessity to reset the conformation of the helicase-RNA complex after each unwinding step, consistent with an inch-worm model of unwinding. However, the mechanism by which pauses are triggered and the role of ATP in this process are not understood. The number of base pairs unwound by NS3 per step appears to be one of the largest reported for helicases to date, and it significantly exceeds the footprint of a monomeric NS3 bound to an RNA substrate (6-8 nt) (8Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure (Lond.).. 1998; 6: 89-100Google Scholar). The structural basis for these large steps is unknown, although it has been suggested that it may be related to the oligomeric state of NS3 in its active form (12Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature.. 2004; 430: 476-480Google Scholar).Kinetic methods have long been employed to study helicase activity, and they provide essential tools for dissecting the mechanism of helicase function (13Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science.. 1997; 275: 377-380Google Scholar, 14Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Nature.. 2000; 403: 447-451Google Scholar, 15Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Google Scholar, 16Lucius A.L. Vindigni A. Gregorian R. Ali J.A. Taylor A.F. Smith G.R. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol.. 2002; 324: 409-428Google Scholar, 17Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 1996; 65: 169-214Google Scholar). One of the fundamental parameters that can be measured is the kinetic step size, which is defined as the number of base pairs unwound per rate-limiting step. The kinetic step size is often reflected in a periodic mode of unwinding that is commonly displayed by processive helicases that make multiple repetitive unwinding steps before dissociating from the nucleic acid substrate (13Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science.. 1997; 275: 377-380Google Scholar).To characterize the mechanism of RNA unwinding by NS3 and to develop a physical explanation for its unusual stepping behavior, we systematically studied the dependence of the NS3 kinetic step size on duplex stability and ionic conditions. We find that the step size of NS3 shows no dependence on duplex stability or sequence, in contrast to its processivity and unwinding rate constant, which have been previously shown to strongly depend on duplex stability (18Cheng W. Dumont S. Tinoco Jr., I. Bustamante C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 13954-13959Google Scholar, 19Donmez I. Rajagopal V. Jeong Y.J. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 21116-21123Google Scholar). However, we observe that the apparent kinetic step size of RNA unwinding by NS3 is sensitive to monovalent salt concentration and is reduced to ∼11 bp under low salt conditions. We address this behavior by analyzing the oligomeric state of NS3 at various salt concentrations. Whereas NS3 oligomers are capable of processive unwinding, we find that monomeric NS3 is an active helicase that possesses low processivity. We demonstrate that low salt conditions enhance unwinding by monomeric NS3 and are likely to account for the changes in kinetic step size of NS3 under low salt conditions. Combining these results with data from previous studies, we propose a physical unwinding mechanism that explains the kinetic step size and the diverse kinetic behaviors that are displayed by NS3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Keck Facility, Yale University. Buffers, salts, and ATP were from Sigma. Phosphorothioate NTPs were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies. Full-length NS3 (genotype 1a) was expressed and purified as described (20Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 358: 974-982Google Scholar). The expressed protein contained a tag of following sequence at its N terminus, MRGSHHHHHHGSDYKDDDDKA. This particular tag, which greatly facilitates NS3 purification, does not influence unwinding step size or functional complex formation characteristics when compared with untagged protein (data not shown). 4V. Serebrov and R. K. F. Beran, unpublished information. Preparation of RNS Duplexes—RNA strands were prepared by T7 transcription of PCR-generated DNA templates using the MEGAshortscript RNA transcription kit (Ambion). For each substrate, the top strand RNA (Fig. 2) was synthesized in four separate transcription reactions. Each of the reactions contained one of the α-phosphorothioate NTPs along with the four regular NTPs. To achieve a suitable level of phosphorothioate incorporation (∼0.7 nicks per top strand upon iodine cleavage), the concentration of each α-phosphorothioate NTP was equal to that of the corresponding NTP (3.5 mm). After transcription, the four RNA products were purified on denaturing PAGE and combined in equimolar proportions to yield a pool of top strand RNAs containing phosphorothioate linkages at random positions. The bottom strands were unmodified RNAs.To prepare RNS duplexes, the pool of top strand RNS oligonucleotides was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and annealed with 2× molar excess of unlabeled complementary bottom strand in the annealing buffer (20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5, 30 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA) by heating to 95 °C and then cooling to room temperature over 30 min. The phosphorothioate linkages in the top strands were then cleaved by addition of iodine to 0.1 mm final concentration and incubating for 15 min at room temperature. The cleaved substrates were then purified by electrophoresis on a semi-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (15% acrylamide, 3 m urea, and 0.5× Tris borate electrophoresis buffer, TBE).NS3 Unwinding Kinetics—Quench-flow unwinding experiments were performed using a model RQF-3 KinTek quench-flow apparatus maintained at 37 °C by a circulating water bath. Prior to initiation of unwinding, the radiolabeled RNS duplexes (2 nm) were preincubated with 200 nm NS3 in the standard reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5, 30 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 37 °C. Unwinding reactions were initiated in the quench-flow apparatus by mixing the preincubated reaction mix with an equal volume of 8 mm ATP and 4 μm trap oligonucleotide in the standard reaction buffer. The oligonucleotide used as a trap for NS3 was a 60-mer DNA with the sequence CATATGAGTCGTATCGTG(T)42. The unwinding reactions were quenched at various times (0.005 to 5 s) with another volume of quench buffer containing 30 mm EDTA, 25% sucrose, 1% SDS, 0.015% xylene cyanol, and 0.015% bromphenol blue. The addition of EDTA and SDS causes NS3 to dissociate from the RNA. Because all partially unwound duplexes immediately reassociate upon NS3 dissociation, only those product lengths that were completely unwound before quenching of the reaction were detected. The quenched reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on a semi-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (15% acrylamide, 3 m urea, 0.5× TBE buffer). No detectable spontaneous duplex dissociation occurred in the gel under these conditions. The electrophoretic bands were visualized and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and Image-Quant software (GE Healthcare). The fraction unwound was determined for each time point and for each RNS duplex length using the following formula: Aunw = Iunw/Iheat, where Iunw and Iheat are relative intensities of electrophoretic bands corresponding to the unwinding reaction and heat-denatured substrate, respectively, corrected for total amounts of radioactivity loaded onto the respective gel lanes.Analysis of Unwinding Time Courses—Individual time courses of NS3 unwinding were analyzed using the analytical solution for Scheme 1 obtained through Laplace transform (37Lucius A.L. Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. Biophys. J.. 2003; 85: 2224-2239Google Scholar) and continuous in both k and n as shown in Equation 1, At(t)=A⋅Γ(kt, n)(Eq. 1) where At(t) is the fraction unwound; t is unwinding time; A is the maximal unwinding amplitude, and Γ(kt, n) is incomplete γ function, defined as shown in Equation 2,The fitting of time courses to Equation 1 was performed using a custom-written script for MATLAB 7.0. This script will be made available at Pyle laboratory website. Fitting was performed individually for each unwinding time course. All unwinding parameters (unwinding amplitude, kinetic rate constant, and number of steps) were allowed to float.RESULTSTo determine the kinetic step size of NS3 under diverse reaction conditions, we conducted unwinding experiments with a combinatorial RNA library of randomly nicked substrates, using methodologies that were previously developed in our laboratory (12Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature.. 2004; 430: 476-480Google Scholar). This approach takes advantage of the fact that NS3 translocates along the “bottom strand” of the duplex and readily displaces “top strand” sequences that contain lesions or discontinuities (Fig. 1) (20Beran R.K. Bruno M.M. Bowers H.A. Jankowsky E. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol.. 2006; 358: 974-982Google Scholar). During the course of unwinding, when the helicase passes a nick, the unwound 5′-portion of the top strand is released, thereby reporting on the progress of helicase translocation and duplex unwinding at a particular location and time. We have employed this approach to examine intermediate states of unwinding using a pool of RNA substrates that contain nicks at random positions in the top strand.FIGURE 1General scheme for the RNS unwinding experiments. The pool of substrates with randomly nicked top strand is created by annealing the 5′-labeled top strand RNA containing randomly incorporated phosphorothioate linkages (less than 1 incorporation per top strand molecule) with the complementary bottom strand, followed by iodine cleavage. NS3 is prebound to the single-stranded overhangs of the substrate molecules in the absence of ATP, and then the synchronized unwinding reaction is initiated by ATP addition. The radioactively labeled 5′-terminal portions of the top strand are released when unwinding of that region is complete and they are subsequently analyzed by gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The nicks are generated by “doping” the top strand with phosphorothioate linkages during the T7 transcription reaction. The top strand RNAs containing phosphorothioates are then 5′-end-labeled with 32P and annealed to the bottom strands, and the phosphorothioate linkages are cleaved by iodine. The resulting pool of randomly nicked substrates is then subjected to an unwinding reaction, and the resultant products are resolved by gel electrophoresis. Because the nick positions are completely random, every possible nucleotide position along the top strand is represented by a fraction of molecules in the substrate pool, and the amount of the unwound product can be independently determined for all the RNS lengths by quantitating the corresponding bands on the gel.To address the influence of sequence on NS3 unwinding parameters, we synthesized four different randomly nicked RNA substrates (Fig. 2). Each of the substrates consists of an RNA duplex that is flanked by a single-stranded 18-nt 3′-overhang that is required for NS3 binding and initiation of unwinding. The overhang sequence was identical for all of the substrates. The length of the duplex part was either 80 (RAND1 and RAND2 substrates) or 82 bp (FLAT1 and FLAT2), to allow for multiple unwinding steps by NS3. The four RNA duplexes used in this study were designed to explore NS3 behavior in a diverse set of environments, with variations in GC content and stability profiles. RAND 1 and RAND2 are substrates of random sequence and average GC contents of 60.0 and 45.0%, respectively. The substrate FLAT1 is composed of the repeating tetranucleotide sequence ACTG, flanked with short irregular sequences (Fig. 2, underlined letters) to ensure proper annealing of strands. The repeat sequence was selected so that the variations of free energy for base pairs within the repeat were minimal, based on the nearest-neighbor rules (21Freier S.M. Kierzek R. Jaeger J.A. Sugimoto N. Caruthers M.H. Neilson T. Turner D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1986; 83: 9373-9377Google Scholar). This results in nearly uniform thermodynamic stability for the repetitive portion of the substrate duplex. The “flat” profile of thermodynamic stability essentially eliminates the idiosyncrasy originating from “rugged” energetic profiles of substrates with random sequences, thereby providing an important control for unwinding behavior that otherwise might be obscured by energetic irregularities of the duplex. Finally, the substrate FLAT2 is identical to FLAT1, with the exception of 7 bp in the middle of the duplex that have been changed to GCCCCCC (Fig. 2, boxed sequence, nucleotides 37-43). This creates a short stretch of RNA duplex that is considerably more stable than the surrounding sequence and has the potential to promote altered unwinding behavior of NS3 (e.g. cause changes in its unwinding periodicity) because of the sudden increase in its “workload.”We carried out time-resolved NS3 unwinding experiments with the four RNS duplexes under identical conditions (37 °C, 4 mm ATP), using a rapid quench-flow mixer. The unwinding reactions were quenched at various times (0.005 to 5 s), and the unwinding products were resolved on a semi-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3A). Each experiment resulted in a series of 30-40 unwinding time courses for various product lengths, all of which could be visualized with single nucleotide resolution (Fig. 3B). With the exception of the shortest resolved RNS lengths, all kinetic series exhibited delayed unwinding kinetics (manifested as lag phases in the unwinding time courses), indicating the presence of rate-limiting intermediate states of unwinding.FIGURE 3A, representative polyacrylamide gel showing separation of the unwinding products after performing a time-resolved RNS experiment with substrate FLAT1. The unwinding reactions were initiated by addition of ATP and terminated at various times (0.005 to 5 s) using a quench-flow mixer, and analyzed on a semi-native polyacrylamide gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The last two lanes on the right are the RNS substrate heated at 99 °C for 5 min (>95% strand dissociation) and a sequencing ladder, respectively.

Lohman T.M. Science.. 1997; 275: 377-380Google Scholar),where n represents the number of rate-limiting steps, and n-1 is the number of populated intermediate states of unwinding (I1, I2,···, In-1). S and P correspond to the substrate and final product, respectively, and k is the kinetic rate constant of each step. Fitting of data to Scheme 1 was performed using Equation 1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For each RNA substrate, the numbers of rate-limiting kinetic steps determined from the NLLS procedure were plotted versus corresponding RNS lengths (Fig. 4). The average kinetic step sizes (bp/step) and associated standard deviations were then determined by linear regression (Table 1). The unwinding rate constants were found to be independent of RNS duplex length within our experimental uncertainty (Table 1). Despite considerable differences in the thermodynamic stabilities of our substrates, we observed an identical unwinding step size (16 ± 1 bp/step) for all of the substrates under our standard unwinding conditions (20 mm MOPS-NAOH, pH 6.5, 30 mm NaCl). This number provides a more precise estimate than that which was previously reported (18 ± 2 bp/step) (12Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature.. 2004; 430: 476-480Google Scholar).FIGURE 4The dependence of the number of rate-limiting steps on RNS duplex length, determined from the analysis of experimental unwinding time courses for each of the RNS substrates. Data for different substrates are shown in different colors as follows: black (RAND1), blue (RAND2), red (FLAT1), and green (FLAT2). The numbers of rate-limiting unwinding steps (symbols) were determined from unwinding time courses by performing the NLLS fitting to Equation 1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Solid lines represent linear fits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of NS3 unwinding on four RNA substratesSubstrateStep size, bp/stepUnwinding rate constant, steps/sRAND116.3 ± 1.11.1 ± 0.3RAND216.5 ± 1.00.9 ± 0.2FLAT116.3 ± 1.11.3 ± 0.2FLAT215.9 ± 1.01.5 ± 0.3Average16.3 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Step Size of NS3 Unwinding Is Sensitive to Monovalent Salt Concentration—It was previously proposed that the large kinetic step size exhibited by NS3 in bulk is the consequence of NS3 dimerization on the RNA substrate (12Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature.. 2004; 430: 476-480Google Scholar). However, additional insights were provided by high resolution single molecule studies using optical tweezers (11Dumont S. Cheng W. Serebrov V. Beran R.K. Tinoco Jr., I. Pyle A.M. Bustamante C. Nature.. 2006; 439: 105-108Google Scholar, 18Cheng W. Dumont S. Tinoco Jr., I. Bustamante C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 13954-13959Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated that, under conditions of relatively high pulling force, NS3 unwinds RNA duplexes with a somewhat smaller step size of 11 ± 3 bp, which was attributed to unwinding by a monomeric form of NS3. Significantly, NS3 requires relatively high pulling forces to behave as a processive helicase in the optical trap.To better understand the relationship between step size, oligomerization state, NS3 affinity, and structural integrity of the duplex, we examined the kinetic step size for NS3 under different monovalent salt conditions. RNS unwinding experiments were conducted in a reaction buffer that contained varying concentrations of NaCl (from 0 to 100 mm, in addition to 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5). The numbers of unwinding steps for different RNS duplex lengths were determined by fitting the resultant time courses to Equation 1 for substrate FLAT1 under various salt concentrations (Fig. 5A). The kinetic step sizes at different salt concentrations were determined from the slope of the linear fit to the data, revealing a substantial dependence of step size on monovalent salt concentration (Fig. 5B). Indeed, under conditions of lowest ionic strength, the NS3 step size reduces to 11 bp, which is exactly the value observed in the optical tweezer experiments.FIGURE 5The apparent kinetic step size of RNA unwinding by NS3 is sensitive to monovalent salt concentration. A, numbers of kinetic steps determined for the substrate FLAT1 at 0, 30, and 60 mm NaCl (in addition to 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.5) plotted versus RNS duplex length.

To study the kinetics of functional complex formation, we performed “double mixing” experiments (Fig. 6), in which the single cycle reaction amplitude of NS3 unwinding (Aunw) is measured as a function of time of preincubation of NS3 with RNA substrate. It has been established that, under single cycle conditions, Aunw is dependent on both functional complex concentration and RNA duplex length (13Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science.. 1997; 275: 377-380Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 3, Γ(kt, n)≡∫0kttn−1e−1dtI∫0∞tn−1e−1dt(Eq. 2) where [EnS*] is concentration of NS3-RNA functional complex; p is processivity per unwinding step; L is the duplex length, and s is unwinding step size.FIGURE 6Top, the general scheme of formation of functional NS3-RNA complex, where S is an RNA substrate; E is NS3 protein; P is unwound product; EnS* is the functional complex, and n is number of NS3 molecules bound to the RNA substrate in the functional complex. Bottom, the experimental design of functional complex formation experiments. The RNA substrate is preincubated with NS3 for variable time Δt, after which unwinding is initiated by the addition of ATP and trap oligonucleotide. The trap oligonucleotide is included to sequester any unbound protein and to prevent re-binding of NS3 to the RNA substrate during the unwinding reaction (single cycle unwinding conditions). The unwinding reactions are allowed to proceed to completion (90 s), after which unwinding amplitudes (Aunw) are determined for each Δt by resolving the unwound products by native PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Equation 3 describes the relationship between the measured amount of unwound product and the concentration of the functional complex. One important implication of Equation 3 is that if observed unwinding is produced by a homogeneous population of active NS3 species, then the kinetics of functional complex formation measured with different RNA duplex lengths should be identical and differ only in their amplitudes. However, if unwinding results from a heterogeneous mixture of functionally active species (e.g. different oligomeric states of NS3), and at least some of these species have substantially different levels of processivity, then different kinetics of functional complex formation can be observed for different RNA duplex lengths. For instance, if nonprocessive species are present, they will only contribute to kinetics of functional complex formation measured with very short RNA duplexes. Measuring functional complex formation kinetics with duplexes of variable length can therefore enable one to resolve different active species of NS3.To establish if NS3 unwinding can be at"
https://openalex.org/W2041730920,"Background The primary cilium is a sensory organelle generated from the centrosome in quiescent cells and found at the surface of most cell types, from where it controls important physiological processes. Specific sets of membrane proteins involved in sensing the extracellular milieu are concentrated within cilia, including G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Most GPCRs are regulated by β-arrestins, βarr1 and βarr2, which control both their signalling and endocytosis, suggesting that βarrs may also function at primary cilium. Methodology/Principal Findings In cycling cells, βarr2 was observed at the centrosome, at the proximal region of the centrioles, in a microtubule independent manner. However, βarr2 did not appear to be involved in classical centrosome-associated functions. In quiescent cells, both in vitro and in vivo, βarr2 was found at the basal body and axoneme of primary cilia. Interestingly, βarr2 was found to interact and colocalize with 14-3-3 proteins and Kif3A, two proteins known to be involved in ciliogenesis and intraciliary transport. In addition, as suggested for other centrosome or cilia-associated proteins, βarrs appear to control cell cycle progression. Indeed, cells lacking βarr2 were unable to properly respond to serum starvation and formed less primary cilia in these conditions. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that βarr2 is localized to the centrosome in cycling cells and to the primary cilium in quiescent cells, a feature shared with other proteins known to be involved in ciliogenesis or primary cilium function. Within cilia, βarr2 may participate in the signaling of cilia-associated GPCRs and, therefore, in the sensory functions of this cell “antenna”."
https://openalex.org/W1991521210,"Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is a non-inhibitory serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) that transports cortisol and progesterone in blood. Crystal structures of rat CBG and a thrombin-cleaved human CBG:anti-trypsin (Pittsburgh) chimera show how structural transitions after proteolytic cleavage of the CBG reactive center loop (RCL) could disrupt steroid binding. This ligand release mechanism is assumed to involve insertion of the cleaved RCL into the β-sheet A of the serpin structure. We have, therefore, examined how amino acid substitutions in the human CBG RCL influence steroid binding before and after its cleavage by neutrophil elastase. Elastase-cleaved wild-type CBG or variants with substitutions at P15 and/or P16 (E334G/G335N or E334A) lost steroid binding completely, whereas deletion of Glu-334 resulted in no loss of steroid binding after RCL cleavage, presumably because this prevents its insertion into β-sheet A. Similarly, the steroid binding properties of CBG variants with substitutions at P15 (G335P), P14 (V336R), or P12 (T338P) in the RCL hinge were largely unaffected after elastase cleavage, most likely because the re-orientation and/or insertion of the cleaved RCL was blocked. Substitutions at P10 (G340P, G340S) or P8 (T342P, T342N) resulted in a partial loss of steroid binding after proteolysis which we attribute to incomplete insertion of the cleaved RCL. Remarkably, several substitutions (E334A, V336R, G340S, and T342P) increased the steroid binding affinities of human CBG even before elastase cleavage, consistent with the concept that CBG normally toggles between a high affinity ligand binding state where the RCL is fully exposed and a lower affinity state in which the RCL is partly inserted into β-sheet A.

Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and it regulates the bioavailability of steroids that control numerous physiological processes including reproduction, inflammation, stress responses, and tissue development (2Hammond G.L. Obstet. Gynecol. Clin. North Am. 2002; 29: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because CBG binds up to 90% of the glucocorticoids in blood plasma, it serves as a reservoir of anti-inflammatory steroids that can be released at their sites of action (3Breuner C.W. Orchinik M. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 175: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The latter concept was proposed when it was discovered that human CBG exhibits remarkable sequence identity with the archetypal serine proteinase inhibitor, α1-anti-trypsin (AAT), and was based on the realization that CBG might also be a target of specific classes of proteinases (4Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Goping I.S. Underhill D.A. Harley M.J. Reventos J. Musto N.A. Gunsalus G.L. Bardin C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5153-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The close structural relationship between CBG and AAT defines it as a clade A serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family member (5Law R.H. Zhang Q. McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Silverman G.A. Wong W. Rosado C.J. Langendorf C.G. Pike R.N. Bird P.I. Whisstock J.C. Genome Biology. 2006; 7: 216Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Many of these serpin A family members, including CBG, are encoded by genes in the human 14q21.1 chromosome cluster and are thought to have arisen by gene duplication to produce serpins with similar properties and physiological functions (6Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Unlike most clade A serpins, CBG is not known to act as a proteinase inhibitor but appears to be a suicide substrate of specific proteinases and is particularly sensitive to attack by neutrophil elastase, the activity of which is normally controlled by AAT (7Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Underhill D.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Structurally, serpins are defined by a single core domain of three β-sheets (termed A, B, and C) and 8–9 α-helices (termed hA-hI) (6Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). For inhibitory serpins in the native state, a reactive center loop (RCL) is fully exposed for target proteinases to recognize and interact. Upon cleavage by proteinase, the RCL is inserted into β-sheet A to form a novel β-strand (s4A), which results in a profound “stressed to relaxed” (S→R) conformational transition (8Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The S→R transition is associated with an increase in thermostability and is crucial for the inhibitory mechanism that yields the serpin-proteinase complex. Intriguingly, the RCLs are perhaps the most poorly conserved regions of individual serpins with the same function (6Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), and the reasons for this are not fully understood. It has been proposed that the serpin structure has been adapted by CBG and the closely related thyroxin-binding globulin to control hormone release at their sites of action after the RCL is cleaved by proteinases (9Pemberton P.A. Stein P.E. Pepys M.B. Potter J.M. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1988; 336: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 10Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Paterson N.A. Sibbald W.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

This is based on evidence that the S→R conformational transition of CBG is accompanied by a marked increase in thermostability (9Pemberton P.A. Stein P.E. Pepys M.B. Potter J.M. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1988; 336: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and decrease in steroid binding affinity (9Pemberton P.A. Stein P.E. Pepys M.B. Potter J.M. Carrell R.W.

Metab. 1990; 71: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) after cleavage by neutrophil elastase. Recently we showed the 1.9 Å crystal structure of cortisol-bound rat CBG displays a typical native serpin conformation, with the RCL fully exposed from the β-sheet A (13Klieber M.A. Underhill C. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29594-29603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a thrombin-cleaved human CBG-AAT chimera has since been reported in which the RCL of human CBG was replaced with an AAT (Pittsburg) variant sequence (14Zhou A. Wei Z. Stanley P.L. Read R.J. Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), presumably to facilitate cleavage by thrombin. In this structure the cleaved AAT RCL was fully incorporated into the β-sheet A of CBG, and soaking the crystals in cortisol led to the surprising observation that the cortisol-binding site of the cleaved CBG-AAT chimera adopts a configuration that resembles that of native CBG (14Zhou A. Wei Z. Stanley P.L. Read R.J. Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, elastase cleavage of CBG results in an irreversible loss of steroid binding that cannot be restored by adding an excess of steroid ligand (9Pemberton P.A. Stein P.E. Pepys M.B. Potter J.M. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1988; 336: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 10Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Paterson N.A. Sibbald W.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and crystal packing effects and high ligand soaking concentrations might have allowed the binding of cortisol with low affinity to the cleaved CBG-AAT chimera. Moreover, the effect of replacing the CBG RCL with the corresponding AAT (Pittsburgh) sequence may itself have influenced steroid binding because previous studies have indicated that human thyroxin-binding globulin-AAT chimeras containing various AAT RCL sequences have either increased or reduced ligand binding affinities (15Grasberger H.

It should also be noted that the proteolytic cleavage site (P1-P1′) in human AAT (16Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) differs in location to that in human CBG, i.e. Val-344—Thr-345, which correspond to the P6 and P5 residues in the AAT RCL (9Pemberton P.A. Stein P.E. Pepys M.B. Potter J.M. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1988; 336: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In other words, the cleaved RCL of human CBG is five residues shorter than that of AAT or the AAT (Pittsburgh) variant, and thus, the composition and length of the cleaved RCL in the thrombin-cleaved human CBG-AAT chimera structure (14Zhou A. Wei Z. Stanley P.L. Read R.J. Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) are likely quite different from those in normal human CBG. Analyses of the human CBG-AAT chimera structure (14Zhou A. Wei Z. Stanley P.L. Read R.J. Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also led to the conclusion that a flip-flop movement of the intact RCL into and out of β-sheet A allows the equilibrated release of cortisol, but direct evidence for this is lacking. To address the issue in a different way, we have substituted specific residues within the RCL of human CBG and determined how this influences its proteolytic cleavage by neutrophil elastase in relation to its cortisol binding properties. This has not only enabled us to identify key residues within the RCL that control the S→R transition of CBG, which results in hormone release, but has provided evidence that partial insertion of the intact RCL within the human CBG β-sheet A exerts an allosteric effect on its cortisol binding activity.

One day later, cells were sub-cultured at a dilution of 1:10 and selected in the presence of 1.5 mg/ml neomycin (Invitrogen) for 1 week. Stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells were then grown to near confluence. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were cultured for 4 days in phenol red-free, high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 nm cortisol. The culture media were collected, dialyzed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 nm cortisol at 4 °C overnight, and subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography column (GE Healthcare) to semi-purify the recombinant CBGs for functional analysis. Elastase Digestion—Human neutrophil elastase (Elastin Products Co., Inc., Owensville, MO) was reconstituted in 0.05 m NaAc (pH 5.0) and 0.1 m NaCl. Unless otherwise stated, elastase digestions were performed with 1 μg of semi-purified CBGs and 0.05 μg of elastase for 5 min at 37 °C, as described previously (10Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Paterson N.A. Sibbald W.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Reaction products were analyzed by Western blotting after reduction by boiling in the presence of 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol and 1% SDS. Human neutrophil elastase typically cleaves human CBG in a single location and reduces its apparent molecular mass by 5 kDa, which can be resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, as described previously (10Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Paterson N.A. Sibbald W.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (5% stacking and 10% separating gels) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation with blocking buffer (5% fat-free milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20), blots were incubated with rabbit anti-human CBG anti-serum at a 1:1000 dilution (18Robinson P.A. Langley M.S. Hammond G.L. J. Endocrinol. 1985; 104: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were further detected with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce) by exposure to x-ray film. Steroid Binding Analyses—[1,2-3H]Cortisol (55 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled steroids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The steroid binding capacities of equivalent amounts of immuno-reactive CBGs, determined by Western blotting, were then assayed by a routine saturation analysis employing [3H]cortisol as the labeled ligand and dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) as a separation agent (19Hammond G.L. Lahteenmaki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To compare the steroid binding capacities of CBG before and after elastase cleavage, purified protein was first stripped of endogenous steroid by incubation with DCC for 30 min at room temperature and then saturated with an excess of [3H]cortisol for 1 h at room temperature. Half of the [3H]cortisol-saturated proteins were then subjected to elastase cleavage, as described above, whereas the remainder was held under the same conditions without the addition of elastase. Aliquots of cleaved and uncleaved CBG-[3H]cortisol complexes were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the rest was rapidly chilled and used to measure the amount of bound [3H]cortisol in samples after absorption of free steroid with DCC for 10 min at 0 °C (19Hammond G.L. Lahteenmaki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation rates of CBG-bound [3H]cortisol were also assessed by the exposure of the cleaved or non-treated [3H]cortisol-saturated sample to DCC for different time intervals at 0 °C (19Hammond G.L. Lahteenmaki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, equilibrium binding constants of untreated wild-type CBG and the CBG variants were determined by Scatchard analysis using [3H]cortisol as the labeled ligand (19Hammond G.L. Lahteenmaki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Amino Acid Substitutions at P16 and P15 in the Human CBG RCL Type I β-Turn—Alignment of the CBG sequences from different mammalian species, including human (NCBI accession code NP_001747), rat (NP_001009663), mouse (NP_031644), rabbit (P23775), pig (AAG45431), and sheep (CAA52000) against human AAT (NP_000286) shows that their RCL sequences are hyper-variable (Fig. 1A). The numbering of residues in the RCL is generally made in relation to the P1-P1′ (Met-Ser) proteinase cleavage site of human AAT (Fig. 1A). Although the normal elastase cleavage sites of human CBG and AAT are in quite different locations within their RCLs (Fig. 1A), neutrophil elastase will cleave AAT in almost the same relative (P6-P7) location as the CBG cleavage site at P5-P6 (Fig. 1A) if the Met residue at P1 in human AAT is oxidized (20Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Sinha S. Travis J. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amino acid substitutions we have made within the CBG RCL (Fig. 1B) are also shown in relation to the P1-P1′ cleavage site in AAT together with a model of how the cleaved CBG RCL is thought to reposition itself between the β-strands s5A and s3A. We first examined the effects of several substitutions within the type I β-turn of the RCL (residues 332 to 335) and focused our attention on Glu-334 and Glu-335 in human CBG to determine whether they represent critical elements of the hinge that allows repositioning of the RCL after proteinase cleavage (Fig. 1B). The amino terminus of the CBG RCL is not well conserved across species and in human CBG is represented by Glu-334 at P16 (Fig. 1A). By contrast, the Glu-335 at P15 in human CBG is conserved in mammalian species apart from rodents (Fig. 1A). However, it has been suggested that the glycine residue at P16 in rodent CBGs plays an equivalent role to Glu-335 in human CBG in allowing the RCL to reposition itself after cleavage (13Klieber M.A. Underhill C. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29594-29603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We, therefore, first converted the P16 (Glu-334) and P15 (Gly-335) residues of the human CBG RCL into the corresponding residues in rat CBG, i.e. Gly-334 and Asn-335, and tested this mutant for its ability to be cleaved by neutrophil elastase and to bind steroid before and after elastase cleavage. As in the case of wild-type CBG, it is evident that these amino acid substitutions do not limit elastase cleavage, as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A), or influence the loss of steroid binding capacity that typically occurs after proteolysis of the RCL of human CBG (Fig. 2B). The Western blotting data (Fig. 2A) show the typical reduction in the apparent size of human CBG by about 5 kDa, consistent with the loss of the 39 carboxyl-terminal residues that are not recognized by our antibodies after cleavage by elastase (21Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Underhill C.M. Nguyen V.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The steroid binding activities of various CBG mutants were also compared with wild-type CBG in a simple assay to assess the apparent rate of [3H]cortisol dissociation from their steroid-binding sites before and after treatment with elastase (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Although this method provides an indirect measure of binding affinity, it can be performed immediately after elastase treatment, thereby circumventing further proteolysis of CBG beyond cleavage of the RCL, which can be monitored in parallel by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). In the cases of wild-type CBG and the E334G/G335N human CBG variant, elastase cleavage clearly results in a substantial (5–10-fold) reduction in the amount of [3H]cortisol bound to the proteins (Fig. 3, left panels of A and B). The small amount of specifically bound [3H]cortisol that remains after the 5-min elastase treatment likely represents the sum of (a) the steroid binding of residual uncleaved proteins and (b) the contribution made by the relative large amounts of cleaved proteins with much reduced binding affinity. To assess this further, we expressed the bound [3H]cortisol at each time point of DCC exposure as a percentage of the extrapolated values at the zero time point, and this shows that the dissociation of [3H]cortisol from these proteins after elastase cleavage is only about 50% faster than that measured for the intact proteins (Fig. 3, right panels of A and B). We, therefore, conclude that the bound [3H]cortisol, remaining after elastase cleavage, primarily reflects binding to a small amount of intact proteins plus a minor contribution from the cleaved proteins from which [3H]cortisol dissociates very much more rapidly and which would be very difficult to accurately measure. To assess the individual contributions of Glu-334 and Glu-335 to the loss of steroid binding from the E334G/G335N CBG variant after elastase cleavage, we first focused on Glu-334 and either deleted it or substituted it with an alanine residue. Because the glutamic acid (Glu-333) at P17 in human CBG is highly conserved in serpin structures (Fig. 1A), deletion of Glu-334 would mean that the Glu-335 would still be adjacent to the P17 glutamic acid, as it is in rat CBG (Fig. 1A). The loss of Glu-334 had no impact on the cleavage of CBG by elastase (Fig. 2A), but surprisingly, its binding capacity after elastase cleavage was essentially unchanged (Fig. 2B). This was confirmed in our assay of the apparent dissociation of [3H]cortisol from its binding site when expressed either in terms of the actual amounts (cpm) of bound [3H]cortisol (Fig. 3C, left panel) or a percentage of the bound counts remaining at set time points after DCC exposure (Fig. 3C, right panel). By contrast, when the Glu-334 in human CBG was substituted with an alanine residue and this variant was cleaved by elastase (Fig. 2A), it clearly behaved like the wild-type protein and lost about 80% of its [3H]cortisol binding capacity (Figs. 2B and 3D). We then replaced the P15 Glu-335 with proline to stiffen the segment of the RCL that is tethered to s5B, as the reduced flexibility should greatly impair conformational changes in this region during RCL insertion. When this G335P CBG variant was examined, we found that it retained its steroid binding activity after proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 2, A and B), and this was confirmed in our dissociation rate assay (Fig. 3E). In Western blotting experiments the G335P variant and two other variants (T338P/A339N and G340P) were consistently less immuno-reactive after elastase cleavage, without any evidence of more extensive proteolysis, and we attribute this to the loss of an epitope within the cleaved RCL. Amino Acid Substitutions at P14 and P12 of the CBG RCL Have Profound Effects on Steroid Binding—When we replaced the Val-336 at P14 of human CBG with a large, charged residue (arginine), this did not influence its cleavage by elastase (Fig. 4A). Moreover, cleavage of the V336R variant did not reduce its steroid binding capacity (Fig. 4B) or the rate of [3H]cortisol dissociation from its binding site (Fig. 5A). We also substituted the Thr-338 at P12 with a proline alone or together with an A339N substitution at P11 because this would then introduce an N-glycosylation site, as found in the corresponding position within the rat CBG RCL (Fig. 1A). As in the case of the V336R CBG variant, the T338P and T338P/A339N substitutions had no effect on the proteolytic cleavage of the RCL by elastase (Fig. 4A), and their steroid binding capacities appeared to even increase after elastase cleavage (Fig. 4B). In the case of the T338P and T338P/A339N human CBG variants, the latter observation was confirmed in our analysis of the rate of [3H]cortisol dissociation from their binding sites before and after elastase cleavage (Fig. 5, B and C, respectively). However, in these cases it appears that the rate of [3H]cortisol dissociation from the elastase-cleaved proteins is slightly more rapid than from their intact counterparts (Fig. 5, B and C).FIGURE 5Dissociation of [3H]cortisol from untreated and elastase-cleaved P14 Val-336, P12 Thr-338, and P11 Ala-339 human CBG variants. DCC was added to [3H]cortisol-saturated CBGs (untreated or elastase-cleaved) at 0 °C, and the samples were incubated for 5, 10, 15, or 20 min at 0 °C before centrifugation to separate CBG-bound from free [3H]cortisol. Aliquots of the corresponding samples were also run on a Western blot to confirm the cleavage by elastase, as illustrated in Fig. 4A. A, V336R CBG. B, T338P/A339N CBG. C, T338P CBG. The results are presented as CBG-bound [3H]cortisol in cpm (left panel) or the percentage of the CBG-bound [3H]cortisol at different times of DCC exposure in relation to the extrapolated CBG-bound [3H]cortisol at zero time of DCC exposure (right panel).

To further assess this, the apparent dissociation rates of [3H]cortisol from the native and elastase-cleaved forms of these variants were measured. As shown in Fig. 7, the [3H]cortisol binding capacities of the G340P, G340S, and T342N CBG variants were reduced (left panel), and their [3H]cortisol dissociation rates were clearly increased (right panel) after elastase cleavage, thus indicating that the steroid binding properties of these CBG variants are not completely disrupted when their RCLs are cleaved.FIGURE 7Dissociation of [3H]cortisol from untreated and elastase-cleaved P10 Gly-340 and P8 Thr-342 human CBG variants.

https://openalex.org/W1996353320,"The quality of gene expression microarray data has improved dramatically since the first arrays were introduced in the late 1990s. However, the reproducibility of data generated at multiple laboratory sites remains a matter of concern, especially for scientists who are attempting to combine and analyze data from public repositories. We have carried out a study in which a common set of RNA samples was assayed five times in four different laboratories using Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. We observed dramatic differences in the results across laboratories and identified batch effects in array processing as one of the primary causes for these differences. When batch processing of samples is confounded with experimental factors of interest it is not possible to separate their effects, and lists of differentially expressed genes may include many artifacts. This study demonstrates the substantial impact of sample processing on microarray analysis results and underscores the need for randomization in the laboratory as a means to avoid confounding of biological factors with procedural effects."

Here, we examine the kinetics and molecular determinants of different modes of synaptic vesicle recycling at a peripheral neuronal synapse formed between superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture, via acute disruption of endocytosis with Dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin activation, or a dynamin peptide (P4) that perturbs linkage of dynamin to clathrin coats through amphiphysin. When paired action potentials are generated to produce excitatory postsynaptic potential responses, the second response was reduced after application of Dynasore but not P4. In addition, graded reduction in synaptic transmission during a train of action potentials was accelerated by Dynasore but enhanced by P4. After full depletion of releasable vesicles, P4 delayed the recovery of synaptic transmission while Dynasore limited recovery to 10%. In control neurons, synaptic transmission is stable for more than 1 h under low frequency presynaptic stimulation (0.2 Hz), but was reduced gradually by P4 and rapidly but incompletely blocked by Dynasore at a much lower stimulation frequency. These results suggest two essential modes of dynamin-mediated synaptic vesicle recycling, one activity-dependent and the other activity-independent.

However, in the calyx of Held, a dynamin-independent endocytosis was detected in the presence of Dynasore (28Xu J. McNeil B. Wu W. Nees D. Bai L. Wu L.G. Nat.

To investigate this issue, we studied the cholinergic synapse formed between rat SCG neurons in culture (29Ma H. Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this model system, it is possible to introduce reagents directly into presynaptic terminals by microinjection, and their effect on acetylcholine release evoked by action potentials can be monitored by recording EPSPs from neighboring neurons (29Ma H. Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Mochida S. Kobayashi H. Matsuda Y. Yuda Y. Muramoto K. Nonomura Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). By perturbing dynamin function with either P4 peptide or Dynasore, we examine both activity-dependent and -independent modes of endocytosis, as well as dynamin-dependent and -independent pathways for refilling of the RRP in sympathetic neurons. Cultured SCG neurons were prepared as described previously (29Ma H. Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Mochida S. Kobayashi H. Matsuda Y. Yuda Y. Muramoto K. Nonomura Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, SCG neurons in culture (8 weeks) were fixed and stained as described previously (30Mochida S. Kobayashi H. Matsuda Y. Yuda Y. Muramoto K. Nonomura Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with polyclonal anti-dynamin 1 and anti-amphiphysin II antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) (supplemental Fig. S1). For electrophysiology, SCG neurons 6-8 weeks in culture were studied. EPSP recording and injection of peptides were performed as described previously (29Ma H. Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Mochida S. Kobayashi H. Matsuda Y. Yuda Y. Muramoto K. Nonomura Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1131-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To measure the replenishment of the RRP with readily releasable SVs, either a paired-pulse protocol or 5-30 Hz stimulation for 2 s was applied. For each neuron pair, three recordings were performed every 2 min for each interval of stimuli, and the EPSP peak amplitudes were averaged to account for variations in transmitter release following repetitive action potentials. For the depletion of synaptic vesicles, action potentials were applied at 5 Hz for 4 min, and replenishment of readily releasable SVs was monitored by tracking the recovery of baseline EPSP via recording every 1 s. The peak amplitudes of EPSP were averaged, and the resultant values were smoothed by an eight-point moving average algorithm. To measure the change in readily releasable SVs during prolonged repetitive activity, EPSPs were recorded at either 0.2 or 0.05 Hz. The peak amplitudes were averaged and plotted against recording time with t = 0 corresponding to the presynaptic injection of P4 (QVPSRPNRAP), a scrambled control peptide (QPPASNPRVR), or bath application of Dynasore. 1 mm peptide in the injection pipette was applied as this is the concentration producing a maximum reduction of EPSP amplitude, whereas 5 mm peptide showed no further reduction. 4W. Lu, H. Ma, Z.-H. Sheng, and S. Mochida, unpublished data. For Dynasore bath application, 100 μl of 1 mm Dynasore dissolved in 5% DMSO was drop-applied to a 1.25-ml bath. A final concentration of 80 μm (0.4% DMSO) Dynasore was used to achieve maximum inhibition of endocytosis, because this concentration completely blocked all forms of endocytosis in hippocampal neurons (28Xu J. McNeil B. Wu W. Nees D. Bai L. Wu L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As a control, 5% DMSO was drop-applied, producing a bath concentration of 0.4%. To reach the final concentration it takes a few minutes after bath superfusion was stopped (31Mochida S. Westenbroek R.E. Yokoyama C.T. Itoh K. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2813-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Before recording EPSPs at 20 min after the Dynasore application, cultured SCG neurons showed no spontaneous synaptic activity (32Mochida S. J. Physiol. Paris. 1995; 89: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduction of SVs in the RRP with the treatment is unlikely. Error bars shown in the text and figures represent mean ± S.E. A two-tailed Student t test was applied as indicated. Readily Releasable SVs after Evoked Transmitter Release—To examine the readily releasable SVs after single action potential-evoked transmitter release, a paired-pulse protocol was applied under acute disruption of endocytosis by P4 or Dynasore (Fig. 1). Synaptic responses induced by two consecutive action potentials showed a depression of the second response (paired-pulse depression) with inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 20-100 ms. In contrast, at longer ISIs (200-2000 ms) the amplitudes of the second response were similar to the first (Fig. 1A). Paired-pulse responses were subsequently recorded 20 min after either P4 (Fig. 1A) or Dynasore application (Fig. 1B). The amplitude and the ratio of the EPSPs did not change with P4 (Fig. 1A). In contrast, with Dynasore the amplitude of the second EPSP decreased more than the first EPSP (with ISI = 50 ms: 14.7 ± 0.9 mV1st and 11.2 ± 0.7 mV2nd before Dynasore and 8.8 ± 0.5 mV1st and 5.0 ± 0.7 mV2nd after Dynasore; with ISI = 120 ms: 13.2 ± 0.9 mV1st and 14.7 ± 0.9 mV2nd before Dynasore and 9.3 ± 0.5 mV1st and 6.6 ± 1.0 mV2nd after Dynasore, mean ± S.E., n = 5; p < 0.05, paired Student t test) (Fig. 1B, panel b). Thus the paired-response ratio decreased with Dynasore (with ISI = 50 ms, from 0.62 ± 0.03 to 0.45 ± 0.06; with ISI = 120 ms, from 1.1 ± 0.03 to 0.70 ± 0.08; p < 0.05, paired t test) (Fig. 1B, panel c). These results suggest that dynamin dysfunction prevented replenishment of readily releasable SVs with an ISI of <120 ms, although the clathrin-mediated pathway might not function in replenishment of readily releasable SVs with an ISI of <2 s. The time for the dynamin-mediated replenishment after a single action potential is much shorter than previous reports for fast endocytosis in hippocampal synapses in imaging studies (τ = 0.4-6 s) (15Royle S.J. Lagnado L. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dynasore is a specific inhibitor for endocytosis (24Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Xu J. McNeil B. Wu W. Nees D. Bai L. Wu L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and unlikely to affect SV fusion. Although the mechanism of paired-pulse depression in central synapses is thought to be associated with a decrease in release probability (33Kavalali E.T. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), SVs are able to fully release from the RRP within tens of milliseconds in synapses of cultured SCG neurons when depression is removed (34Mochida S. Few A.P. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2008; 57: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The results indicate that rapid replenishment of the RRP via dynamin-mediated SV recycling occurs after an evoked transmitter release. Readily Releasable SVs during and after Repetitive Transmitter Release—To examine readily releasable SVs during and after repetitive action potential firing, 2-s trains of 5-30 Hz action potentials were elicited every 2 min in five synaptic couples. The EPSP amplitude decreased during the train (Fig. 2, A-D, upper graphs), and the rate of the decay was dependent on the frequency of action potential generation (Fig. 2I). The train-evoked decrease in EPSP amplitude returned to the initial value 2 min after cessation of each train. Normalized first EPSP amplitudes recorded at 10, 20, and 30 Hz to those at 5 Hz were around 1 (Fig. 2, A-D and L). At 2 min after a series of recording, P4 or Dynasore was applied. EPSP recordings with trains of action potentials were resumed at 20 min after reagent application. In the presence of P4 or Dynasore, the EPSP amplitude did not return to the initial value during a 22-min cessation of firing. Normalized first EPSP amplitudes recorded at 5 Hz were 0.45 ± 0.06 for P4 and 0.2 ± 0.03 for Dynasore (Fig. 2, A, C, J, and L). Dynasore decreased EPSP amplitude rapidly with each successive train of action potentials, especially ≥10 Hz (Fig. 2, E-H and K). P4 enhanced the EPSP amplitude decrease at 20 and 30 Hz (G-I). As a control, the scrambled P4 peptide and DMSO control showed no change in EPSP amplitude (Fig. 2, B and D). The inhibition of the recovery with Dynasore was stronger than that with P4 (Fig. 2J). These results suggest that activity-dependent endocytosis could be activated by a 2-s train of action potentials at >10 Hz, in addition to dynamin-mediated endocytosis seen after a single action potential (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that, in addition to recycling from the plasma membrane, Dynasore will inhibit vesicle budding from sorting endosomes that supply de novo synaptic vesicles to the RRP (35Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the train-evoked decrease in EPSP amplitude in the presence of Dynasore returned to the initial value 2 min after cessation of each train. Normalized first EPSP amplitudes recorded at 10, 20, and 30 Hz were ∼0.2 (Fig. 2, C, J, and L), suggesting a possible dynamin-independent pathway for replenishment of readily releasable SVs through the transport route from the RP to the RRP during the 2-min cessation of each train. We note that an incomplete effect of Dynasore or an effect of dynamin 3 at this synapse cannot be excluded with these data. However, inhibition of available dynamin 1 and 2 and most if not all components of endocytosis would be consistent with prior work employing similar concentrations of Dynasore (27Newton A.J. Kirchhausen T. Murthy V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17955-17960Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28Xu J. McNeil B. Wu W. Nees D. Bai L. Wu L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Replenishment of Readily Releasable SVs after Depletion of Releasable SVs—To test whether both dynamin-dependent and -independent pathways can replenish readily releasable SVs, SVs in the presynaptic terminals were depleted with 4-min trains of 5-Hz action potentials, and the recovery of EPSP amplitude was measured every 1 s. At the end of the train, the EPSP amplitude was within baseline noise levels (Fig. 3, A and B), and subsequently recovered at two distinct rates: fast and slow (see arrows in Fig. 3A, panel a). A control scrambled P4 peptide or DMSO did not show any reduction in the recovery rate (Fig. 3, A (panel b) and B (panel b)). In contrast, both P4 and Dynasore inhibited fast recovery (Fig. 3, A (panel a), B (panel a), and C). At 20 s after the train, the EPSP amplitude was significantly smaller than that before reagent applications (Fig. 3C, panel b). These results indicate that releasable SVs are depleted, while SVs in the RP may persist at the end of a 4-min train of action potentials. Furthermore, SVs in the RP may refill the RRP through the dynamin-dependent and clathrin-mediated pathway. In addition, readily releasable SVs may also be replenished through a dynamin-independent pathway in the presence of Dynasore. At 5 min after the train, the EPSP amplitude recovered to 41.4 ± 4.5% with P4, but remained at 12.3 ± 2.1% with Dynasore (Fig. 3C, panel b). The slow recovery could be described by a linear relationship (Fig. 3C, panel a). The slopes before and after P4 injection were 8.1 ± 1.7%/min and 6.7 ± 1.6%/min (p = 0.63, unpaired t test), whereas the slope with Dynasore was 0 ± 0.4%/min (Fig. 3C, panel a). These results demonstrate that the slow recovery rate was not significantly affected by P4 but blocked completely by Dynasore, suggesting the replenishment of readily releasable SVs through dynamin-dependent recycling (18Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or de novo sorting via an endosomal pool (35Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Together, the results suggest that the fast replenishment of the readily releasable SVs may involve SV transport from the RP via dynamin-mediated and non-dynamin-mediated pathway, whereas the slow replenishment of the readily releasable SVs may be achieved solely through dynamin-mediated endocytosis. Readily Releasable SVs during Low Frequency Repetitive Transmitter Release—To examine the role of the dynamin-mediated pathway in replenishment of readily releasable SVs during low frequency repetitive transmitter release, changes in the amplitude of EPSPs evoked by presynaptic action potentials at 0.2 or 0.05 Hz were measured (Fig. 4). P4 gradually reduced the EPSP amplitude at 0.2 Hz (Fig. 4A, panels a and c), but not at 0.05 Hz (Fig. 4A, panels b and c). At 40 min after P4 injection, reduction of EPSP amplitude was -47.9 ± 9.4% at 0.2 Hz (n = 7), and -11.7 ± 6.4% at 0.05 Hz (n = 4). This value was similar to the control value with the scrambled P4 peptide (-8.9 ± 4.9% at 0.2 Hz; n = 6) (Fig. 4A, panel d) In contrast, Dynasore reduced the EPSP amplitude at 0.2 and 0.05 Hz (Fig. 4B). The reduction rate was more rapid than that of P4 with 0.2 Hz stimuli (Fig. 4, A (panel a) versus B (panel a)). The decay time constant of the EPSP amplitude in the presence of Dynasore was 4.8 ± 0.12 min at 0.2 Hz, and 13.2 ± 0.17 min at 0.05 Hz (p < 0.01, unpaired t test) (Fig. 4B, panel d), whereas it was 28 ± 1.0 min at 0.2 Hz in the presence of P4. These results suggest that dynamin also mediates replenishment of readily releasable SVs during low frequency firing. Surprisingly, the EPSP amplitude was very small at 60 min after Dynasore application, but not completely blocked. The amplitudes were 6.8 ± 1.6% (at 0.2 Hz) and 6.8 ± 0.9% (at 0.05 Hz) of the initial value before Dynasore application, suggesting that non-dynamin-mediated processes may function in replenishing readily releasable SVs, although further experiments will be necessary to address this issue in future. In this study, we demonstrate that sympathetic neurons maintain synaptic transmission via the recycling of SVs through dynamin-mediated pathways during and after action potential activity. In addition, we provide evidence for a non-dynamin-mediated endocytic pathway, assuming that P4 and Dynasore blockade of dynamin-mediated recycling is complete. Refilling of the RRP via dynamin-mediated endocytic pathways was dependent on both rate and number of action potential firing (Figs. 2, 3, 4), in accord with activity-dependent recycling of synaptic vesicles observed at other synapses. In contrast, another mode of the RRP refilling through a dynamin-mediated endocytic pathway was activated independently of action potential firing rate and number (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4), consistent with an activity-independent pathway. The third pathway, not affected by dynamin dysfunction, was also activated at all rates or numbers of firing tested (Figs. 3 and 4) and was thus activity-independent; it is estimated that 10% of SVs in readily releasable SVs were replenished via this pathway to maintain efficient synaptic vesicle recycling with long lasting repetitive firing of the SCG neuron. Compared with neurons in the central nervous system, sympathetic nerve fibers show relatively low firing activity in the 0.5- to 7.5-Hz range in vivo (36Janig W. Schmidt R.F. Pflugers Arch. 1970; 314: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, evidence for activity-dependent refilling of the RRP observed in this study may reflect physiological synaptic transmission in autonomic neurons in vivo. The kinetics of endocytosis is variable at different presynaptic terminals (15Royle S.J. Lagnado L. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Wu L.G. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 548-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In hippocampal neurons, imaging studies have shown a wide range of time constants for endocytosis from a τ = 0.1-6 s for fast components (13Klingauf J. Kavalali E.T. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 15Royle S.J. Lagnado L. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and τ = 4-90 s for slow clathrin-mediated endocytosis (15Royle S.J. Lagnado L. J. Physiol. 2003; 553: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In Drosophila neuromuscular synapses, two pathways of vesicle recycling (37Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3844-3860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and two or three SVs pools, the RRP and the RP (38Kuromi H. Kidokoro Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 917-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) or “immediately releasable pool” (39Delgado R. Maureira C. Oliva C. Kidokoro Y. Labarca P. Neuron. 2000; 28: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), were documented. During short period or low frequency presynaptic activity, SVs in the RRP, including the immediately releasable pool but not those in the RP, participate in transmitter release, whereas vesicles in the RP are required during intense neuronal activity (>10 Hz). A dynamin mutant, shibire, exhibits rapid synaptic fatigue within 0.02 s of repetitive stimulation, a phenotype that cannot be explained by vesicle depletion, suggesting that dynamin is required for rapid replenishment of the RRP with synaptic vesicles (40Kawasaki F. Hazen M. Ordway R.W. Neuron. 2000; 3: 859-860Google Scholar). In the present study, reduction of the second of two consecutive EPSPs with an ISI of 0.05 s by Dynasore (Fig. 1B) suggests that in sympathetic neurons dynamin is also required for rapid replenishment of readily releasable SVs, in addition to its role in slow clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which contributes to SVs recycling via the RP. Our data suggest approximate time constants for endocytosis in cultured sympathetic neurons. The dynamin-mediated pathway is able to mobilize SVs to the RRP in <0.05 s after an action potential (Fig. 1B), and the dynamin- and clathrin-mediated pathway is able to transport SVs to the RRP in under 20 s (Fig. 4A), if P4, as proposed, could perturb clathrin-coats formation. Measuring the time constant of readily releasable SV replenishment via the non-dynamin-mediated pathway is technically difficult because of the small synaptic responses after dynamin inhibition. Using primary cortical cultures from dynamin 1 knockout mice, Ferguson et al. (18Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that neuron-specific dynamin 1 is required for rapid SV recycling during high frequency (>10 Hz) stimulation, but not after cessation of the stimulus train. Dynamin 3 appears to share a similar role to dynamin 1. In contrast, ubiquitously expressed Dynamin 2 may play a role in slow activity-independent constitutive replenishment of clathrin-coated vesicles. Here we report that presynaptic terminals of a sympathetic neuron have two dynamin-mediated SV replenishment pathways, which differ in activity dependence. The relationship of these two recycling modes to specific dynamin isoforms will require further investigation. The differential effects of P4 peptide and Dynasore may be accounted for different steps in which they are likely to participate in the endocytic pathway. P4 disrupts the interaction of dynamin with amphiphysin (24Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), which may interfere with formation of the clathrin-coat (21Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) or fission complex. On the other hand, Dynasore may act at a downstream step involving dynamin activity and subsequently provide constitutive inactivation of dynamin across the endocytic cycle. It is also possible that, by targeting different parts of the dynamin endocytic complex, P4 peptides and Dynasore may act on different time scales and efficacies and thus account for their differential effects. Clearly the two reagents provide unique insight into distinct roles of dynamin in endocytosis with respect to synaptic vesicle pool recovery during different patterns of action potential stimulation. We should caution that one cannot exclude incomplete inhibition of dynamin function by injected P4 peptides, which may be unable to fully target preassembled dynamin endocytic complexes due to steric hindrance and lower concentrations at nerve terminals. Because it was technically unfeasible to collect enough injected neurons for in vitro biochemical co-immunoprecipitation study, we are unable to provide experimental evidence to verify the assumption that injected P4 peptide could completely block the dynamin-amphiphysin interaction in our SCG neurons. Although the amphiphysin I/II knockout mice exhibit some defects in synaptic vesicle recycling (41Di Paolo G. Sankaranarayanan S. Wenk M.R. Daniell L. Perucco E. Caldarone B.J. Flavell R. Picciotto M.R. Ryan T.A. Cremona O. De Camilli P. Neuron. 2002; 33: 789-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), its essential role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis remains further investigation. It is possible that P4 might target not only to amphiphysin but also to other SH3 domain-containing proteins (24Marks B. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 740-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), thus playing a less specific role in blocking endocytosis than that by Dynasore. However, previous work in the SCG neuron system has indicated that injected peptides at even lower concentrations can disassemble other preformed synaptic protein complexes (42Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Baker C. Kobayashi H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 781-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Furthermore, P4 peptides have the efficacy to block clathrin-dependent endocytosis at intracellular concentrations (25Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) that are comparable to those used in the current study, although it was injected into different neuronal types and the effect was measured by different readouts. Likewise, one must interpret the Dynasore inhibition data with caution. Dynasore is a fast-acting cell-permeable small molecule that inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin 1, dynamin 2, and Drp1, the mitochondrial dynamin (43Kirchhausen T. Macia E. Pelish H.E. William E. Balch C.J.D. Alan H. Methods in Enzymology. 2008; (Academic Press, New York, pp.): 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains possible that in SCG neurons Dynasore may inhibit endocytosis dependent on dynamins 1 and 2 but not dynamin 3. Incomplete inhibition can also not be excluded without an independent measure of endocytosis inhibition. To address these issues, investigation of the role of dynamin isoforms in synaptic vesicle endocytic pathways in SCG neurons is under further study. However, it should be noted that robust inhibition of dynamin 1 and 2 and most if not all kinetic components of endocytosis is consistent with prior work employing similar concentrations of Dynasore (27Newton A.J. Kirchhausen T. Murthy V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17955-17960Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28Xu J. McNeil B. Wu W. Nees D. Bai L. Wu L.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The results in the present study suggest a dynamin-independent pathway for SV recycling in a sympathetic neuron synapse. Recent studies at other synapses support this conclusion. SV endocytosis at the large presynaptic terminal of the calyx of Held is partially independent of dynamin (29Ma H. Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Endocytosis activated during intense stimulation persists in the calyx synapse dialyzing with Dynasore and PQVPSRPNRAP (called pp11, one amino acid longer than P4) (29Ma H. Mochida S. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In peripheral dorsal root ganglion neurons, a calcium- and dynamin-independent form of rapid endocytosis, which is controlled by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation, has been described (44Zhang C. Xiong W. Zheng H. Wang L. Lu B. Zhou Z. Neuron. 2004; 42: 225-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to further examine the molecular and physiological basis of vesicle fission via dynamin-independent endocytosis and its relationship to kiss-and-run and other proposed fast, non-classic modes of synaptic vesicle recycling. The synaptic short-term depression observed during repetitive neuronal firing may be attributed to multiple mechanisms, including a decrease in vesicle fusion probability, inactivation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (34Mochida S. Few A.P. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2008; 57: 210-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), or use-dependent inhibition of the vesicle release machinery (33Kavalali E.T. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In hippocampal or neocortical neurons, rapidly recycled SVs in the RRP are capable of rapid reuse (45Pyle J.L. Kavalali E.T. Piedras-Renteria E.S. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 2000; 28: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and slow the rate of synaptic depression (46Ertunc M. Sara Y. Chung C. Atasoy D. Virmani T. Kavalali E.T. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our study shows that synaptic transmission in cultured SCG neurons also decreases rapidly in response to repetitive action potential firing (Fig. 2). The decrease was strongly accelerated in the presence of Dynasore, suggesting that a rapid reduction in the number of vesicles available for fast release may contribute to synaptic depression. These results may suggest that dynamin-mediated pathways are critical to maintain baseline levels of neurotransmission. Together, our results along with other results in the literature indicate that distinct endocytic pathways may be engaged under distinct patterns of synaptic activity history, short- and long-term neuromodulation and cell type. For example, the release probability of presynaptic terminals (11Gandhi S.P. Stevens C.F. Nature. 2003; 423: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), Ca2+ and protein kinase activity may regulate the relative engagement of endocytotic pathways as a function of firing history and modulation (5Harata N.C. Aravanis A.M. Tsien R.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1546-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Klingauf J. Kavalali E.T. Tsien R.W.

In addition, dynamic engagement of multiple modes of recycling may be useful in homeostatic maintenance of a working amplitude and gain of synaptic transmission under different stimulation patterns. In summary, the present data characterize the fundamental modes of SV recycling and refilling of the RRP in SCG neurons during and after single or sustained firing of action potentials, supporting the involvement of activity-dependent and -independent pathways with distinct molecular requirements for synaptic vesicle endocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2025420709,"Studies on the longevity and migration patterns of wild animals rely heavily on the ability to track individual adults. Non-extractive sampling methods are particularly important when monitoring animals that are commercially important to ecotourism, and/or are rare. The use of unique body patterns to recognize and track individual vertebrates is well-established, but not common in ecological studies of invertebrates. Here we provide a method for identifying individual Wunderpus photogenicus using unique body color patterns. This charismatic tropical octopus is commercially important to the underwater photography, dive tourism, and home aquarium trades, but is yet to be monitored in the wild. Among the adults examined closely, the configurations of fixed white markings on the dorsal mantle were found to be unique. In two animals kept in aquaria, these fixed markings were found not to change over time. We believe another individual was photographed twice in the wild, two months apart. When presented with multiple images of W. photogenicus, volunteer observers reliably matched photographs of the same individuals. Given the popularity of W. photogenicus among underwater photographers, and the ease with which volunteers can correctly identify individuals, photo-identification appears to be a practical means to monitor individuals in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2043139675,"Background Since 1999 GHESKIO, a large voluntary counseling and HIV testing center in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, has had an ongoing collaboration with the Haitian Ministry of Health to reduce the rate of mother to child HIV transmission. There are limited data on the ability to administer complex regimens for reducing mother to child transmission and on risk factors for continued transmission and infant mortality within programmatic settings in developing countries. Methods and Findings We analyzed data from 551 infants born to HIV-infected mothers seen at GHESKIO, between 1999 and 2005. HIV-infected mothers and their infants were given “short-course” monotherapy with antiretrovirals for prophylaxis; and, since 2003, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) when clinical or laboratory indications were met. Infected women seen in the pre-treatment era had 27% transmission rates, falling to 10% in this cohort of 551 infants, and to only 1.9% in infants of women on HAART. Mortality rate after HAART introduction (0.12 per year of follow-up [0.08–0.16]) was significantly lower than the period before the availability of such therapy (0.23 [0.16–0.30], P<0.0001). The effects of maternal health, infant feeding, completeness of prophylaxis, and birth weight on mortality and transmission were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis. Infant HIV-1 infection and low birth weight were associated with infant mortality in less than 15 month olds in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate success in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission and mortality in a highly resource constrained setting. Elements contributing to programmatic success include provision of HAART in the context of a comprehensive program with pre and postnatal care for both mother and infant."
https://openalex.org/W2095579736,"Many proteins are translocated across and integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The type I signal anchor sequence mediates the translocation of its preceding region through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, but the source of the motive force has been unclear. Here, we characterized the motive force for N-terminal domain translocation using two probes. First, an Ig-like domain of the muscle protein titin (I27 domain) or its mutants were fused to the N termini, and translocation was examined in a cell-free translation system supplemented with rough microsomal membrane. The N-terminal translocation efficiencies correlated with the mechanical instabilities of the I27 mutants. When the I27 domain was separated from the signal anchor sequence by inserting a spacer, even the most unstable mutant stalled on the cytoplasmic side, whereas its downstream portion spanned the membrane. Proline insertion into the signal anchor sequence also caused a large translocation defect. Second, a streptavidin-binding peptide tag was fused to the N terminus. Titration of streptavidin in the translation system allowed us to estimate the translocation motive force operative on the tag. The motive force was decreased by the proline insertion into the signal anchor sequence as well as by separation from the signal anchor sequence. When the streptavidin-binding peptide tag was separated from the signal anchor, the proline insertion did not induce further deficits in the motive force for the tag. On the basis of the findings obtained by using these two independent techniques, we conclude that the signal sequence itself provides the motive force for N-terminal domain translocation within a limited upstream region.

The majority of membrane proteins and lumenal soluble proteins in the secretory pathway are synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and cotranslationally inserted into and translocated across the membrane. Ribosomes synthesizing polypeptide chains with a signal sequence are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum via the signal recognition particle and its receptor system (1Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar). On the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the signal sequence is released from the particle and then recognized by the protein translocation machinery, the so-called translocon (2Belin D. Bost S. Vassalli J.-D. Strub K. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 468-478Google Scholar, 3Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Cell.. 1995; 82: 261-270Google Scholar). The translocon is composed of several copies of Sec61 complexes (in eukaryotes) or SecY complexes (in bacteria). The crystal structure of the archaeal SecY complex indicates that the 10 transmembrane (TM) 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; H-segment, hydrophobic segment; N-domain, N-terminal domain; RM, rough microsomal membrane; SA-I, type I signal anchor; SBP, streptavidin-binding peptide; SAv, streptavidin; SytII, synaptotagmin II. segments of a single SecY molecule form a narrow pore through the membrane, and the pore allows for a lateral exit toward the lipid environment (4Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature.. 2004; 427: 36-44Google Scholar). The signal recognition pocket is located at the lateral exit site. The polypeptide chain of the secretory protein is translocated through the pore (5Osborne A.R. Rapoport T.A. Cell.. 2007; 129: 97-110Google Scholar). On the other hand, a large aqueous environment of the translocon has been observed (6Alder N.N. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 22787-22790Google Scholar). Moreover, the translocon possesses such remarkable flexibility that two translocating hydrophilic polypeptide chains can be simultaneously accommodated (7Kida Y. Morimoto F. Sakaguchi M. J. Cell Biol... 2007; 179: 1441-1452Google Scholar). The dynamics of the Sec61/SecY channel and cooperation of the channels within the oligomeric form, however, remain to be solved (8Skach W.R. J. Cell Biol... 2007; 179: 1333-1335Google Scholar). Signal sequences trigger translocation of either the N-terminal or C-terminal flanking portion through the channel. The type II signal anchor sequence and signal peptide mediate translocation of their downstream portion, whereas the type I signal anchor (SA-I) sequence mediates translocation of the N-terminal domain (N-domain) (9Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol... 2000; 150: 719-730Google Scholar). Translocation of the portion downstream from the type II signal anchor sequence and signal peptide is simply explained as the ongoing protein elongation pushing the polypeptide chain through continuous ribosome and translocon tunnels. In contrast, translocation of the upstream portion of SA-I sequences cannot be driven by polypeptide chain elongation, and therefore another mechanism must pull the upstream portion. Previous analyses of the translocation of the large N-domain, including the dihydrofolate reductase domain, indicated that the SA-I sequence mediates translocation, even of large N-terminal domains that are greater than 200 residues (10Kida Y. Mihara K. Sakaguchi M. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 3202-3213Google Scholar). Translocation is blocked by a specific ligand (methotrexate), indicating that the N-domain is significantly folded before translocation. The N-domain translocation requires neither nucleotide triphosphates nor the lumenal chaperone BiP. Despite this lack of requirements, long domain translocation occurs only while the nascent chain is maintained in the ribosome. The ribosome maintains a productive state of nascent chain and translocon. These results led us to the idea that motive force is provided by the SA-I sequence itself. Analysis of the energetics of N-domain translocation by the SA-I sequence will provide insight into the function of the signal sequence during protein translocation, i.e. whether the signal sequences only trigger targeting and translocation of the polypeptide chain or whether they also contribute to generate the motive force required for the translocation. If it is the latter case, motive force should be dependent on the signal sequence itself and on the distance between the signal sequence and the passenger domain. To address these questions, quantitative analysis of the translocation motive force is essential. Here, we examined the motive force for N-domain translocation using the N-terminally fused titin 27th immunoglobulin domain (I27 domain) and streptavidin (SAv)-binding peptide (SBP) tag as passenger probes. The I27 domain consists of 89 amino acid residues and is a constituent of the huge elastic protein cardiac muscle titin. Wild-type and mutant I27 domains have been extensively characterized with regard to their mechanical stability, and their unfolding forces have been estimated by atomic force microscopy (11Li H. Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol... 2000; 7: 1117-1120Google Scholar). Their mechanical unfolding requires a force of more than 200 piconewtons. These domains have been successfully used to analyze mitochondrial protein import (12Okamoto K. Brinker A. Paschen S.A. Moarefi I. Hayer-Hartl M. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 3659-3671Google Scholar, 13Sato T. Esaki M. Fernandez J.M. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 17999-18004Google Scholar). The SBP-tag of 38 residues binds SAv with high affinity and has been used to arrest N-domain translocation mediated by the SA-I sequence (7Kida Y. Morimoto F. Sakaguchi M. J. Cell Biol... 2007; 179: 1441-1452Google Scholar). The arrested translocation can be resumed by biotin (7Kida Y. Morimoto F. Sakaguchi M. J. Cell Biol... 2007; 179: 1441-1452Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the motive force for translocation can be quantitatively estimated using these probes. The translocation motive force operating on a particular region depends on its distance from the SA-I sequence and on the structural characteristics of the SA-I sequence. We concluded that the signal sequence provides the motive force for protein translocation as well as targets the nascent chain to the translocon and that the motive force is effective within a limited region. DNA Manipulation—The I27 domain of human cardiac muscle titin and its mutants were described previously (11Li H. Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol... 2000; 7: 1117-1120Google Scholar). The plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Sato (13Sato T. Esaki M. Fernandez J.M. Endo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 17999-18004Google Scholar), with permission from Dr. Fernandez. DNA fragments encoding the I27 domains (Leu1–Leu89; HindIII/EcoRI) were obtained by polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: CCCCAAGCTTGCCACCATGCTAATAGAAGTGGAAAAGCCTC (with the HindIII site, Kozak sequence, and initiation Met underlined) and CCGGAATTCCAATTCTTTCACTTTCAGATTGG (with the EcoRI site underlined). In the following DNA construction procedures, the indicated DNA fragments were obtained by polymerase chain reaction. Each fragment was designed to possess the appropriate restriction enzyme site at both ends; these are described in parentheses. The DNA fragments were ligated into plasmid vectors that had been digested with the indicated restriction enzymes. At each junction, six bases of the restriction enzyme site encoded two codons. The amino acid residues were taken into account when numbering the residues indicated in the figures. For I27-Syt200 series constructs (see Fig. 1), the DNA fragments encoding Met plus the I27 domain (HindIII/EcoRI), the glycosylation sequence (KLNSTAT; MfeI/EcoRI), synaptotagmin II (SytII) (EcoRI/XbaI), and pRcCMV vector (HindIII/XbaI) were ligated. For I27(V13P)-X-Syt200 series model proteins (see Fig. 2), a DNA fragment (MfeI/EcoRI) encoding the 38-residue spacer sequence was derived from 627–662 of human anion exchanger 1 (ELT627YTQKLSVPDGFKVSNSAARGWVIHPLGLRSEFPIW662. The junction sequence of EcoRI and MfeI is underlined, and the silenced endogenous glycosylation site is double-underlined). Its derivative sequence (X = 10, ELT627YTQKLSV634; X = 20, ELT627YTQKLSVPDGFKVSNSA644; X = 30, ELT627YTQKLSVPDGFKVSNSAARGWVIHPLG654) was inserted between the glycosylation sequence and SytII. For monoglycosylation constructs (see Fig. 2), either glycosylation site (a or b) was silenced by a point mutation using the QuikChange method and the method of Kunkel (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). For proline insertion mutations (see Fig. 3), the proline codon was inserted after residues Ala67, Leu68, Phe84, and Cys85 of the SytII sequence. The SBP tag-SytII fusion constructs (see Fig. 4) were described previously (7Kida Y. Morimoto F. Sakaguchi M. J. Cell Biol... 2007; 179: 1441-1452Google Scholar). Pro insertions of the SBP-fusion model proteins (see Fig. 4) were made by point mutations. 3The primer sequences are available upon request from the author.FIGURE 2V13P mutant of the I27 domain arrests ongoing translocation. A, spacer sequences consisting of X residues were inserted between the I27(V13P) domain and the SA-I sequence. As the I27 domain separated from the SA-I sequence, the second site (b-site) reached in the lumen to be accessible to glycosylation enzyme, even when the I27 domain was still on the cytoplasmic side. The insertion of the spacer sequence caused arrest of the I27 domain translocation. Open and filled circles indicate glycosylated and non-glycosylated potential sites, respectively.

Mihara K. Sakaguchi M. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 3202-3213Google Scholar). A truncated RNA encoding protein sequence up to Arg200 of SytII was obtained by in vitro transcription using plasmids linearized with AflII. The mRNAs were translated with a reticulocyte lysate cell-free system in the presence of rough microsomal membrane (RM) for 60 min at 25 °C. After translation was terminated by 2 mm cycloheximide, the reaction mixture was further incubated for the indicated periods and then directly subjected for SDS-PAGE (see Figs. 1, 2, 3). In Fig. 4, incubation at 25 °C was continued for 30 min in the presence of cycloheximide, and then the mixture was diluted with 10 volumes of high salt buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 500 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 5 min. The membrane precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were detected with an image analyzer (Fuji Bioimage analyzer, BAS1800). Diglycosylation (percent) was calculated using the following formula: (diglycosylated form) × 100/[(non-glycosylated) + (monoglycosylated) + (diglycosylated)]. Translocation Efficiency and Mechanical Instability of the I27 Domain—To evaluate the motive force for N-domain translocation, the titin I27 domain or its mutant in which a single amino acid residue in the N-terminal portion was exchanged with Pro was fused to the N terminus of the SA-I sequence derived from SytII (Fig. 1). In the model protein, the hydrophilic N-domain consisted of the 90-residue I27 domain and a 70-residue hydrophilic segment (under “Experimental Procedures”). The hydrophilic segment between the I27 domain and the SA-I sequence contained two glycosylation sites, which are indicators of N-domain translocation. N-domain translocation was assessed in a cell-free translation system of reticulocyte lysate supplemented with RM. For the analysis, we used truncated mRNA encoding up to Arg200 of SytII (Fig. 1). When the mRNA was translated, the nascent polypeptide chain emerging from the ribosome was targeted to the membrane and was retained in the ribosome as a peptidyl-tRNA to form a ribosome nascent chain complex even after elongation was completed. After translation in the presence of RM for 1 h, the glycosylation level of the nascent polypeptide chain was not very high (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17). Further incubation in the presence of cycloheximide, a polypeptide chain elongation inhibitor, shifted the products up on the SDS-PAGE, indicating that the products were gradually diglycosylated during the chase period (Fig. 1C). The nascent chain is maintained in a translocation-competent state as long as it is retained in the ribosome (10Kida Y. Mihara K. Sakaguchi M. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 3202-3213Google Scholar). When the chain was released from the ribosome by a termination codon or with puromycin, the I27 domain translocation was not chased (data not shown). The translocation efficiency correlated with the mechanical instability of the I27 mutations that were reported by Li et al. (11Li H. Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol... 2000; 7: 1117-1120Google Scholar). Two mutants with a lower unfolding force (V11P and V13P) were efficiently diglycosylated. In these cases, few monoglycosylated intermediates were observed, indicating that the two sites were simultaneously exposed to the oligosaccharyltransferase in the lumen. It is also indicated that both glycosylation sites were efficient substrates of the oligosaccharyltransferase in the lumen. On the other hand, the Y9P mutant and wild-type I27 showed lower translocation efficiencies and gave a small but significant amount of monoglycosylated intermediates during the chase, indicating that the movement of the polypeptide chain was slower than that of the other mutants. The titin I27 domain has seven β-strands, and the first and last ones interact with each other to form a parallel pair. In unfolding analysis by atomic force microscopy, each point mutation in the first strand (V11P, V13P, and V15P) led to unfolding with a lower mechanical force, indicating that dissociation of the interaction between the first and the last strands is the rate-limiting step of its mechanical unfolding. The translocation efficiencies of I27 domain mutants correlated with their mechanical unfolding properties, suggesting that breaking the β-strand pair is the rate-limiting step of the global unfolding and the following translocation. N-domain translocation starts with entry of the SA-I sequence into the translocon. In the case of longer N-domains, the hydrophobic segment (H-segment) of the SA-I sequence acquires the TM orientation before the N-domain is completely translocated (7Kida Y. Morimoto F. Sakaguchi M. J. Cell Biol... 2007; 179: 1441-1452Google Scholar, 10Kida Y. Mihara K. Sakaguchi M. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 3202-3213Google Scholar). It is also possible that the stroke of the N terminus of the SA-I sequence across the membrane traps the last β-strand detached from the first strand in the translocon and leads to unfolding of the N-domain. After the initiation stage, further movement of the polypeptide chain should be possibly driven by lumenal chaperones and/or diffusion of TM segment in the lipid environment during the progression stage. These findings indicate that the folded N-terminal I27 domain functions as a resistor against polypeptide chain movement and that the unfolding of the I27 domain is the rate-limiting step of N-domain translocation. Effect of Distance from the Signal Sequence on I27 Domain Translocation—Next, we examined the effect of the distance between the I27(V13P) resistor and the SA-I sequence by inserting hydrophilic spacer sequences (Fig. 2A). Diglycosylation was greatly affected by the spacer length. In the presence of a 20-residue spacer, the monoglycosylated intermediate was dominantly observed during the chase (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7) and then became shifted to the diglycosylated form (lane 8). This monoglycosylated form was not observed in the absence of the spacer sequence (X = 0), indicating that the translocation rate was a little decreased by the insertion of the spacer and that the translocating polypeptide chain is trapped in the pore for a significant time period. When the spacer was 30 or 38 residues long, the diglycosylated form was rarely observed even after a 2-h chase, whereas the monoglycosylated form appeared more rapidly than the X = 20 molecule. In the presence of the spacer sequence, the second glycosylation site (b-site) was initially glycosylated. The b-site glycosylation may prevent the polypeptide chain from sliding back so that it eventually stimulates translocation as a molecular ratchet. To examine the contribution of b-site glycosylation to I27 domain translocation, the b-site was silenced by a point mutation (Fig. 2C). The a-site glycosylation of the X = 0 molecule occurred with similar efficiency as the diglycosylation. The a-site glycosylation of the X = 20 molecule also occurred with essentially the same time course as diglycosylation of the original molecule, indicating that the intermediate monoglycosylated form of the X = 20 molecule was due to glycosylation of the b-site. In both cases, silencing of the b-site had little effect on the N-domain translocation (a-site glycosylation) rate. Thus, the ratchet function of the b-site glycosylation is not a major determinant of N-domain translocation. In the absence of the second site (b-site), X = 30 and X = 38 molecules were little glycosylated (Fig. 2C, lanes 12 and 16), confirming that only the second glycosylation site (b-site) is accessible to the oligosaccharyltransferase and that the I27 domains are on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Actually, the b-site of the X = 38 molecule was quite efficiently glycosylated (Fig. 2C, lanes 17–20). Thus, in the presence of longer spacers (X = 30 and 38), the b-site was rapidly translocated to the lumen of the RM, whereas the a-site was not. In these cases, polypeptide chain movement was blocked by the I27 domain. The hydrophilic segment between the I27 domain and the SA-I sequence spanned the membrane; the I27 domain could be unfolded and translocated through the translocon only when it was placed near the SA-I sequence. Even the most unstable V13P mutant cannot be translocated in the presence of a long spacer. The N-domain translocation of the X = 38 molecule was initiated more rapidly than the molecule without a spacer. Thus, translocation is stalled at the I27 domain, and only the monoglycosylated form was observed. In this case, the unfolding of the I27 domain was not the rate-limiting step of the initiation stage, but it readily arrested the progression stage. On the other hand, in the absence of a spacer, it is likely that the unfolding of the I27 domain was a limiting step of the translocation initiation. Once the translocation was triggered, however, the polypeptide chain movement readily progressed up to the N terminus so that the monoglycosylated intermediate was not detected (Fig. 2B). We conclude that the motive force for the polypeptide movement is not uniform during translocation; the motive force for the initiation stage is greater than that for the progression stage. When the SA-I sequence enters into the membrane and forms a TM helix (initiation stage), it generates a motive force sufficient for the unfolding of the I27 domain. Thereafter, once it forms the TM helix, the motive force operative on the I27 domain decreases (progression stage). The stroke of the H-segment into the translocon and the partition of the H-segment into the hydrophobic environment of lipid likely provide free energy for the motive force. The unfolding of the tightly folded I27 domain can be achieved only by coupling with the TM helix formation at the initiation stage. Proline Insertion into the Hydrophobic Segment Decreases the Translocation Motive Force—To evaluate the possibility that the signal sequence provides the motive force for N-domain unfolding and translocation, we next examined the effect of altering the SA-I sequence on the motive force. To perturb the helicity and hydrophobicity of the SA-I sequence, a single proline residue was inserted into various sites of the H-segment (Fig. 3A). The Pro insertions induced a large decrease in the I27(V13P) domain translocation (Fig. 3B). We then examined the N-domain translocation in the absence of the resistor domain. For the purpose, the I27(V13P) domain was replaced with SBP tag of 38 residues, which gave no affect on the N-domain translocation of the SytII in the absence of SAv (7Kida Y. Morimoto F. Sakaguchi M. J. Cell Biol... 2007; 179: 1441-1452Google Scholar). The Pro insertions, except Pro-2 mutant, did not induce a significant decrease of the SBP-tagged N-domain translocation (Fig. 3C). The Pro insertion does not dramatically affect the targeting function of hydrophobic domain either. The N-domain translocation was affected by the Pro insertion only in the presence of the I27 resistor domain, strongly suggesting that the Pro insertions into the H-segment partially decreased the translocation motive force, whereas the Pro-inserted SA-I can still drive the SBP-tagged N-domain. The signal sequence is involved not only in targeting to the translocon but also in generating the translocation motive force. Motive Force for Translocation Estimated by SBP Tag—To more quantitatively assess the motive force, we took advantage of affinity tag trapping of the N-domain translocation (Fig. 4). The 38-amino acid SBP tag was fused to the N terminus of the wild-type and Pro-inserted SA-I sequences. When the truncated mRNA was translated in the presence of SAv, N-domain translocation was arrested in a SAv concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–6). Adding biotin releases the arrest as previously reported (7Kida Y. Morimoto F. Sakaguchi M. J. Cell Biol... 2007; 179: 1441-1452Google Scholar) (data not shown). The motive force can be estimated by titrating the SAv. The translocation of the Pro-4 mutant was inhibited by a 10-fold lower concentration of SAv compared with the original construct. Moreover, the Pro-1 and Pro-3 mutants of the SA-I sequence were more sensitive than the Pro-4 mutant. This finding clearly demonstrated that the Pro-inserted H-segment was correctly targeted and inserted into the translocon with the expected orientation, but had partially defective translocation motive force. These results quantitatively confirmed that the Pro insertions decrease the translocation motive force generated by the SA-I sequence. When a 38-residue spacer was inserted between the SBP tag and the SA-I sequence, N-domain translocation became more sensitive to the SAv concentration, and the translocation intermediate was monoglycosylated (Fig. 4C). Translocation was stalled by the SBP tag bound to SAv, and the downstream portion spanned the membrane through the translocon channel as observed for the I27 domain with the 38-residue spacer (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the Pro insertion caused no additional defect in the spacer construct. It was therefore demonstrated that polypeptide chain movement in the progressive stage does not depend on the SA-I sequence. The motive force induced by the SA-I sequence is not operative on the SBP tag portion in the distal position. We conclude that the motive force caused by the SA-I sequence can be effective only within a limited portion. Conclusion—Using two independent probes, the I27 domain mutants and SBP tag, we evaluated motive force for N-domain translocation. When the probes were proximal to the SA-I sequence, their translocation was more strongly driven than when they were distal to the SA-I sequence. Insertion of a Pro residue into the SA-I sequence decreased the motive force. When the SBP tag probe was separated from the SA-I sequence, Pro insertion no longer affected translocation of the probe. These observations indicate that the SA-I sequence not only targets the ribosome-nascent chain complex to the translocon but also provides the motive force for the polypeptide chain movement. The SA-I sequence-mediated motive force is operative only within a limited region. Furthermore, it generates the motive force only during the initiation stage. At the initiation stage, the SA-I sequence is recognized by the translocon and triggers translocation of the N-domain. It is possible that the motive force for the movement is generated by the stroke of the TM segment into the translocon and decreased after it forms the TM topology. The stroke of the H-segment into the translocon or membrane might drive the polypeptide chain movement as a power stroke. Alternatively, the movement might be driven by Brownian movement of the polypeptide chain, and the TM segment formation of the SA-I sequence might be a ratchet. In both hypotheses, the motive force is likely dependent on the free energy of the hydrogen bonds of the TM helix formation and the hydrophobic interaction between the signal sequence and the lipid environment. Some C-terminal tail anchor sequences can mediate translocation of downstream sequences of more than 80 residues through the liposome membrane, even in the absence of the translocon (14Brambillasca S. Yabal M. Makarow M. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol... 2006; 175: 767-777Google Scholar), suggesting that partition of the TM sequence into a lipid environment may generate the free energy for the motive force of the 80-residue hydrophilic domain. Because the SA-I sequence of SytII is more hydrophobic than the tail anchor segments, it may be sufficient for translocation of N-terminal probes. Insertion of the Pro residue decreased hydrophobicity and/or α-helicity and led to a weaker interaction between the H-segment and the lipid. It may cause a defect in the exit from the translocon to the lipid environment. Furthermore, the motive force might be dependent on the kinetics of particular processes: TM helix formation, partition of the TM segment into membrane, and lateral gating of the translocon pore. Although further physicochemical studies are required to address these possibilities, the experimental system developed here would provide a powerful system for these analyses. After the TM conformation is achieved, the helix might function as a ratchet to fix the translocating polypeptide chain, and then the ongoing translocation occurring far from the signal sequence would not be affected by the Pro insertion. After that, several candidate energy-driving sources might be supposed in the progression stage, such as the ratchet and/or power stroke of the lumenal chaperone molecules and lateral diffusion of the TM segment into the lipid environment. In any case, those driving-force sources are clearly lower than that of the initiation stage, at which the SA-I sequence generates the motive force.

Evidence presented here shows that this “redundancy effect” can be attributed to a favorable sequence context and, to a lesser extent, remedial initiation. In the case of redundant ACG initiator codons, the second ACG not only acts as a remedial initiation site for scanning ribosomes that skip the first ACG but also enhances the activity of the preceding initiator by providing a preferable “A” at its relative +4 position. Hence, non-successive ACG codons can be as effective as successive ACG codons in initiation, if positioned within a similar context. In contrast, redundant GUG initiation codons (GUG/GUG) bear an unfavorable “G” nucleotide at both the +4 and –3 positions relative to the first and second GUGs, respectively, such that redundant GUG codons act more poorly as translation initiation sites than does a single GUG with a favorable “A” nucleotide in the +4 position (∼2.5-fold). Thus, the sequence context plays a much more important role than remedial initiation in modulating the efficiency of translational initiation from redundant non-AUG codons.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are a group of primordial enzymes, each of which catalyzes the attachment of a specific amino acid to its cognate tRNAs. Aminoacyl-tRNAs are then delivered by elongation factor-1 to ribosomes for protein translation. Typically there are 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in prokaryotes, one for each amino acid (1Carter Jr., C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Martinis S.A. Schimmel P. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 4Pelchat M. Lapointe J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 343-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, protein synthesis occurs not only in the cytoplasm, but also in organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts (5Dietrich A. Weil J.H. Maréchal-Drouard L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, eukaryotes, such as yeast, need two distinct sets of enzymes for each aminoacylation activity, one localized to the cytoplasm and the other to the mitochondria. Each set aminoacylates the isoaccepting tRNAs within its respective cell compartment and is sequestered from the isoacceptors confined in other compartments. In most cases, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial synthetase activities are encoded by two distinct nuclear genes, regardless of the cell compartments to which they are confined. However, two Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, HTS1 (the gene encoding histidyl-tRNA synthetase) (6Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and VAS1 (the gene encoding valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS) 3The abbreviations used are: ValRS, valyl-tRNA synthetase; aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; AlaRS, alanyl-tRNA synthetase; GlyRS, glycyl-tRNA synthetase; YPG, yeast extract-peptone-glycerol.3The abbreviations used are: ValRS, valyl-tRNA synthetase; aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; AlaRS, alanyl-tRNA synthetase; GlyRS, glycyl-tRNA synthetase; YPG, yeast extract-peptone-glycerol.) (7Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specify both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms through alternative initiation from two in-frame AUG codons. Each of these genes encodes more than one mRNA, and the mRNA species produced differ only at their 5′-ends. The mitochondrial form of the enzyme is translated from the first AUG on “long” mRNAs, while the cytosolic form is translated from the second AUG on “short” mRNAs, the 5′-ends of which are located between the first and second AUG initiator codons. Hence, mitochondrial enzymes have the same polypeptide sequences as their cytosolic counterparts, except for a short N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. The transit peptide is subsequently cleaved away upon being imported into mitochondria. Because the isozymes are targeted to different compartments, the two isoforms of ValRS, for example, cannot be substituted for each other in vivo (7Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.-P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A similar scenario has been observed for genes encoding the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic forms of Arabidopsis thaliana alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), threonyl-tRNA synthetase, and ValRS (9Souciet G. Menand B. Ovesna J. Cosset A. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, although two isoforms of AlaRS are generated in a similar manner in Candida albicans, the longer form per se appears to be dual-targeted and is thus functional in both compartments (10Huang H.Y. Kuei Y. Chao H.Y. Chen S.J. Yeh L.S. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31430-31439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two rare cases of one gene encoding both activities have been reported in yeast in which the protein isoforms are produced by alternative use of two in-frame initiation codons: an upstream non-AUG initiator and a downstream AUG initiator (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Translation initiation in eukaryotes is a stringent process requiring not only initiator tRNA but also many protein factors, including eukaryotic initiation factors eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, eIF4F, and eIF5. Upon binding to the cap structure, the 43 S preinitiation complex, composed of the 40 S ribosome and initiation factors, moves along the mRNA in a 3′ direction until it encounters the first AUG codon. At this point, GTP hydrolysis that leads to dissociation of the eIF2-GDP complex from the initiator tRNA in the preinitiation complex and subsequent Pi release signifies a 3-bp codon-anticodon interaction between Met-tRNA(i)(Met) and the start codon (13Unbehaun A. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U. Pestova T.V. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3078-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that eIF1 plays a critical role in start codon selection. Mutations of eIF1 may lead to reduced interaction of this initiation factor with 40 S subunits and increased initiation at UUG codons (14Cheung Y.N. Maag D. Mitchell S.F. Fekete C.A. Algire M.A. Takacs J.E. Shirokikh N. Pestova T. Lorsch J.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1217-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Previous studies on CYC1 (15Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Schweingruber A.M. Cell. 1980; 20: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in S. cerevisiae suggested that AUG is the only codon recognized as a translational initiator, and that the AUG codon nearest the 5′-end of mRNA serves as the start site for translation. If the first AUG codon is mutated, then initiation can begin at the next available AUG from the 5′-end of the message. The same rules apply to all eukaryotes. However, there are many examples in higher eukaryotes, where cellular and viral mRNAs can initiate from “non-AUG” codons that differ from AUG by just one nucleotide (16Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The relatively weak base pairing between a non-AUG codon and the anticodon of an initiator tRNA appears to be compensated for by interactions with nearby nucleotides, in particular a purine (A or G) at position –3 and a “G” at position +4 (17Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pisarev A.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Pisareva V.P. Merrick W.C. Hellen C.U.T. Pestova T.V. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 624-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations in the sequence region surrounding the first AUG can lead to its inefficient utilization as an initiator and subsequent use of AUG at a downstream location. In addition to the sequence context, a stable hairpin structure located 12–15 nucleotides downstream from the initiator can also facilitate recognition of a weak initiator by the 40 S ribosomal subunit (19Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Although some reports have suggested that sequences immediately preceding the initiation codon may also play a role in modulating the efficiency of AUG translation initiation in yeast, the magnitude of this context effect appears relatively insignificant (20Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 21Baim S.B. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2964-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Perhaps for that reason, yeast cannot efficiently use non-AUG codons as the translation start site (23Zitomer R.S. Walthall D.A. Rymond B.C. Hollenberg C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Clements J.M. Laz T.M. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4533-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, three yeast genes, GRS1 (one of the two glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) genes in S. cerevisiae) (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), ALA1 (the only alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) gene in S. cerevisiae) (12Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and CARP2A (the gene coding for acidic ribosomal protein P2A in Candida albicans) (25Abramczyk D. Tchorzewski M. Grankowski N. Yeast. 2003; 20: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), have recently been reported to use naturally occurring non-AUG triplets as translation initiators. Moreover, a very recent study suggested that the translational efficiency of non-AUG initiation codons is significantly affected (up to 32-fold) by nucleotides at its relative –3 to –1 position, and, to a lesser extent, +4 (26Chen S.J. Lin G. Chang K.J. Yeh L.S. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3173-3180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The nucleotide at position –3 is the most influential one. AARuugA (R represents A or G; uug represents a non-AUG initiation codon) appears to be the most favorable sequence context for a non-AUG initiation site (26Chen S.J. Lin G. Chang K.J. Yeh L.S. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3173-3180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the case of CARP2A, a non-AUG codon, i.e. GUG, serves as the exclusive translation initiator, whereas in the cases of ALA1 and GRS1, non-AUG codons act as alternative translation initiators that are accompanied by a downstream in-frame AUG initiation codon. Although two homologous GlyRS genes have been identified in the yeast genome (GRS1 and GRS2), only GRS1 is functional by possessing both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aminoacylation activities, while GRS2 appears to be dispensable for growth (27Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further studies indicated that two functionally exclusive protein isoforms are alternatively generated from GRS1. A short form that is responsible for the cytoplasmic activity of GlyRS is translationally initiated from a classic AUG initiator, whereas a longer isoform that provides the mitochondrial activity is initiated from an upstream in-frame UUG codon (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Expression of ALA1 essentially follows a similar mechanism. However, it is noteworthy that the mitochondrial form of AlaRS is initiated from two successive in-frame ACG codons 69 nucleotides upstream of the AUG initiator of the cytoplasmic form (12Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Huang H.Y. Tang H.L. Chao H.Y. Yeh L.S. Wang C.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that redundant ACGs contain stronger initiation activity than does a single ACG and can functionally substitute for the alternative AUG initiator codons of VAS1 (coding for mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isoforms of ValRS) in vivo. This feature of redundancy of non-AUG initiator codons may in itself represent a novel mechanism to improve the overall efficiency of a poor initiation event (29Chang K.J. Lin G. Men L.C. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7775-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). So far, it is not clear whether this mechanism is a general feature of all possible non-AUG initiation codons. Moreover, because the sequence context also plays a role in modulating the efficiency of translation initiation from a non-AUG codon (26Chen S.J. Lin G. Chang K.J. Yeh L.S. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3173-3180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), redundancy of non-AUG initiation codons may run into a situation in which the initiation codons are flanked by an unfavorable sequence context imposed by themselves. For example, redundant GUG codons (GUG/GUG) bear an unfavorable nucleotide G at both the +4 and –3 positions relative to the first and second GUGs, respectively. Hence, the redundancy of GUG codons might not improve the efficiency of translation at all, but instead may impair the initiating activity of the preceding GUG codon and the overall efficiency of translation. In the work described here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the translational efficiencies of several pairs of redundant and single non-AUG initiation codons and determined the effect of the sequence context on the translational activity. Our results suggested that a redundancy of non-AUG initiation codons does not always significantly enhance the translational efficiency and does so only when the first nucleotide of the initiation codons is an “A.” Construction of Plasmids—Various ALA1-lexA fusions for the Western blot analysis were constructed as previously described (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Chang K.J. Lin G. Men L.C. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7775-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, an initiator mutant of lexA was amplified by PCR as an SpeI-XhoI fragment and cloned in appropriate sites of pADH (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To construct various ALA1-lexA fusions, a wild-type or mutant ALA1 sequence containing base pairs –105 to –24 relative to ATG1 was amplified by PCR as a PstI-SpeI fragment and cloned in-frame into the 5′-end of the lexA mutant. The expression of these constructs was under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter (30Bennetzen J.L. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3018-3025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that, because the native initiator codon of lexA was rendered inactive, the only translational initiation sites for these fusion constructs are those which exist in the ALA1 portion. To generate mutations in the 5′ leader region of the ALA1 gene, a short ALA1 sequence containing bp –300 to +60 (relative to ATG1) was PCR-amplified from the full-length ALA1 clone as an EagI-XbaI fragment and cloned in appropriate sites of pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This construct was subsequently used as a template for mutagenesis. Mutagenesis was carried out following standard protocols provided by the manufacturer (Stratagene). After mutagenesis, the ALA1 fragment carrying the desired mutation was recovered from the plasmid by EagI/XbaI digestion and then fused in-frame to the 5′-end of a truncated version of ALA1 lacking the EagI-XbaI segment, yielding a full-length ALA1 clone. Note that the XbaI site is a native restriction site between bp +55 and +60 of ALA1. To generate mutations in the 5′ leader region of the VAS1 gene, a similar approach was followed (29Chang K.J. Lin G. Men L.C. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7775-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Complementation Assays for the Mitochondrial Function of VAS1—The yeast VAS1 knockout strain, CW1, was previously described (8Wang C.C. Chang K.J. Tang H.L. Hsieh C.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1646-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To test the mitochondrial function of the wild-type and mutant VAS1 constructs, CW1 was first transformed with a test plasmid (carrying a LEU2 marker) and plated onto selection medium lacking uracil and leucine. Following 5′-fluoroorotate selections, a single colony of transformants was selected and grown to the stationary phase in synthetic medium lacking leucine. Starting from a cell density of 1.0 A600, cultures were 10-fold serially diluted, and 5-μl aliquots of each dilution were spotted onto the designated YPG plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Photos were taken of the complementation assays at day 3 following incubation. Because a yeast cell cannot survive on glycerol without functional mitochondria, the transformants did not grow on the YPG plates unless a functional mitochondrial ValRS was provided by the test plasmid. Complementation assays for the mitochondrial function of ALA1 followed a similar protocol (12Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—The protein expression patterns of the ALA1-lexA fusions were determined by a chemiluminescence-based Western blot analysis. The lexA fusion constructs that were expressed under the control of a constitutive ADH promoter were first transformed into INVSc1 (Invitrogen), and the transformants were subsequently grown in selection medium lacking leucine. Total protein extracts were prepared from each transformant with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of the protein extracts (10–40 μg) were loaded onto a gel containing 10% polyacrylamide and electrophoresed at 100 V for 1–2 h. Following electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were transferred using a semi-dry transfer device to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a buffer containing 30 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris base (pH 8.3), 0.037% SDS, and 20% methanol. The membrane was probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-LexA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then exposed to x-ray film following the addition of the appropriate substrates. Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments (only one blot is shown in each figure), and the relative intensity of the protein bands shown is presented as a percentage using the mean value of the intensity of the protein band translated from the native initiator (or its equivalent) as a reference. Degradation Assay—To determine the turnover of the fusion proteins, analogous ALA1-lexA constructs were made and expressed under the control of an inducible GAL1 promoter. Transformants carrying these constructs were first grown in medium lacking leucine with 2% raffinose to a cell density of ∼1.0 A600 and then induced with 2% galactose for 1 h. Afterward, the cells were washed twice and then grown in medium lacking leucine with 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 h postinduction and lysed. Forty-microgram samples of the cellular lysates were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide and electrophoresed at 100 V for 1–2 h, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. RT-PCR—To determine the relative levels of specific ALA1-lexA mRNAs derived from these fusion constructs, a semiquantitative reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR experiment was carried out following the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Total RNA was first isolated from the transformant, and aliquots (∼1 μg) of the RNA were then reverse-transcribed into single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) using an oligo(dT) primer. After RNase H treatment, the single-stranded cDNA products were amplified by PCR using a pair of specific primers. The forward and reverse primers contained sequences complementary to nucleotides –90 to –70 of ALA1 (5′-TATGAAAGCAGTTTGATTGAA-3′) and nucleotides +370 to +390 of lexA (5′-CAAGTCACCATCCATAATGCC-3′), respectively. To obtain more reliable data, two different cycle numbers of PCR amplification were carried out for each cDNA preparation as indicated in the figure. As a control, the relative levels of actin-specific mRNAs in each preparation were also determined using a set of primers complementary to nucleotides +537 to +560 (5′-ACCAACTGGGACGATATGGAAAAG-3′) and nucleotides +696 to +719 (5′-TTGGATGGAAACGTAGAAGGCTGG-3′) of actin, respectively, and only the cDNA products of 21 cycles of PCR amplification are shown. β-Galactosidase Assay—Yeast cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s and resuspended in 100 μl of breaking buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and 100 μl of beads. Cells were then lysed at 4 °C using a bead beater, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min. Aliquots of the supernatants (25 μg) were diluted to 0.8 ml with Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). β-Galactosidase activity assays were initiated (at 37 °C) by adding 0.2 ml of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside (4 mg/ml). The reaction mixtures were incubated with constant shaking at 37 °C for 20 min and then terminated by the addition of 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min, and the absorbance (A420) of the supernatants was determined. Relative β-galactosidase activities were calculated from A420 readings normalized to protein concentrations. Translational Efficiencies of Redundant versus Single Non-AUG Initiation Codons—Our previous study showed that two distinct protein isoforms are generated from the yeast ALA1 gene via alternative use of two in-frame initiation sites. The longer form that accounts for the mitochondrial activity is initiated from ACG(–25)/ACG(–24) (the numbers “-25” and “-24” in parenthesis refer to the 25th and 24th codon triplets that precede AUG1), whereas the short form that is responsible for the cytoplasmic activity is initiated from AUG1 (11Chang K.J. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13778-13785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Further study suggested that the redundancy of ACG initiation codons may represent a novel mechanism to enhance the overall efficiency of translation (29Chang K.J. Lin G. Men L.C. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7775-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this is a common feature of all possible non-AUG initiation codons (that differ from AUG by a single nucleotide), redundant ACG initiation codons were mutated to various redundant or single non-AUG initiation codons (Fig. 1A), and the translational efficiencies of the resultant constructs were tested. We used an initiator mutant of lexA as a reporter to monitor the relative initiating activities and thus levels of expression of various ALA1-lexA fusions (see “Experimental Procedures”) (12Tang H.L. Yeh L.S. Chen N.K. Ripmaster T. Schimmel P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49656-49663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The first nucleotide of all initiator candidates chosen for this assay differed (Fig. 1A), so that we could simultaneously examine “remedial initiation” and the “context effect” (particularly the –3 and +4 nucleotides relative to the second and first initiator codons, respectively). Consistent with previous observations (29Chang K.J. Lin G. Men L.C. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7775-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), Fig. 1B shows that redundant ACG codons acted better than ACG/ACC and ACG/TCG as a translational initiation site by 2.5- and 6.0-fold, respectively (Fig. 1B, numbers 1–3). In contrast to the case scenario of ACG initiation, redundant GTG codons did not exhibit the expected “redundancy effect” at all. Instead, the translational efficiency of GTG/GTG was almost equivalent to that of a single GTG (GTG/GTC) with an unfavorable G nucleotide in its relative +4 position, and 2.5-fold lower than that of a single GTG (GTG/ACC) with a favorable “A” nucleotide in its relative +4 position (Fig. 1B, numbers 4 and 5). This result suggested that the second GTG in redundant GTG codons is essentially inactive as a remedial initiation site, probably due to the presence of an unfavorable G nucleotide in its relative –3 position (Fig. 1B, numbers 4 and 6). As a result, a single GTG codon with a favorable A nucleotide in its relative +4 position functioned better as a translational initiation site than did redundant GTG codons (Fig. 1B, numbers 4 and 5). Similar to the case of redundant GTG codons, redundancy of TTG initiation codons failed to enhance the protein yield (Fig. 1, A and B, numbers 7–9). The initiating activity of TTG/ACC was slightly higher than that of redundant TTG codons (∼1.5-fold) (Fig. 1B, numbers 7 and 8). Strangely enough, the initiating activity of TTG/TTC was also slightly higher than that of redundant TTG codons (∼1.5-fold) (Fig. 1B, numbers 7 and 9). Also, TTG/TTC and TTG/TTT expressed similar levels of proteins (Fig. 1E, numbers 9 and 13). Note that both TTT and TTC code for Phe. Although this result suggests that the second amino acid may affect the stability of the protein product (31Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 21: 6155-6168Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the possibility that the nucleotide at position +6 plays a minor role in modulating the efficiency of translation initiation cannot be ruled out at the moment. As for CTG initiation, the initiating activity of redundant CTG codons was equivalent to that of a single CTG codon with a favorable +4 A nucleotide, and was 2-fold higher than that of a single CTG with an unfavorable +4 C nucleotide (Fig. 1, A and B, numbers 10–12). Therefore, it appears that a favorable nucleotide at position +4 is just as good as redundancy of initiator codons in this instance. To check whether the ALA1-lexA fusions shown in Fig. 1B expressed similar levels of mRNAs, a semiquantitative RT-PCR was conducted. Two different cycle numbers of PCR amplification were carried out for each construct and compared. Fig. 1C shows that similar levels of cDNA products were generated from these fusions, suggesting that these mutations did not impair the stability of the specific mRNAs in vivo. To verify whether the data of Western blots shown in Fig. 1B truthfully reflect the translational efficiencies of the various initiation codons, we next used lacZ as a reporter gene. The lexA portion of constructs 1–6 used in Fig. 1B was replaced by a lacZ reporter gene where the native initiator codon ATG had been mutated to ACT. Therefore, the redundant ACG initiator codons (or their derivatives) in the ALA1 portion became the only initiation sites for the translation of the AlaRS-LacZ fusion proteins. To examine the initiating activities of various initiation codons, aliquots of the soluble"

Here we show that functional exosites can be engineered at homologous positions in a P1 Arg variant of the serpin alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1PI) that does not require heparin for activation. The combined effect of the two exosites increased the association rate constant for the reactions of alpha1PI with factors Xa and IXa 11-14-fold, comparable with their rate-enhancing effects on the reactions of heparin-activated antithrombin with these proteases. The effects of the engineered exosites were specific, alpha1PI inhibitor reactions with trypsin and thrombin being unaffected. Mutation of Arg-150 in factor Xa, which interacts with the exosite residues in heparin-activated antithrombin, abrogated the ability of the engineered exosites in alpha1PI to promote factor Xa inhibition. Binding studies showed that the exosites enhance the Michaelis complex interaction of alpha1PI with S195A factor Xa as they do with the heparin-activated antithrombin interaction. Replacement of the P4-P2 AIP reactive loop residues in the alpha1PI exosite variant with a preferred IEG substrate sequence for factor Xa modestly enhanced the reactivity of the exosite mutant inhibitor with factor Xa by approximately 2-fold but greatly increased the selectivity of alpha1PI for inhibiting factor Xa over thrombin by approximately 1000-fold. Together, these results show that a specific and selective inhibitor of factor Xa can be engineered by incorporating factor Xa exosite and reactive site recognition determinants in a serpin."
https://openalex.org/W2081536501,"The R-ras gene encodes a small GTPase of the ras family that is closely related to H-ras and K-ras. Unlike the prototypic ras genes, the disruption of the R-ras gene in mice results in enhanced angiogenesis in tumor implants and sustained neointimal hyperplasia in response to arterial injury, indicating the in vivo role of R-ras as a negative regulator of vascular proliferation. R-ras is abundantly expressed in normal mature blood vessels but significantly down-regulated in pathologically regenerating vasculature. In this study, we investigated the roles of cis-acting elements in the transcription of the human R-ras gene, as well as the transcription factors that interact with these sequences in cultured endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells. The findings from vascular cells were then compared with findings from epithelial tumor cells that aberrantly express R-ras. Deletion analyses on 5 kb of 5′-flanking DNA of the human R-ras gene revealed the functional importance of the region between –727/–476, which contains two Ets and one Sp1 consensus binding motifs. Mutation analyses of various consensus binding motifs within this region suggest both cell type-dependent and -independent regulatory mechanisms for the R-ras gene transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift and antibody disruption assays demonstrated that an Ets transcription factor family protein, GA-binding protein (GABP), binds to the R-ras-derived sequence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses determined the association of endogenous GABP as well as Sp3 proteins with the –727/–476 region of the R-ras promoter in intact cells grown in culture. Forced expression of GABP significantly enhanced R-ras mRNA expression level in endothelial cells. These results map the functional elements in the R-ras promoter sequence and suggest that the GABP may be critical for transcription of R-ras and for maintenance of normal blood vessel functions through the regulation of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W2066946720,"To investigate whether the C-terminal loop 13 of rabbit sodium/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 is involved in the recognition of the substrate d-glucose, isolated loop 13 (amino acids (aa) 541–638) was immobilized to a lipid bilayer. Interactions were investigated by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy using an antibody directed against the late part of the loop (aa 606–631) or the glucoside transport inhibitor phlorizin. Specific binding of the antibody to the loop could be detected. The number of bound antibodies decreased upon the addition of d-glucose but not upon the addition of l-glucose. Phlorizin also significantly lowered the number of bound antibodies. Binding of phlorizin to the loop could also be demonstrated directly. Binding of phlorizin was, however, reduced to a similar extent upon the addition of either d-glucose or l-glucose, indicating their unspecific competition with the inhibitor's sugar moiety. Thus, the presence of a stereospecific glucose interaction site in the late part of the loop and a second, but non-stereospecific, sugar binding site on the same loop was assumed. To investigate whether the early part of loop 13 contains this non-stereospecific sugar binding site, peptides containing aa 541–598 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Both d-glucose and l-glucose quenched the peptides tryptophan fluorescence and reduced the Trp accessibility to acrylamide to a similar degree. In view of the recently proposed transmembrane orientation of loop 13, the two binding sites may be part of the extracellular (stereospecific) and intracellular (non-stereospecific) sugar interaction sites of SGLT1.

In the human kidney two transporters accomplish proximal-tubular glucose resorption on the luminal side of tubule cells; whereas the low affinity sodium/glucose cotransporter SGLT2 3The abbreviations used are: SGLT, sodium-glucose cotransporter; rbSGLT1, sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (rabbit isoform); FC, fluid cell; RU, resonance units; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; NTA, N-nitrilotriacetic acid; DOGS-Ni2+-NTA, nickel salt of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-{N-[(5-amino-1-caboxypentyl)iminodiaceticacid]succinyl}; aa, amino acid(s). is located in the early proximal kidney tubule, the high affinity sodium/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 can be found in the late proximal tubule (1Barfuss D.W. Schafer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: F322-F332PubMed Google Scholar). On the basal side of the epithelial cells sugar transport to the blood is mediated by the sugar uniporter GLUT2. SGLT1 and SGLT2 are secondary active sodium/glucose symporters, i.e. they use the electrochemical sodium gradient across the membrane, which is maintained by the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase, to accumulate their substrates within the cell. The sodium/glucose cotransporters SGLT2 in brush border membrane vesicle preparations from human renal outer cortex, representing segments of the early proximal tubule, have a low affinity for d-glucose (Km = 6 mm) and a transporter stoichiometry of 1 Na+ to 1 glucose (2Turner R.J. Silverman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2825-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast, SGLT1 in brush border membrane vesicle from the rabbit outer medulla (Km = 0.35 mm) and skate kidney (Km = 0.12 mm) have a significantly higher affinity for d-glucose and a transporter stoichiometry of 2 Na+ to 1 glucose (3Kipp H. Kinne-Saffran E. Bevan C. Kinne R.K.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R134-R142PubMed Google Scholar). Several models for sodium/glucose cotransport have been developed by correlating structure-determining and functional studies of SGLT1 (e.g. Refs. 4Wielert-Badt S. Hinterdorfer P. Gruber H.J.

Biol. 2003; 192: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Expressing only parts of SGLT1 has further increased the knowledge about this transporter (e.g. Refs. 6Raja M.M. Tyagi N.K.

Substrate binding and translocation by SGLT1 is thought to be a multistep process showing strong stereospecificity at the extracellular face of the transporter (d-glucose is favored over l-glucose) (e.g. Refs. 4Wielert-Badt S.

Kinne R.K.H. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 179: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that there are at least two sugar interaction sites on rabbit SGLT1, one representing the initial binding site and one related to the translocation pathway (10Puntheeranurak T. Wimmer B. Castaneda F. Gruber H.J. Hinterdorfer P. Kinne R.K.H. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SGLT1 can be inhibited by several glucosides with either aromatic or aliphatic aglucone residues (11Diedrich D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Kipp H. Lin J.T. Kinne R.K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1282: 124-130Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phlorizin, a β-glucoside of the aromatic compound phloretin, is the most potent inhibitor with an apparent Ki value of 1 μm (11Diedrich D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 117: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In previous studies we have shown that phlorizin binds to loop 13 of rabbit SGLT1 (aa 541–638) via the aromatic aglucone moiety inducing conformational changes of the loop, predominantly in the region between aa 600 and aa 621 (4Wielert-Badt S.

Mutagenesis experiments provided also data on individual amino acids critically important for the interaction with the inhibitors (6Raja M.M. Tyagi N.K. Kinne R.K.H. J. Biol.

In addition, the role of loop 13 in the interaction with phlorizin has been investigated by examining binding of PAN3-2 antibody. PAN3-2, raised against a peptide representing aa 606–630 on the C-terminal (“late”) part of loop 13, was shown to interact with the extracellular side of whole SGLT1 in brush border membrane vesicles and intact cells, and this interaction could be blocked by phlorizin (e.g. Ref. 4Wielert-Badt S.

Biol. 1999; 170: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although the interaction of the transporter with phlorizin and its aglucone phloretin is fairly well understood, there are only few studies that investigate the interaction of the transporter with its substrate d-glucose. Panayotova-Heiermann et al. (16Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Kong C.T. Lever J.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the C-terminal half of the protein is responsible for d-glucose binding and translocation. Several mutagenesis studies and tryptophan scanning analysis of the isolated transporter have identified a variety of amino acids in the transmembrane helix between aa 454 and aa 460 (18Diez-Sampedro A. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. Zampighi G.A. Hirayama B.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13175-13184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Tyagi N.K. Kumar A. Goyal P. Pandey D. Siess W. Kinne R.K.H. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13616-13628Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There is also evidence from single molecule recognition studies on brush border membrane vesicles using PAN3-2-poised cantilevers that d-glucose interacts with loop 13 of the transporter. These studies face, however, the problem that no distinction between binding sites and translocation pathways of the transporter can be made. In the current study, we therefore employed isolated loop 13 to directly study the interaction of sugars with this domain of the transporter. The complete loop was immobilized on a phospholipid bilayer, and the interactions were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Specific binding of the PAN3-2 antibody and of phlorizin to the complete loop 13 could be detected which was significantly but differently reduced in the presence of d-glucose and l-glucose, suggesting the involvement of loop 13 in glucose binding. Its role in sugar binding was also confirmed by tryptophan fluorescence and acrylamide quenching studies on isolated peptides representing the early parts of loop 13. The data suggest that loop 13 contains a non-stereospecific interaction site for sugars in its early part (aa 548–571), probably located intracellularly, and a stereospecific sugar binding site in its late part (aa 620–631), definitely located extracellularly. To what extent these sites are indeed involved in the sugar binding and translocation process of SGLT1 remains to be determined. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles and Solutions—For preparation of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles, 2 mg of POPC was dissolved in 2 ml of CHCl3. For preparation of POPC-Ni2+-NTA vesicles, 5 mol % of DOGS-Ni2+-NTA, the nickel salt of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-{N-[(5-amino-1-caboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid]succinyl} was included. CHCl3 was evaporated by a stream of nitrogen, and the resulting lipid film was further dried at 1–10 pascals for at least 10 min. Vesicles were generated by ultrasonication in 2 ml of buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) under argon atmosphere until the solution became clear. All solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm pore size filters (Nalgene) before usage. HEPES buffer containing 5 mm oxidized glutathione was used to prevent a breaking open of the disulfide bridge between Cys-560 and Cys-608. Glutathione-containing buffer was mixed, degassed, and held oxygen-free during experiments by continuous purging with helium. Although buffers were held at room temperature during BIACORE experiments, vesicles and samples were kept on ice and light-protected. Stock solutions of sugars and inhibitors were freshly prepared before experiments. Dilution of these components with glutathione-containing HEPES buffer to the desired final concentrations (10 mm sugar, 0.5 mm phlorizin, 0.3 mm phloretin, 0.3 mm arbutin) was done immediately before injection into the BIACORE. Running BIACORE Sensograms—All experiments were done on a BIACORE X setup at a temperature of 25 °C using sensor chip L1 (produced by Biacore AB, a GE Healthcare company). cDNAs coding for whole loop 13 of rabbit SGLT1 (aa 541–638) were amplified by PCR (13Novakova R. Homerova D. Kinne R.K.H. Kinne-Saffran E. Lin J.T. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 184: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), His6-tagged, expressed, and purified as described earlier (20Xia X.B. Lin J.T. Kinne R.K.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The antibody PAN3-2 and the short peptide A606 representing the amino acid sequence of the PAN3-2 epitope were synthesized and purified as described before (15Lin J. Kormanec J. Homerová D. Kinne R.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 170: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The serial order of flow cells had to be kept in mind to avoid contaminations of flow cell 2 (FC2) with material coming from flow cell 1 (FC1), whereas a multichannel flow path (FC1-2) was used (for a detailed description, see Ref. 21Hölzl M. Tinazli A. Leitner C. Hahn C.D. Lackner B. Tampé R. Gruber H.J. Langmuir. 2007; 23: 5571-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Injections had a volume of 100 μl each. If dissociation of analytes was taken into consideration (to reach a stable value after injection), then the automatic wash cycle of the injection port normally after an injection was delayed for 120 s. Sensor chips were treated with 40 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside solution for 2 min first, then vesicle solution was injected into both FCs with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. To remove multilayers and entire vesicles, both FCs were flooded with 100 mm NaOH (at 50 μl/min for 2 min) afterward. It has been shown that a dense lipid layer causes a stable increase in the resonance signal of about 1000 resonance units (short term, RU) (22Erb E.M. Chen X. Allen S. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J. Davies M.C. Forsen S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hence, the signal level after the end of the NaOH injection had to remain higher than this critical mark; otherwise, vesicle and NaOH injections were repeated (see Fig. 1A). Freshly diluted loop 13 (in a final concentration of 1 μg/ml) was injected using multimode flow path FC1-2 next (5 μl/min) till saturation. Again, the peptide was required to cause a signal increase of more than 100 RU, and the signal level after the end of the peptide injection had to remain higher than this critical mark for at least 2 min; otherwise, the injection was repeated. Blocking experiments were characterized by three consecutive injections with 10 μl/min for minutes 10 each after the peptide immobilization. First, 3.5 μg/ml PAN3-2 or 0.5 mm phlorizin was injected into FC2 to get a reference value for unblocked interaction between immobilized loop 13 and the antibody or the inhibitor, respectively. Second, sugar or inhibitor (acting as blocking reagent of PAN3-2 or phlorizin binding, respectively, during experiments) was injected in FC1-2 to interact with unaffected loop 13 in FC1 and to show if it can remove already bound antibody/phlorizin from peptides in FC2. And third, a mixture of this blocking reagent and antibody/phlorizin (same concentrations as before) was injected into FC1 to investigate the ability of the blocking substance to hinder PAN3-2 or phlorizin from binding to immobilized loop 13. As the last step of a sensogram, SDS was used for removal any immobilized material from the sensor chip. A whole sensogram is given in Fig. 1A. The injection schemes of some control experiments (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2) differed from the scheme given above and could not be generalized, but normally FC1 was used as “investigation cell” and FC2 as “control cell.” Evaluation of Sensograms—Sensograms were evaluated using BIAevaluation, Version 3. To test the stability of signal levels after injections of vesicles, loop 13, PAN3-2, or phlorizin, mean signal values from the end of the respective injection to 90 s afterward were calculated and S.D. were determined (Table 1).TABLE 1Changes in BIACORE signals by phospholipids, loop 13, PAN3-2 antibody, and phlorizin The RU values were obtained from signal levels representing the 90 s after either the start of the NaOH injection, which removed POPC-Ni2+-NTA or POPC multilayers and led to a stable signal due to the presence of a dense bilayer, or the start of the buffer wash after peptide, PAN3-2, or phlorizin injection (see Fig. 1A).

First, the starting point of peptide injection was set to time point zero (x transformation), and both signal curves were set to a common baseline (y transformation). Subsequently, the sensogram representing FC2 was equalized to its counterpart of FC1 using RU values at the end of peptide injection as reference values, and mean values of curve parts preceding antibody/phlorizin injections were set to RU = 0. To get the mean percentage of residual antibody/phlorizin binding over the time span of 90 s after the end of the respective injections, 100 × RUFC1/RUFC2 was calculated for every single time point. Examples for modified curves are shown in Figs. 3 and 4.FIGURE 4Phlorizin binding to loop 13 immobilized on POPC-bilayers and the influence of glucosides and sugars in BIACORE experiments.

BamHI and EcoRI sites introduced in forward and reverse primers, respectively, are indicated in bold letters. PCR conditions were optimized, and the product was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and alcohol precipitation. DNA was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, separated on 1.5% agarose gel, and extracted using QIA-quick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). After the DNA fragment had been subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector, the recombinant plasmid was sequenced and then transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. The GST-tagged part of loop 13 was expressed using 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 3.5 h at 37 °C in a 2-liter culture. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 adjusted to pH 7.3) supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture. Afterward, they were effectively lysed using a SONOPULS ultrasonic homogenization system under mild conditions. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,000 g for 45 min at 4 °C, and supernatants containing GST-tagged peptides were applied to glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) after passage through a 0.2-μm filter. Soluble fractions of early loop 13 were generated by treating the glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized fusion peptide, derived from pGEX-4T-1, with 2 units of thrombin per ml of column (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 16 h at 4 °C after removing protease inhibitor. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis (using a precasted Bis-Tris 4–12% gel in Tris-glycine running buffer) and staining with Coomassie Blue (a picture of the gel is shown in the supplemental material). Finally, protein concentration was determined by the method according to Lowry using bovine serum albumin as a standard (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 248: 25-32Google Scholar). A short fusion protein of GST (representing aa 548–590 of SGLT1) was a gift from Jutta Luig and Hendrike Schütz from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany. Soluble fractions of this peptide were generated by treating the glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized fusion peptide with 2 units of factor Xa per ml of column (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 16 h at 4 °C after removing protease inhibitor. The purity of the GST-cleaved peptide (∼5 kDa) was assessed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). MALDI Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion linear mode on a Voyager DE-PRO MALDI system (PE Biosystems) as described previously (6Raja M.M. Tyagi N.K. Kinne R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49154-49163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, after mixing the solubilized protein with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (saturated 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile), 0.5-μl aliquots of the mixture were dispensed onto the sample support followed by 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile). Samples were deposited on a MALDI plate and dried at room temperature before collecting the spectrum (the spectrum can be seen in the supplemental material). Tryptophan Fluorescence and Acrylamide Quenching—All fluorescence experiments were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B Luminescence spectrometer fitted with 450-watt xenon arc lamp at room temperature. The samples were excited at 295 nm, and emission spectra were collected between 300 and 400 nm. The bandwidths for both excitation and emission monochromators were 5 nm. Acrylamide quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was performed to check the accessibility of Trp-561 as a function of d/l-glucose (see Fig. 5, A and C). Acrylamide was added in aliquots from a 5 m stock solution to the peptide solution up to a concentration of about 18 mm. The Stern-Volmer equation was used to analyze the quenching data (24Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Kluwer Academic Publishers/Plenum Press, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar): F0/F = 1 + KSV [Q], where F0 is the Trp fluorescence in the absence of quencher, and F is the observed fluorescence at the concentration [Q] of the quencher. KSV is the collisional quenching constant, which was determined from the slope of Stern-Volmer plots (see Fig. 5, B and D, Table 3). The inner filter effects of the ligands for the titration of an l-Trp solution (5 μm) at an excitation of 295 nm and emission at 355 nm were found to be very weak; hence, they were not considered further in our measurements.TABLE 3Effect of d-glucose and l-glucose on the Trp fluorescence of the early part of loop 13 (aa 541–598) and of the truncated early part of loop 13 (aa 548–590)PeptideSugarsQuenchingaThe parameters were derived from the fluorescence quenching data shown in Figs. 5, A and C.

The step size was 0.5 nm with a 1.0-nm bandwidth at a scan speed of 50 nm/min. An average of 10 scans was obtained for blank and peptide spectrum, and data were corrected for buffer contributions. All measurements were performed under nitrogen flow. Predicted percentages for different kinds of secondary structure were calculated using the K2d computer modeling program, and the results were named as mean residue ellipticity in units of degrees/cm2/dmol (see supplemental material). The spectrum was recorded at 10 μm peptide concentration in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Immobilization of Isolated Whole Loop 13 to a Lipid Bilayer—To investigate the optimum conditions under which loop 13 could be immobilized on bilayers, the interaction of the peptide with lipid bilayer chips was examined by real-time surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIACORE). Initially, chip surfaces of flow cells were covered by POPC vesicles containing 5% of DOGS-Ni2+-NTA, the nickel salt of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-{N-[(5-amino-1-caboxypentyl)iminodiacetic-acid]succinyl} to fix the peptides via their His6 tags, a method used to purify the peptides during their isolation. Indeed, immobilization of loop 13 to POPC-Ni2+-NTA vesicles gave a value of 566 ± 36 RU (mean values ± S.D., n = 3, Table 1), suggesting interactions between His6 tags of loop 13 and Ni2+-NTA (Fig. 1A). To test this hypothesis, the Ni2+-loaded lipid bilayer was first treated with 100 mm EDTA to block all Ni2+ ions, and the peptide was applied subsequently. As shown in Fig. 1B, peptide immobilization could be completely prevented by EDTA. Another characteristic of the interaction between His6 tags and Ni2+-NTA is that the bonding is destabilized by high concentrations of imidazole. This maneuver failed, however, under the experimental conditions employed (see Fig. 1C), as the peptide could not be removed by even 200 mm imidazole. Hence, additional interactions between the phospholipids and the peptide had to be assumed. Another experiment, depicted in Fig. 1D, clearly demonstrated that Ni2+-NTA groups were not necessary for immobilization of isolated whole loop 13. The signal increases related to loop 13 injections were similar whether the peptides were immobilized to pure POPC or POPC-Ni2+-NTA bilayer. Immobilization of loop 13 to a dense bilayer formed by pure POPC caused a mean signal of 468 ± 216 RU (mean value ± S.D., n = 10, Table 1), which is not significantly different from the value obtained in the presence of Ni2+-NTA groups. Therefore, in all further studies the peptides were immobilized to pure POPC bilayers to guarantee maximum flexibility and optimum functionality of the loop.

https://openalex.org/W2030180246,"Large numbers of sequence elements have been identified to be highly conserved among vertebrate genomes. These highly conserved elements (HCEs) are often located in or around genes that are involved in transcription regulation and early development. They have been shown to be involved in cis-regulatory activities through both in vivo and additional computational studies. We have investigated the structural relationships between such elements and genes in six vertebrate genomes human, mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish and tetraodon and detected several thousand cases of conserved HCE-gene associations, and also cases of HCEs with no common target genes. A few examples underscore the potential significance of our findings about several individual genes. We found that the conserved association between HCE/HCEs and gene/genes are not restricted to elements by their absolute distance on the genome. Notably, long-range associations were identified and the molecular functions of the associated genes do not show any particular overrepresentation of the functional categories previously reported. HCEs in close proximity are found to be linked with different set of gene/genes. The results reflect the highly complex correlation between HCEs and their putative target genes."
