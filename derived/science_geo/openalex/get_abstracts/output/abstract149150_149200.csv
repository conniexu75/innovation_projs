https://openalex.org/W2120904752,"Campylobacter jejuni, from the delta-epsilon group of proteobacteria, is a microaerophilic, Gram-negative, flagellate, spiral bacterium—properties it shares with the related gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. It is the leading cause of bacterial food-borne diarrhoeal disease throughout the world1. In addition, infection with C. jejuni is the most frequent antecedent to a form of neuromuscular paralysis known as Guillain–Barré syndrome2. Here we report the genome sequence of C. jejuni NCTC11168. C. jejuni has a circular chromosome of 1,641,481 base pairs (30.6% G+C) which is predicted to encode 1,654 proteins and 54 stable RNA species. The genome is unusual in that there are virtually no insertion sequences or phage-associated sequences and very few repeat sequences. One of the most striking findings in the genome was the presence of hypervariable sequences. These short homopolymeric runs of nucleotides were commonly found in genes encoding the biosynthesis or modification of surface structures, or in closely linked genes of unknown function. The apparently high rate of variation of these homopolymeric tracts may be important in the survival strategy of C. jejuni."

https://openalex.org/W2023797120,"Bulk quantities of defect-free silicon (Si) nanowires with nearly uniform diameters ranging from 40 to 50 angstroms were grown to a length of several micrometers with a supercritical fluid solution-phase approach. Alkanethiol-coated gold nanocrystals (25 angstroms in diameter) were used as uniform seeds to direct one-dimensional Si crystallization in a solvent heated and pressurized above its critical point. The orientation of the Si nanowires produced with this method could be controlled with reaction pressure. Visible photoluminescence due to quantum confinement effects was observed, as were discrete optical transitions in the ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectra."

https://openalex.org/W2022891092,"All computers process information electronically. A processing method based on magnetism is reported here, in which networks of interacting submicrometer magnetic dots are used to perform logic operations and propagate information at room temperature. The logic states are signaled by the magnetization direction of the single-domain magnetic dots; the dots couple to their nearest neighbors through magnetostatic interactions. Magnetic solitons carry information through the networks, and an applied oscillating magnetic field feeds energy into the system and serves as a clock. These networks offer a several thousandfold increase in integration density and a hundredfold reduction in power dissipation over current microelectronic technology."
https://openalex.org/W1993357810,"The structure of RuO(2)(110) and the mechanism for catalytic carbon monoxide oxidation on this surface were studied by low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and density-functional calculations. The RuO(2)(110) surface exposes bridging oxygen atoms and ruthenium atoms not capped by oxygen. The latter act as coordinatively unsaturated sites-a hypothesis introduced long ago to account for the catalytic activity of oxide surfaces-onto which carbon monoxide can chemisorb and from where it can react with neighboring lattice-oxygen to carbon dioxide. Under steady-state conditions, the consumed lattice-oxygen is continuously restored by oxygen uptake from the gas phase. The results provide atomic-scale verification of a general mechanism originally proposed by Mars and van Krevelen in 1954 and are likely to be of general relevance for the mechanism of catalytic reactions at oxide surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2077324189,"A bulk nanocrystalline (nc) pure copper with high purity and high density was synthesized by electrodeposition. An extreme extensibility (elongation exceeds 5000%) without a strain hardening effect was observed when the nc copper specimen was rolled at room temperature. Microstructure analysis suggests that the superplastic extensibility of the nc copper originates from a deformation mechanism dominated by grain boundary activities rather than lattice dislocation, which is also supported by tensile creep studies at room temperature. This behavior demonstrates new possibilities for scientific and technological advancements with nc materials."

https://openalex.org/W2066880840,"The motion of individual cesium atoms trapped inside an optical resonator is revealed with the atom-cavity microscope (ACM). A single atom moving within the resonator generates large variations in the transmission of a weak probe laser, which are recorded in real time. An inversion algorithm then allows individual atom trajectories to be reconstructed from the record of cavity transmission and reveals single atoms bound in orbit by the mechanical forces associated with single photons. In these initial experiments, the ACM yields 2-micrometer spatial resolution in a 10-microsecond time interval. Over the duration of the observation, the sensitivity is near the standard quantum limit for sensing the motion of a cesium atom."

https://openalex.org/W2169171285,"A shaped, magnetic ceramic was obtained from a metal-containing polymer network, which was synthesized by thermal polymerization of a metal-containing organosilicon monomer. Pyrolysis of a cylinder, shape, or film of the metal-containing polymer precursor produced a low-density magnetic ceramic replica in high yield. The magnetic properties of the shaped ceramic could be tuned between a superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic state by controlling the pyrolysis conditions, with the particular state dependent on the size of iron nanoclusters homogeneously dispersed throughout the carbosilane-graphitic–silicon nitride matrix. These results indicate that cross-linked metal-containing polymers may be useful precursors to ceramic monoliths with tailorable magnetic properties."

https://openalex.org/W1486346849,"Sequence comparisons suggest that all living green plants belong to one of two major phyla: Streptophyta (land plants and their closest green algal relatives, the charophytes); and Chlorophyta (the rest of green algae). Because no green algae are known that pre-date the Streptophyta/Chlorophyta split, and also because the earliest diverging green algae show considerable morphological variation, the nature of the unicellular flagellate ancestor of the two green plant phyla is unknown. Here we report that the flagellate Mesostigma viride belongs to the earliest diverging green plant lineage discovered to date. We have sequenced the entire chloroplast DNA (118,360 base pairs) of this green alga and have conducted phylogenetic analyses of sequences derived from this genome. Mesostigma represents a lineage that emerged before the divergence of the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta, a position that is supported by several features of its chloroplast DNA. The structure and gene organization of this genome indicate that chloroplast DNA architecture has been extremely well conserved in the line leading to land plants."
https://openalex.org/W1901112539,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme in human skeletal muscle1 can be encoded by either of two variants of the ACE gene2, one of which carries an insertion of 287 base pairs. This longer allele gives rise to lower enzyme activity2, and is associated with enhanced endurance performance3 and an anabolic response to intense exercise training4. Here we examine training-related changes in the mechanical efficiency of human skeletal muscle (energy used per unit power output) and find that the presence of this ACE allele confers an enhanced mechanical efficiency in trained muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1637519760,"The population of Mauritius kestrels is thought to have recovered from a single wild breeding pair in 19741, when its prospects were considered to be hopeless, to over 200 pairs today2. Here we evaluate the loss of genetic variation that resulted from this bottleneck by typing 12 microsatellite DNA loci in museum skins up to 170 years old and from modern kestrels. We find that ancestral variation was remarkably high and comparable to continental kestrel species. This shows that the unexpected resilience of the population could not have been due either to benefits contributed by an undetected remnant population or to reduction of the inbreeding genetic load by a history of small population size3."
https://openalex.org/W2018099403,"Thrombin-mediated changes in endothelial cell adherens junctions modulate vascular permeability. We demonstrate that the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 co-precipitates with VE-cadherin complexes in confluent, quiescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Ligand-binding blots using a SHP2-glutathione<i>S</i>-transferase fusion peptide established that SHP2 associates selectively with β-catenin in VE-cadherin complexes. Thrombin treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells promotes SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation and dissociation from VE-cadherin complexes. The loss of SHP2 from the cadherin complexes correlates with a dramatic increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin, γ-catenin, and p120-catenin complexed with VE-cadherin. We propose that thrombin regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin-associated β-catenin, γ-catenin, and p120-catenin by modulating the quantity of SHP2 associated with VE-cadherin complexes. Such changes in adherens junction complex composition likely underlie thrombin-elicited alterations in endothelial monolayer permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1675918302,"The brain is generally considered immunoprivileged, although increasing examples of immunological responses to brain antigens, neuronal expression of major histocompatibility class I genes, and neurological autoimmunity have been recognized. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) vaccine generated autoantibodies that targeted a specific brain protein, the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. After peroral administration of the AAV vaccine, transgene expression persisted for at least 5 months and was associated with a robust humoral response in the absence of a significant cell-mediated response. This single-dose vaccine was associated with strong anti-epileptic and neuroprotective activity in rats for both a kainate-induced seizure model and also a middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model at 1 to 5 months following vaccination. Thus, a vaccination strategy targeting brain proteins is feasible and may have therapeutic potential for neurological disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1964415576,"Previous studies observed that there is about 100 ng/ml soluble endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) in human plasma and that the levels increase in inflammatory diseases. In this study we examine the potential mechanisms involved in release of EPCR from cells. We find that EPCR is released from the surface of endothelium and transfected 293 cells by a metalloprotease in a constitutive fashion. The mass of soluble EPCR is 4 kDa less than intact EPCR. Release is blocked by either the hydroxamic acid based inhibitor, KD-IX-73-4 or by 1,10-phenanthroline, but not by matrix metalloprotease inhibitors. Release is stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, thrombin, interleukin-1β, and hydrogen peroxide. Stimulation with these agents reduces EPCR expression levels sufficiently to decrease the rate of protein C activation to a limited extent. The influence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on both EPCR release and inhibition of protein C activation are enhanced by microtubule disruption with nocodazole. EPCR release is augmented by transfection of EPCR expressing 293 cells with caveolin, suggesting that release is caveolae dependent. These studies indicate that metalloproteolytic release of EPCR is a highly regulated process that is sensitive to both coagulation factors and inflammatory mediators.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR)1was identified (2.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Bangalore N. Drohan W.N. Orthner C.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), cloned (2.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and shown to facilitate protein C activation by the thrombin thrombomodulin complex (4.Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). EPCR is a type 1 transmembrane protein capable of binding protein C and activated protein C with comparable affinities (2.Fukudome K. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26486-26491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein C interaction with EPCR stimulates protein C activation by increasing the affinity of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex for protein C (4.Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mollica J.S. Ferrell G.L. Esmon C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5.Fukudome K. Ye X. Tsuneyoshi N. Tokunaga O. Sugawara K. Mizokami H. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Reconstitution studies of EPCR and thrombomodulin into phosphatidylcholine vesicles indicate that the extent of enhancement of protein C activation does not saturate with respect to EPCR concentration even at EPCR to thrombomodulin ratios of 14:1 (6.Xu J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6704-6710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the efficiency of the protein C activation complex would appear to be determined by EPCR surface density and hence subject to control by agents that modulate surface expression or possibly subcellular localization. Physiologically, these observations may be important in the differential control of coagulation in large vessels versus the microcirculation. Specifically, EPCR is expressed at its highest levels on endothelial cells of large vessels and at trace levels in most capillary beds, whereas thrombomodulin is expressed at comparable levels throughout most of the vasculature (5.Fukudome K. Ye X. Tsuneyoshi N. Tokunaga O. Sugawara K. Mizokami H. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7.Laszik Z. Mitro A. Taylor Jr., F.B. Ferrell G. Esmon C.T. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3633-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In addition to expression on the cell surface, unexpectedly high levels of plasma EPCR (≈100 ng/ml plasma) were detected recently (8.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Patients with lupus erythematosus or sepsis were found to have increased levels of plasma EPCR and thrombomodulin (9.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Carson C.W. D'Angelo A. Della Valle P. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 725-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The magnitude of the increases in these two endothelial cell receptors did not correlate, possibly reflecting differences in vascular distribution or mechanisms of release. Release of thrombomodulin from the endothelium is known to be mediated by neutrophil elastase (10.Takano S. Kimura S. Ohdama S. Aoki N. Blood. 1990; 76: 2024-2029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the mechanisms underlying the release of EPCR were not identified (9.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Carson C.W. D'Angelo A. Della Valle P. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 725-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of the plasma EPCR revealed that it has a mass similar to intact EPCR as assessed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and that it retains its affinity for protein C and activated protein C (8.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Many cellular receptors, such as l-selectin (6.Xu J. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6704-6710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and biological response modifiers, such as tumor necrosis factor α (11.Moss M.L. Jin C.S.L.

Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), are released from cells by metalloproteases. The matrix metalloproteases in general play the different role of degrading the cell matrix. Receptor release is often accelerated by phorbol esters and other agonists including thrombin (13.Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Inhibitors have been developed with considerable specificity toward different members of the metalloprotease family (12.Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Corretti D.P. Alderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarna K. Kronhelm S.R. Petersen M. Gerhart M. Kozlosky C.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Many of these are hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors. In some cases, the release of the receptor or cell surface protein is facilitated by interacting with caveolae (14.Ikezu T. Trapp B.D. Song K.S. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10485-10495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the present study, we undertook to identify the mechanisms underlying the release of EPCR. We find that release of soluble EPCR is mediated by a metalloprotease and its activity is inducible by inflammatory mediators and thrombin. Human protein C and activated protein C (15.Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B.F. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), human thrombin (16.Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

When used for immunoprecipitation or protein isolation, the antibodies were coupled to the affinity resins at 5 mg of mAb/ml of resin. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated vendors: Spectrozyme PCa, American Diagnostica Inc.; IODO-GEN, Pierce;125Iodine, streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and the enhanced chemiluminescence system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), Calbiochem; Lubrol PX, Triton X-100, hydrogen peroxide, and Nocodazole, Sigma; Affi-Gel 10, Bio-Rad; PD 10 and protein G columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; PVDF membrane, Millipore; recombinant human interleukin-1β, Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), EA.hy926 and E7 cells were maintained as described previously (17.Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). HUVEC were used between passages 2 and 4. EA.hy926 cells are a transformed human endothelial cell line that was generously provided by Dr. Cora-Jean Edgell (18.Edgell C.-J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IODO-GEN was used to radiolabel mAbs according to the manufacturer's protocol. 125I-labeled protein was separated from free 125I by gel filtration on a PD-10 column. E7 cells were detached from a cell factory (6320 cm2) with 2 liters of 0.526 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffer saline and centrifuged at 3500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were extracted at 4 °C for 15 min with 120 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.02% NaN3, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The sample was clarified further by passage through a 0.45-mm filter. The filtrate was applied to the anti-EPCR mAb 1496 Affi-Gel 10 column (8 ml) at 0.667 ml/min. The column was washed sequentially with 16 ml of TBS containing 0.1% Lubrol PX, 32 ml of 2 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Lubrol PX, and 32 ml of TBS, 15 mm OG at 1 ml/min. EPCR was eluted with 32 ml of 50% ethylene glycol, 5 mm MES, pH 6.0, 15 mm OG at 0.333 ml/min. The protein containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against TBS containing 15 mm OG. Conditioned medium (8 liters) from this factory was concentrated, centrifuged to remove particles, brought to 0.1% Lubrol PX, and applied to an anti-EPCR 1496 mAb Affi-Gel 10 column. Further purification steps were as described above except that 15 mm OG was omitted. The purified EPCR from E7 cells and culture medium were sent to the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight facility at the University of Oklahoma Health Science Center for molecular weight determination. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was modified from Kurosawa et al. (8.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and used standard techniques. The coating antibody was mAb 1494 and the second antibody was biotinylated mAb 1500. The standard curve was linear (r = 0.999) from 0 to 100 ng/ml. Confluent EA.hy926 cells in a 100-mm dish were washed with Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS) containing 3 mm Ca2+ and 0.6 mmMg2+, and biotinylated with 0.75 mg of sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffer saline for 10 min at room temperature, washed with HBSS containing 3 mm Ca2+ and 0.6 mm Mg2+, and fresh culture medium. The biotinylated cells were cultured with fresh culture medium in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm PMA for the indicated time. The conditioned medium and cells lysed with 1% Triton X-100, 0.25m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.02% NaN3, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3 to 3.5 h with anti-EPCR mAb 1496 Affi-Gel 10. The immunoprecipitates were washed and eluted by boiling for 2 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 50% ethylene glycol, 5 mmMES, pH 6.0, 0.1% Lubrol PX. The eluates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and the blot was developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system. HUVEC in 24-well plates were washed two times with HBSS and preincubated for 5 min with HBSS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 3 mm calcium, and 0.6 mm magnesium, and 0.1 μm anti-EPCR mAb (1494) (when present) before addition of 0.1 μm protein C. The activation reactions were initiated by addition of 10 nm human thrombin in a total volume of 0.2 ml. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 40 μl of antithrombin (1.66 mg/ml) to the reactions. The supernatants were transferred into the 96-well microplate and amidolytic activities of activated protein C were determined toward 0.2 mmSpectrozyme PCa substrate in 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mmHEPES-HCl, pH 7.5. The rates of substrate cleavage were measured with aV max microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The concentration of enzyme in the reaction mixtures was determined by comparison to a standard curve of amidolytic activity versusenzyme concentration constructed with freshly prepared, fully activated protein C. Under the conditions employed in this study, less than 10% of the protein C was activated during the assay and all assays were linear as a function of time between the initiation and termination of the assay. All determinations were performed in duplicate. Confluent HUVEC in 12-well plates were washed with M199 medium and incubated with the indicated amount of125I-labeled anti-EPCR (1500) in M199 at room temperature for 15 min, the cells were washed rapidly 4 times with M199, and then cultured in the absence or presence of various stimuli for 1 h. KD-IX-73-4 or 1,10-phenanthroline was added 5 min before the stimulus if applicable. The cells were washed with cold HBSS twice and the medium combined with the wash solution was measured for125I. The anti-EPCR mAb on the cell surface was eluted 3 times from the cells with ice-cold acid buffer (0.15 mNaCl, 20 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5). The cells were lysed with 1 m NaOH. Both acid buffer and cell lysate were measured for 125I. Nonspecific binding of the mAb was less than 5%, and cold acid buffer eluted more than 95% of the bound mAb from the cells at 4 °C. Total RNA was isolated from MDCK cells using the S.N.A.P. total RNA Isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reacation was performed using the SUPERSCRIPT Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA for canine caveolin-1 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: caveolin P1, 5′-ACTCCGCTCGAGATGTCTGGGGGCAAATACGTA-3′; caveolin P2, 5′-ACACGCGGATCCTTATGTTTCTTTCTGCATGTT-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with XhoI and BamHI, and inserted into pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The canine caveolin-1 cDNA sequence was confirmed and found to be identical to that reported previously (19.Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). 293 cells stably transfected with EPCR cDNA plasmid were seeded into 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well. After incubation for 16 h, the cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA-caveolin or pcDNA3.1 vector only using 1 μg of DNA plasmid and 9 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). 24 h post-transfection, the cell surface was biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin at 0.5 mg/ml for 10 min at room temperature. The biotinylated cells were then cultured with fresh culture medium in the presence of 0.1 μm PMA for the indicated times. The conditioned medium was collected and the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.5% deoxycholate). The conditioned medium was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and brought up to 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove cell debris. Both conditioned medium and cell lysates were then incubated with UltraLink Immobilized NeutrAvidin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 2–3 h. The precipitates were washed 3 times with wash buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% SDS, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.25% deoxycholate) and then eluted by boiling for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer. The eluates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted with anti-EPCR mAb 1513, followed by goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Previous studies demonstrated that human plasma contains about 100 ng/ml soluble EPCR that is selectively processed to yield a form fully capable of binding protein C/activated protein C (8.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Hidari N. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The levels of circulating EPCR can rise severalfold in sepsis and in lupus erythematosus (9.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Carson C.W. D'Angelo A. Della Valle P. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 725-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanisms of the release were not determined. Initially we examined the conditioned medium from HUVEC, the EA.hy924 endothelial cell line and 293 cells stably transfected with wild type EPCR for the presence of soluble EPCR. To our surprise, more soluble than cellular EPCR was present in the medium of HUVEC and EA.hy926 cells than was present in the cell layers (Fig.1). Soluble EPCR was also abundant in the conditioned medium of the 293 cells expressing wild-type EPCR. The soluble receptor migrated on SDS-PAGE with a mobility quite similar to that of the intact EPCR. To determine if the release was proteolytic, we isolated the soluble and membrane-associated EPCR from the EPCR expressing 293 cells and analyzed both forms by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The mass of the soluble form was about 4000 daltons lower than the membrane form suggesting that the soluble form may be a proteolytic derivative of the native molecule (Fig.2). PMA is a potent protein kinase C activator that can increase proteolytic shedding of membrane proteins by metalloproteases (11.Moss M.L. Jin C.S.L. Milla M.E. Burkhart W. Carter H.L. Chen W.-J.

Cell. 1998; 92: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether metalloproteases might be involved in the apparent shedding of the receptor, we examined its influence on the rate of release of EPCR. The cell surface EPCR on EA.hy926 cells was biotinylated and the time course of release was measured in the absence (Fig. 3 A) and presence (Fig.3 B) of PMA. PMA increased the rate of soluble EPCR release from the EA.hy926 endothelial cell line. To test the nature of the protease responsible for shedding EPCR from the cell surface, we tested the influence of metalloproteinase inhibitors on this process. KD-IX-73-4, a hydroxamic-based inhibitor capable of blocking metalloproteolytic release ofl-selectin (21.Feehan C. Darlak K. Kahn J. Walcheck B. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7019-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), blocked EPCR release from the surface of cells stimulated with PMA for 1 h (TableI). The general metalloprotease inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline, at a concentration of 5 mm, diminished EPCR release, but did not block it completely. In contrast, the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, TIMP-1 (5 μg/ml) and the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor, GM6001 (100 nm), failed to inhibit the release (data not shown). Since the experiments shown in Fig. 3 indicate that little EPCR is released from unstimulated cells in this time frame, we interpret antibody release from the control cells to reflect antibody dissociation from EPCR rather than EPCR release. This conclusion is supported by the observation that KD-IX-73-4-treated cells and control cells released the same amount of antibody.Table IKD-IX-73–4 and 1,10-phenanthroline attenuate EPCR release stimulated by PMATreatmentmAb in mediumInduced release% total boundControl14.60+PMA29.915.3+KD + PMA12.3−2.3+Phenanthroline + PMA23.79.1HUVEC were incubated with 13 nm125I-labeled anti-EPCR mAb 1500 for 15 min and then washed to remove unbound label.

The deviation was not more than 10% of the average value and usually less than 5%. The results presented in all tables are representative of at least two separate experiments done in duplicate. Potential physiological agonists of EPCR were examined next. Since previous studies had indicated that sepsis and lupus erythematosus elevated plasma levels of EPCR (9.Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Carson C.W. D'Angelo A. Della Valle P. Esmon C.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 725-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested known endothelial cell agonists that would likely be elevated under these conditions. Thrombin and interleukin-1β both stimulated EPCR release (TableII). The combination of thrombin and interleukin-1β-stimulated EPCR release more effectively than either alone. The stimulation of release by these agents was completely blocked by KD-IX-73-4.Table IIThrombin and interleukin-1β stimulate EPCR release from HUVECTreatmentmAb in mediumInduced release% total boundControl13.30+Thr15.32.0+IL-1β21.78.4+Thr + IL-1β25.812.5+KD + Thr + IL-1β13.50.2HUVEC were preincubated for 15 min with 30 nm125I-labeled anti-EPCR mAb 1500 and then washed to remove the unbound antibody. The cells were treated with thrombin (Thr) (20 nm), IL-1β (100 units/ml); or a combination of both agonists at 37 °C for 1 h. The hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor KD-IX-73–4 (KD) (25 μg/ml) was included in some wells. Examination by SDS-PAGE of the cell-associated antibody and antibody in the cell supernatant did not reveal antibody degradation under any of these conditions. Open table in a new tab HUVEC were preincubated for 15 min with 30 nm125I-labeled anti-EPCR mAb 1500 and then washed to remove the unbound antibody.

Examination by SDS-PAGE of the cell-associated antibody and antibody in the cell supernatant did not reveal antibody degradation under any of these conditions. Since EPCR promotes protein C activation on the surface of the endothelium, we examined the possibility that the above agents would lead to impairment of protein C activation. To control for potential effects of the agents on thrombomodulin expression or function, we also examined protein C activation rates in the presence of the anti-EPCR mAb 1494 that blocks protein C binding to EPCR. PMA had a small, but consistent, inhibitory effect in the 1-h incubation employed in these experiments and no effect on activation of protein C in the presence of anti-EPCR mAb 1494 (Fig. 4). Nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule assembly, had little effect on protein C activation by itself (compare the second and third bar in Fig. 4), but, in combination with PMA, had a considerably greater inhibitory effect on protein C activation than was observed with PMA alone (Fig. 4, compare the sixth and seventh bar). The PMA and nocodazole inhibition of protein C activation was eliminated with the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor KD-IX-73-4 (Fig. 4, eighth bar). In contrast, nocodazole had little influence on protein C activation over cells treated with interleukin 1β (Fig. 4, tenth and eleventh). Since nocodazole enhanced inhibition of protein C activation, especially in the presence of PMA, we wished to determine if it increased shedding also. Nocodazole increased EPCR shedding in cells treated with PMA (Table III). This effect was blocked by KD-IX-73-4. This correlates with the relatively large effect of nocodazole on protein C activation and the ability of KD-IX-73-4 to block the nocodazole-PMA dependent inhibition of protein C activation. In contrast, nocodazole had little effect on shedding in response to thrombin (Table III) which is consistent with the lack of an effect of nocadazole on protein C activation. Nocodazole had a similar small effect on shedding of EPCR in the presence of thrombin and interleukin-1β (data not shown).Table IIIThe influence of thrombin, PMA, and nocadazole on EPCR shedding from HUVECTreatmentmAb in mediumInduced releasemAb on surfaceInduced changemAb internalizedInduced change% total bound% total bound% total boundControl15.0067.3017.70+PMA25.610.666.7−0.77.8−9.9+PMA + Noc48.833.837.6−29.713.7−4.0+KD + PMA + Noc16.31.362.6−4.721.13.4+Thr18.13.164.5−2.817.5−0.2+Thr + Noc20.95.954.4−12.924.77.0+KD + Thr + Noc15.60.656.5−10.828.010.3+Thr + PMA34.920.058.4−8.96.8−10.9+KD + Thr + PMA14.90.176.08.79.1−8.6+Thr + PMA + Noc54.139.134.6−32.711.4−6.3+KD + Thr + PMA + Noc16.31.365.5−1.88.30.6HUVEC were preincubated for 15 min with 30 nm125I-labeled anti-EPCR mAb 1500 and then washed to remove the unbound antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2119214100,"Apoptosis is a physiological program for the deletion of cells in which caspases govern events leading to safe clearance by phagocytes. However, a growing weight of evidence now suggests that not all forms of programmed cell death are caspase-dependent. We now report a complete and constitutive but caspase-independent program for the specific phagocytic clearance of intact effete platelets, anucleated blood cells of critical importance in health and disease. Platelets aged in vitro not only exhibited increased expression of proapoptotic Bak and Bax but also evidenced constitutive diminution of function such as decreased aggregation to ADP, which was accelerated by culture in the absence of plasma. This abrogation of cell function in plasma-deprived platelets was associated with morphological and biochemical features similar to those of granulocyte apoptosis, that is, cytoplasmic condensation, plasma membrane changes including exposure of phosphatidylserine and the granule protein P-selectin, and recognition by phagocyte scavenger receptors. However, and in contrast with constitutive death of other inflammatory blood cells by apoptosis, these events were not affected by caspase inhibitors, nor was there evidence of caspase-3 activation either by hydrolysis of analog peptide substrates or Western blot analysis, serving to emphasize that neither programmed cell death nor clearance by phagocytes need involve caspases."

Two major conformational epitope regions have been identified on the noncollagenous domain of type IV collagen (NC1 domain) of the α3(IV) chain as residues 17–31 (EA) and 127–141 (EB) (Netzer, K.-O. et al. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 11267–11274). To determine whether these regions are two distinct epitopes or form a single epitope, three GP sera were fractionated by affinity chromatography on immobilized NC1 chimeras containing the EA and/or the EB region. Four subpopulations of GP antibodies with distinct epitope specificity for the α3(IV)NC1 domain were thus separated and characterized. They were designated GPA, GPB, GPAB, and GPX, to reflect their reactivity with EA only, EB only, both regions, and neither, respectively. Hence, regions EA and EB encompass critical amino acids that constitute three distinct epitopes for GPA, GPB, and GPAB antibodies, respectively, whereas the epitope for GPX antibodies is located in a different unknown region. The GPA antibodies were consistently immunodominant, accounting for 60–65% of the total immunoreactivity to α3(IV)NC1; thus, they probably play a major role in pathogenesis. Regions EA and EB are held in close proximity because they jointly form the epitope for Mab3, a monoclonal antibody that competes for binding with GP autoantibodies. All GP epitopes are sequestered in the hexamer configuration of the NC1 domain found in tissues and are inaccessible for antibody binding unless dissociation of the hexamer occurs, suggesting a possible mechanism for etiology of GP disease.

The disease is produced by autoantibodies to type IV collagen, the major component of basement membranes. Binding of autoantibodies to glomerular and/or alveolar basement membranes causes rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage, respectively (1.Wilson C. Dixon F. Berner B. Rector F. The Kidney. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986: 800-889Google Scholar). The basement membrane autoantigen has been identified as the α3(IV) chain (2.Butkowski R.J. Langeveld J.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GP autoepitope(s) has been mapped to the noncollagenous domain (NC1), composed of 232 amino acids at the C terminus of the α3(IV) chain. A strategy based on chimeric proteins has been recently used by several groups to localize the immunodominant GP epitope(s) (6.Ryan J.J. Mason P.J. Pusey C.D. Turner N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 113: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7.Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J.

In this approach, α3(IV) sequences have been substituted at the corresponding positions into the homologous but nonimmunoreactive α1(IV)NC1 domain. The use of α1(IV) as inert scaffolding is required to preserve the three-dimensional structure of conformational GP epitopes. By swapping relatively large portions between α1(IV)NC1 and α3(IV)NC1 domains (thirds of the molecule), one study has found that GP immunoreactivity maps exclusively to the N-terminal 54 amino acids of α3(IV)NC1 (6.Ryan J.J. Mason P.J. Pusey C.D. Turner N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 113: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas another (7.Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) has reported that both the N-terminal 85 amino acids and the central portion of α3(IV)NC1 domain (amino acids 86–175) react with GP autoantibodies. We have further narrowed down the location of the conformational GP epitopes of α3(IV)NC1 to two short amino acid sequences: residues 17–31, designatedEA , and 127–141, designatedEB (8.Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11267-11274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whether EA and EB sequences form two distinct conformational epitopes or belong to a single epitope is unknown. Moreover, an intriguing homology that exists between the EA and EB regions (7 identical residues out of 15 and similar location in the two homologous half-domains of NC1) raises an additional possibility, that autoantibodies to one epitope could cross-react with the other epitope. A detailed characterization of the GP epitopes is important for understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease and may facilitate the design of specific therapeutic approaches aimed at removing or neutralizing the pathogenic antibodies. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether theEA and EB regions are two distinct epitopes or form a single epitope. Three GP sera were fractionated by affinity chromatography on immobilized NC1 chimeras containing the EA and/or theEB region. Four subpopulations of GP antibodies with specificity for distinct epitopes within the α3(IV)NC1 domain were thus separated and characterized, proving thatEA and EB regions constitute separate GP epitopes. These two regions, held in close proximity in the folded α3(IV)NC1 domain, contain certain amino acid residues critical for GP autoantibody binding that are sequestered in the hexamer configuration of the NC1 domain found in tissues. This cryptic property is likely important for the etiology of the disease. Recombinant human α1–3(IV)NC1 domains and α1/α3 chimeras containing a N-terminal FLAG sequence were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and purified as described (8.Netzer K.O. Leinonen A.

Glomerular basement membrane (GBM) was obtained from human kidneys not suitable for transplantation (generously provided by Midwest Organ Bank, Kansas City, KS) and digested with collagenase to prepare human NC1 hexamers (10.Wieslander J.

IgG was purified from these GP sera by affinity chromatography on protein A-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's protocol. ChimerasC2 (containing the EA region; residues 17–31 of α3(IV)NC1 domain), C6 (containing theEB region; residues 127–141 of α3(IV)NC1 domain), and C2·6 (containing bothEA and EB regions), as well as control recombinant human α3(IV)NC1, were immobilized to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad) at a concentration of about 1 mg/ml gel. The IgG fraction of GP sera (∼2.5–5 mg) was applied to each of these affinity columns (containing approximately 0.5 ml of affinity gel). The columns were sequentially washed with 10 volumes (∼5 ml) of Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.5, and high salt buffer (1m sodium chloride in TBS). The bound IgG was sequentially eluted with increasing concentrations (four column volumes each of 1.5, 3, and 6 m solutions) of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5; no additional GP reactivity was detected in fractions eluted under more stringent conditions, such as 8 m GdmCl or 6 m GdmCl at pH 3.0. GdmCl was removed from the eluted IgG fractions by repeated dilution with TBS followed by concentration in Centricon-10 tubes (Millipore). All IgG fractions were concentrated to the same volume (∼1 ml) for subsequent analysis by ELISA. Bovine serum albumin was added (∼1 mg/ml) as carrier protein to the diluted IgG fractions to prevent loss by adsorption. The procedure was repeated for all three GP sera. An alternative purification scheme was used for quantitation of autoantibody subpopulations and involved sequential passage of GP sera through columns containing immobilized α1(IV)NC1 domain,C6, C2, and α3(IV)NC1 domain; the bound autoantibodies were eluted with 6 m GdmCl and processed as above. The reactivity of the purified fractions against α3(IV)NC1 domain (100 ng/well) was assayed by ELISA and the concentration of GP antibodies in each fraction was read from a standard curve made using serial dilutions of GP IgG. Monoclonal antibodies to NC1 domains of type IV collagen (Mab1 (to α1(IV)NC1; also known as Mab6), Mab3 (to α3(IV)NC1; also known as Mab17) (11.Johansson C. Butkowski R. Wieslander J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1991; 25: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and Mab5 (to α5(IV)NC1)) were purchased from Wieslab AB (Lund, Sweden). The monoclonal antibody M3/1, raised against an N-terminal synthetic peptide of human α3(IV)NC1 domain, and monoclonal antibodies 175, 178, and 189, raised against randomly folded recombinant human α3(IV)NC1 domain expressed in Escherichia coli, were previously described (12.Penades J.R.

For immunoblotting, the proteins (200 ng/lane of recombinant NC1 domains and chimeras, and 1 μg/lane of NC1 hexamers) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the remaining binding sites were blocked with casein, the membranes were incubated with appropriately diluted GP antibody fractions or monoclonal antibodies and then with alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibodies to human or mouse IgG, and the blots were developed with nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Direct and inhibition ELISA were performed as described (8.Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

The antigens (50–100 ng of chimeras or NC1 domains for direct ELISA, 50 ng of recombinant human α3(IV)NC1 domain for inhibition ELISA) were coated onto plastic plates overnight, at room temperature, in 100 μl of carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in binding buffer (TBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween-20). Alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibodies to mouse IgG and human IgG (Sigma) were chosen so that they exhibited no cross-reactivity toward IgG from the other species. The substrate used was 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenol phosphate in 1 mdiethanolamine, pH 9.8, containing 0.5 mm zinc chloride, and color development was monitored at 410 nm with a Dynatech MR4000 plate reader. The results shown were the average of duplicate determinations that differed by less than 10%. A competition assay between GP autoantibodies and monoclonal antibodies (13.Hellmark T. Johansson C. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was performed with modifications. Wells coated with α3(IV)NC1 domain (50 ng/well) were preincubated for 30 min with saturating concentrations of monoclonal antibodies Mab3, 175, and M3/1 (1/10–1/25 dilution of cell culture supernatants, as determined by titration); then, GP autoantibodies were added for 1 h, and the amount of human IgG bound was measured using anti-human IgG that did not cross-react with mouse IgG. The results were normalized relative to the binding of GP antibodies in the absence of monoclonal antibody competitor, which was assigned a value of 100%. Alternatively, the overlap of the epitopes was assessed in a two-antibody sandwich assay (14.Harlow E. Lane D. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 579-583Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies purified on protein A-agarose in the presence of high salt (15.Harlow E. Lane D. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 311Google Scholar) were immobilized overnight onto plastic plates (500 ng in 50 μl of binding buffer). After blocking the nonspecific binding sites with bovine serum albumin, the plates were incubated with antigen (250 ng α3(IV)NC1 domain in 50 μl of binding buffer) for 1 h, washed three times, and then incubated with affinity-purified GP autoantibodies for 1 h. Binding of the second antibody layer was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugate goat antibodies to human IgG. To correct for differences in the titers of GP antibody fractions, their reactivity toward α3(IV)NC1 domain captured by the monoclonal was normalized to their reactivity to α3(IV)NC1 domain coated directly onto plates by passive adsorption (50 ng/well). To study the sequestration of the GP epitopes within NC1 hexamers isolated from human GBM, an ELISA previously used for bovine hexamers (16.Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9062-9068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used with the following modifications. Native or dissociated GBM hexamers (300 ng/well) were covalently coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated plates (Costar) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The native hexamers were dissociated by heating with 6 m GdmCl at 60 °C for 30–60 min or at 90 °C for 15 min and coupled to the plates in the presence of 3m GdmCl to prevent reassociation. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in parallel with native and dissociated (as above) NC1 hexamers from human GBM (2 μg), to which equal amounts of antibodies were added in 0.5 ml of TBS, pH 7.5. The following antibodies were used: GP-IgG from two patients, affinity-purified on the α3(IV)NC1 column; posttransplantation Alport alloantibodies eluted from a kidney biopsy, previously shown to bind α3(IV)NC1 (17.Hudson B.G. Kalluri R. Gunwar S. Weber M. Ballester F. Hudson J.K. Noelken M.E. Sarras M. Richardson W.R. Saus J. et al.Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 179-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); and the monoclonal antibody Mab3. To minimize reassociation of dissociated NC1 hexamer subunits (monomers and dimers), the hexamers in 6 m GdmCl were diluted directly (20–30-fold) in the antibody solution, as described previously (18.Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30–60 min at room temperature, and then the immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose by gentle rocking for several hours at 4 °C, dissolved in sample buffer (15 min at 90 °C), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to α3(IV)NC1 (Mab3) and α5(IV)NC1 (Mab5). Previous epitope mapping of GP autoantigen using a panel of α1/α3 chimeric NC1 domains has demonstrated that GP sera bind only chimerasC2 (containing the EA region of α3(IV)NC1) and C6 (containing theEB region), as well as the composite chimeraC2·6 (8.Netzer K.O. Leinonen A. Boutaud A. Borza D.B. Todd P. Gunwar S. Langeveld J.P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11267-11274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine whether EA and EB make up a single or two distinct epitopes, GP sera were fractionated by affinity chromatography using the chimeras and α3(IV)NC1 domain as the matrix. Elution of bound autoantibodies was performed stepwise, with increasing concentrations of GdmCl, to separate IgG fractions with different affinities for the solid phase. The specificity of each fraction was determined by ELISA (Fig. 1). The C2-Affi-Gel column retained the antibodies reacting with the EA region of the α3(IV)NC1 domain. This column bound between half and two-thirds of the total reactivity against the α3(IV)NC1 domain in the three sera analyzed (Fig. 1,a–c). The specificity of the C2-bound autoantibodies fell into two distinct patterns. Those eluted at the 3–6 m concentration of GdmCl were specific for theEA epitope, reacting only with the C2chimera, and were therefore designatedGPA . 2In the nomenclature of the affinity-purified autoantibody fractions, the subscript was chosen to designate their reactivity toward the EA andEB regions. In contrast, the antibodies eluted at 1.5 m GdmCl showed additional reactivity to the C6 chimera and were therefore designated GPAB . A detailed examination of the properties of affinity-purified antibody fractions (see Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4below) further confirmed that GPA andGPAB populations are distinct.Figure 2Epitope specificity of GP autoantibody subpopulations. The reactivity of affinity-purified autoantibody subpopulations GPA (a),GPB (b), GPAB (c), and GPX (d) toward α1/α3 chimeric NC1 domains C1–C7 was assessed by ELISA (left panel, 100 ng of protein/well). The chimeras contained the following α3(IV)NC1 residues: 1–6 (C1), 17–31 (C2), 197–208 (C3), 218–232 (C4), 90–104 (C5), 127–141 (C6), and 1–14 plus four Gly-X-Ytriplets (C7). Chimeras showing reactivity in ELISA (C2, C6, and C2·6) were further analyzed by Western blotting (right panel, 200 ng of protein/lane). Recombinant α1(IV)NC1 and α3(IV)NC1 domains were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. NC1 hexamers isolated from human GBM were also used as positive control in Western blot (1 μg/lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The analysis of the fractions not bound to theC2-Affi-Gel revealed the presence of two additional populations of GP autoantibodies with distinct epitope specificity. In two of the three sera analyzed (GP-1 and GP-3), the nonbound fraction reacted with the C6 chimera but not with the C2chimera. Thus, these antibodies recognized specifically theEB region and were designatedGPB . The nonbound fraction of the third serum (GP-2) did not react with either C2 or C6chimeras but only with the α3(IV)NC1 domain and was therefore designated GPX . In contrast to the C2 column, much less autoantibody (5–20% of the total reactivity against α3(IV)NC1) bound to theC6 column. The C6 column retained the antibodies reacting with the EB region of the α3(IV)NC1 domain, i.e. the GPB andGPAB populations described above. The elution profiles for all three sera were similar; one example is shown in Fig.1 d. All eluted fractions reacted with both C2 andC6 chimeras, indicating the overlap of theGPB and GPAB fractions. The autoantibody fraction not bound to the C6column contained the GPA antibody subpopulation, which accounted for most reactivity with the C2 chimera (75–90%). The C2·6 column retained antibodies to bothEA and EB regions,i.e. the GPA ,GPB , and GPAB populations. In general, antibodies to EA bound to this column more strongly than those to EB and required higher concentration of GdmCl for elution (an example is shown in Fig. 1 e). In all three sera, about 25–35% of GP autoantibodies passed through the C2·6 column unbound; this fraction consisted of GPX autoantibodies. Affinity columns containing immobilized α3(IV)NC1 and α1(IV)NC1 domains were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Most GP autoantibodies (90–95%) bound to the α3(IV)NC1-Affi-Gel, as shown in Fig. 1 f. As with the C2·6 column, autoantibodies reacting with C2 chimera required higher concentrations of GdmCl for elution and thus appeared to bind the α3(IV)NC1 domain stronger than those reacting with C6chimera. Only one serum (GP-3) contained antibodies that reacted with α1(IV)NC1. These antibodies were isolated on a column of immobilized α1(IV)NC1 domain, analyzed by direct and inhibition ELISA, and found to be very similar (if not identical) to theGPAB fraction of the same serum. The four populations of GP autoantibodies isolated by affinity chromatography were further characterized for specificity, abundance, and relative affinity for autoantigen (see Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4).GPA autoantibodies were the major population in all three GP sera, accounting for 61, 60, and 66% of the reactivity to α3(IV)NC1. They were purified from the C2 column, after elution of GPAB antibodies with 1.5m GdmCl. Alternatively, they were isolated in larger amounts by a two-step procedure: GP IgG was first passed through aC6-Affi-Gel column to remove GPAB andGPB fractions and then applied to aC2-Affi-Gel column, which retains GPA but not GPX autoantibodies. TheGPA fraction was specific for C2chimera and exhibited no cross-reactivity for other chimeras (Fig.2 a). In inhibition ELISA,C2 chimera was the only potent inhibitor of theGPA subpopulation, besides the positive control α3(IV)NC1 (Fig. 3 a). GPB autoantibodies were found in two out of the three sera analyzed, GP-1 and GP-3, and accounted for 10 and 6% of the reactivity to α3(IV)NC1. They were isolated from the C6column after previous passage of GP IgG through the C2column to remove GPA andGPAB fractions. In Western blots and direct ELISA, GPB autoantibodies were specific forC6 chimera and exhibited no cross-reactivity withC2 or other chimeras (Fig. 2 b). In inhibition ELISA, this fraction was inhibited only by the positive control, α3(IV)NC1 domain, and weakly by the C6 chimera (Fig.3 b). That C6 is about 50-fold weaker inhibitor of than α3(IV)NC1 may indicate that C6 does not encompass the full epitope for GPB antibodies. Moreover, thatGPB antibodies react well with C6immobilized on a solid phase (in direct ELISA and Western blot) suggests that these antibodies have sufficiently high avidity forC6 (due to multivalent binding) despite lower affinity. GPAB autoantibodies were separated from the C2 column by elution with 1.5 m GdmCl. They were present in all three sera but in relatively small amounts: 10, 6, and 12%. In Western blots and direct ELISA, this subpopulation reacted with bothC2 and C6 chimeras, and to a smaller extent with α1(IV)NC1 and the other chimeras (Fig. 2 c). In inhibition ELISA, the GPAB population showed preference either for the EA epitope, as in GP-2 serum, or for the EB epitope, as in GP-3 serum (Fig.3 c), as indicated by the difference (more than 10-fold) in the inhibitory potency of C2 and C6 chimeras, respectively. GPX autoantibodies constituted the second most abundant fraction in all sera analyzed, accounting for 20, 35, and 17% of the reactivity to α3(IV)NC1. They bound neither C2,C6, nor any other α1/α3 chimeras (Fig. 2 d) and were only inhibited by α3(IV)NC1 (Fig. 3 d). Based solely on these data, it could not be ascertained whether theGPX antibodies represented a homogeneous subpopulation or a mixture. The relative affinity of the autoantibody populations for α3(IV)NC1 was measured by inhibition ELISA (Fig.4), and their affinity was expressed as IC50, the concentration of soluble α3(IV)NC1 required to inhibit antibody binding to immobilized α3(IV)NC1 by 50%.GPA antibodies had IC50 values ranging between 0.015 and 0.3 μg/ml (0.6–12 nm). Due to relatively large amounts of antibodies required in this assay, the less abundant fractions GPB andGPAB were assayed together, as eluted from theC6 column in the 3 m GdmCl fraction. Their IC50 values ranged between 0.021 and 0.107 μg/ml (0.84–4.28 nm). GPX autoantibodies consistently had the lowest affinity for α3(IV)NC1 (range, 0.675–9.03 μg/ml, or 27–360 nm), at least 15-fold lower that other fractions from the same serum. Thus, the relative affinities of GPA and GPB antibodies were similar, and both were much higher than those ofGPX autoantibodies. The distinction, proximity, and accessibility of the multiple epitopes that bind the GP autoantibody populations were also investigated using five different monoclonal antibodies that were against the α3(IV)NC1 domain. First, the epitopes for the monoclonal antibodies were determined by ELISA (Fig. 5, top panel) and Western blot (not shown), using α1/α3 chimeras. Monoclonal antibody M3/1 reacted exclusively with C7, the chimera containing the 14 N-terminal amino acids of α3(IV)NC1 domain that were used as a synthetic peptide to prepare the antibody (12.Penades J.R. Bernal D. Revert F. Johansson C. Fresquet V.J. Cervera J. Wieslander J. Quinones S. Saus J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 175, 178, and 189 reacted with only C5 chimera, indicating that their epitope is encompassed by residues 90–104 of the α3(IV)NC1 domain. Monoclonal antibody Mab3 reacted exclusively with chimera C2·6, but not with chimeras C2 orC6. Hence, regions EA andEB together, encompassing residues 17–31 and 127–141 (see above), form the epitope for Mab3. That Mab3 recognizedEA and EB regions jointly demonstrated the close proximity of these noncontiguous sites within α3(IV)NC1. Moreover, these results demonstrate that among the five monoclonal antibodies, Mab3 binds to the same region asGPA , GPB , andGPAB antibodies. Like GP antibodies, Mab3 also recognizes a conformational epitope, because its reactivity was completely abolished by the reduction of disulfide bonds of α3(IV)NC1 domain or C2·6 chimera (data not shown). In contrast, the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies 175, 178, 189, and M3/1 are linear because their reactivity with α3(IV)NC1 domain was relatively unaffected by reduction. The location of the epitopes of monoclonal antibodies and their relationship with the GP epitopes in regions EA and EB are shown in Fig. 5, bottom panel. The finding that EA andEB regions together encompass the epitope for Mab3 provided an independent strategy to determine the location of GP epitopes relative to those of Mab3 and other monoclonal antibodies to α3(IV)NC1 by competition experiments. Mab3 produced the highest inhibition of all GP subpopulations (50.7 ± 6.1%), compared with other monoclonal antibodies in competition ELISA (Fig.6, top panel). This must be caused by the close proximity and/or the overlap between the epitope of Mab3 and those for GPA ,GPB , and GPAB antibodies. Moreover, GPX antibodies were also inhibited significantly by Mab3, suggesting that their epitope must be in relatively close to the EA andEB regions. Although inhibition produced by the control monoclonal antibodies 175 (20 ± 4.8%) and M3/1 (33.7 ± 3.9%) was always lower than that produced with Mab3, it could not be ascertained whether this was due to proximity of the epitopes or mere steric hindrance. To distinguish between these possibilities, a two-antibody sandwich assay (14.Harlow E. Lane D. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 579-583Google Scholar) was performed. The α3(IV)NC1 antigen was first bound to a layer of immobilized monoclonal antibody, and then its ability to further react with GP antibodies—and thus form an antibody-antigen-antibody “sandwich”—was measured by ELISA. As found by direct competition, GP antibodies could not bind α3(IV)NC1 simultaneously with Mab3, indicating that their epitopes are identical or in close proximity. Nevertheless, GP antibodies bound to α3(IV)NC1 captured by Mabs 175, 178, 189, and M3/1, indicating that the epitopes of these monoclonal antibodies were relatively far away from the GP epitopes. To better understand how GP autoantibodies bind to GBM in vivo, the pathogenic event that leads to glomerulonephritis, we next studied the reactivity of purified GP antibodies with the autoantigen in the native hexameric form. In basement membranes, α3(IV)NC1 domain occurs as a hexameric complex, which represents the end-to-end connection between two triple helical collagen molecules. Our previous studies of isolated NC1 hexamers of bovine origin revealed that the GP epitopes are sequestered and do not bind antibodies, unless the hexamer is dissociated into subunits by 6 m GdmCl or low pH (18.Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, this cryptic property was also demonstrated for human GBM hexamers (19.Weber M. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Kohler H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 74: 289-294PubMed Google Scholar). However, identification of several subpopulations of GP antibodies raised the possibility that they may differ in their reactivity to native human GBM, not all being cryptic. Here, we investigated the relative accessibility of individual GP epitopes in the human NC1 hexamer complex by ELISA, as described previously (16.Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9062-9068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and by immunoprecipitation. Sequestration of GP epitopes within the hexamers was manifested in ELISA as a significant increase (3–4-fold) in the reactivity of GP sera with human GBM hexamers after dissociation (Fig.7, top panel), which contrasted with a decrease in the reactivity of control antibodies Mab3 and Alport alloantibodies (see below). GP autoantibody populations were individually assayed and found to react better with dissociated NC1 hexamers (Fig. 7, bottom panel), the relative reactivity of dissociated GBM hexamers ranging between 225 and 850% (on average, 398 ± 181%). Therefore, all GP epitopes are cryptic. The increased reactivity must have been caused by hexamer dissociation and not by denaturation of its subunits, because the treatment with GdmCl of α3(IV)NC1 monomers only produced a slight decrease (to 86 ± 10%) in their reactivity with GP antibodies. Moreover, treatment with GdmCl of native hexamers in the presence of reducing agents (such as dithiothreitol) strongly diminished their reactivity with GP antibodies (data not shown), consistent with the conformational nature of GP epitopes. Unlike GP antibodies, several control antibodies bound less to dissociated human GBM hexamers (20–50% of the reactivity of native hexamers), thus ruling out the possibility that hexamer reactivity was increased nonspecifically by the treatment with GdmCl (e.g.due to increased coating efficiency). These controls were antibodies of which the epitopes are known to be accessible in bovine GBM hexamers. Among these, posttransplantation Alport alloantibodies were used because they bind to the same α3·α4·α5 network of type IV collagen network as GP antibodies (20.Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8767-8775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and also produce anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. Mab3 and Mab1 are also known to react with intact NC1 hexamers, having been used to isolate hexamers containing α3(IV)NC1 and α1(IV)NC1, respectively, by affinity chromatography (21.Johansson C. Butkowski R. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24533-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Kahsai T.Z. Enders G.C. Gunwar S. Brunmark C. Wieslander J. Kalluri R. Zhou J. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17023-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Mab3 epitope was readily accessible in the NC1 hexamer, in contrast with the GP epitopes, although both are located in the EA and EB regions, comprising 15 amino acids each. To address the nature of the small but measurable reactivity of native GBM hexamers in ELISA, the interaction between GBM hexamers and GP antibodies was further studied by immunoprecipitation. Because in this assay, binding occurred in solution, possible artifacts caused by immobilization of hexamers to the ELISA plates were excluded. GP antibodies from two different patients (affinity-purified on α3(IV)NC1) and control antibodies (Mab3 and Alport alloantibodies) were allowed to interact with both native and dissociated GBM hexamers under native-like conditions, and then the immune complexes were precipitated with protein G and analyzed by Western blot (Fig.8) for the presence of α3(IV)NC1 (top panel)—precipitated directly by antibodies—and α5(IV)NC1 (bottom panel)—co-precipitated only when associated with the α3(IV)NC1 domain. Whole GP IgG was used because much larger amounts of antibody were required in this assay compared with ELISA, and all GP populations were shown to be cryptic. When incubated with native hexamers, GP antibodies precipitated only α3(IV) monomers, but no α3(IV) dimers, although both were present in the original GBM hexamers (cf. Fig. 8, right lane). However, α3(IV)NC1 dimers were precipitated by GP antibodies from dissociated GBM hexamers (along with an increased amount α3(IV)NC1), showing that the inertness of dimers is not an intrinsic property but must be caused by sequestration of their GP epitopes within the hexamer configuration. Unlike GP antibodies, monoclonal antibody Mab3 and Alport alloantibodies precipitated both α3(IV)NC1 monomers and dimers without requiring prior dissociation of GBM hexamers. The control antibodies also co-precipitated the α5(IV)NC1 domain in both monomer and dimer forms, demonstrating binding to whole NC1 hexamers and thus the accessibility of their epitopes. In contrast, even though α3(IV)NC1 monomers were precipitated by GP antibodies from native GBM hexamers, they were not accompanied by α5(IV) monomers, indicating that GP antibodies bind only to dissociated α3(IV) monomers, but not to intact hexamers. Therefore, GP epitopes on the monomers are also cryptic and sequestered within the NC1 hexamers. Because these monomers were not present in the GBM hexamer preparation (as established by analytical gel-filtration), they must have been extracted from the native hexamer during the incubation with GP antibodies—either passively, due to a dynamic equilibrium between hexamer and its subunits, or actively, by the effect of antibodies on the hexamers. Overall, immunoprecipitation demonstrated that GP antibodies did not bind to intact GBM hexamers, although they reacted with α3(IV)NC1 monomers that were dislodged from the hexamer under nondenaturing conditions and with α3(IV)NC1 dimers after hexamer dissociation in vitro. Overall, our results demonstrate that GP autoantibodies are heterogeneous, consisting of a mixture of populations that recognize multiple epitopes on α3(IV)NC1 domain. Four distinct subpopulations, designated GPA ,GPB , GPAB , andGPX , were isolated by affinity chromatography using NC1 chimeras and characterized in this work.GPA and GPB antibodies were specific for the EA (residues 17–31) andEB (residues 127–141) regions of α3(IV)NC1, respectively. Hence, regions EA andEB encompass critical amino acid residues that constitute two distinct epitopes. GPAB subpopulation recognized both EA andEB regions individually, but not as a single entity. The cross-reactivity of GPAB antibodies suggests that their epitopes include amino acids conserved between the homologous EA and EB regions and therefore are distinct from the epitopes of the specificGPA and GPB subpopulations. GPX antibodies did not recognize either the EA or EB region, indicating the existence of one or more additional epitopes at a different location. Although EA andEB encompassed distinct epitopes for GP antibodies, they were both required for binding of Mab3 monoclonal antibody. That EA or EB together form a single epitope for Mab3 established the close proximity of these two regions in the native structure of the α3(IV)NC1 domain. Of several monoclonal antibodies recognizing different α3(IV)NC1 epitopes, only Mab3 competed effectively with GP autoantibodies, providing an independent confirmation that their epitopes map to the same regions."

Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Rodent FcεRI is a tetrameric receptor consisting of an α chain, β chain, and a dimer of disulfide-linked γ chains, whereas human FcεRI exists both as trimeric (αγ2) and tetrameric (αβγ2) structures (4.Kinet J.-P.

The α chain binds IgE, the γ chains are essential for signal transduction, and the β chain acts as an amplifier of signaling (26.Lin S. Cicala C. Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 985-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Rodent FcεRI is strictly expressed on mast cells, basophils, and non-B, non-T cells, whereas the expression of human FcεRI also includes dendritic cells, eosinophils, Langerhans cells, platelets, and monocytes (4.Kinet J.-P.

FcεRI plays a critical role in allergic reactions because it is the major surface receptor through which MCs direct immunologically specific secretory effects, such as the release of preformed cytoplasmic granule-associated mediators and the generation and release of lipid mediators and cytokines (32.Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar). PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), PtdIns-4-phosphate, or PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate at the 3′-position of the inositol ring to generate PtdIns-3-phosphate, PtdIns-3,4-bisphosphate, and PtdIns-3,4,5-trisphosphate, respectively (33.Rameh L.E.

Sci. 1997; 22: 17209-17215Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (829) Google Scholar). In response to a variety of signals, PI3Ks are involved in the regulation of many cellular functions ranging from cytoskeletal reorganization, secretion, vesicular sorting, cell migration, protein synthesis, and cell survival (33.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 34.Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem.

PtdIns-3,4-bisphosphate and PtdIns-3,4,5-trisphosphate interact directly with the pleckstrin homology domains of intracellular proteins such as Btk, the serine/threonine kinase Akt, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, and phospholipase C-γ, thereby targeting these molecules to the plasma membrane and facilitating their activation for downstream signaling (35.Salim K.

Nine members of the PI3K family have been isolated from mammalian cells, and they are grouped into three classes (33.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 42.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Heterodimeric, class IA PI3Ks consist of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110α, β, or δ) and a regulatory subunit (p85α, p85β, or p55γ) combined in an apparently nonpreferential manner (42.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The gene encoding p85α produces two additional isoforms, p55α and p50α, by alternate splicing or promoter usage (43.Fruman D.A. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Genomics. 1996; 37: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The regulatory subunits possess no enzymatic activity but are composed of several domains capable of interacting with other signaling proteins. The Src homology-2 domains of p85 bind selectively to phosphotyrosyl residues within a p-Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met sequence motif, where Xaa is any amino acid (44.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides containing tandemp-Tyr-Met-Xaa-Met motifs bind to p85 proteins with high affinity and increase the catalytic activity of the associated p110 subunits 2- to 3-fold (45.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Chanudhuri M. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. Shoelson S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9478-9483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, p85 proteins regulate the activities and subcellular locations of class IA PI3Ks. The signaling pathways initiated by the stimulation of mast cells through the Kit tyrosine kinase and FcεRI, which lacks intrinsic kinase activity, include kinase activation, receptor phosphorylation and association with various intracellular signaling molecules, and activation of PI3Ks, but these events occur in a different manner for Kit and FcεRI. The dimerization of Kit by KL causes receptor autophosphorylation (46.Besmer P. Garland J. Quesenberry P. Colony Stimulating Factors. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 369-403Google Scholar) leading to the direct binding of one or more of the p85 subunits of the class IA PI3Ks to Tyr-719 (47.Serve H. Hsu Y.-C. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6026-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,48.Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and PI3K activation (49.Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elimination of the PI3K-binding site by substitution of Tyr-719 with phenylalanine reduces the rate of Kit-mediated proliferation (48.Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and abolishes Kit-mediated potentiation of FcεRI-induced secretion in mast cells (50.Vosseller K. Stella G. Yee N.S. Besmer P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because FcεRI does not have intrinsic kinase activity, signaling by aggregated FcεRI depends on the Src family kinase Lyn, which is associated with the β-chain, to phosphorylate tyrosines on the β and γ chains within a sequence known as the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (51.Jouvin M.H. Numerof R.P. Kinet J.-P. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosines target Syk to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated by Lyn, resulting in Syk activation (52.Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,53.Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Activated Syk then phosphorylates a number of substrates and ultimately, PI3K is activated (54.Yano H. Agatsuma T. Nakanishi S. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 55.Barker S.A. Caldwell K.K. Hall A. Martinez M. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. Wilson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1145-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The exact nature of the interactions of PI3K within the FcεRI signaling cascade is unclear. Nonetheless, PI3K activity is required for maximal FcεRI-induced calcium influx, degranulation, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activation, and cytokine production as assessed with pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K such as wortmannin and LY294002 (56.Huber M. Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Liu L. Humphries R.K. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11330-11335Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 57.Ishizuka T. Chayama K. Takeda K. Hamelmann E. Terada N. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2087-2094PubMed Google Scholar). However, these broad spectrum PI3K inhibitors inhibit all three classes of PI3Ks. Therefore, it is not known whether Kit or FcεRI use the same or different class(es) of PI3K. To address this issue, we have compared Kit- and FcεRI-induced activation events in mast cells derived from p85α wild-type (+/+)versus homozygous-deficient (−/−) fetal livers. The results demonstrate that p85α gene products are not required for FcεRI-mediated mast cell exocytosis and phosphorylation of Akt but are essential for maximal Kit-mediated exocytosis, proliferation, and Akt phosphorylation. Our findings represent the first demonstration that Kit and FcεRI utilize distinct members of the PI3K family. Mouse recombinant KL and IL-3 were expressed by the infection of Sf9 insect cells with recombinant baculovirus (58.Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Urade Y. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol.

Fetal livers from 15.5-day-old embryos resulting from the mating of p85α +/− mice (129/Sv × C57BL/6) were dispersed mechanically. The genotypes of the fetuses were determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis as described previously (59.Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Fetal liver cells were cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum) containing 50% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium. Nonadherent cells were passed weekly. Bone marrow cells from the femurs of CBA/J and CBA/CaHN-xid/J mice (Jackson Labs) were cultured identically. To measure FcεRI expression, IgG-Fc receptors were first blocked by incubating cells with rat mAb 2.G2 for 15 min, followed by incubation for 50 min on ice with or without mouse mAb IgE anti-DNP. The cells were washed and stained with FITC rat anti-mouse IgE for 25 min on ice. Kit expression was measured by incubating the cells with FITC rat mAb 2B8 anti-mouse Kit or with the isotype-matched negative control, FITC rat IgG2b, for 30 min on ice. Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSort with logarithmic fluorescence amplification. For KL-mediated activation, cells were incubated at 1 × 107 cells/ml in medium alone or containing the indicated concentrations of KL. For IgE-induced activation, cells were sensitized at 1 × 107 cells/ml in medium alone or containing the indicated concentrations of rat mAb IgE anti-DNP for 1 h on ice. The cells were washed by centrifugation, and pellets were resuspended on ice in their original volume in medium with 25 μg/ml MAR. With both agonists, the reactions were stopped by centrifugation after incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. The supernatants were saved, and the pellets were resuspended in their original volume with medium and lysed by three cycles of freezing in an alcohol/dry ice bath and thawing at 37 °C. For the β-hexaminidase assay, aliquots (10 μl) of supernatants and cell lysates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 80 μl of substrate solution (1.3 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl-β-d-2-acetamido-2-deoxyglucopyranoside in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 4.5). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 0.2 m glycine (pH 10.7) and OD was read at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. Cells were washed and incubated at 37 °C at 1 × 106/ml in medium alone or containing the indicated concentrations of KL or IL-3, with or without 10 μmLY294002 (Calbiochem). After 1, 2, and 3 days, cells were stained with trypan blue and counted with a hemacytometer. For measurement of DNA synthesis, cells were starved for 2 h in medium, and 5 × 104 cells were seeded in 100 μl in triplicate in 96-well plates and maintained in medium alone or with the indicated concentrations of cytokines, with or without LY2942002. After 24 h, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine (2 Ci/mmol) was added to each well. After an additional 12 h, cells were harvested onto a filter, and the filter-bound radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. For cell cycle analysis, 1 × 106 cells were washed once and resuspended in 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA. Cells were fixed by slowly adding 1 ml of 100% ethanol while vortexing and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mmEDTA containing 40 μg/ml RNase A (Ambion), and incubated 30 min at room temperature. Propidium iodide (Sigma) (0.5 ml of a 100 μg/ml solution in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA) was added, and the cells were incubated at 4 °C until samples were analyzed for cell cycle and apoptosis by FACS using Modfit software. Detection of apoptosis by FITC-Annexin V staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen). Cells were starved for 20 h in medium, then incubated at 1 × 107 cells/ml in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution containing 1 mm each of CaCl2 and MgCl2 (CM buffer) for 30 min on ice, and stimulated with KL (1/100) or IgE (5 μg/ml) + MAR (25 μg/ml) in CM buffer as described above. The cells were lysed at 5 × 107 cells/ml with 1% Nonidet P-40 extraction buffer (60.Lu-Kuo J.M. Joyal D.M. Austen K.F. Katz H.R. J. Biol.

For Western blotting, 20 μl of lysate (1 × 106 cell equivalents) was mixed with 10 μl of 3× sample buffer containing 15% β-mercaptoethanol and loaded on precast Tris-glycine gels (Novex). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by electroblotting. For p85 and p110 immunoblotting, 100 μg of protein was loaded on 6 or 7% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight. Membranes were then washed three times, incubated at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h, and washed three times. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with chemiluminescence. Cells (1 × 107) were starved, incubated in CM buffer as described for immunoblotting, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-pan-p85 antibody, polyclonal anti-p85β antibody, or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Immune complex kinase assays were performed with a substrate mixture of PtdIns, PtdIns-4-phosphate, and PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate in the presence of phosphatidylserine carrier as described (61.Carpenter C.L.

The lipid products were separated by thin-layer chromatography, and radioactivity in the PtdIns-3,4,5-trisphosphate spot was quantitated with a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Because mice homozygous for disruption of all three isoforms of p85α gene products die perinatally (59.Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C.

After 3–4 weeks, cultures from both genotypes consisted of similar numbers of >99% fetal liver-derived mast cells (FLMC), as determined by metachromatic staining with toluidine blue. In a single experiment, mast cells grew comparably from the bone marrow of a p85α −/− mouse that survived for several weeks, compared with cells grown from the bone marrow of a p85α +/+ littermate. The absence of p85α protein in p85α −/− FLMC was ascertained with a mAb directed specifically to p85α (Fig.1 A). Immunoblot analysis of FLMC, thymocyte, and fibroblast lysates with a pan-p85 Ab that recognizes the p85α, p55α, and p50α splice variants as well as p85β confirmed the loss of p85α and p50α protein in p85α −/− FLMC and thymocytes and revealed that, unlike thymocytes, FLMC did not express p55α detectably (Fig. 1 B). Expression of the p85β gene product, identified by its absence in p85β −/− fibroblasts, appeared to be up-regulated in FLMC lacking p85α, as reported for other cell types (59.Fruman D.A. Snapper S.B. Yballe C.M. Davidson L., Yu, J.Y. Alt F.W. Cantley L.C. Science. 1999; 283: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The expression of the PI3K p55γ gene product was not detected by immunoblotting in FLMC of either genotype (data not shown). Hence, p85α +/+ FLMC expressed p85α, p50α, and p85β of the class IA PI3K adapter subunits. Expression of the class IA PI3K catalytic subunits p110α, p110β, and p110δ was reduced in p85α −/− FLMC (Figs. 1,C–E, respectively), indicating that p85α regulatory subunits are required to stabilize expression of not only p110α (62.Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but all three p110 isoforms. The pan-p85 antibody immunoprecipitated a small amount of PI3K activity in p85α −/− FLMC (2.8 ± 1.3% of the amount from p85α +/+, n = 3; Fig.1 F), whereas the amount of PI3K activity associated with p85β immunoprecipitates in p85α −/− FLMC was 184% of the amount in p85α +/+ FLMC in one experiment (Fig. 1 F), consistent with the changes in immunoreactivity. Hence, p85α gene products and a substantial portion of class IA PI3K activity are not required for the growth and development of mast cells from fetal liver in the presence of IL-3. As assessed by flow cytometry, FLMC of both genotypes expressed comparable levels of Kit and FcεRI (Fig. 2). FLMC derived from p85α +/+ and −/− mice were incubated with several concentrations of KL for 20 min at 37 °C. Separate samples were incubated with rat IgE for 1 h and washed, and then the bound IgE was cross-linked with MAR for 20 min at 37 °C. Stimulation with KL resulted in a dose-dependent release of β-hexosaminidase from FLMC with both genotypes (Fig.3 A). However, there was an approximately 50% reduction in β-hexosaminidase release from p85α −/− cells a"

https://openalex.org/W1557687568,"When a bubble of air rises to the top of a highly viscous liquid, it forms a dome-shaped protuberance on the free surface. Unlike a soap bubble, it bursts so slowly as to collapse under its own weight simultaneously, and folds into a wavy structure. This rippling effect occurs for both elastic and viscous sheets, and a theory for its onset is formulated. The growth of the corrugation is governed by the competition between gravitational and bending (shearing) forces and is exhibited for a range of densities, stiffnesses (viscosities), and sizes—a result that arises less from dynamics than from geometry, suggesting a wide validity. A quantitative expression for the number of ripples is presented, together with experimental results that support the theoretical predictions."

https://openalex.org/W2066955429,"Branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) has been known in mammals to be a key enzyme of the catabolic pathway of branched-chain amino acids. We have isolated two cDNA clones encoding the E1β and E2 subunits of BCKDH, respectively, fromArabidopsis thaliana. Proteins encoded in these cDNA sequences had putative mitochondrial targeting sequences and conserved domains reported for their mammalian counterparts. Northern blot and immunoblot analyses showed that transcripts from the respective genes and E2 protein markedly accumulated in leaves kept in the dark. We found that the activity of BCKDH in the leaf extracts also increased when plants were placed in the dark. Addition of sucrose to detached leaves inhibited the accumulation of transcripts, whereas application of a photosynthesis inhibitor strongly induced the expression of these genes even under light illumination. These observations indicate that the cellular sugar level is likely responsible for the dark-induced expression of these genes. The transcript levels of these genes were also high in senescing leaves, in which photosynthetic activity is low and free amino acids from degraded protein are likely to serve as an alternative energy source.

The E1 subunit is further composed of two E1α and two E1β subunits. This enzyme complex also contains two specific regulatory enzymes, a kinase and a phosphatase (1.Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). E1 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain α-keto acids, which are derived from branched-chain amino acids by transamination. E2 catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from the lipoyl moiety to coenzyme A. E3 is a flavoprotein and reoxidizes the reduced lipoyl sulfur residues of the E2 subunit (2.Reed L.J. Pettit F.M. Yeaman S.J. Teague W.M. Bleile D.M. Mildner P. Ries B. Enzyme Regulation and Mechanism of Action. 60. Pergamon Press, New York1980: 47-56Crossref Google Scholar). BCKDH in mammals is thought to be a key enzyme in the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids, i.e. valine, leucine, and isoleucine. As end products, leucine is converted to acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate, valine to succinyl-CoA, and isoleucine to succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA (3.Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1239-1277Google Scholar). Through this pathway, these amino acids serve as substrates for energy production via acetoacetate and succinyl-CoA. It has been firmly established that nutritional conditions play an important role in modulating the activity of BCKDH through a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism (4.Reed L.J. Damuni Z. Merryfield M.L. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1985; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). From this point of view, BCKDH is critically important in the pathway for energy utilization, rather than being merely a system for the catabolism of a small group of amino acids. BCKDH has been extensively studied in mammals because defects in the genes for this enzyme cause maple syrup urine disease, an inborn disorder of metabolism in humans (3.Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1239-1277Google Scholar). In the plant kingdom, however, we have come across only one case reporting the detection of the activity of this enzyme in mung bean (Vigna radiata L.) (5.Gerbling H. Gerhardt B. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Gerbling H Bot. Acta. 1993; 106: 380-387Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Plants employ complicated mechanisms to adapt themselves to various environmental conditions. As the energy source for photosynthesis, light is a vital environmental factor for the plant. Unfavorable light conditions such as prolonged darkness and shading lead to a significant decrease in the photosynthetic activity of leaves, and the carbohydrate reserves are quickly depleted (7.Kerr P.S. Rufty Jr T.W. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 1985; 78: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.Stitt M. Wirtz W. Gerhardt R. Heldt H.W. Spencer C. Walker D. Foyer C. Planta (Heidelb.). 1985; 166: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The metabolic consequences of carbohydrate starvation have been studied in a number of plant species (9.Saglio P.H. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 516-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Journet E.P. Bligny R. Douce R. J. Biol.

Alban C. Bligny R. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After a long duration of starvation, many cellular constituents are degraded and used as an energy source for survival. This process has not been fully interpreted, however, in terms of molecular events. We have identified genes that are strongly expressed in leaves when they are placed in the dark. As an initial part of our efforts, the din1 gene was isolated from cotyledons of dark-treated radish (Raphanus sativus L.) (14.Azumi Y. Watanabe A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15.Shimada Y. Wu G. Watanabe A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). So far, we have isolated more than one dozen cDNA clones for genes that are strongly expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves in the dark, using differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Two of these cDNA clones had sequence similarities to the genes for the E1β and E2 subunits of BCKDH, respectively (16.Fujiki Y. Sato T. Yoshikawa Y. Ito M. Watanabe A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114, (suppl.): S-95Google Scholar). Isolation of these cDNAs has not only provided the first structural information on these proteins in plants, but has also given information on the expression of the corresponding genes that would suggest the physiological role of the enzyme during carbohydrate starvation. Plants (A. thaliana L. ecotype Columbia) were grown at 23 °C under continuous light illumination (60 μmol/m2/s) and supplied with Arabidopsisinorganic medium (17.Somerville C.R. Orgren W.L. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1982: 129-138Google Scholar). For dark treatment, young plants grown for 3 weeks were exposed to complete darkness for various time periods. Sugars and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) were supplied to detached leaves as described by Mita et al. (18.Mita S. Suzuki-Fujii K. Nakamura K. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The leaves were incubated in the dark for 48 h with 3% sucrose or mannitol. The leaves were also floated on water containing 10 μm DCMU with or without 3% sucrose for 48 h under continuous light illumination. For sampling of plant organs and naturally senescing leaves, plants were grown under a 16-h light and 8-h dark photoperiod. Samples were harvested from plants at the end of the light period. Leaves from ∼60-day-old plants were divided into four groups according to the extent of yellowing of leaves. Stage M represents fully expanded mature leaves and stages S1, S2, and S3 represent leaves with ∼25, 50 and 75% of the leaf area visually estimated to have yellowed, respectively. Plants grown for 3 weeks under continuous light illumination were exposed to darkness or kept under light illumination for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from the leaves according to the method of Schmidt et al. (19.Schmidt G.W. Bartlett S.G. Grossman A.R. Cashmore A.R. Chua N. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was separated from total RNA using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of the poly(A)+ RNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed as described by Yoshida et al. (20.Yoshida K.T. Naito S. Takeda G. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 1003-1009PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction was performed with 2 ng of the first-strand cDNA and 10 μm 10-mer primer (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA). After 40 amplification cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 35 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min, the amplified cDNAs were loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel. Bands specific for dark-treated plants were identified after ethidium bromide staining. cDNA fragments were recovered from the gel and subcloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The expression of the genes corresponding to these fragments was examined by Northern hybridization with the respective fragments as probes. Poly(A)+ RNA from leaves exposed to darkness for 24 h was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using a TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cDNA products were inserted into the λ- ZAPII vector (Stratagene). Phage plaques were blotted on nylon membranes (Biodine A, Pall Bio Support, East Hills, NY) by the standard plaque lift method (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled cDNA probes were prepared by a Megaprime labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C overnight according to Sambrook et al. (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The positive clones were converted to plasmid clones by in vivo excision according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52865) Google Scholar) using an automated DNA sequencer (Model ABI 373A, Applied Biosystems Japan, Tokyo). DNA sequences were analyzed by the computer program GENETYX (Software Development, Tokyo). Sequence homology was searched for using the BLAST Network Service of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Genomic DNA was isolated fromArabidopsis leaves as described previously (23.Murray M.G. Thompson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4321-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (9579) Google Scholar). Digested DNA was resolved on 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane as described above. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C overnight. The membranes were washed as described above. RNA was separated by 2% formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nylon membranes (Biodine A) by capillary flow of 20× SSC solution (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNA inserts were 32P-labeled as described above. Hybridization was performed at 42° C overnight in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The distribution of radioactivity on the membrane was analyzed with a BAS2000 imaging analyzer (Fuji Photofilm, Tokyo). The full-length insert of the din3 clone was fused in frame with the pGEMEX-2 expression vector (Promega). The resulting plasmid was introduced intoEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Bacterial expression was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The expressed protein accumulated in inclusion bodies, was purified as described by Harlow and Lane (24.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-137Google Scholar), and was then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). After the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, the major band with the expected mobility was excised from the gel and used for the generation of antisera in rabbits. Leaf extracts were prepared by grinding the frozen tissue in an extraction buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm ascorbic acid, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Soluble proteins were denatured in an equal volume of 2× SDS buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). The separated polypeptides were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.25% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) for 2 h. The membrane was then incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of the primary antibodies against the E2 protein for 1 h. After washing with blocking solution, the blots were incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA), which was diluted 1:4000. The color reaction was performed by incubation of the membrane in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.6, 100 mmNaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.05 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and 1% dimethylformamide. Extraction and assay of BCKDH were performed according to Goodwin et al. (27.Goodwin G.W. Zhang B. Paxton R. Harris R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as descried below. Leaves were disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer in an extraction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mmKCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was saved, and its volume was measured. 0.25 volume of 45% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 was added to the supernatant to give a final polyethylene glycol concentration of 9%. After stirring on ice for 30 min, the extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was saved. The pellet was resuspended in the extraction buffer with a Potter-Elvehjem-type homogenizer and desalted with PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activity of BCKDH was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm. The assay mixture contained 175 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm NAD+, 0.6 mm CoASH, 0.4 mm thiamin pyrophosphate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm NaCN, and the extract (0.4–0.6 mg of protein in 600 μl of reaction solution). The reaction was initiated with 0.1 mm α-keto-β-methylvalerate, and the blank rate determined in the absence of substrate was subtracted. The assay was performed at 23° C, and 1 unit of enzymatic activity is expressed as micromoles of NADH formed per min/g of tissue (fresh weight). In an attempt to isolate cDNAs corresponding to genes that are activated in leaf cells in the dark, we were able to identify dozens of cDNA fragments by a simplified differential display procedure. Dark-specific expression of the genes was confirmed by Northern hybridization with the respective cDNA fragments as probes (data not shown). We found that two of these cDNA fragments,din3 and din4, encoded proteins with striking amino acid sequence similarities to the E2 and E1β subunits of mammalian BCKDH, respectively. As there has been no information on plant BCKDH genes, we isolated full-length cDNA clones from a cDNA library prepared from Arabidopsis leaves that were placed in the dark for 24 h. The din3 cDNA clone contains a 1449-base pair (bp) open reading frame encoding a protein of 483 amino acid residues (Fig.1) with a predicted molecular mass of 53 kDa. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that this cDNA encoded a protein with significant homology and 39% identity to human (28.Danner D.J. Litwer S. Herring W.J Pruckler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7742-7746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine (29.Griffin T.A. Lau K.S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14008-14014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) E2 subunits (Fig. 1). The mammalian E2 subunit is known to contain three functional domains: a lipoate-containing domain, an E1- and E3-binding domain, and a catalytic domain (1.Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 30.Lau K.S. Griffin T.A. Hu C.C. Chuang D.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1971-1981Google Scholar). The lipoate-containing domain is located between residues 105 and 117, and the E1- and E3-binding domain is located between residues 175 and 206 of the human E2 protein (31.Hummel K.B. Litwer S. Bradford A.P. Aitken A. Danner D.J. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6165-6168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain is located in the C-terminal portion of the protein (29.Griffin T.A. Lau K.S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14008-14014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Lau K.S. Griffin T.A. Hu C.C. Chuang D.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1971-1981Google Scholar). There is a very strong homology between the lipoate-containing domain from mammalian proteins and the E2 protein from Arabidopsis (amino acids 111–127), with 71% identity and 88% similarity compared with human E2 (Fig. 1). A lipoyllysine residue in the lipoate-containing domain is highly conserved among mammalian E2 proteins. There is also a lysine residue in the Arabidopsis E2 protein at an identical position (Lys-116) corresponding to the lipoyllysine residues in the mammalian proteins (Fig. 1). The E1- and E3-binding domain is also conserved, with 56% identity and 78% similarity between the human andArabidopsis (residues 185–216) E2 proteins. The C-terminal catalytic domains of mammalian E2 proteins contain a His residue in a conserved sequence, His-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Asp-Gly (32.Fussey S.P.M. Guest J.R. James O.F.W. Bassendine M.F. Yeaman S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 33.Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 44: 417-422Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The putative catalytic domain of the Arabidopsis protein contains a His residue prior to the C terminus (Fig. 1). It has been postulated that His in this position is involved in CoASH bonding for catalyzing the covalent linkage of the thiol ester to the acyl group (32.Fussey S.P.M. Guest J.R. James O.F.W. Bassendine M.F. Yeaman S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The fact that these domains, including the lipoyllysine residue and CoASH-bonding motif, are conserved among species suggests that they have critical functions in the plant protein as well. The cDNA clone for the din4 gene contains a 1074-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 358 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa. This amino acid sequence is highly similar to that of the mammalian BCKDH E1β subunit (Fig.2). The amino acid sequence encoded bydin4 cDNA showed 59 and 58% identities to the human (34.Mitsubuchi H. Nobukuni Y. Endo F. Matsuda I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14686-14699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bovine (35.Nobukuni Y. Mitsubuchi H. Endo F. Asaka J. Oyama R. Titani K. Matsuda I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) amino acid sequences, respectively. We performed Southern blot analysis to estimate the copy number of the genes for the E1β and E2 subunits from Arabidopsis. Genomic DNA was digested with BamHI, HindIII, EcoRI,PstI, or EcoRV. There is one HindIII site in the din4 cDNA, but no other restriction sites in both cDNAs. The din3 cDNA hybridized to only one restriction fragment (Fig. 3). In contrast, the din4 cDNA hybridized to three bands in theHindIII digests and to two bands in the other restriction digests (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we performed Southern blot analysis to examine whether the appearance of three bands in the HindIII digests was due to the presence of a HindIII site in thedin4 cDNA. The din4 cDNA was cut into two fragments at the HindIII site, and each fragment was used as a probe for Southern blot analysis. One fragment hybridized to 700- and 1000-bp bands, and the other hybridized to 1000- and 2500-bp bands (data not shown). Hence, the 700- and 2500-bp bands corresponded to a gene complementary to the din4 cDNA, and the 1000-bp band corresponded to a homologous gene. Luethy et al. (36.Luethy M.H. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 329Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) have isolated another cDNA clone for the E1β gene inArabidopsis. Given this, the Arabidopsis genome seems to contain two copies of the E1β gene and a single copy of the E2 gene. We examined the kinetics of the dark-induced expression of the genes for the E1β and E2 subunits by Northern blot analysis. The expression kinetics of the genes for the E1β and E2 subunits were very similar to each other (Fig. 4,A and B). The transcripts from both genes were barely detectable in leaves grown under continuous light conditions, but they could be detected 3 h after the beginning of the dark treatment and continued to accumulate. At 48 h in the dark, the levels of the transcripts from both of the genes reached a maximum, and then the transcript levels decreased gradually. To examine the accumulation level of the E2 protein in leaves, we used antibodies against the E2 subunit. Fig. 4 C shows that polypeptides with an apparent molecular mass of 52 kDa in leaf extracts were specifically recognized by the antibodies. As shown in Fig.4 C, dark treatment caused the increase in the content of E2 protein. The accumulation of the E2 protein appeared to parallel that of the mRNA. We measured the activity of the active form of BCKDH in leaves that were placed either in the dark or under light illumination for 3 days. The procedure was based on studies in mammalian tissues (27.Goodwin G.W. Zhang B. Paxton R. Harris R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 37.Block K.P. Aftring R.P. Buse M.G. Harper A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but there were several modifications as described below. Since mammalian BCKDH has been known to be freed of endogenous E3 during polyethylene glycol precipitation, E3 has been added to the assay solution (27.Goodwin G.W. Zhang B. Paxton R. Harris R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions; however, the reduction of NAD was not stimulated by 10 units of porcine E3. The possibility of interconversion of the active state during homogenization was checked by investigating the effect of inhibitors of phosphatase (100 mm NaF) and kinase (5 mmα-ketoisocaproate or 1 mm dichloroacetate). Application of these inhibitors with the extraction buffer had little effect on the final activity of the enzyme. The activity of BCKDH from dark-treated leaves was 0.89 ± 0.13 milliunits/g of tissue (mean ± S.D., n = 3), which was comparable to the basal activity reported for the enzyme from rat muscle (0.84 milliunits/g of tissue) (37.Block K.P. Aftring R.P. Buse M.G. Harper A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The activity from light-grown plants was below the detection limit of the assay. When 50 μl of leaf extracts were preincubated with 5 μl of antibodies to E2 for 20 min on ice prior to the assay, the production of NADH was completely inhibited, whereas preimmune serum had no effect (data not shown). These data suggest that the enzymatic activity we have detected involves the catalytic function of the E2 protein, which is encoded by the din3 gene, and that the activity increases in leaves kept in the dark, which parallels the accumulation of its transcripts and proteins. We searched the regulatory signals that are responsible for the dark-induced gene expression of the E1β and E2 subunits. One of the proposed physiological effects of dark treatment is the cessation of photosynthesis in leaves, resulting in the lowering of the sugar level in leaf cells. To address the question of gene activation as a consequence of sugar deprivation, we examined the effect of exogenously supplied sugars and the photosynthesis inhibitor DCMU (Fig.5). Transcripts from the genes for the E1β and E2 subunits accumulated in detached leaves floated on a 10 μm DCMU solution for 2 days, even under light illumination. In contrast, when leaves were floated on a 3% sucrose solution for 2 days, accumulation of the transcripts was totally suppressed both in darkness and under light illumination in the presence of DCMU. These results suggest that the expression of the genes for the E1β and E2 subunits is modulated by the sugar level in leaf cells. We examined the organ-specific expression of the genes for the E1β and E2 subunits in plants by Northern blot analysis (Fig.6). The transcripts from both genes were less abundant in leaves, cauline leaves, and bolts (stems), which possess photosynthetic activity. The transcripts were more abundant in non-photosynthetic organs such as siliques, flowers, and roots, in which the level of free sugars is considered to be low. In senescing leaves as well as in sugar-starved cells, proteins are massively degraded, and amino acids are used as an energy source. We observed that a gradual loss of cellular protein occurred in senescing leaves (data not shown). We examined the expression of the genes for E1β and E2 in senescing rosette leaves by Northern blot analysis. For simple classification of leaves in terms of the extent of senescence, we visually inspected the yellowing of rosette leaves and divided them into four stages (see “Experimental Procedures”). The transcripts from genes for E1β and E2 were barely detectable in non-senescent green leaves (stage M) (Fig. 7). The transcripts from both genes accumulated slightly at the early stages of leaf senescence (S1 and S2), and the relative levels of transcripts were maximal at the last stage (S3), being ∼20 times higher than in non-senescent green leaves (stage M). These results suggest that the expression of the E1β and E2 genes is strongly associated with the progression of leaf senescence. This report presents the first evidence of the structural similarity of BCKDH from plants to the mammalian counterpart. We further propose the physiological role of BCKDH in plants from the results of examination of the gene expression of the E1β and E2 subunits of BCKDH in Arabidopsis. BCKDH belongs to a 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex family, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (1.Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the BCKDH E1β subunit has low but significant homology to that of the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1β subunit in mammals (35.Nobukuni Y. Mitsubuchi H. Endo F. Asaka J. Oyama R. Titani K. Matsuda I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); the same is true for the BCKDH and pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 subunits (29.Griffin T.A. Lau K.S. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14008"

https://openalex.org/W2052688792,"In order to map the molecular determinants that dictate the subcellular localization of human protein kinase C α (hPKCα), full-length and deletion mutants of hPKCα were tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and transiently expressed in GH3B6 cells. We found that upon thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, hPKCα-GFP was localized exclusively in regions of cell-cell contacts. Surprisingly, PKCα failed to translocate in single cells despite the presence of TRH receptors, as attested by the TRH-induced rise in intracellular calcium concentration in these cells. TRH-stimulated translocation of hPKCα-GFP from the cytoplasm to cell-cell contacts was a biphasic process: a fast (measured in seconds) and transient phase, followed by a slower (approximately 1 hour) and long lasting phase. The latter and the translocation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate absolutely required the N-terminal V1 region. In contrast to the full-length hPKCα, the N-terminal regulatory domain alone or associated with the V3 hinge region was spontaneously and uniformly localized at the plasma membrane of single and apposed cells. However, treatment with the calcium chelator BAPTA/AM induced a differential cytoplasmic/nuclear redistribution of the regulatory domain, depending on its association with V3, which suggests the existence of a mechanism controlling the cytoplasmic sequestration of inactive hPKCα and involving the V3 region. By using other deletion mutants, we were able to map the sequence required for this sequestration to the C2+V3 regions. This work points to the existence of a complex interplay between membrane targeting and cytoplasmic sequestration in the control of the spatiotemporal localization of hPKCα."
