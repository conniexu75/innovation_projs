https://openalex.org/W1542420067,"The administration of polycyclic aromatic compounds such as beta-naphthoflavone or 3-methylcholanthrene is known to cause the induction of many liver microsomal monoxygenase activities and the appearance of a distinct cytochrome called P-448 in genetically responsive, but not in nonresponsive, inbred mouse strains. However, the administration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induces these activities and cytochrome P-448 formation to the same extent in both responsive and nonresponsive inbred strains. In contrast, phenobarbital or pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile induces in both responsive and nonresponsive strains a different profile of enzyme activities and the appearance of cytochrome P-450 (rather than cytochrome P-448). In the present studies, electrophoresis of liver microsomal proteins from inbred C57BL/6N and DBA/2N and recombinant inbred AKXL-38 and AKXL-38A mouse strains revealed the presence of four polypeptides whose relative staining intensity could be correlated with the induction state of the microsomes as determined by enzymatic and spectral methods. Of these four bands, Band 4 (55,000 daltons) was increased whenever spectral measurements revealed an increase in the cytochrome P-448 content due to administration of beta-naphthoflavone or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Administration of pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile caused an increase in Band 3 (54,000 daltons), whereas administration of phenobarbital caused an increase primarily in Band 2 (51,000 daltons) but also smaller increases in Band 1 (49,000 daltons) and Band 4. The changes observed for phenobarbital and pregnenolone-16alpha-carbonitrile were the same for both responsive and nonresponsive strains. The same electrophoretic technique was used to measure the incorporation of radioactive leucine into microsomal proteins. Microsomes were prepared from liver combined from responsive mice (C57BL/6N) treated with beta-naphthoflavone and L-[14C]leucine and nonresponsive mice (DBA/2N) treated with beta-naphthoflavone and L-[3H-4,5]leucine. A significant increase in the 14C/3H ratio was observed for Band 4, and decreases were seen for Bands 1 and 2. In similar experiments with other mice and phenobarbital as the inducing agent with L-[14C]leucine and the vehicle alone with L-[3H-4,5]leucine, the 14C/3H ratio was markedly increased for Band 2, and smaller increases were observed for Bands 1 and 4. These results and other data presented indicate that the increased formation of cytochrome P-448 and P-450 by beta-naphthoflavone and phenobarbital, respectively, is primarily the result of an increased rate of de novo protein synthesis rather than a decreased degradation rate or a conversion of pre-existing polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1919090863,"The trhombin-like activities from the snake venoms of two subspecies of Bothrops atrox, moojeni (type I) and marajoensis (type II), were purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on a support consisting of the inhibitor, p-aminobenzamidine, linked to Sepharose 4B with a spacer of diaminodipropylaminosuccinate. At room temperature the enzyme was not bound to the affinity support but rather was retarded in relation to the unbound protein. As a result the thrombin-like activity eluted in a large volume following the main protein fraction. However, at 4 degrees the enzyme was absorbed to the affinity support and could be eluted specifically with the ligand benzamidine (0.15 M). Optimal conditions for column loading and washing were 0.05 M Tris.HCl/0.4 M NaCl, pH 9.0 at 4 degrees. The type I enzyme isolated in this manner showed a single major band on pH 8.9 disc gel electrophoresis as well as two minor bands. Further purification by isoelectric focusing yielded one major and two minor components. All three protein fractions had identical thrombin-like activities and amino acid composition. The major band had a specific activity of 210 to 230 NIH thrombin units/mg, a S20, w of 2.65 S, a molecular weight of 29,000, and an E1% 280 of 15.6. This protein has a carbohydrate content, measured as hexose, glucosamine, and sialic acid, of 27%. From the amino acid and carbohydrate composition a partial specific volume of 0.700 ml/g was calculated. The type I enzyme, purified on affinity chromatography only, did not activate Factor XIII and was free of thromboplastin-like activity. The type II enzyme behaved very differently from the type I on pH 8.9 polyacrylamide disc gels yielding two major bands and two minor bands. The relative amounts of these four bands were not a function of purity. The type II enzyme had a specific activity of 650 to 700 NIH thrombin units/mg, a S20, w of 2.60, and a molecular weight of 31,400."
https://openalex.org/W1496602812,"(a) The reactivity of substituted acetates as substrates for CoA transferase increases sharply with increasing basicity and exhibits a slope of 1.0 in a plot of either log kappacat or log (kappacat/Km) against pKa (betanuc = 1.0). This result shows that the catalyzed reaction, which involves both carboxylate activation and leaving group transfer, does not proceed through a fully concerted reaction mechanism in the rate-determining step. The result is consistent with a stepwise reaction mechanism that proceeds through an anhydride intermediate. (b) Equilibrium constants for thiol ester formation, either bound to the enzyme or free in solution, show the same dependence on the basicity of carboxylate ions (betaeq = 1.0) and are independent of acidity when expressed in terms of the carboxylic acid. Thus, the polar environment around substituents on the acyl group is the same for carboxylic acids, thiol esters, and oxygen esters. (c) The interaction of the terminal CH3CO group of acetoacetate with the active site causes a 200,000-fold increase in kappacat/Km, corresponding to a decrease in delta G++ OF 7.2 kcal/mol compared with an unsubstituted acid of the same pK. The binding energy of the coenzyme A moiety of the substrate is utilized to interact with the active site and cause a 10(4) to 10(6)-fold increase in kappacat, corresponding to a decrease in delta G++ of 6 to 9 kcal/mol, compared with fragments of the coenzyme A moiety added separatly or together. (d) The exchange of labeled coenzyme A into acyl-CoA substrates was found to be greater than or equal to 10(5) slower than substrate turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1565487885,"In an attempt to determine which membrane proteins are essential to the stereospecific uptake of D-glucose, isolated human erythrocyte membranes were exposed to a variety of reagents capable of selectively extracting various membrane proteins. These reagents included EDTA, lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate, sodium iodide, and 2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride. Selective elution of spectrin and Components 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 5, and 6 representing 65% of the ghost protein has no effect on the uptake of D-glucose. All of the sugar transport proteins are associated with a membrane residue consisting of the proteins of Bands 3, 4.5, and 7, the periodic acid-Schiff-sensitive glycoproteins, and ghost phospholipids. Specific cross-linking of the proteins of Band 3 of ghosts by the catalyzed oxidation of intrinsic sulfhydryl groups with the o-phenanthroline-cupric ion complex inhibits D-glucose uptake and alters the relative electrophoretic mobility of Band 3 proteins in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-agarose gels. This uptake activity and the relative mobility of Band 3 proteins are recovered upon reversal of the cross-linking reaction by reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol. These results and other observations indicate that the D-glucose transport protein is an intrinsic component of the hydrophobic structure of the erythrocyte membrane and may be associated with the proteins of Band 3 which are glycoproteins spanning the membrane bilayer. It is proposed that D-glucose transport occurs through a water-filled channel formed by specific subunit aggregates of the transport proteins in the erythrocyte membrane rather than by rotation of the protein within the plane of the membrane."

Incubation of cobalt-cobalt leucine aminopeptidase with various AnCl2 concentrations or zinc-zinc leucine aminopeptidase with various CoCl2 concentrations in M KCl and 0.2 M N-ethylmorpholine-HCl at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees demonstrates that Co2+ and Zn2+ compete reversibly for two independent binding sites per subunit for which the ratio of the association constants for Zn2+ and Co2+ (1KZn:1KCo = 1KZn/Co; 2KZn:2KCo = 2KZn/Co) are 115 and 15.9 for sites 1 and 2, respectively. The specific activities of the various species of enzyme with 2 mM L-leucine p-nitroanilide as substrate in 0.2 M N-ethylmorpholine-HCl and 0.01 M NaHCO3 at pH 7.5 are estimated to be (in micromoles per min per mg) 0.043 for the zinc-zinc. 0.039 for the zinc-cobalt, 0.541 for the cobalt-zinc, and 0.536 for the cobalt-cobalt forms, which implies that activity is affected only when cobalt is substituted at site 1, the activation site. The site, at which cobalt substitution has no effect on activity, is designated the structural site. The value of Km for cobalt-cobalt leucine aminopeptidase with L-leucine p-nitroanilide as substrate in 0.2 M N-ethylmorpholine-HCl at pH 7.5 containing 0.01 M NaHCO3 at 30 degrees is 0.52 mM while Vmax is 0.90 mumol per min per mg. In the additional presence of 1 M KCl, Km is 0.19 mM while Vmax is 0.68 mumol per min per mg."

https://openalex.org/W1542549195,"Eukaryotic polypeptide elongation factor 1 (EF-1) from pig liver has been resolved into two complementary factors, EF-1alpha and EF-1beta (Iwasaki, K., Mizumoto, K., Tanka, M., and Kaziro, Y. (1973) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 74, 849). This paper describes the procedures for purification of EF-1beta and some properties of the purified factor. The purification method includes an aqueous two-phase separation technique, a treatment of the crude factor with sodium cholate and two successive column chromatographies on diethyl-aminoethyl-Sephadex A-50. By this method, EF-1beta was purified about 50-fold starting from the material obtained after two-phase separation followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation with a recovery of 20%. The purified EF-1beta appeared homogeneous, having a molecular weight of about 90,000. It consisted of two unequal subunits of the molecular weights of 55,000 and 30,000. It stimulates polymerization of phenylalanine dependent on poly(U) in the presence of both EF-1alpha and EF-2, as well as the EF-1alpha-dependent binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA to ribosomes in the presence of GTP. However, it had no effect on the stoichiometric binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA to ribosomes dependent on EF-1alpha in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl methylenediphosphonate. These results indicate that the function of EF-1beta is to stimulate the recycling of EF-1alpha."

https://openalex.org/W1523683689,"The proteins of the subunits of rat liver ribosomes were fractionated by stepwise elution from carboxymethylcellulose with LiCl at pH 6.5. The 40 S ribosomal proteins were separated into five groups containing between 3 and 14 proteins; the 60 S proteins, into seven groups of 3 to 15. Only a comparatively small number of proteins occurred in appreciable amounts in more than one group. The number of relatively acidic proteins associated with the ribosomal subunits was larger than had been reported before: it is not known if they are initiation or translation factors or ribosomal structural proteins. The group fractionation procedure has proven valuable as the initial step in the isolation and characterization of rat liver ribosomal proteins."

https://openalex.org/W18002355,"The biosynthesis of sphinganine and 4-D-hydroxysphinganine was studied in rat liver microsomes and whole cells of yeast (Hansenula ciferri). It was shown in both cases that the condensation of [2,3,3-2H3]serine and palmitic acid yielded long chain bases containing only two deuterium atoms, both of which were located on the terminal (C-1) carbon atom by combined gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. When the reaction with the liver microsomal system was carried out in 2H2O with the protium species of serine, the sphinganine contained a deuterium atom on C-2. These results suggest that the synthesis of 3-ketosphinganine involves the replacement of the alpha-hydrogen atom and the carboxyl group of serine by a proton from the medium and a palmitoyl group, rather than a previously proposed mechanism in which the alpha-hydrogen of serine is retained. Some stereochemical requirements of 3-ketosphinganine synthetase are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1521245440,"The rate of inactivation of succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase by thiol reagents is increased 3 to 100 times by very low concentrations of acyl-CoA substrates. The same maximum inactivation rate is found with acetoacetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. The enhanced rate of inactivation is caused by the stoichiometric formation of the enzyme-CoA intermediate and an accompanying conformation change of the enzyme. The inactivation rate provides a simple assay for the amount of enzyme present as the enzyme-CoA intermediate, using only catalytic concentrations of enzyme. This technique has been utilized to measure (a) a rate constant for hydrolysis of the enzyme-CoA intermediate of 0.10 min-1 at pH 8.1; (b) a stoichiometry of two active sites per enzyme molecule; and (c) the equilibrium constants for formation of the enzyme-CoA intermediate from dilute solutions of substrates (and hence for the overall reaction) by determining the ratio of [enzyme-CoA]/[enzyme] in the presence of a series of substrate buffers at different ratios of [RCOO-]/[RCOSCoA]. As the total concentration of acyl-CoA and carbosylate substrates is increased, the inactivation rate is decreased. This indicates that the Michaelis complexes are protected against inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W1510718429,"In order to understand better the regulation of human placental proteins the activity of placental lactogen messenger RNA has been examined. Total RNA was extracted from normal term placentas and purified by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose. The poly(A)-containing fraction stimulated amino acid incorporation 5- to 10-fold in wheat germ cell-free extracts, and immunoprecipitation of the translation products with antiserum directed against human placental lactogen (hPL) suggests that about 2% of the peptides contain hPL determinants. Analysis of the material precipitated with hPL antiserum by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels revealed two major species, one co-migrating with hPL and the other migrating slightly slower than hPL. On DEAE-cellulose chromatography the former material eluted close to authentic hPL while the latter material eluted at higher ionic strength than hPL, indicating a difference in net charge of these two species. Tryptic peptide analysis of the large material and authentic hPL shows marked similarities in the primary structure of these two proteins. The slower migrating peptide has an apparent molecular weight about 3000 larger than hPL and thus may represent a precursor molecule. Both cell-free products could be competed out of immunoprecipitates by a large excess of authentic hPL, confirming their immunologic similarities. Centrifugation of the placental poly(A)-containing RNA through aqueous glycerol gradients indicates that the hPL mRNA sediments at about 14 S."

https://openalex.org/W5692200,"3beta-Hydroxypregn-5-en-20-one (pregnenolone) and NAD+ were incubated with a solubilized preparation of the coupled enzyme 3beta-hydroxysteroid:NAD(P) oxidoreductase-3-ketosteroid delta4,delta5-isomerase (3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase: delta5-isomerase) from the mitochondrial fraction of human placenta. Unconverted pregnenolone, pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione (rogesterone), and a small but detectable amount of pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione were isolated from the medium by Sephadex LH-20 chromomatography. The identification of pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione, confirmed by mass fragmentography, has provided the first direct evidence for the formation of the hypothetical delta5,3-ketone intermediate in the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. When tritium-labeled pregnenolone and [4-14C]pregnenolone were incubated simultaneously the 3H:14C ratio in isolated pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione was 4.6 times greater than in isolated progesterone and pregnenolone, indicating a kinetic isotope effect in the enzymatic isomerization of tritium-labeled pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione. Exposure of the enzyme to two steroids which inhibit the overall enzyme reaction, 2alpha-cyano-17beta-hydroxy-4,4,17alpha-trimethylandrost-5-en-3-one (cyanoketone) and 3-hydroxyestra-1,3,5(10),6,8-pentaen-17-one (equilenin), increased the relative yield of labeled pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione as well as the recovery of radioactivity remaining as unconverted pregnenolone, suggesting that both the dehydrogenase and isomerase activities were inhibited. Exposure of the enzyme to equilenin increased the ratio of isolated pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione radioactivity to progesterone radioactivity as progesterone synthesis was inhibited. Equilenin also diminished the tritium isotope effect on the isomerase reaction. Both findings suggest that it is possible to inhibit the isomerase to a greater extent than the dehydrogenase. In order to measure the rate of progesterone produced by the coupled enzymes, we have modified a radiochemical method which involves precipitation of pregnenolone by digitonin. Digitonin precipitation proved to be effective in separating unconverted pregnenolone from the steroid products of both enzyme reactions, progesterone and pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione. Neither the steroidal inhibitors nor the kinetic isotope effect altered the accuracy of the method for routine measurement of the overall rate of conversion of delta5,3beta-hydroxysteroid to delta4,3-ketosteroid."

https://openalex.org/W1490473480,"Rabbit muscle phosphorylase b reacts with the phosphate-like reagent potassium ferrate, K2FeO4, a potent oxidizing agent. The reaction results in inactivation of the enzyme and abolition of the ability of the enzyme to bind 5'-AMP. Activating and nonactivating nucleotides which bind at the 5'-AMP binding site such as 5'-AMP, 2'-AMP, 3'-AMP, and 5'-IMP substantially protect the enzyme from inactivation by ferrate. One to two residues of tyrosine and approximately 1 residue of cysteine are modified by ferrate under the conditions employed. Tyrosine is protected by 5-AMP, whereas cysteine is not. The tyrosine modification is suggested as the inactivating chemical reaction. The location of the inactivating reaction is suggested to be in or near the 5'-AMP binding site. The structural and chemical properties of ferrate ion are discussed and compared to those of phosphate. Ferrate ion may be a reagent useful for phosphate group binding site-directed modification of proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1545673548,"Circular dichroism and difference ultraviolet visible spectra were obtained for cobalt hemoglobin derivatives. At 287 nm the ellipticity difference between the oxy- and deoxycobaltohemoglobin is about one-half as great as that for the native proteins indicating smaller quaternary conformational changes for the former. Deoxygenation increases the Soret rotational strengths of both iron and cobalt hemoglobins to comparable degrees suggesting similar conformational changes for their aromatic residues near the heme. Deoxygenation causes a much larger decrease of L band ellipticity for iron than cobalt hemoglobin. Circular dichroism spectra of nitrosylcobaltohemoglobin indicate the molecule to have a T quaternary structure. The circular dichroism spectra of cobaltihemoglobin do not seem to fit the patterns of the other cobalt derivatives and its 287 nm ellipticity is pH-dependent. From the shape of the Soret circular dichroism spectra, it is estimated that the transition dipole makes an angle with the line joining the two opposing pyrrole nitrogens of about 60 degrees for oxy- and deoxycobaltohemoglobin, 80 degrees for cobaltihemoglobin, as compared to 70 degrees for the native oxy- and deoxyhemoglobins. Inositol hexaphosphate has little or no effect on the circular dichroism spectra of cobalt hemoglobins in the 287 nm region, but it significantly increases the Soret rotational strength and decreases the L band ellipticity. The results are interpreted to mean that polyphosphates modify primarily the protein structure of hemoglobins at the tertiary level, and that the intersubunit interactions are weak in cobalt hemoglobins."
https://openalex.org/W1509020351,"In rats 80 to 95% of 4'-deoxypyridoxine administered intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously was excreted in the urine within 7.5 hours. Orally administered deoxypyridoxine was also rapidly eliminated. Over one-half of the excreted material appeared as deoxypyridoxine-3-(hydrogen sulfate) and the remainder as unchanged deoxypyridoxine. Tissue concentrations of deoxypyridoxine 5'phosphate were comparable to those of pyridoxal 5'phosphate. In normal men about 50% of a single oral dose (3 to 7.5 mg/kg of body weight) appeared in the urine within 6 hours. 4'Deoxy-5-pyridoxic acid accounted for 50 to 100% of the excreted material. The remainder was unchanged deoxypyridoxine. No deoxypyridoxine-3-(hydrogen sulfate) was detected in human urine and no 4'-deoxy-5-pyridoxic acid was found in rat urine. Deoxypyridoxine 5'-phosphate was not detected in the urine of either species. The complexity of deoxypyridoxine metabolism indicated by these data suggests the use of caution in extrapolating data obtained with deoxypyridoxine to B6 metabolism in the absence of deoxypyridoxine, and particularly in extrapolating results from the rat to man. Synthesis for 4'-deoxypyridoxine-3-(ethyl carbonate), 4'-deoxypyridoxine 5'-acetate, 4'-deoxy-3-0-(2-sulfoethyl)-pyridoxine, and the metabolites are presented. These synthesis were facilitated by using ethylchloroformate conjugates and N-methylpiperazine hydrolysis to block and unblock the phenol group."

https://openalex.org/W1510614435,"Abstract The semisynthetic syntheses and some properties of derivatives of Clostridium acidi-urici ferredoxin that contain amino acid deletions or replacements in the peptide chain are described. All 16 stable derivatives prepared, with the exception of [Trp2]ferredoxin, were fully active as electron carriers in the two enzymatic assay systems tested: the phosphoroclastic system and the ferrodoxin-dependent reduction of cytochrome c. E1Trp1]Ferredoxin had 70% of the activity of native ferredoxin in both assay systems. The stability in aerobic solution of [Ala1]ferredoxin, which had had its natural alanyl NH2-terminal residue removed and then replaced chemically, is the same as that of the native ferrodoxin (half-life of approximately 54 days). The relative stabilities of derivatives with a replacement or deletion of the NH2-terminal residue are as follows: [Ala1]- greater than or equal to [Phe1]-, [Lys1]-, [ Pro1]-, [Leu1]- greater than [Met1]- greater than [Gly1]- greater than [Glu1]- greater than des-Ala1-ferrodoxin. The data indicate that a large bulky residue, but not a negatively charged residue, is tolerated in position 1 of the peptide chain and the greatly decreased stability (half-life = 1 day) of des-Ala1-ferredoxin confirms the importance of the NH2-terminal residue for the stability of the protein. The relative stabilities of derivatives containing Ala1, but including a replacement for the normal Tyr2, are as follows: Native greater than [Trp2]- greater than or equal to [Phe2]- greater than [His2]- greater than [Leu2]- greater than [Pro2]ferredoxin. [Gly2]- and des-Ala1-Tyr2-apoferredoxin did not form stable derivatives upon reconstitution with iron and sulfide, nor did [3-NO2-Tyr2, 30]- and [Leu2,3-NO2-Tyr30]apoferredoxins. Other relatively stable and fully active derivatives prepared included: [3-NH2-Tyr30]-, [3-F-Phe2]-, and [2-F-Phe2]ferredoxin. The behavior of these various derivatives demonstrates the importance of the peptide chain for the stability of C. acidi-urici ferredoxin and shows that the activity of ferredoxin can be altered by a single amino acid substitution in the peptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W1550500651,"Reaction of hen egg-white lysozyme with 2,3-dioxo-5-indolinesulfonic acid (DISA) yielded a homogeneous derivative which was modified at a single tryptophan residue. The modification was located at Trp-123. The absorption spectrum of the derivative showed a new peak in the visible range with lambdamax at 365 nm. In addition, the absorption maximum in the ultraviolet which appears in lysozyme at 280 nm was shifted to 270 nm in the derivative and appreciably enhanced. In ORD measurements, the rotatory behaviors of lysozyme and its derivative were identical at the 233 nm negative minimum and the 199 nm positive extremum. CD measurements gave equal [theta] values for lysozyme and derivative at the two negative ellipticity bands at 208 and 220 nm. Although no conformational differences between lysozyme and derivative were observed by ORD and CD measurements, some changes were detectable by chemical methods. Accessibility to tryptic hydrolysis and susceptibility of the disulfide bonds to reduction were increased in the derivative relative to lysozyme. The lytic activity of the derivative, which retained the same pH optimum as native lysozyme, was greatly (50%) decreased, probably as a result of the slight conformational change. With several antisera to lysozyme, the native protein and its derivative had equal antigenic reactivities. The findings were instrumental in further delineation of an antigenic reactive site in lysozyme."
