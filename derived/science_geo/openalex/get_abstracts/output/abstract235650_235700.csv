https://openalex.org/W1997600163,"Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, replicates as an intracellular parasite of amoebae and persists in the environment as a free-living microbe. Here we have analyzed the complete genome sequences of L. pneumophila Paris (3,503,610 bp, 3,077 genes), an endemic strain that is predominant in France, and Lens (3,345,687 bp, 2,932 genes), an epidemic strain responsible for a major outbreak of disease in France. The L. pneumophila genomes show marked plasticity, with three different plasmids and with about 13% of the sequence differing between the two strains. Only strain Paris contains a type V secretion system, and its Lvh type IV secretion system is encoded by a 36-kb region that is either carried on a multicopy plasmid or integrated into the chromosome. Genetic mobility may enhance the versatility of L. pneumophila. Numerous genes encode eukaryotic-like proteins or motifs that are predicted to modulate host cell functions to the pathogen's advantage. The genome thus reflects the history and lifestyle of L. pneumophila, a human pathogen of macrophages that coevolved with fresh-water amoebae."
https://openalex.org/W2076441216,"In the human genome the apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC)3 gene has expanded into a tandem array of genes termed APOBEC3A-G. Two members of this family, APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, have been found to have potent activity against virion infectivity factor deficient (Δvif) human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). These enzymes become encapsidated in Δvif HIV-1 virions and in the next round of infection deaminate the newly synthesized reverse transcripts. The lentiviral Vif protein prevents the deamination by inducing the degradation of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F. We report here that two additional APOBEC3 family members, APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C, have potent antiviral activity against simian immuno-deficiency virus (SIV), but not HIV-1. Both enzymes were encapsidated in HIV-1 and SIV virions and were active against Δvif SIVmac and SIVagm. SIV Vif neutralized the antiviral activity of APOBEC3C, but not that of APOBEC3B. APOBEC3B induced abundant G → A mutations in both wild-type and Δvif SIV reverse transcripts. APOBEC3C induced substantially fewer mutations. APOBEC3F was found to be active against SIV and sensitive to SIVmac Vif. These findings raise the possibility that the different APOBEC3 family members function to neutralize specific lentiviruses.

In cells infected with HIV-1 that is deleted for the virion infectivity factor (vif) gene (Δvif), APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F become encapsidated during virus assembly, and the virions that are released are greatly reduced in infectivity (2Sheehy A.M.

These encapsidated APOBEC proteins deaminate the viral reverse transcripts upon minus-strand synthesis; as a result, virus replication is aborted prior to integration (3Mangeat B. Turelli P. Caron G.

Science. 2003; 300: 1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Much of the deaminated DNA appears to be degraded by cellular DNA repair enzymes prior to integration. Those molecules that escape degradation are compromised in their coding capacity as a result of G → A mutations that insert frequent termination codons throughout the viral genome (10Yu Q. Konig R.

In cells infected with wild-type HIV-1, Vif rescues viral infectivity by binding to APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, inducing their polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation through an association with an E3 ubiquitin ligase consisting of Elongin B/C, Rbx-1, and Cul5 (11Stopak K. de Noronha C.

The interaction of Vif with APOBEC3G is species-specific (4Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R.

Chen D. Landau N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3927-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Vif binds to human APOBEC3G but not mouse, African green monkey (AGM), or rhesus macaque (MAC) APOBEC3G (4Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). As a result, noncognate APOBEC3G proteins tend to block the replication of both Δvif and wild-type HIV-1. Conversely, Vif of SIVmac, but not SIVagm, binds to human APOBEC3G; therefore, human APOBEC3G inhibits wild-type SIVagm but not wild-type SIVmac (4Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The species specificity of the Vif-APOBEC3G interaction is determined by a single amino acid difference in APOBEC3G at position 128 that encodes a charged amino acid (16Schrofelbauer B. Chen D. Landau N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3927-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17Bogerd H.P. Doehle B.P. Wiegand H.L. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

APOBEC3G can be encapsidated by HIV, SIV, and murine leukemia virus (MLV) through a mechanism thought to involve binding to viral RNA, cellular RNA, or the viral nucleocapsid protein (20Alce T.M.

APOBEC3G can also be encapsidated in hepatitis B virus and is thought to inhibit replication without deamination of the viral DNA (24Turelli P. Mangeat B. Jost S. Vianin S. Trono D. Science. 2004; 303: 1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In the human genome, the APOBEC gene family consists of APOBEC1, APOBEC2, activation-induced deaminase (AID), and APOBEC3A-G (here referred to as APOBEC3 in general) (25Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The mouse genome contains only a single APOBEC3 gene, suggesting that APOBEC3A-G is a fairly recent evolutionary expansion (26Zhang J. Webb D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Each APOBEC protein contains a catalytic domain characterized by a conserved amino acid motif consisting of a His and two Cys residues that coordinate a Zn2+ and a Glu residue that acts as a proton shuttle during catalysis. In APOBEC3B, APOBEC3F, and APOBEC3G the structural unit has been duplicated such that the enzyme contains two potential catalytic domains (25Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In addition, the APOBEC proteins are generally dimeric. APOBEC3G was the first cytidine deaminase shown to have anti-lentiviral activity (2Sheehy A.M. Gaddis N.C. Choi J.D. Malim M.H. Nature. 2002; 418: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Recently, its most closely related family member, APOBEC3F, was also shown to be active against HIV-1 and a target of Vif (8Zheng Y.H. Irwin D. Kurosu T. Tokunaga K. Sata T. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6073-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 9Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R.

Biol. 2004; 14: 1392-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). APOBEC3F is expressed in lymphocytes where it is able to form heteromul-timers with APOBEC3G (9Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2451-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 27Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1385-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The two enzymes differ in target sequence preference, in that APOBEC3F prefers TC, whereas APOBEC3G targets CC (9Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2451-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 27Liddament M.T. Brown W.L. Schumacher A.J. Harris R.S. Curr.

Here, we characterized APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C for their activity against HIV-1, SIVmac, and SIVagm. Although they were hardly active against HIV-1, APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C were potent inhibitors of SIV. Both enzymes were efficiently encapsidated by HIV-1 and SIV. These findings raise the possibility that the various APOBEC3 family members protect against different lentiviruses and provide a rationale for the expansion of the gene family in primates. APOBEC Expression Vectors—APOBEC3B expression vector was derived by cloning the full-length cDNAs into the pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were generated by reverse transcriptase PCR using the RNA isolated from phytohemagglutinin-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was primed with oligo(dT) and extended with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The APOBEC3B sequence was amplified with primers that contained EcoR V and SalI restriction sites and encoded the 5′-influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag, YPYDVPDYA. The amplicons were cleaved with EcoRV and SalI and ligated to similarly cleaved pcDNA3.1(+). Expression vectors for human APOBEC3C, APOBEC2, and AID were constructed the same way as for APOBEC3B, except that BamHI and SalI sites were used for cloning of APOBEC3C and EcoRI and XhoI sites for APOBEC2 and AID. Expression vectors for HA-tagged human APOBEC3G and AGM APOBEC3G were constructed by similar methods as previously described (4Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). APOBEC3F expression vector was provided by Dr. M. Peterlin (8Zheng Y.H. Irwin D. Kurosu T. Tokunaga K. Sata T. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6073-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Lines—The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T, human embryonic carcinoma cell line NCCIT, adherent human osteosarcoma cell line HOS, and HOS.CD4.X4 that expresses CD4 and CXCR4 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HIV-1, SIV, and MLV Luciferase Reporter Viruses—Single cycle wild-type and Δvif HIV-1 (pNL-Luc-E-R-, pNL-Luc-E-R-Δvif), SIVagm (pSIVagm-Luc-E-R-, pSIVagm-Luc-E-R-Δvif), and SIVmac (pSIVmac-Luc-E-R-, pSIVmac-Luc-E-R-Δvif) have been previously described (4Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The reporter viruses were generated as vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotypes by cotransfection of 293T cells in 10-cm dishes with 8 μg of proviral plasmid DNA, 4 μg of pcVSV-G, and 4 μg of APOBEC expression vector or empty pcDNA3.1(+) vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For experiments in Fig. 6A, 8 μg instead of 4 μg of APOBEC expression vector was used for the cotransfection. Virus-containing supernatant was collected 2 days posttransfection, filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and quantitated by p24 or p27 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HOS cells (∼1 × 104) were infected in 96-well plates in triplicate with 1 ng of p24/p27. Luciferase was measured 3 days later using Luc-Lite Plus reagent (Packard). Data are presented as the average counts/second of the triplicates ± S.D. MLV viruses encoding EGFP (MLV-EGFP) were generated by cotransfection of 293T cells with pHIT-60 (29Sakai H. Shibata R. Sakuragi J. Sakuragi S. Kawamura M. Adachi A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1663-1666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pMX-EGFP (30Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Morikawa Y. Shibuya A. Phillips J. Lanier L.L. Gorman D.M. Nolan G.P. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar), APOBEC expression vector, and pcVSV-G. The virions were normalized by quantitation on immunoblots probed with anti-MLV serum. APOBEC Encapsidation—Virions were produced by transfection of 293T cells as for production of reporter viruses. Culture supernatant was harvested 2 days posttransfection, and the virions were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose at 150,000 × g for 1 h (Beckman). The pelleted virions were solubilized in 100 μl of 1% Triton-containing buffer and normalized for p24/p27 concentration, which was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in the same buffer and normalized for protein concentration. Lysates of virions (20 ng of p24/p27) and cells (20 μg of protein) were analyzed on immunoblots probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 16B12 (Covance) and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Equal loading of virions was confirmed on immunoblots probed with anti-p24/p27 mAb AG3.0 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). Sequencing of Viral Reverse Transcripts—HOS.CD4.X4 cells (1 × 106) were infected with DNase-I-treated HIV-1 or SIVagm (50 ng of p24/p27). After 4 h, the cells were washed with medium; at 12 h postinfection, DNA was isolated using DNeasy DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). A 1.1-kb fragment covering a portion of env and nef (nucleotides 8496-9609 in NL4-3 and 8153-9252 in SIVagm) was amplified with Expand high fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) and cloned into the TOPO TA-cloning vector pCR4 (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence of at least 10 independent clones was analyzed using Hypermut software (31Rose P.P. Korber B.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 400-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR and sequencing were SIVagm-F, 5′-GCC GTG GAC TTT CAA CAA TAC ACC; SIVagm-R, 5′-GCT TCC TGG GAG ACA TCT ACC G; HIV-1-F, 5′-GGA GCC TGT GCC TCT TCA GCT ACC; HIV-1-R, 5′-GCT TTA TTG AGG CTT AAG CAG TGG G. Cytidine Deaminase Assay—This assay was modified from the deaminase activity assay for encapsidated APOBEC3G previously described (10Yu Q. Konig R. Pillai S. Chiles K. Kearney M. Palmer S. Richman D. Coffin J.M. Landau N.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Briefly, virions were pelleted and solubilized in 100 μl of virus lysis buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (10Yu Q. Konig R. Pillai S. Chiles K. Kearney M. Palmer S. Richman D. Coffin J.M. Landau N.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Virus lysate containing 100 ng of p24 was mixed with 1 × 105 cpm of 5′-end 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the indicated target sequence in the deaminase buffer. After 5 h at 37 °C, the reactions were heated to 90 °C for 5 min and then incubated with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) (New England Biolab) in UDG buffer for another 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the reaction was brought to 0.15 m NaOH at 37 °C for 30 min. The products were separated on a precast 15% TBE-urea PAGE (Invitrogen) and detected by autoradiography. A labeled marker oligonucleotide in which the target C was replaced with U was processed in parallel to indicate the position of the cleaved product. Real-time PCR Quantitation of APOBEC3 mRNA in Primary Cell Populations—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated from healthy donor blood by Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) centrifugation. To purify unactivated CD4+ T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were positively sorted on anti-CD4 Dynabeads and removed with Detachabead (Dynal Biotech) as previously described (32Sundrud M.S. Grill S.M. Ni D. Nagata K. Alkan S.S. Subramaniam A. Unutmaz D. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cells were further purified by negative selection on anti-CD8 and anti-CD14 (BD Biosciences) with goat anti-mouse IgG (Dynal Biotech)-coated beads. The purified cells were 99.5% CD4+ as determined by flow cytometry. Activated cells were prepared as previously described (33Oswald-Richter K. Grill S.M. Shariat N. Leelawong M. Sundrud M.S. Haas D.W. Unutmaz D. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E198Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Purified CD4+ T cells were cultured in dishes coated with goat anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml; CalTag Laboratories) followed by 3 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody OKT-3 (American Type Culture Collection) in medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml soluble anti-CD28 antibody (BD Biosciences). The cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum and IL-2 (Chiron) prepared as previously described (33Oswald-Richter K. Grill S.M. Shariat N. Leelawong M. Sundrud M.S. Haas D.W. Unutmaz D. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E198Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by positive selection on anti-CD14-coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) using an AutoMacs (Miltenyi Biotech). The monocytes were >98% CD14+. Macrophages were generated by culturing the monocytes for 4 days in medium containing 50 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D Systems). Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 cells using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I. NCCIT cells, human heart, and small intestine total RNAs (Ambion) were used as controls. cDNA was generated from 100 ng of RNA using the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) primed with random hexamers. Specific cDNAs from 2 to 10 ng of total RNA were quantitated by Taqman quantitative PCR with specific primer/probe combinations on an ABI PRIS 7700 sequence detection system following the manufacturer's instruction. Primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) and were shown to be specific for a single APOBEC family member by testing against plasmid DNA. Standard curves were constructed using serially diluted plasmid. The data were normalized using 18 S rRNA primers and probe (Applied Biosystems), which was found to be reliable for comparison of resting and activated populations. Data are presented as the average of triplicates ± S.D. HIV-1 and SIV Encapsidate APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C— To determine whether different APOBECs can be encapsidated by lentiviruses, virions were generated by cotransfection of 293T cells with wild-type or Δvif HIV-1 or SIVagm proviral clones and expression vectors for HA-tagged APOBECs. Virus-containing culture supernatant was harvested 2 days post-transfection, the virions were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, normalized for p24/p27 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and then analyzed for APOBEC content by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA mAb. To determine the relative expression levels of the APOBEC proteins, lysates of the transfected cells were prepared and analyzed similarly on immunoblots (Fig. 1A). The results showed that APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C were encapsidated into HIV-1 and SIVagm virions (Fig. 1B). Both enzymes were more efficiently encapsidated than APOBEC3G in HIV-1 and SIV. Controls with human and AGM APOBEC3G demonstrated the expected species specificity; HIV-1, but not SIVagm Vif, reduced the amount of human APOBEC3G that was encapsidated. Conversely, SIVagm, not HIV-1 Vif, reduced the AGM APOBEC3G encapsidation. This species specificity did not apply to APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C. HIV-1 and SIVagm Vif reduced the amount of encapsidated APOBEC3C, but not APOBEC3B (Fig. 1B). Two other members of the APOBEC family, APOBEC2 and AID, were also efficiently incorporated into wild-type and Δvif HIV-1 virions (Fig. 1B). There was slightly more APOBEC3B and AID in the wild-type as compared with Δvif virus particles, a phenomenon previously noted for mouse and AGM APOBEC3G encapsidated into HIV-1 virions (4Mariani R. Chen D. Schrofelbauer B. Navarro F. Konig R. Bollman B. Munk C. Nymark-McMahon H. Landau N.R. Cell. 2003; 114: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). HIV-1 Vif appeared to slightly reduce the amount of encapsidated APOBEC2. APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C Inhibit SIV Infectivity—Although the different APOBECs could be encapsidated in HIV-1 and SIV, it was not clear whether they would have antiviral activity. To determine this, VSV-G pseudotyped wild-type and Δvif HIV-1, SIVagm, and SIVmac luciferase reporter viruses were prepared in 293T cells cotransfected with APOBEC expression vectors. The infectivity of the viruses was determined by infecting HOS cells with viruses normalized for p24/p27 and measuring luciferase activity 3 days postinfection (Fig. 2). The amount of APOBEC3G expression vector in the transfection was sufficient to reduce the infectivity of Δvif HIV-1 to close to background and to cause an ∼2-fold reduction in wild-type virus infectivity. AGM APOBEC3G, which is resistant to HIV-1 Vif, potently inhibited both wild-type and Δvif HIV-1 (Fig. 2A). APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C weakly inhibited HIV-1 (2-5-fold for APOBEC3B and <2-fold for APOBEC3C; Fig. 2A). The antiviral activity of APOBEC3C, but not APOBEC3B, was moderately relieved by HIV-1 Vif. In contrast, APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C were potent inhibitors of SIVagm and SIVmac (Fig. 2, B and C). APOBEC3B reduced SIVagm infectivity to near background. SIV Vif did not relieve APOBEC3B inhibition of the virus. APOBEC3C was potent against Δvif SIVagm, and in contrast to APOBEC3B, its inhibitory activity was relieved by SIV Vif. APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C activity on SIVmac was similar to that on SIVagm (Fig. 2, B and C). Human APOBEC2 and AID did not affect the infectivity of HIV-1, SIVagm, and SIVmac (Fig. 2, A-C). Encapsidated APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C Deaminate the Reverse Transcripts—APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F mediate their antiviral activity by single-strand DNA deamination (9Wiegand H.L. Doehle B.P. Bogerd H.P.

To determine whether APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C also act through this mechanism, the sequence of viral reverse transcripts from newly infected cells was analyzed. VSV-G pseudotyped wild-type and Δvif HIV-1 and SIVagm with or without encapsidated APOBEC were prepared, normalized for p24, treated with DNase I, and then used to infect HOS cells. At 12 h postinfection, a fragment of the reverse transcript that contained the 3′-portion of env and 5′-portion of nef, a region that is highly susceptible to APOBEC3G deamination (10Yu Q. Konig R.

Nucleotide sequences were determined for at least 10 independent clones from each infection. APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C generated a low frequency of G → A mutations on HIV-1 reverse transcripts (Fig. 3A). The number of mutations induced by APOBEC3C, but not APOBEC3B, was reduced by Vif. In contrast, APOBEC3B generated a high frequency of G → A mutations on SIVagm reverse transcripts (Fig. 3A; quantitated in Fig. 3B). This mutational frequency was comparable with that induced by human APOBEC3G and was not affected by Vif. The pattern of bases changed by APOBEC3B and APOBEC3G was overlapping, with many shared hot spots, but APOBEC3B displayed a broader target sequence preference, targeting both GG and GA dinucleotides (Fig. 3C). APOBEC3C also induced G → A mutations on Δvif SIVagm reverse transcripts, but with a 9-fold lower frequency compared with APOBEC3B (Fig. 3B). These mutations were randomly distributed and lacked obvious hot spots or strong dinucleotide sequence preference (Fig. 3, A and C). Vif reduced t"
https://openalex.org/W2036836052,"Elevated glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity is associated with Alzheimer disease. We have found that collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMP) 2 and 4 are physiological substrates of GSK-3. The amino acids targeted by GSK-3 comprise a hyperphosphorylated epitope first identified in plaques isolated from Alzheimer brain. Expression of wild type CRMP2 in primary hippocampal neurons or SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells promotes axon elongation. However, a GSK-3-insensitive CRMP2 mutant has dramatically reduced ability to promote axon elongation, a similar effect to pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3. Hence, we propose that phosphorylation of CRMP proteins by GSK-3 regulates axon elongation. This work provides a direct connection between hyperphosphorylation of these residues and elevated GSK-3 activity, both of which are observed in Alzheimer brain."
https://openalex.org/W2057559671,"The up-regulation of glycolysis to enhance the production of energy under reduced pO2 is a hallmark of the hypoxic response. A key regulator of glycolytic flux is fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, and its steady state concentration is regulated by the action of different isozymes product of four genes (pfkfb1–4). pfkfb3 has been found in proliferating cells and tumors, being induced by hypoxia. To understand the organization of cis-acting sequences that are responsible for the oxygen-regulated pfkfb3 gene, we have studied its 5′-flanking region. Extensive analysis of the 5′ pfkfb3 promoter sequence revealed the presence of putative consensus binding sites for various transcription factors that could play an important role in pfkfb3 gene regulation. These DNA consensus sequences included estrogen receptor, hypoxia response element (HRE), early growth response, and specific protein 1 putative binding sites. Promoter deletion analysis as well as putative HREs sequences (wild type and mutated) fused to a c-fos minimal promoter unit constructs demonstrate that the sequence located from -1269 to -1297 relative to the start site is required for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) induction. The effective binding of HIF-1 transcription factor to the HREs at -1279 and -1288 was corroborated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and biotinylated oligonucleotide pull-down. In addition, HIF-1α null mouse embryo fibroblasts transfected with a full-length pfkfb3 promoter-luciferase reporter construct further demonstrated that HIF-1 protein was critically involved for hypoxia transactivation of this gene.

In eukaryotic cells exposure to a low oxygen environment induces a hypoxic response pathway through a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) 1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; Glut-1, glucose transporter-1; DFO, deferoxamine; HRE, hypoxia response element; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; Fru-2,6-P2, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; PFK-2, 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase; mEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. (1Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5416) Google Scholar). The active transcription factor is a heterodimeric protein complex composed of two subunits HIF-1α and HIF-1β. This dimer recognizes the hypoxia response element (HRE; 5′-ACGTG-3′) present in hypoxia-inducible promoters. The HIF-1β is a constitutively expressed protein, whereas the α subunit is rapidly degraded in normoxic conditions through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (2Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The protein that initiates this degradation process is the tumor suppressor VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau), which is the recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that targets HIF-1α for proteasomal degradation when HIF-1α prolines -564 and -402 are hydroxylated (3Bruick R.K.

A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). This hydroxylation process is controlled by specific Fe2+, oxoglutarate, and oxygen-dependent hydroxylase enzymes. Thus, stabilization of HIF-1α is induced by oxygen deficiency, allowing its nuclear translocation and dimerization with HIF-1β (6Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chelating or substituting Fe2+ with deferoxamine (7Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cobalt chloride (8Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, or inhibiting oxoglutarate with dimethyloxalylglycine reduces the hydroxylase activity and mimics the hypoxia effects. There is now substantial evidence in support of the hypothesis that HIF-1 functions as a mediator of the adaptive response to hypoxia. Among all of the adaptations, transcriptional activation of genes associated to metabolism is of special interest. Many of these target genes promote cellular adaptation to reduced oxygen availability by increasing glucose uptake and glycolysis. Several genes encoding enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and glucose transport are activated by low pO2: aldolase-A, phosphoglycerate kinase-1, pyruvate kinase M, lactate dehydrogenase A, phosphofructokinase L, and glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1) (1Semenza G.L.

High glycolytic flux is essential for tumor growth in hypoxic conditions, and many transformed cells display a high rate of glycolysis that is maintained even under aerobic conditions (Warburg effect) (12Warburg O. Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9940) Google Scholar). Glycolytic flux is mainly controlled by 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (13Krebs H.A. Essays Biochem. 1972; 8: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar), with fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) being its most powerful allosteric activator (14Van Schaftingen E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

These properties confer to this metabolite a key role in the control of the glycolytic pathway. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2) is the bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6-P2 and hence critically regulates carbohydrate metabolism (14Van Schaftingen E.

Four independent genes, pfkfb1–4, code for the different isoforms of the PFK-2 family. These isoforms show differences in their tissue distribution and kinetic properties in response to allosteric effector, hormonal, and growth factor signals (17Okar D.A. Manzano A. Navarro-Sabate A.

This implies that in tissues where it is expressed, elevated Fru-2,6-P2 levels are maintained, and consequently high glycolytic rates are sustained.

Our data provide evidence that the consensus binding site located at -1279 and -1288 in the pfkfb3 promoter is necessary for stimulation of this gene by hypoxia. Cell Culture—Human glioblastoma T98G and U-87 cell lines were obtained through the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Mouse embryo fibroblasts (mEF wild type (+/+) or (+) and HIF-1α deficient (-/-) or (-) cell lines) were kindly provided by Dr. R. S. Johnson (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA) (31Seagroves T.N. Ryan H.E. Lu H. Wouters B.G. Knapp M. Thibault P. Laderoute K. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3436-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), l-glutamine, and antibiotics and incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Hypoxia simulation conditions were achieved by growing cells in DMEM supplemented with 200 μm deferoxamine (DFO), 200 μm CoCl2, or 1 mm dimethyloxalylglycine (kindly provided by Peter Ratcliffe, Oxford, UK). For hypoxic treatment, cell culture plates were incubated in a modular incubator chamber (Billup-Rothenburg, Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH) and flushed with a gas mixture containing 2% O2, 5% CO2. Whole extracts were prepared from cultured cells as described below. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was performed on RNA extracts from T98G cells. Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells under hypoxia (2% oxygen) (see above for details) for 0, 3, and 6 h. RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ultraspec RNA Biotecx Laboratories). The concentration and purity of all RNA samples were determined using the A260 nm/A280 nm ratio and formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Five micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a Ready-To-Go First Strand Kit from Amersham Biosciences, using random primers. pfkfb3 and Glut-1 were specifically amplified by real time PCR using the probe/primer set (Hs0019079_ml) for human pfkfb3 (NM_004566) and (Hs00197884_ml) for Glut-1 (NM_006516) (Applied Biosystems). The threshold cycle number (Ct) was obtained, and the relative quantity of the specific mRNA in each sample was calculated using the standard curve generated with the same primer/probe set on T98G total RNA. The relative expression of each gene was normalized to that of the TATA-binding protein gene (probe/primer: Hs99999910_ml), and gene expression in each sample was then compared with expression in basal conditions (T98G cells under hypoxia for 0 h). HIF-1α RNA Interference Experiments—To knock down HIF-1α expression in U-87 cells, an expression vector (pCEP4; Invitrogen) containing small interference RNA oligonucleotides against HIF-1α mRNA was transfected into U-87 cells followed by selection in hygromycin (40 μg/ml)-containing medium. The vector was constructed by replacing the SV40 promoter with a cassette containing the U6 promoter and cDNA sequences corresponding to nucleotides 1543–1561 (NM-001530) to generate a looped small interference RNA against the human HIF-1α mRNA. Control cells were generated by using a similar vector containing scrambled cDNA sequences. Plasmid Constructions—To expand up to 3566 the promoter region already available in our laboratory, we used a PCR-amplified fragment obtained from the cosmid clone CRI-JC2015 and subcloned into the previously published PFKFB3/-1198 pGL2-basic luciferase reporter construct (35Navarro-Sabate A. Manzano A. Riera L. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. Bartrons R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Primers utilized were named: Fw-3661 5′-GAACGTTTTAACCTGGCTATGGCTGGCACA-3′ (from -3661 to -3632) and revoligo 5′-CGTCTCCTTTCCCGGCCCTCGCAGTTT-3′ (from -994 to -1020). The fragment obtained was used as a substrate for a nested PCR reamplification using the primer oligo BglII-Fw 5′-GGAGTTAGATctCATTGGCTGGCAC-3′ (from -3572 to -3548) and the primer revoligo (lowercase letters indicate nucleotides changed to introduce restriction sites in the amplified fragment). PCR was performed at 95 °C for 2 min and then 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C. The reamplified fragment was cloned in a TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen). A 2490-nt BglII-BglII fragment from this construct (corresponding to region from nucleotides -3566 to -1076 of the pfkfb3 promoter) was subcloned in PFKFB3/-1198. The BglII-BglII common region of the 123-nt fragment was previously deleted from PFKFB3/-1198 construct. The new recombinant plasmid was named PFKFB3/-3566. PFKFB3/-1407 was generated by redigestion of the PFKFB3/-3566 construct using ApaI and subsequent religation. Positive clones were completely sequenced at both strands, using the dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction products were analyzed on a PerkinElmer ABI PRISM 377 automated DNA sequencer. PFKFB3/-1198, PFKFB3/-938, and PFKFB3/-148 constructs of the pfkfb3 promoter cloned into the pGL2-basic vector (Promega) with the firefly luciferase gene as a reporter have been described previously (35Navarro-Sabate A. Manzano A. Riera L. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. Bartrons R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A pGL2-basic vector with the c-fos minimal promoter unit served as the basis for reporter constructs 29Wt-cfos and 29-Mut-cfos. The fragment of 29 nt from pfkfb3 promoter (from -1297 to -1269) with the sequence: 5′-GCATGCGGGACGTGACGCACGTGTGGCAG-3′ (containing the two putative HRE (marked in bold type)) was subcloned to obtain the 29Wt-cfos construct. The same 29 nucleotide fragment with a mutation in two base pairs in each of the HIF-1-binding sites (underlined) (5′-GCATGCGGGAATTGAGCGAATTGTGGCAG-3′) was used for the 29Mut-cfos construct. The identity of cloned products was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. A green fluorescent protein plasmid that codes for the green fluorescent protein was used to monitor transfection efficiency Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Transfections were performed using polyethylenimine or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and DMEM following the supplier's protocols. The different promoter-reporter fusion plasmids (1 μg) and 60 ng of the pSV40-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega, Madison, WI) were co-transfected into cells. Four hours later, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in DMEM (basal condition). For hypoxia stimulation assays, transfected cells were maintained in DMEM with 200 μm DFO (Sigma) or 200 μm cobalt chloride (Aldrich) or hypoxia (2% O2) for 16 h. At the times indicated, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. Luciferase activity was measured in supernatant extracts. Co-transfection with pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid DNA was carried out to normalize transfection efficiencies in different transfectants. The transfections were performed at least in triplicate, and the individual values were averaged to give the result of one experiment. The protein content of each sample was determined using a BCA protein kit (Pierce). Luciferase activity was measured in a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). β-Galactosidase activity was determined in 3 μl of cell extract using the luminescent β-galactosidase Clontech detection kit II (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The data are presented as the means ± S.E. At least three separate experiments with each plasmid DNA preparation were performed. Analysis of exogenous HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein effects on pfkfb3 promoter constructs were performed using co-transfection experiments. For these co-transfection experiments, PFKFB3/-3566 and pcDNA3-HA-HIFα(401Δ603) and/or pARNT constructs were transfected into T98G using various amounts of each plasmid such that all cells received a total of 1 μg plasmid DNA. HA-HIFα(401Δ603) and pARNT pcDNA3 protein expression vectors contain an oxygen-dependent degradation domain deleted HIF-1α and HIF-1β c-DNA human sequences, respectively, downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Both constructs were kindly provided by F. Bunn and L. E. Huang (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Western Blot Analysis—Total cellular protein was obtained from T98G cells using 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol with 2% SDS), scraped, and heated for 5′ at 95 °C. 30 μg of total cellular protein were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was probed with a specific polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of uPFK-2 (26Riera L. Manzano A. Navarro-Sabate A. Perales J.C. Bartrons R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) at 1:50 dilution and visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibody. α-Tubulin and HIF-1α were detected using monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Calbiochem) and anti-HIF1-α (Transduction Laboratories) antibodies (1:250 dilution), respectively. Bound antibody was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse. The antigen-antibody complexes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of Whole Cell Extracts for Gel Retardation Assay—Whole cell extracts were isolated from either untransfected (basal condition) or 48 h after transfection with HIF-1α(401Δ603) and HIF-1β protein expression vectors. Briefly, T98G cells were washed twice with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping using 500 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline and then pelleted by centrifugation at 150 × g for 5′. The cell pellet was resuspended with 50 μl of an extraction solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol. The cells were broken by passing the cell suspension through a 25-gauge needle at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15′ at 4 °C. The clear supernatant was used as whole cell extract for gel retardation assay. The cell extracts were stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were measured spectroscopically using Bio-Rad protein reagents. Gel Retardation Assay (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay)—Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by mixing equal amounts of complementary single-stranded DNAs in 50 mm NaCl, heating to 70 °C for 15 min, and cooling at room temperature. Oligonucleotides utilized contained the sequence from -1297 to -1269 of the pfkfb3 gene promoter, which include two consensus HRE boxes (in bold type, sequence of sense strand): 5′-GCATGCGGGACGTGACGCACGTGTGGCAG-3′ and a mutated consensus (nucleotides underlined) 5′-GCATGCGGGAATTGAGCGAATTGTGGCAG-3′. The sequence of the control oligonucleotide EPO-1 is: 5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′. The annealed oligonucleotides were labeled with 32P in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were carried out in a reaction mixture containing 5 μg of whole protein extract, incubated in the presence of binding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 250 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) for 10 min at room temperature. 32P-Labeled DNA probes (50,000 cpm) where added for 30 min at room temperature. In reactions including antibodies, rabbit polyclonal antibody against HIF-1β protein (Abcam, Novus-Biologicals) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the reaction mixture. The samples were immediately separated using low ionic strength 4% polyacrylamide to analyze for DNA-protein complex. A bromphenol blue-xylene cyanol dye solution was added to empty spaces flanking the sample wells to provide an indication of the electrophoresis process. The gels were electrophoresed at 20 mA. Biotinylated Oligonucleotide Precipitation Assay—Six hours after 2% O2 hypoxia, normoxia, or CoCl2 treatment, T98G cells were lysed with HKMG buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25% of Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Supernatants were collected after 10 min of centrifugation. The cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides (containing the sequence from -1297 to -1269 of pfkfb3 gene promoter) and 10 μg of poly-(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) for 16 h. DNA-bound proteins were collected with streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, washed with HKMG buffer, and separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Human anti-HIF-1α antibody was used to identify the DNA-bound proteins by Western blot. Computerized Search for Nuclear Factor-binding Sites in the pfkfb3 Promoter—Potential nuclear factor-binding sites were found using the TRANSFAC library of binding sites and MatInspector software. Notably, the following TRANSFAC consensus sequences were identified among others: cEBP, (C/T)AA(C/T); early growth response, GCGCGGGCG; estrogen receptor, GGTACAnnnTGACC; HRE, ACGTG; NFKB, GGGACTCTC; specific protein 1, GG(G/C)(C/G)GG. Data Analysis and Statistics—Fold of induction values obtained from different promoter fragments constructs were compared using an analysis of variance previous logarithmic transformation of data values, after testing their normal distribution. Comparison among the different constructs was performed applying a Scheffe's multiple comparison test. α = 0.05 was selected as statistically significant level. A two-sample t test was used to compare fold induction obtained from 29-Wt-cfos and 29Mut-cfos constructs. Effect of Deferoxamine, Cobalt Chloride, Dimethyloxalylglycine, and Hypoxia on uPFK-2 Expression in Glioblastoma Cells—To examine the effects of hypoxia on pfkfb3 gene expression, we used hypoxia (2% O2) and the hypoxia-mimics: cobalt chloride (CoCl2), a transition metal, DFO, an iron chelator, and dimethyloxalylglycine, a cell-permeable competitive inhibitor of oxoglutarate. These reagents inhibit HIF-1 prolyl hydroxylases activity (7Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human glioblastoma T98G and U-87 cell lines were chosen because of positive gene expression for pfkfb3 (22Manzano A. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. Perez J.X. Nadal M. Estivill X. Ambrosio S. Gil J. Bartrons R. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1998; 83: 214-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Western blot results from T98G (Fig. 1a) show the accumulation of HIF-1α subunit after 3, 6, and 9 h of treatment with deferoxamine, cobalt chloride, or hypoxia. Similarly, uPFK-2 isozyme expression increased significantly in the same conditions. To assess mRNA levels in hypoxia conditions, quantitative real time PCR was used. As shown in Fig. 1b hypoxia treatment produced significant increases on pfkfb3 mRNA levels, around 10-fold at 6 h. Similar results were achieved using Glut-1, another HIF target, as a positive control of hypoxia response. These results indicate that hypoxia and hypoxia mimics produce an increase of uPFK-2 levels in this cell line, as was described for Hep-3B cells (11Minchenko A. Leshchinsky I. Opentanova I. Sang N. Srinivas V. Armstead V. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6183-6187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Moreover, to evaluate the direct effect of endogenous pfkfb3 gene as an HIF target, expression of pfkfb3 was assayed in HIF-1α RNAi suppressed cells. Fig. 1c shows Western blot analysis from HIF-1α RNAi suppressed U-87 cells exposed to hypoxia or dimethyloxalylglycine. When using these cells, a complete correlation between the inhibition of HIF-1α expression and a decrease on uPFK-2 levels was observed, whereas levels of uPFK-2 increased in the control-vector transfected cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of HIF-1α subunit in the transcription regulation of endogenous pfkfb3 gene in glioblastoma cells. Identification of Sequences Required for Hypoxia-inducible Transcription from the pfkfb3 Promoter—We next focused our attention on detailed pfkfb3 promoter analysis, being of particular interest the search for putative HIF-binding sequences. For this purpose, we obtained various fragments from the promoter region and constructed luciferase expression vectors containing up to 3566 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the human pfkfb3 gene. The fragments were obtained using PCR amplification of the BAC cosmid CRJ2015 (containing the whole pfkfb3 promoter region). As shown in Fig. 2a, an extensive analysis of 5′ pfkfb3 promoter sequence, using the computer data base TRANSFAC, version 3.2, revealed the presence of several putative consensus binding sites for various transcription factors likely relevant in pfkfb3 gene regulation. These DNA consensus sequences included estrogen receptor, HRE, early growth response, and specific protein 1-binding sites. Among all the putative response sequences found in the pfkfb3 promoter region, estrogen receptor and HRE are of special interest because of the implication of these factors in the transcriptional regulation of the gene. Fig. 2a also indicates the presence of DNA-binding sites containing the core consensus sequence for other transcription factors that have been implicated in the induction of numerous genes in response to hypoxia. Most notable are sequences for NFκβ, specific protein 1, and cEBP. In Fig. 2b the positions of hypoxia response element sequences located in the pfkfb3 promoter are shown. A total of four HREs that are 100% homologous to the consensus HIF binding site (-ACGTG-) are present. The previously reported analysis of published pfkfb3 promoter included a -1198-bp region that contained a putative HRE at position -107. Spanning the region of study up to 3566 bp revealed interesting new potential hypoxia binding sites at positions -1279, -1288, and -1902 that appeared to be good candidates to contribute to the pfkfb3 stimulation by hypoxia. Response of Nested Deletions of the 5′-Flanking Region of pfkfb3 Gene Promoter to Deferoxamine and Cobalt Chloride Treatments—To delimit the promoter region mediating activation by CoCl2 or DFO, different fragments of the pfkfb3 promoter were generated and cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter vector. T98G cells were transiently transfected with these"
https://openalex.org/W2043453715,"Intergenerational mixing of DNA through meiotic recombinations of homologous chromosomes during gametogenesis is a major event that generates diversity in the eukaryotic genome. We examined genome-wide microsatellite data for 23,066 individuals, providing information on recombination events of 14,140 maternal and paternal meioses each, and found a positive correlation between maternal recombination counts of an offspring and maternal age. We postulated that the recombination rate of eggs does not increase with maternal age, but that the apparent increase is the consequence of selection. Specifically, a high recombination count increased the chance of a gamete becoming a live birth, and this effect became more pronounced with advancing maternal age. Further support for this hypothesis came from our observation that mothers with high oocyte recombination rate tend to have more children. Hence, not only do recombinations have a role in evolution by yielding diverse combinations of gene variants for natural selection, but they are also under selection themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2078043014,"The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum from three structurally related subunits (α, β, and γ). Channel maturation within the biosynthetic pathway involves cleavage of the α and γ subunits by furin and processing of N-linked glycans on α, β, and γ to complex type. Both mature and immature subunits have been observed at the surface of stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We have examined whether channel maturation is an all-or-none event or whether heterogeneous processing of channel subunits occurs within an individual channel complex. Using an immobilized lectin to isolate proteins with complex type N-glycans, we found that individual channel complexes with mature subunits lack immature subunits. Furthermore, terminal processing of N-glycans on ENaC subunits was not dependent on cleavage of ENaC subunits, and proteolysis of channel subunits was not dependent on prior processing of N-glycans. Our results suggest that processing of subunits within an individual channel complex is an all-or-none event such that channels present on the cell surface contain either all mature or all immature subunits. The presence of immature channel complexes at the plasma membrane provides epithelial cells with a reserve of poorly functional channels that can be activated by proteases in post-Golgi compartments.

These channels are composed of three structurally related subunits, termed α, β, and γ, that share a common structure, with two membrane-spanning domains separated by a large (∼450 residue) ectodomain and cytosolic amino and carboxyl termini. ENaC subunits are thought to assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they also undergo N-linked glycosylation (1Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Furin is a member of the proprotein convertase family of serine proteases that is expressed primarily in the trans-Golgi network and participates in the biosynthetic processing of proteins (5Thomas G.

Expression of active channels at the plasma membrane is blocked by treatment of cells with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A, which disrupts assembly of cytosolic coats that are required for intra-Golgi transport (10Shimkets R.A.

Most N-glycans on glycoproteins that transit the Golgi complex during biogenesis are modified from a high mannose type to a complex type by a series of enzymatic steps (12Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S.

However, it is apparent that two distinct pools of ENaC subunits are expressed at the plasma membrane: (i) mature subunits that have N-glycans processed to complex type and cleaved α and γ subunits; and (ii) immature subunits that have high mannose type N-glycans on full-length (i.e. non-cleaved) subunits (see Fig. 1A) (14Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

These observations raise the question of whether individual channels at the plasma membrane are composed of subunits that either (i) have all undergone maturation in the biosynthetic pathway (i.e. complex type N-glycans and cleaved α and γ subunits) or (ii) have subunits that have all escaped maturation. Alternatively, a mix of both mature and immature subunits might be present within an individual channel complex. We have used a lectin that recognizes sialic acid to isolate ENaC subunits that have complex type N-glycans and demonstrate that biosynthetic processing of ENaC subunits within an individual channel complex is an all-or-none event.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVectors, Antibodies, and Cell Culture—Preparation of mouse ENaC subunits with carboxyl-terminal epitope tags or mutant α and γ subunits lacking the sites for furin cleavage were described previously (4Hughey R.P.

Immobilized lectin from Sambucus nigra (SNA, 200 μl of slurry) from EY Laboratories, Inc. (San Mateo, CA) was added to the supernatants and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, and washed with HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) prior to elution in HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.1 m lactose at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were pelleted again, and the supernatant was recovered for immunoprecipitation of ENaC with anti-epitope tag antibodies and immunblotting. Mouse anti-HA antibody from Covance Inc. (Princeton, NJ) was used for ENaC immunoprecipitations from cell extracts before SNA precipitation and immunoblotting; and goat anti-V5 antibody conjugated to agarose from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO) was used for ENaC immunoprecipitation from the SNA eluate.Immunoblotting of Lamin—MDCK cells transfected, or not transfected, with ENaC were treated with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-SS-biotin and extracted with detergent solution as described previously (14Hughey R.P.

Nuclear lamin was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with mouse anti-lamin A/C IgM (clone XB10, Covance Inc.) using mouse anti-IgM conjugated to agarose from Sigma and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Lamin was eluted by boiling for 2 min, and 10% was retained for immunoblotting with mouse anti-lamin A/C antibody (clone 14) from Upstate (Waltham, MA). Any biotinylated lamin was recovered from the remainder of the immunoprecipitate (90%) using ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) and analyzed by immunoblotting for lamin.RESULTSENaC subunits with unique carboxyl-terminal epitope tags were transiently expressed in MDCK cells in various combinations as indicated in Fig. 1B, and cell surface proteins were labeled with biotin. For each combination of epitope-tagged α, β, and γ ENaC, the V5-tag was present on the subunit of interest. ENaC was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 antibodies (10% of total), and biotinylated ENaC subunits expressed at the plasma membrane were recovered with streptavidin-conjugated beads from the anti-V5 immunoprecipitates (90%). Expression of ENaC subunits was analyzed by probing the precipitates on immunoblots using anti-V5 antibodies. For each subunit, two distinct bands were detected in immunoprecipitates from total cell lysates and at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). These correspond to bands that we previously observed and characterized as representing immature (or non-processed) subunits (95 kDa for α, 96 kDa for β, 93 kDa for γ) and mature (or fully processed) subunits (65 kDa for α, 110 kDa for β, 75 kDa for γ) (see Fig. 1A). We confirmed that biotin was specifically labeling plasma membrane proteins and did not label an intracellular protein (nuclear lamin, Fig. 1C). These data are in agreement with our previous observation that both mature and immature ENaC subunits are expressed at the plasma membrane.We next examined whether all subunits within an individual channel complex undergo processing in the biosynthetic pathway or whether a mix of both mature and immature subunits is present within an individual channel complex. Mature subunits have complex type N-glycans, so we used the lectin SNA immobilized on agarose beads to precipitate proteins containing sialylated complex type N-glycans from solubilized MDCK cells expressing epitope-tagged ENaC subunits. Following elution from the SNA-agarose beads, selected ENaC subunits were immunoprecipitated and subjected to immunoblotting to detect co-immunoprecipitating subunits (Fig. 2). Only the mature forms of the β (110 kDa) and γ (75 kDa) subunits coimmunoprecipitated with α subunits that were isolated with SNA-agarose (see lanes 2 and 4); only mature forms of the α (65 kDa) and γ (75 kDa) subunits co-immunoprecipitated with β subunits isolated with SNA-agarose (see lanes 6 and 8); and only mature forms of the α (65 kDa) and β (110 kDa) subunits co-immunoprecipitated with γ subunits isolated with SNA-agarose precipitation (see lanes 10 and 12). Direct immunoprecipitation of α (lanes 5 and 9), β (lanes 1 and 11), or γ (lanes 3 and 7) from cell extracts before SNA-agarose precipitation indicated that both mature and immature forms of all three subunits were present in the initial cell extracts.Fig. 2Channel complexes containing mature subunits lack immature subunits. MDCK cells were transfected with either no DNA (C, control) or one of these cDNA combinations: (i) α(V5), β(HA), γ(myc) (lanes 1 and 2); (ii) α(V5), β(FLAG), γ(HA) (lanes 3 and 4); (iii) α(HA), β(V5), γ(myc) (lanes 5 and 6); (iv) α(myc), β(V5), γ(HA), (lanes 7 and 8); (v) α(HA), β(FLAG), γ(V5) (lanes 9 and 10); and (vi) α(myc), β(HA), γ(V5) (lanes 11 and 12). After 24 h, cell extracts were incubated with SNA lectin-conjugated agarose, and bound material was eluted with lactose. ENaC was immunoprecipitated (IP) either from extract before incubation with SNA-conjugated agarose (–) using anti-HA antibodies or from the SNA eluate (+) using anti-V5 antibodies, prior to immunoblotting (IB) with anti-HA antibodies.

However, it is unclear whether (i) ENaC N-linked glycan processing is dependent on the presence of cleaved α and γ, (ii) ENaC α and γ subunit cleavage is dependent on the presence of complex type N-linked glycans, or (iii) ENaC N-linked glycan processing and α and γ subunit cleavage are independent events. N-Glycan maturation occurs in the Golgi complex and trans-Golgi network, whereas ENaC proteolysis appears to be mediated by serine proteases, including furin and prostasin, which are present in post-Golgi compartments (5Thomas G.

Inhibition of α-mannosidase-1 prevents subsequent maturation of N-linked glycans. Whole cell and surface expression of ENaC subunits was examined in MDCK cells transiently expressing epitope-tagged ENaC subunits with and without overnight treatment with kifunensine (Fig. 3A). Cleavage of both the α and γ subunits was observed in both control and kifunensine-treated cells, indicating that α and γ subunit cleavage was not dependent on N-glycan processing. The mature (110 kDa) form of the β subunit was not seen in cells treated with kifunensine, consistent with a lack of processing of N-glycans, and thereby serving as an internal control. Furthermore, the mature α (65 kDa) and γ (75 kDa) subunits from kifunensine-treated cells migrated faster on SDS-gels, consistent with a lack of N-glycan processing. These faster migrating forms of the cleaved α and γ subunits were also completely sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), an enzyme that removes only high mannose type N-glycans from glycoproteins (data not shown).Fig. 3Subunit cleavage and N-glycan processing of ENaC are not interdependent. A, MDCK cells were transiently transfected with either α(HA), β(FLAG), γ(myc) for negative controls (mock); α(V5), β(FLAG), γ(myc) for immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunoblotting (IB) of α; α(HA), β(V5), γ(myc) for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of β or α(HA), β(FLAG), γ(V5) for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of γ. The inhibitor of ER α-mannosidase-1 kifunensine (KIF) was added to the media (+) or not (–) as indicated after transfection. After 24 h, immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were carried out with anti-V5 antibodies. B, MDCK cells were transiently transfected as described for A except that mutant V5-tagged subunits (αMUT and γMUT) lacking the sites for furin cleavage were analyzed. Samples were analyzed on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient SDS-gel in A and on a 7.5% polyacrylamide SDS-gel in B to enhance separation of uncleaved subunits with processed N-glycans.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Mutation of critical Arg (R) residues at consensus motifs for furin cleavage in the α and γ subunits prevented ENaC subunit cleavage when expressed in oocytes (triple mutant R205A, R208A, and R231A for α and R143A for γ) (4Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These mutations also prevented α and γ subunit cleavage when expressed in MDCK cells (Fig. 3B). In the absence of ENaC cleavage, bands migrating slightly slower than the immature α (95 kDa) and γ (93 kDa) subunits were observed, consistent with processing of N-glycans. These slower migrating forms of the α and γ subunits were not observed when cells were treated with kifunensine, suggesting that these slower migrating forms had processed N-glycans. Finally, these slower migrating bands were partially resistant to Endo H indicating that these non-cleaved forms contain complex type N-glycans (data not shown).DISCUSSIONWe have shown that two distinct pools of ENaC subunits are expressed at the plasma membrane: (i) mature subunits that have N-glycans processed to complex type and cleaved α and γ subunits and (ii) full-length subunits that have immature, high mannose type N-glycans (Fig. 1B) (4Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The processing of N-glycans on ENaC subunits was not dependent on cleavage of ENaC subunits, and proteolysis of ENaC subunits was not dependent on prior terminal processing of N-glycans (Fig. 3). Furthermore, our data demonstrate that there are distinct pools of heteroligomeric ENaC complexes at the plasma membrane: (i) channel complexes that contain only mature subunits and (ii) complexes that lack mature subunits (Fig. 2). Thus, biosynthetic processing of ENaC subunits within an individual channel complex, as determined by the processing of N-glycans and cleavage of the α and γ subunits, appears to be an all-or-none event.Integral membrane proteins expressed at the plasma membrane are synthesized in the ER where folding is completed and post-translational processing of N-glycans begins. Subsequent transit through the Golgi complex and post-Golgi compartments can result in further processing prior to delivery to the plasma membrane. This paradigm predicts that integral membrane proteins expressed at the plasma membrane will be subjected to processing by enzymes that are localized to either the Golgi complex or post-Golgi compartments during transit from the ER to the plasma membrane. Thus, it was surprising to find that a pool of ENaCs was expressed at the plasma membrane that appears to have bypassed key processing events known to occur in Golgi (N-glycan maturation) or post-Golgi (cleavage) compartments.There are several possible explanations for these findings. First, it is possible that one distinct population of channel complexes exiting the ER transits through Golgi and post-Golgi compartments where subunits are processed, whereas a second population of channels exiting the ER bypasses Golgi and post-Golgi compartments and are delivered directly to the plasma membrane with immature subunits. Previous studies suggest that several proteins, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (17Yoo J.S. Moyer B.D. Bannykh S. Yoo H.M. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11401-11409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), a membrane type-1 metallo-proteinase (18Deryugina E.I. Ratnikov B.I. Yu Q. Baciu P.C. Rozanov D.V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48339-48347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), traffic to the plasma membrane by non-conventional pathways that bypass the Golgi complex. A second possible explanation for our findings is that all ENaC subunits traffic to the plasma membrane via conventional pathways, but a population of channels is resistant to post-translational processing by enzymes present in Golgi and post-Golgi compartments.At present, there is no evidence for specific signals that direct channels exiting the ER to be processed in post-ER compartments or to escape post-ER processing. Perhaps some channels exiting the ER exhibit distinctive conformations, or different subunit stoichiometries, that dictate their fate regarding post-ER processing. In this regard, the results of several biophysical studies based on channel activity indicate that ENaC has a 2α/1β/1γ subunit stoichiometry (21Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K.

Other groups using combined biophysical and biochemical approaches have proposed a more complex subunit stoichiometry, raising the possibility that channels with different subunit compositions and/or stoichiometries exit the ER and perhaps have different fates (23Snyder P.M.

Therefore, we propose that the presence of two distinct pools of channels at the plasma membrane provides epithelial cells with a reserve pool of immature, poorly functional channels that can be activated by proteases in post-Golgi compartments.

These channels are composed of three structurally related subunits, termed α, β, and γ, that share a common structure, with two membrane-spanning domains separated by a large (∼450 residue) ectodomain and cytosolic amino and carboxyl termini. ENaC subunits are thought to assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they also undergo N-linked glycosylation (1Snyder P.M. McDonald"
https://openalex.org/W2145881880,"We have recently shown that stimulation of endothelial cells with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces dissociation of caveolin-1 from the VEGFR-2 receptor, followed by Src family kinase-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein (Labrecque, L., Royal, I., Surprenant, D. S., Patterson, C., Gingras, D., and Beliveau, R. (2003) Mol. Biol. Cell 14, 334-347). In this study, we provide evidence that the VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 induces interaction of the protein with the membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). This interaction requires the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 by members of the Src family of protein kinases, such as Src and Fyn, because it is completely abolished by expression of a catalytically inactive Src mutant or by site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine 14 of caveolin-1. Most interestingly, the association of MT1-MMP with phosphorylated caveolin-1 induced the recruitment of Src and a concomitant inhibition of the kinase activity of the enzyme, suggesting that this complex may be involved in the negative regulation of Src activity. The association of MT1-MMP with phosphorylated caveolin-1 occurs in caveolae membranes and involves the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP because it was markedly reduced by mutation of Cys574 and Val582 residues of the cytoplasmic tail of the enzyme. Most interestingly, the reduction of the interaction between MT1-MMP and caveolin-1 by using these mutants also decreases MT1-MMP-dependent cell locomotion. Overall these results indicate that MT1-MMP associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 and that this complex may play an important role in MT1-MMP regulation and function."

Severe HHCY patients exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations including atherosclerosis, thrombosis, mental retardation, ectopia lentis, osteoporosis, and skeletal abnormalities. These patients commonly develop hepatic steatosis (or fatty liver), which is characterized by enlarged, multinucleated hepatocytes containing microvesicular lipid droplets (2Gaull G. Sturman J.A.

As a loading control, ribosomal 18 S RNA was stained with ethidium bromide. Western Blot Analysis—Tissues were quickly removed from an 8-week-old C57BL/6 male, homogenized with a Teflon tissue grinder in ice-cold buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated with the Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Five micrograms of each tissue sample was solubilized in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (0.45 μm; Millipore). The mouse CBS protein was detected with an anti-rat CBS polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution), a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody, and the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Heterozygous CBS-deficient mice (CBS+/–) on the C57BL/6 background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and subsequently bred with C57BL/6 mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) in our institution. CBS+/– mice were bred to produce homozygous CBS–/– mice. Tail biopsies were done at 1 week of age, and polymerase chain reaction was performed for genotyping of the targeted Cbs allele (15Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick R. Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Wild-type (CBS+/+), heterozygous, and homozygous mice were used at 2–3 weeks of age. Age-matched mice were compared in each experiment. Tissues were quickly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. The tissues were homogenized with the Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica AG, Lucerne, Switzerland) in ice-cold phosphate buffer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The protein content of the supernatant was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Thiolase activity was measured as described previously (19Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was initiated by adding tissue samples to a reaction mixture containing 50 μm 3-oxooctanoyl-CoA, 0.15 mm CoA, 25 mm MgCl2,50mm KCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The decrease in absorbance at 303 nm was measured, and the enzyme activity was expressed by the absorbance units (AU)/min/g of protein. The 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity was measured as described previously (20Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 574: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was initiated by adding tissue samples to a reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.15 mm NADH, and 25 μm acetoacetyl-CoA. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured, and the enzyme activity was expressed by the AU/min/g of protein. Serum LCAT activity was determined using a commercial assay kit from Daiichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Lipids were extracted from tissue homogenates according to the established protocol of Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). One volume of methanol was added to the homogenates and mixed, and then two volumes of chloroform were added and mixed. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, the lower phase was collected, dried, and subjected to the measurement of lipid components. TG, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), total cholesterol (TC), and phospholipid (PL) were independently measured with commercial enzymatic assay kits according to the manufacturers' instructions (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). In our assay system, the detected PLs include choline-associated phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin, but not phosphatidylethanolamine. The measurement of serum lipid components was similarly performed without the lipid extraction steps. Serum HDL, cholesterol, and PL were measured after the removal of other lipoproteins by the precipitation with sodium phosphotungstate-magnesium, using a commercial kit (Wako Chemicals). Serum lipoproteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide disk gel electrophoresis using the Lipophor system (Jokoh, Tokyo, Japan). Serum samples were analyzed within 3 h after blood collection. Twenty-five microliters of serum was mixed with 200 μl of the loading buffer containing Sudan Black, and the lipoproteins were separated by polyacrylamide disk gel electrophoresis. Serum HDL was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described previously (agarose gel for the first dimension and polyacrylamide gel for the second dimension) (22Asztalos B.F. Sloop C.H. Wong L. Roheim P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The first dimensional electrophoresis was performed using the Titan Gel Lipoprotein (Helena Laboratories, TX). The second dimensional electrophoresis was performed using a 5–20% gradient native polyacrylamide gel. After the electrophoresis, the lipoproteins were transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with an anti-apoA-I antibody. ApoB100 and apoA-I levels were determined by the Western blot analysis. Serum samples were diluted (1:30) with SDS sample buffer. Liver was homogenized in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein contents of the samples were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, and the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Western blot analyses were performed with antibodies against mouse apoB100 and apoA-I (Santa Cruz). ApoA-I in HDL fractions was detected from samples prepared with sodium phosphotungstate-magnesium (Wako Chemicals). The electrophoresis was performed using 2–15% and 5–20% gradient gels for apoB100 and apoA-I, respectively. The apoB100 band intensity was quantified using NIH Image software. thiolase (both mitochondrial and peroxisomal) and lcat expression levels were determined by the Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from liver with TRIzol, and 5 μg of each RNA sample was separated by 6% formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by blotting to the Hybond-XL nylon membrane. Partial mouse cDNA sequences for peroxisomal thiolase, mitochondrial thiolase, and LCAT (nucleotides 1–627, 1–700, and 1–687, respectively), were used as specific cDNA probes. The cDNA probes were isolated from adult mouse liver cDNA by PCR amplification and labeled with digoxigenin using the DIG DNA labeling Mix (Roche Applied Science). The hybridization was performed at 50 °C for 16 h. Hybridized DNA probes were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science) and the ECL system. The expression levels of thiolase and lcat were normalized by the band intensities of ethidium bromide-stained ribosomal 18 S RNA. The average expression levels in the wild-type mice were expressed as 100%. LPL hydrolysis of VLDL was measured as described previously (23Ng D.S. Xie C. Maguire G.F. Zhu X. Ugwu F. Lam E.

Briefly, serum samples were incubated with purified bovine LPL (0.2 mg/ml) in 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 mm Tris (pH 8.5) and 0.1% Triton X-100. The samples were immediately placed on ice, and the NEFA contents were measured using the commercial enzymatic assay kit as described. The NEFA levels in samples without LPL addition represented the basal levels. HPLC analysis of serum lipoproteins was performed as described (25Usui S. Hara Y. Hosaki S. Okazaki M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Magoori K. Kang M.J. Ito M.R. Kakuuchi H. Ioka R.X. Kamataki A. Kim D.H. Asaba H. Iwasaki S. Takei Y.A. Sasaki M.

In brief, 100-μl samples of diluted serum were applied onto two columns of TSK gel Lipopropak XL connected in tandem. The conventional FPLC system cannot separate CM from VLDL, but, in contrast, this HPLC system provides higher resolution especially in the fraction range of large lipoproteins in which CM and VLDL fractions can be separated. Both TG and cholesterol levels in post-column effluents were measured with the enzymatic reactions as described above. Statistical analyses were performed by the Student's t test. The data presented are the means ± S.E. The p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Predominant Expression of the Cbs Transcript and CBS Protein in Mouse Liver—The tissue distribution of the Cbs mRNA and CBS protein was determined in the adult mouse. Total RNA was isolated from eight different tissues and analyzed by Northern blotting. A single 3-kb Cbs transcript was detected in brain, liver, and kidney, but not in heart, lung, thymus, spleen, or skeletal muscle (Fig. 1A). Expression of the CBS protein was examined in the same eight tissues by the Western blotting using an anti-CBS antibody. The mouse 61.5-kDa CBS protein was most highly expressed in liver followed by kidney (at one-third of the liver level). Faint CBS expression was detected in brain but not in any other tissues tested (Fig. 1B). CBS expression was not detected in CBS–/– tissues (liver, kidney, and brain) (data not shown). Altered Lipid Components and Thiolase Activity in CBS–/–Mouse Liver—Liver is the major locus for the Cbs/CBS expression (Fig. 1) and CBS–/– mice exhibit hepatic steatosis without any obvious phenotypic abnormality in the kidney and brain (15Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick R. Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) in which the Cbs/CBS is also expressed (Fig. 1). We measured several lipid contents (TG, NEFA, TC, and PL) by enzyme assays in CBS-deficient liver (Table I). The hepatic TG and NEFA levels were 11.4- and 3.1-fold greater, respectively, in CBS–/– mice than those in the wild-type mice. The hepatic TC levels were not significantly different among the CBS+/+, CBS+/–, and CBS–/– mice, although the PL levels in CBS–/– liver were significantly lower than those in CBS+/+ or CBS+/– liver. Accumulation of TG and NEFA in CBS–/– liver could result from the following three pathways: 1) increased lipid uptake, 2) impairment of lipid export, and 3) inhibition of β-oxidation. We measured the enzymatic activity of 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase, which is involved in the final step of β-oxidation of fatty acids in both mitochondria and peroxisomes and is a rate-limiting enzyme of β-oxidation. The hepatic thiolase activity in CBS–/– mice was significantly lower than that in the wild-type mice (42.8 ± 1.9 versus 75.3 ± 5.9 AU/min/g protein; p < 0.0002) (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined the expression of both peroxisomal and mitochondrial thiolase genes in liver. The expression of peroxisomal thiolase was significantly elevated in CBS–/– liver (139 ± 8% of the wild-type levels, p < 0.014) (Fig. 2B), whereas that of mitochondrial thiolase was not significantly different among the three genotypes (Fig. 2C). We have also measured hepatic enzymatic activity of 3-hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, another enzyme in β-oxidation. No significant differences were observed among the three genotypes (Fig. 2D).Table IThe levels of TG, NEFA, TC, and PL in liverCBS genotypes+/+ (n = 8)+/- (n = 8)-/- (n = 7)TG (mg/g protein)734 ± 52637 ± 508,382 ± 846ap < 0.0001.NEFA (mEq/g protein)3.04 ± 0.282.60 ± 0.419.47 ± 1.7bp < 0.002.TC (mg/g protein)147 ± 12153 ± 11142 ± 25PL (mg/g protein)1007 ± 37968 ± 36684 ± 103cp < 0.02.a p < 0.0001.b p < 0.002.c p < 0.02. Open table in a new tab Altered Lipid and Lipoprotein Components in CBS–/–Mouse Serum—Lipid components in serum were determined (Table II). Serum TG and NEFA levels were significantly higher in CBS–/– mice than those in wild-type mice, whereas TC levels were not significantly different (Table II), as observed in liver (Table I). Serum NEFA levels were also significantly higher in CBS+/– mice than those in the wild-type mice. In contrast, serum PL levels were not significantly different among the three genotypes.Table IIThe levels of TG, NEFA, TC, and PL in serumCBS genotypes+/+ (n = 7)+/- (n = 10)-/- (n = 7)TG (mg/ml)5.52 ± 0.908.63 ± 2.5017.95 ± 5.00ap < 0.04.NEFA (μEq/l)459 ± 40622 ± 30bp < 0.004.830 ± 60cp < 0.0005.TC (mg/ml)10.8 ± 0.59.9 ± 0.511.9 ± 1.1PL (mg/ml)21.2 ± 1.818.5 ± 2.024.8 ± 3.2a p < 0.04.b p < 0.004.c p < 0.0005. Open table in a new tab We further examined serum apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) levels. ApoB100 is an unusually large (∼550 kDa) secretory protein and is the major component of VLDL and low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Liver is a major locus for apoB100 expression and a site where apoB100 assembles endogenous lipids to form TG-rich lipoproteins such as VLDL (27Davis R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Serum apoB100 levels were measured by Western blotting using an anti-apoB100 antibody. Serum apoB100 protein levels were much higher in CBS–/– mice than those in the wild-type or CBS+/– mice (Fig. 3A). This observation suggests that serum VLDL and/or LDL levels are much higher in CBS–/– mice than those in the wild-type or CBS+/– mice. To confirm the above observation, we analyzed the distribution of serum lipoproteins by polyacrylamide disk gel electrophoresis. In this system, lipoproteins were stained with Sudan Black and then separated by gel electrophoresis with mobility that depends on their particle sizes. CBS–/– mouse serum contained more VLDL particles and less HDL particles than the wild-type or CBS+/– mouse serum, whereas serum LDL levels were comparable among the three genotypes (Fig. 3B). This finding suggests that the increased serum apoB100 may be a reflection of the increased serum VLDL (not LDL) in CBS–/– mice. To examine whether VLDL secretion from liver is enhanced, hepatic apoB100 levels were analyzed by Western blotting. CBS–/– mouse liver contained less apoB protein than the wild-type or CBS+/– mouse liver (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the VLDL secretion from the liver into serum is down-regulated in CBS–/– mice. Next, we examined whether serum lipoproteins (VLDL and CM) in CBS–/– mice are metabolized by LPL as those in wild-type mice. Because LPL catalyzes the conversion of TG in VLDL (or CM) to NEFA, purified bovine LPL was added to serum samples, and NEFA production during 10-min incubation was measured. Although the basal NEFA levels in CBS–/– serum lipoproteins were comparable with (or rather higher than) those in wild-type or CBS+/– samples, the NEFA levels produced by exogenously added LPL in CBS–/– samples was much less than those in samples from either wild-type or CBS+/– mice (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that VLDL and CM in CBS–/– mouse serum could be inefficient substrates for endogenous LPL, which may cause abnormal accumulation of TG in both VLDL and CM. Altered HDL Components and LCAT Activity in CBS–/– Serum—Because serum HDL levels were decreased in CBS–/– mice (Fig. 3B), the lipid components of HDL (cholesterol and PL) were investigated in serum. HDL fractions were prepared from serum, and cholesterol and PL levels in the HDL fractions were measured. Although both total cholesterol and PL levels in serum were similar among the three genotypes, those in serum HDL fractions were significantly different; the amounts of cholesterol and PL in HDL from CBS–/– mice were lower than those in HDL from wild-type or CBS+/– mice (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). LCAT is an enzyme that is primarily synthesized in liver and is involved in HDL maturation; it catalyzes the trans-acylation of fatty acids from phosphatidylcholine to cholesterol and thus produces esterified cholesterol-rich HDL (28Cheung M.C. Wolf A.C. Lum K.D. Tollefson J.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 1135-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Francone O.L. Gurakar A. Fielding C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the gene expression and the enzymatic activity of LCAT in CBS-deficient mice. The hepatic lcat gene expression levels and LCAT activity in serum were significantly decreased in CBS–/–mice (64 and 11% of the wild-type levels, respectively) (Fig. 5). Although the lcat gene expression in CBS+/– liver was similar to that in the wild-type liver (Fig. 5A), the serum LCAT activity reduced in CBS+/– mice (∼75% of the wild-type level) (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the impaired LCAT enzyme activity (rather than the decreased lcat expression) may underlie the decreased serum HDL-cholesterol in CBS–/– mice. We measured free cholesterol (nonesterified cholesterol) levels in serum, because LCAT activity is correlated with serum esterified cholesterol level (30Sakai N. Vaisman B.L. Koch C.A. Hoyt Jr., R.F.

Because insulin stimulates carbohydrate and lipid synthesis, it would be important to decipher how the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c is regulated in the insulin signaling pathway. In this study, we demonstrated that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. GSK3 inhibitors enhanced a transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c and expression of ADD1/SREBP1c target genes including fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and steroyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) in adipocytes and hepatocytes. In contrast, overexpression of GSK3β down-regulated the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. GSK3 inhibitor-mediated ADD1/SREBP1c target gene activation did not require de novo protein synthesis, implying that GSK3 might affect transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c at the level of post-translational modification. Additionally, we demonstrated that GSK3 efficiently phosphorylated ADD1/SREBP1c in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, these data suggest that GSK3 inactivation is crucial to confer stimulated transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c for insulin-dependent gene expression, which would coordinate lipid and glucose metabolism.

Unlike other kinases, GSK3 is constitutively active in resting cells and is inhibited by several growth factors or hormones, such as Wnt ligands, insulin, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (1Shaw M.

Also, GSK3 plays an important role in the insulin signaling pathway and it phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase in the absence of insulin (10Parker P.J. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In insulin-sensitive tissues, insulin-derived GSK3 inactivation is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt), which phosphorylate at the N-terminal serine residue of GSK3 (serine 21 and serine 9 in GSK3α and -3β, respectively) (5Sutherland C.

Thus, recent reports suggest a potential role for GSK3 as a negative regulator of insulin signaling (13Orena S.J. Torchia A.J. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15765-15772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, one of the GSK3 inhibitors, lithium chloride (LiCl), shows insulin-like effects including increase of glucose uptake, activation of glycogen synthase, and stimulation of glycogen synthesis in various tissues (13Orena S.J.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibition of GSK3 alters gene expression profiles in insulin-responsive cell lines. For example, LiCl selectively reduces expressions of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase genes, whose expression is also inhibited by insulin (16Lochhead P.A. Coghlan M. Rice S.Q. Sutherland C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GSK3 can phosphorylate several transcription factors, including p53, HSF-1, and C/EBPα and regulate their transcriptional activities (17Turenne G.A.

In insulin-sensitive tissues including fat, liver, and muscle, insulin stimulates the expression of ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA and its target genes via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PKB/Akt (26Matsumoto M.

Therefore, it has been suggested that ADD1/SREBP1c plays a key role in orchestrating insulin-dependent lipid and glucose metabolism (22Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G.

Furthermore, several groups have investigated the post-translational modifications of ADD1/SREBP1c that affect its transcriptional activity. Brown and Goldstein (31Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

In addition, Kotzka et al. (35Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Koponen A. Njamen D. Kremer L. Roth G. Munck M. Knebel B. Krone W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that ADD1/SREBP1c is phosphorylated at the N-terminal end of the protein through the MAP kinase pathway, and such phosphorylation of ADD1/SREBP1c stimulates its transcriptional activity (35Kotzka J. Muller-Wieland D. Koponen A. Njamen D. Kremer L. Roth G. Munck M. Knebel B. Krone W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase pathway, did not antagonize the effect of insulin on the expression of ADD1/SREBP1c target genes in cultured hepatocytes (28Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 36Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 351: 621-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the MAP kinase pathway might not be a major player for ADD1/SREBP1c target gene expression by insulin treatment. Given the importance of GSK3 as a negative regulator of insulin signaling and ADD1/SREBP1c as a mediator of insulin-responsive gene expression, it would be important to understand the molecular mechanism between inhibition of GSK3 and increase of ADD1/SREBP1c transcriptional activity by insulin. To address this question, we examined the roles of GSK3 on the regulation of transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. Here, we demonstrate that GSK3 inhibitors enhance the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c and promote the expression of ADD1/SREBP1c target genes without de novo protein synthesis. Additionally, we reveal a phosphorylation event of ADD1/SREBP1c by GSK3. Taken together, these results propose a novel regulatory role of GSK3 in the insulin-dependent activation of ADD1/SREBP1c in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Reagents and Antibodies—LiCl and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma and SB-216763 was purchased from Tocris. GSK3 antibody was purchased from BD Sciences. Polyclonal antibody against ADD1/SREBP1c was previously described (21Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vector for GSK3β was thankfully provided from Dr. Junichi Sadoshima (New Jersey Medical School) (38Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (JBI, Daegu, Korea). At confluence, differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was induced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm), dexamethasone (1 μm), and insulin (5 μg/ml) for 48 h. Culture medium was changed every other day with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin. HEK293 and Rat1-IR cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, and cultured at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator. FAO cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented 10% fetal bovine serum, and HepG2 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—HEK293 cells and HepG2 hepatocytes were transfected with several DNA constructs 1 day before confluence by the calcium phosphate method described previously (22Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 39Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D.

The mammalian expression vector for ADD1/SREBP1c contains 1–403 amino acids, which was engineered by in-frame fusion with the Myc His tag derived from pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). After being starved with low glucose DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 12 h, cells were treated with LiCl, NaCl, or insulin and incubated for 24 h. Total cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100), and the activities of β-galactosidase and luciferase were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Rat1-IR cells were transfected with the same method as described earlier (22Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 39Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-five μg of each RNA were denatured in formamide and formaldehyde buffer, and separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). After cross-linking, membranes were hybridized and washed as described by the manufacturer's instructions. DNA probes were labeled by random priming using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (MBI Fermentas) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNAs used as probes were: FAS, ACC1, SCD1, ADD1/SREBP1c, and 36B4. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System for the reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Invitrogen) was used for cDNA synthesis with 1 μg of total RNA. cDNAs for ADD1/SREBP1c and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were amplified for 30 and 27 cycles, respectively, which are not saturating stages. Reverse transcriptase-PCR products were separated by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by UVP BioImaging Systems (UVP). Primers used in this study are as followings: ADD1/SREBP1c up, 5′-ATCGGCGCGGAAGCTGTCG-3′, ADD1/SREBP1c down, 5′-ACTGTCTTGGTTGTTGATGAG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase up, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase down, 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′. Protein Kinase Assay—Recombinant GSK3β proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal GST tag from the pGEX-4T-1 vector and purified with glutathionine-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Biosciences). Insect cell-expressed GSK3β was kindly provided by Crystalgenomics (Daejun, Korea). Protein kinase reaction samples were incubated at 30 °C in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm cold ATP, 0.33 μm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and each substrate, and stopped by addition of 5% phosphoric acid for peptide substrate or SDS sampling buffer for recombinant ADD1/SREBP1c proteins. Substrates were 100 μm phospho-eIF2B peptide (Peptron, Daejun, Korea) or His-tagged recombinant ADD1/SREBP1c proteins purified from E. coli. The amino acid sequence of phospho-eIF2B was RRAAEELDSRAGpSPQL (pS denoted phosphoserine) and was characterized previously (40Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After incubation, phosphopeptides were spotted on P-81 chromatography paper (Whatman), and washed twice with 0.5% phosphoric acid. After drying, counts/min were measured. Phosphorylated ADD1/SREBP1c proteins were loaded onto SDS-PAGE and visualized with autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Assay of Protein Kinases (IP Kinase Assay)—Equal amounts of total cell extract were incubated with GSKβ antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The immunoprecipitates collected with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) were pelleted and washed twice with 1 ml of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 100 mm NaCl). Activity of immunoprecipitated GSK3 complexes were determined by counting counts/min or autoradiography as mentioned previously. Orthophosphate Labeling—HEK293 cells transfected with ADD1/SREBP1c expression vector were starved in low glucose DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. After changing the culture medium to phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen), [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.) was added and cells were incubated for 2 h. After incubation, LiCl (10 mm, 1 h), SB-216763 (10 μm, 1 h), or insulin (100 nm, 30 min) were treated and total cell lysates were extracted with NETN buffer. Radiolabeled ADD1/SREBP1c proteins were obtained by immunoprecipitation with anti-ADD1/SREBP1c antibody. The precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel) and subjected to autoradiography. Lithium Chloride Stimulates the Transcriptional Activity of ADD1/SREBP1c and Its Target Gene Expression—To investigate whether the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c is regulated by GSK3, LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3, was used in luciferase reporter assays. Previous studies revealed that LiCl inhibits GSK3 activity with an IC50 of 2.5 mm and a 90% loss of GSK3 activity is observed with 32 mm LiCl treatment (41Ryves W.J. Harwood A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). FAS is one of the best characterized target genes of ADD1/SREBP1c and its promoter region contains the binding sites for ADD1/SREBP1c (22Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 42Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Yoshikawa T. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Sato R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 10619-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, LiCl stimulated the FAS promoter activity in the presence of ADD1/SREBP1c in a dose-dependent manner. However, it had no influence on the basal promoter activity in the absence of ADD1/SREBP1c in HEK293 cells. When 20 mm sodium chloride (NaCl) was treated, we did not observe any changes in promoter activity, suggesting that transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c is specifically modulated by LiCl. Similar results were obtained in Rat1-IR cells that express insulin receptor (Fig. 1B). Next, to investigate the alteration of target gene expression of ADD1/SREBP1c by GSK3, we performed a Northern blot analysis using insulin-responsive cells, such as differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and FAO hepatocytes in the absence or presence of GSK3 inhibitor. Consistent with the results from reporter assays, LiCl treatment remarkably increased the mRNA expression of ADD1/SREBP1c target genes, such as FAS, ACC1, and SCD1 (Fig. 2, A and B). However, LiCl had little effect on the expression level of nuclear SREBP1 protein (Fig. 2C). Together, these observations indicate that inhibition of GSK3 clearly stimulates transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c and enhances its target gene expression in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Inhibition of GSK3 by SB-216763 Stimulates ADD1/SREBP1c Target Gene Expression—Because LiCl has several targets other than GSK3, such as the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway via inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (44Zhen X. Torres C. Friedman E. Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2002; 162: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we performed similar experiments using a selective GSK3 inhibitor, SB-216763 (45Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Chem.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, SB-216763 evidently enhanced FAS mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, similar to LiCl. The nuclear form of the SREBP1 protein was not significantly changed by SB-216763 treatment (Fig. 3C). To clarify whether SB-216763 efficiently inhibits GSK3 kinase activity, IP kinase assays were conducted. After HepG2 cells were treated with or without GSK3 inhibitors, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with GSK3 antibody. Then, immune complexes were incubated with phospho-eIF2B peptide, one of the well known substrates of GSK3 (40Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 47Jefferson L.S. Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and GSK3 kinase activities were measured. The kinase activity of GSK3 was decreased (about 50% reduction) by LiCl or SB-216763 treatment at concentrations of 10 mm or 10 μm, respectively (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4). These observations implicate that LiCl- or SB-216763-stimulated target gene expression of ADD1/SREBP1c is closely associated with the inhibition of GSK3 kinase activity. Overexpression of GSK3β Inhibits Transcriptional Activity of ADD1/SREBP1c—To confirm the effect of GSK3 on the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c, we investigated the effects of GSK3β overexpression. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that overexpression of GSK3β decreased the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we examined the effect of ADD1/SREBP1c target gene expression in the absence or presence of GSK3β overexpression. As shown in Fig. 4B, ectopic expression of GSK3β in HepG2 cells concomitantly inhibited FAS mRNA levels, whereas SB-216763 treatment reversed GSK3β-mediated down-regulation of FAS mRNA expression. These results suggest that GSK3β plays a negative regulator for ADD1/SREBP1c. LiCl- and SB-216763-induced Target Gene Expression of ADD1/SREBP1c Does Not Require de Novo Protein Synthesis— Although it has been demonstrated that an increase of ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA expression is important for insulin-stimulated gene expression (30Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 48Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), GSK3 inhibitors shows little effect on the mRNA level of ADD1/SREBP1c and protein level of nuclear SREBP1 (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus we hypothesized that the changes of the ADD1/SREBP1c target gene expression with GSK3 inhibitors can occur at the level of post-translational modification such as phosphorylation. To test the above idea, cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis (49Chesnokov V.N. Mertvetsov N.P. Biokhimiya. 1990; 55: 1276-1278PubMed Google Scholar), was treated in the absence or presence of LiCl or SB-216763. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, cyclohexamide did not alter the induction of FAS mRNA expression by LiCl or SB-216763 treatment. These results suggest that GSK3-mediated regulation of the ADD1/SREBP1c transcriptional activity does not require additional protein synthesis, and that modulation of ADD1/SREBP1c transcriptional activity by GSK3 is presumably accomplished by post-translational modification of ADD1/SREBP1c. Lithium Chloride Does Not Completely Mimic Insulin-stimulated Gene Expression—It has been reported that LiCl mimics insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism including an increase of glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake and regulates several hepatic gluconeogenic gene expressions, including glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (16Lochhead P.A. Coghlan M. Rice S.Q. Sutherland C. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, it has not been clearly understood whether LiCl sufficiently mediates insulin-dependent gene expression. To clarify the idea whether LiCl is able to substitute for insulin action in regulation of several gene expression, we performed a luciferase reporter assay in Rat1-IR cells in the presence or absence of LiCl and/or insulin. Treatment of insulin or LiCl stimulated the transactivation of FAS promoter by ADD1/SREBP1c (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 6), and simultaneous treatment of LiCl and insulin showed additive effects (Fig. 6A, lane 8). Likewise, cotreatment of LiCl and insulin increased FAS mRNA expression on 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 6B). But LiCl had minor effects on the expression level of ADD1/SREBP1c, whereas insulin dramatically stimulated ADD1/SREBP1c expression (Fig. 6C). Together, these results implicate that LiCl does not completely mimic insulin effects, at least, for the activation of ADD1/SREBP1c, suggesting that LiCl and insulin might have cooperative effects to stimulate ADD1/SREBP1c activity. GSK3β Phosphorylates ADD1/SREBP1c in Vitro and in Vivo—Because inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl or SB-216763 increased the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c without de novo protein synthesis, we decided to examine whether GSK3 is directly able to phosphorylate ADD1/SREBP1c protein. GSK3 has two isoforms, GSK3α and -β share 98% homology in their catalytic domain and have similar substrate specificity (50Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 51Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Because GSK3β is highly expressed in adipocytes and hepatocytes, we used GSK3β in the following experiments. To test the possibility that ADD1/SREBP1c is a novel substrate of GSK3β, we purified recombinant GSK3β proteins from E. coli or insect cells. When in vitro kinase assays were conducted with recombinant GSK3β proteins from E. coli, ADD1/SREBP1c was strongly phosphorylated as well as GSK3β itself, implying that ADD1/SREBP1c is a putative substrate of GSK3β, at least, in vitro (Fig. 7A). We obtained the same results using GSK3β proteins purified from insect cells (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, to validate the effect of purified recombinant GSK3β protein, we examined whether the kinase activity of recombinant GSK3β is directly inhibited by LiCl or SB-216763. Treatment of LiCl caused a significant reduction of kinase activity of GSK3β, whereas treatment of SB-216763 completely abolished the kinase activity of GSK3β in vitro (Fig. 7C). Next, to test whether GSK3β phosphorylates ADD1/SREBP1c in vivo, endogeneous GSK3β was obtained by IP, and IP kinase assays were carried out with ADD1/SREBP1c as substrate. As shown in Fig. 7D, ADD1/SREBP1c was clearly phosphorylated by endogenous GSK3β in both HepG2 hepatocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, implying that ADD1/SREBP1c is a novel substrate for GSK3. In addition, we performed in vivo orthophosphate labeling in the absence or presence of LiCl or insulin. Consistent with the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 7), the basal phosphorylation level of ADD1/SREBP1c protein was decreased by LiCl and SB-216763 treatment (Fig. 8A). Previously, it has been reported that insulin might induce serine phosphorylation of ADD1/SREBP1c (22Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). We also observed that total phosphorylation of ADD1/SREBP1c was moderately increased by insulin (Fig. 8B, lane 3), and insulin treatment partially rescued LiCl-mediated reduction (Fig. 8B, lane 5), implying that GSK3 might phosphorylate ADD1/SREBP1c in resting status. Thus, it appears that GSK3 and other kinase(s) would be involved in the regulatory phosphorylation of ADD1/SREBP1c to mediate insulin-dependent gene expression. ADD1/SREBP1c is a member of key transcription factors that regulate genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. Three isoforms of the SREBP family have been identified in several mammalian species. SREBP-1a and ADD1/SREBP1c are generated by using alternative promoters from a single gene. SREBP-2 is derived from a different gene with 47% similarity to SREBP-1 (52Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). Among the three SREBP isoforms, the transcript level of ADD1/SREBP1c is sensitively controlled by insulin and nutritional status, which are associated with lipid and glucose metabolism (30Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 48Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). As a major anabolic hormone, insulin enhances the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c at the level of its own transcription and post-translational modifications (22Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M.

With this regulatory mechanism, ADD1/SREBP1c induces expression of several lipogenic genes, which leads to fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis and regulates expression of several genes involved in glucose metabolism (28Azzout-Marniche D.

Indeed, ADD1/SREBP1c-specifc knockout mice reveal not only a severe decrease of hepatic and plasma triglyceride with reduced fat mass but also elevation of plasma glucose levels (56Liang G. Yang J.

Several lines of recent evidence indicate that GSK3 is involved in insulin resistance, which is defined as the status where peripheral tissues cannot respond to insulin and is closely associated with obesity and type II diabetes. Inhibition of GSK3 improves insulin resistance not only by an increase of glucose disposal rate in Zucker diabetic rats but also by inhibition of gluconeogenic genes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase in hepatocytes (16Lochhead P.A.

Furthermore, selective GSK3 inhibitors potentiate insulin-dependent activation of glucose transport and utilization in muscle in vitro and in vivo (58Ring D.B. Johnson K.W. Henriksen E.J. Nuss J.M. Goff D. Kinnick T.R. Ma S.T. Reeder J.W. Samuels I. Slabiak T. Wagman A.S. Hammond M.E. Harrison S.D. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). GSK3 also directly phosphorylates serine/threonine residues of insulin receptor substrate-1, which leads to impairment of insulin signaling (59Greene M.W. Garofalo R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7082-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 60Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a novel role of GSK3 in the regulation of ADD1/SREBP1c transcriptional activity. Treatment of GSK3 inhibitors remarkably enhanced the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c and stimulated the expression of its target genes such as FAS, SCD1, and ACC1, which are known to be key players for fatty acid metabolism as well as insulin-sensitive genes, in adipocytes and hepatocytes (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Accordingly, we observed that the levels of ADD1/SREBP1c target gene expression by GSK3 inhibitors were similar to those by insulin (Fig. 6), implicating that stimulation of ADD1/SREBP1c by insulin appears to be mediated, at least partly, by GSK3 inhibition. We also observed that insulin augmented the effects of the GSK3 inhibitor on the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. In addition to the role of GSK3 in insulin signaling, these results might provide a clue to explain why expression of several lipogenic genes is reduced in fat tissues of insulin-resistant animals (61Lan H. Rabaglia M.E. Stoehr J.P. Nadler S.T. Schueler K.L. Zou F. Yandell B.S. Attie A.D. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Compared with lean mice, the levels of GSK3 and its enzyme activity are elevated in fat tissues or skeletal muscles of obese and diabetic mice models (62Eldar-Finkelman H. Schreyer S.A. Shinohara M.M. LeBoeuf R.C. Krebs E.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 63Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Mudaliar S. Mohideen P. Carter L. Henry R.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), proposing that an increase of GSK3 might be associated with abnormal energy metabolism by disrupting insulin action. Under these circumstances, it appears that transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c might be repressed by increased GSK3 activity, leading to the reduced expression of lipogenic genes in fat tissues of obese and diabetic mice. Previously, Roth et al. (64Roth G. Kotzka J. Kremer L. Lehr S. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33302-33307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MAP kinase phosphorylates SREBP-1a at serine 117 in vitro and mutation of this serine residue to alanine abolishes responsiveness of SREBP-1a to insulin and platelet-derived growth factor. However, the same for ADD1/SREBP1c was not confirmed and inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathway did not inhibit insulin-stimulated ADD1/SREBP1c target gene expression (28Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 36Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 351: 621-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rather, we suggest that ADD1/SREBP1c can be phosphorylated by GSK3, which is a downstream kinase of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the insulin signaling pathway. With in vitro and in vivo assays, we showed that GSK3 is able to phosphorylate ADD1/SREBP1c (Fig. 7), and the basal level of ADD1/SREBP1c phosphorylation was drastically decreased by the GSK3 inhibitor (Fig. 8), clearly indicating that GSK3 might induce negative phosphorylation of ADD1/SREBP1c in resting cells. Additionally, we observed that GSK3 was colocalized with the mature form of ADD1/SREBP1c in the nucleus (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that inactivation of GSK3 might be an important regulatory step that stimulates the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. To identify the phosphorylation residue(s) of ADD1/SREBP1c by GSK3β, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis. As a result, we observed that ADD1/SREBP1c was predominantly phosphorylated at serine residues (Supplemental Materials Fig. 1). Furthermore, by using different truncated ADD1/SREBP1c recombinant proteins, we observed that the N-terminal end of ADD1/SREBP1c was phosphorylated by GSK3β (Supplemental Materials Fig. 2). Although we identified at least six putative target sites of GSK3β in the N-terminal portion of the ADD1/SREBP1c protein, the exact site(s) of phosphorylation has not been identified yet. We are currently investigating the phosphorylation site(s) of ADD1/SREBP1c by GSK3β and the functional roles of those sites in regulating the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c. Taken together, these data suggest that GSK3 plays a role in regulating the activity of ADD1/SREBP1c and that insulin-mediated induction of ADD1/SREBP1c target gene expression might be associated with the regulation of GSK3. Consistent with this view, inhibitors of GSK3, both LiCl and SB-216763, stimulate ADD1/SREBP1c target gene expression by altering its transcriptional activity. Therefore, GSK3 appears to negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of ADD1/SREBP1c by phosphorylating ADD1/SREBP1c and this repression process is probably relieved when GSK3 is suppressed in the presence of the insulin signaling pathway.

We have now demonstrated that PC1 can activate the calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) signaling pathway through Gαq -mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC). Transient transfection of HEK293T cells with an NFAT promoter-luciferase reporter demonstrated that membrane-targeted PC1 constructs containing the membrane proximal region of the C-terminal tail, which includes the heterotrimeric G protein binding and activation domain, can stimulate NFAT luciferase activity. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β by LiCl treatment further increased PC1-mediated NFAT activity. PC1-mediated activation of NFAT was completely inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A. Cotransfection of a construct expressing the Gαq subunit augmented PC1-mediated NFAT activity, whereas the inhibitors of PLC (U73122) and the inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors (xestospongin and 2-aminophenylborate) and a nonspecific Ca2+ channel blocker (gadolinium) diminished PC1-mediated NFAT activity. PC2 was not able to activate NFAT. An NFAT-green fluorescent protein nuclear localization assay demonstrated that PC1 constructs containing the C-tail only or the entire 11-transmembrane spanning region plus C-tail induced NFAT-green fluorescent protein nuclear translocation. NFAT expression was demonstrated in the M-1 mouse cortical collecting duct cell line and in embryonic and adult mouse kidneys by reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunolocalization. These data suggest a model in which PC1 signaling leads to a sustained elevation of intracellular Ca2+ mediated by PC1 activation of Gαq followed by PLC activation, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry, thus activating calcineurin and NFAT.

Transient intracellular Ca2+ increases are associated with cellular functions such as muscle contraction, synaptic transmission, or neuroendocrine secretion. In contrast, sustained Ca2+ signals are known to affect transcriptional events leading to adaptive cellular changes and to changes in cell proliferation and cell differentiation (43Berridge M.J.

Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 10: 671-676PubMed Google Scholar). A cellular target for sustained increases in Ca2+ is calcineurin, a ubiquitous serine-threonine phosphatase (48Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). An important intracellular substrate for calcineurin is NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) (49Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). In its inactive hyperphosphorylated form, NFAT is sequestered in the cytosol. Signals causing sustained Ca2+ increases result in calcineurin activation, dephosphorylation of NFAT, and translocation of NFAT to the nucleus where it regulates target genes, often at composite NFAT/AP-1 elements (49Rao A.

Activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling has been shown to regulate cell differentiation, apoptosis, and cellular adaptation in a wide variety of cell types and tissues (55Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and to regulate the non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway during embryonic development (56Saneyoshi T. Kume S. Amasaki Y. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 2002; 417: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In attempting to identify a connection between polycystin function and Ca2+ signaling, we determined that PC1 is able to activate a pathway that leads to calcineurin activation and translocation of dephosphorylated NFAT to the nucleus. The activation of NFAT by PC1 suggests that polycystin-1 may function to integrate Ca2+ signals at NFAT target genes. Cell Lines and DNA Constructs—HEK293T cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5% glucose and l-glutamine supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin.

The pRL-null construct was from Promega. NFAT Luciferase Assay—HEK293T cells were plated at a density of ∼7.5 × 105 cells/well of a six-well plastic plate in DMEM plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. 24 h after plating, the cells were transiently transfected with the Ca2+ phosphate precipitation method (61Maser R.L. Magenheimer B.S. Zien C.A. Calvet J.P. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 86: 205-217PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 3 μg of plasmid DNA was used to transfect each well, which contained 50–500 ng of PC1 DNA or control construct, 100 ng of the ARRE-2 NFAT/AP-1 promoter-reporter construct (firefly luciferase), 1.5–5 ng of Renilla luciferase-null, pBlueScript as filler DNA, and, where indicated, 50 ng of EE-tagged Gαq. 6 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM and the cultures were incubated for an additional 20 h. Inhibitors were added 4 h before harvesting. The cells were then lysed in Passive lysis buffer (Promega), and 20 μl of cell lysate was used with the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) using an EG&G Berthold 9507 Luminometer. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA using GraphPad software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Western Blot Analysis—HEK293T cell lysates were boiled in the presence of 2× sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Western blotting was performed using anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) and anti-PC1 C-terminal peptide (antibody A19) (62Sutters M. Yamaguchi T. Maser R.L. Magenheimer B.S. St John P.L.

Secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were used to detect the immobilized antibodies by chemiluminescence with CDP-Star substrate (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+—HEK293T cells were plated at ∼5 × 104 cells/well/six-well plate on type I collagen-coated glass coverslips 24 h prior to co-transfection with 450 ng of PC1-LT or sIg-0 and 22.5 ng of a cytomegalovirus-enhanced GFP construct (per 3 wells) (Invitrogen) to identify transfected cells plus 9 μg of pBlueScript DNA. 4 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with DMEM plus 0.5% heat-inactivated serum and the cultures were incubated for an additional 20 h. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Teflabs) in DMEM/F12 equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% air for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were rinsed with a HCO3-Ringer's solution containing 2 mm CaCl2, and the coverslips were mounted in a thermally controlled chamber on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a monochromator. The chamber was continuously perfused with Ringer's solution equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Transfected cells were identified by viewing GFP fluorescence with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter set (490-nm excitation and 535-nm emission). Base-line Fura-2 measurements were made with dual excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. The measurement of emitted light at 510 nm was restricted to GFP-expressing cells using an adjustable iris in front of a digital photomultiplier detection system (Photon Technology International). Felix 32 analysis software (Photon Technology International) controlled the monochromator and data acquisition to generate the 340/380 fluorescence ratio (F340/F380). After a steady state (F340/F380) was established, 10 mm caffeine was added to release Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive stores. At the end of each experiment, cells were permeabilized with 2 μm ionomycin in Ringer's solution containing 2 mm Ca2+ to determine the maximum (F340/F380) ratio (Rmax) and then 10 mm EGTA was added to determine the minimum ratio (Rmin). Background correction for the glass coverslips and GFP fluorescence was measured in several cells expressing GFP at the same intensity and was subtracted from the experimental values. F340/F380 ratios were converted to [Ca2+] using the equation [Ca2+] = Kd × ((R – Rmin)/Rmax – R)) × (Sf380/Sb380), where the dissociation constant (Kd) of Fura-2 for Ca2+ is 224 nm, Rmax and Rmin are F340/F380 ratios for Ca2+-saturating and Ca2+-free conditions, and Sf380 and Sb380 are fluorescence signals at 380 nm for free Ca2+ and bound Ca2+, respectively (63Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2016688796,"SV2 proteins are abundant synaptic vesicle proteins expressed in two major (SV2A and SV2B) and one minor (SV2C) isoform. SV2A and SV2B have been shown to be involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Previous studies found that SV2A, but not SV2B, can interact with the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin 1, a Ca2+ sensor for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. To determine whether SV2B can interact with full-length synaptotagmin 1, we performed immunoprecipitations from brain protein extracts and found that SV2B interacts strongly with synaptotagmin 1 in a detergent-resistant, Ca2+ -independent manner. In contrast, an interaction between native SV2A and synaptotagmin 1 was not detectable under these conditions. The SV2B-synaptotagmin 1 complex also contained the synaptic t-SNARE proteins, syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25, suggesting that SV2B may participate in exocytosis by modulating the interaction of synaptotagmin 1 with t-SNARE proteins. Analysis of retinae in SV2B knock-out mice revealed a strong reduction in the level of synaptotagmin 1 in rod photoreceptor synapses, which are unique in that they express only the SV2B isoform. In contrast, other synaptic vesicle proteins were not affected by SV2B knock out, indicating a specific role for SV2B in the regulation of synaptotagmin 1 levels at certain synapses. These experiments suggest that the SV2B-synaptotagmin 1 complex is involved in the regulation of synaptotagmin 1 stability and/or trafficking. This study has demonstrated a new role of SV2B as a regulator of synaptotagmin 1 that is likely mediated by direct interaction of these two synaptic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2114446978,"Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in endothelial cells is impaired in diabetes. We previously showed that impaired NO synthesis in the spontaneously diabetic BB (BBd) rat is due to decreased levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), secondary to decreased expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH). The aim of this study was to utilize adenoviral GTPCH gene transfer to reverse BH4 deficiency and repair the ability of endothelial cells to produce NO. GTPCH gene transfer increased BH4 levels in BBd endothelial cells from 0.17 +/- 0.02 (mean +/-SE) to 73.37 +/- 14.42 pmol/million cells and NO production from 0.77 +/- 0.07 to 18.74 +/- 5.52 nmol/24 h/million cells. To demonstrate a functional effect of increasing BH4 concentrations in tissues, we transferred GTPCH into aortic rings from BBd and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, models of human type I and type II diabetes, respectively. GTPCH gene transfer led to a dose-dependent increase in acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation, preventable by inhibiting NO synthase. Maximal relaxation of virus-treated rings (10(10) virus particles/ml) to acetylcholine was significantly higher than sham-treated rings (BBd 64% vs. 37%, P<0.005; ZDF 80% vs. 44%, P<0.05). This study demonstrates that GTPCH gene transfer can reverse BH4 deficiency in both type I and type II diabetes and provides an experimental basis for using gene therapy to treat cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2058127668,"Megakaryopoiesis is the process by which hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow differentiate into mature megakaryocytes. The expression of megakaryocytic genes during megakaryopoiesis is controlled by specific transcription factors. Fli-1 and GATA-1 transcription factors are required for development of megakaryocytes and promoter analysis has defined in vitro functional binding sites for these factors in several megakaryocytic genes, including GPIIb, GPIX, and C-MPL. Herein, we utilize chromatin immunoprecipitation to examine the presence of Ets-1, Fli-1, and GATA-1 on these promoters in vivo. Fli-1 and Ets-1 occupy the promoters of GPIIb, GPIX, and C-MPL genes in both Meg-01 and CMK11-5 cells. Whereas GPIIb is expressed in both Meg-01 and CMK11-5 cells, GPIX and C-MPL are only expressed in the more differentiated CMK11–5 cells. Thus, in vivo occupancy by an Ets factor is not sufficient to promote transcription of some megakaryocytic genes. GATA-1 and Fli-1 are both expressed in CMK11-5 cells and co-occupy the GPIX and C-MPL promoters. Transcription of all three megakaryocytic genes is correlated with the presence of acetylated histone H3 and phosphorylated RNA polymerase II on their promoters. We also show that exogenous expression of GATA-1 in Meg-01 cells leads to the expression of endogenous c-mpl and gpIX mRNA. Whereas GPIIb, GPIX, and C-MPL are direct target genes for Fli-1, both Fli-1 and GATA-1 are required for formation of an active transcriptional complex on the C-MPL and GPIX promoters in vivo.

Overexpression of Fli-1 in transgenic mice results in death from progressive immunological renal disease associated with an increased number of autoreactive T- and B-lymphocytes (23Zhang L. Eddy A.

The possible role of Fli-1 in autoimmunity is further supported by our observation of elevated expression of Fli-1 mRNA in lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (24Georgiou P.

Viral integration and insertional activation of Fli-1 is associated with hematological cancers, including erythroleukemia by Friend-MuLV (28Ben-David Y. Giddens E.B. Letwin K. Bernstein A.

To clarify the physiological role of Fli-1 in hematopoiesis, we (32Spyropoulos D.D. Pharr P.N. Lavenburg K.R. Jackers P. Papas T.S. Ogawa M. Watson D.K. Mol. Cell.

GATA-1 is a Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger DNA-binding protein that recognizes and binds the sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) in the cis-regulatory elements of many lineage-restricted genes (46Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). GATA-1 is expressed in erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells and has been shown to be essential for maturation of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells (46Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 47Fujiwara Y. Browne C.P. Cunniff K. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12355-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Absence of GATA-1 expression is associated with the accumulation of early megakaryocytic progenitors that fail to mature (46Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Over 200 Ets target genes have been identified by the presence of functional EBS (5Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), based upon transient transfection studies. However, few of these have been characterized on chromatin templates in vivo. To better understand how Ets and GATA-1 proteins regulate the transcription of megakaryocytic target genes, we examined the in vivo binding of Fli-1, Ets-1, and GATA-1 proteins to the endogenous GPIIb, GPIX, and C-MPL promoters. The differential expression of these genes in megakaryocytic cell lines allowed us to correlate Ets factor occupancy, histone acetylation status, and/or presence of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II with transcription from these promoters. Co-expression of GATA-1 and Fli-1 is critical for expression of endogenous C-MPL and GPIX genes. We also demonstrate for the first time that simultaneous in vivo promoter occupancy by these factors is directly correlated with the transcriptional status of specific megakaryocytic genes. Megakaryocytic Cell Lines—Meg-01 cells (48Ogura M. Morishima Y. Ohno R. Kato Y. Hirabayashi N. Nagura H. Saito H.

These two cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 media plus 10% fetal bovine serum, according to the ATCC protocol for Meg-01 cells. Briefly, cells were subcultured by dilution into fresh media at a split ratio of 1:2 to 1:3, 2 to 3 times weekly and maintained between 1 × 105 and 5 × 105 cells/ml. For Meg-01 cells, adherent cells (less than 10% of the population) were scraped into the media prior to subculture. All cell lines were propagated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Antibodies—Anti-Fli-1 (C19), anti-Ets-1 (C20), and anti-GATA-1 (N6) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-acetylated H3 (06–599) and anti-phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II (clone CTD4H8) antibodies were obtained from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). β-Actin antibody was obtained from Sigma. The specificity of the Ets-1, Fli-1, and GATA-1 antibodies was confirmed by the absence of nonspecific bands on Western blots of cells extracts.

Orientation and sequence were verified by analysis on an ABI 373 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gel electrophoresis of RNA and transfer to nylon membrane (Duralon-UV membrane, Stratagene) was performed according to Sambrook et al. (56Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Prehybridization and hybridization were performed at 65 °C with QuikHyb Hybridization Solution (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Membranes were washed once at room temperature in 2× SSPE, 0.2% SDS for 15 min, once at room temperature in 1× SSPE, 0.2% SDS for 15 min, and then twice at 55 °C in 0.2× SSPE, 0.2% SDS for 30 min.

Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min and quantitated using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For Western analysis, protein extracts (20 μg) were separated on a 12.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-Fli-1 (C19) and Ets-1 (C20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using a 1:1000 dilution for both antibodies, anti-GATA-1 (N6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using a 1:2000 dilution. After several washes with TBST, membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) using a 1:2000 dilution. Immunocomplexes were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce). Membranes were stripped (0.2 n NaOH) at room temperature for 5 min and re-probed with a β-actin antibody (Sigma; 1:10,000 dilution) to assess equivalent loading. ChIP Assays—ChIP assays were adapted from Boyd and Farnham (58Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells (107) were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and the reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 200 mm. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of ChIP cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 μl protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma). Nuclei were obtained by centrifugation at 3,500 × g and lysed in ChIP nuclei lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 50 μl of protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma). DNA was sheared by sonication to yield an average fragment size of 500 bp and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were stored at –70 °C. For immunoprecipitation, supernatants were diluted 5-fold in IP buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, protease inhibitors) and pre-cleared with 80 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry (equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml preimmune IgG) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min, specific antibodies (10 μg) were added to the supernatants. Immunocomplexes were formed overnight at 4 °C and collected with 60 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (equilibrated as above, except no IgG was added) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed for 5 min on ice in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS), buffer B (buffer A with 500 mm NaCl), buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), buffer D (buffer C with 500 mm LiCl) and twice in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). Immunocomplexes were eluted off the beads with 150 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 and cross-links were reversed by incubation for 4 h at 65 °C after addition of NaCl to the final concentration of 0.3 m. Proteins were digested with proteinase K (40 μg/ml) for 1 h at 50 °C. DNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Of the total yield of 30 μl of PCR template, 4 μl was used in each PCR using AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Gene-specific primer sequences and predicted amplicon sizes are summarized in Table I. In all experiments, the specificity of the ChIP reaction was monitored by PCR utilizing primers derived from the coding region of the C-MPL gene. Sequential ChIP Assays—After primary immunoprecipitation, the cross-linked immunocomplexes were eluted from the beads by incubation in elution buffer at room temperature, and the eluate then diluted 1:10 in IP buffer, followed by re-immunoprecipitation with the second antibody. All the subsequent steps were carried out as described above. DNA Transfection and Selection of Stable Clones—Meg-01 cells were transfected with pSGNeo GATA-1 or pSGNeo control vector using the FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 16 h, and G418 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm to allow selection of clones with stable expression. After 3 weeks, pools of selected cells were used for RNA isolation. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from pools of transfected Meg-01 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed in first strand synthesis buffer according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). 14 ng of the cDNA products were used as template in subsequent PCR using the primers and conditions listed in Table I. The products were electrophoretically separated on a 1.5% agarose gel. After ethidium bromide staining of the molecular weight marker, the gel was used for Southern blotting and hybridization.

https://openalex.org/W2017229649,"Rad51 and Rad54 proteins play a key role in homologous recombination in eukaryotes. Recently, we reported that Ca2+ is required in vitro for human Rad51 protein to form an active nucleoprotein filament that is important for the search of homologous DNA and for DNA strand exchange, two critical steps of homologous recombination. Here we find that Ca2+ is also required for hRad54 protein to effectively stimulate DNA strand exchange activity of hRad51 protein. This finding identifies Ca2+ as a universal cofactor of DNA strand exchange promoted by mammalian homologous recombination proteins in vitro. We further investigated the hRad54-dependent stimulation of DNA strand exchange. The mechanism of stimulation appeared to include specific interaction of hRad54 protein with the hRad51 nucleoprotein filament. Our results show that hRad54 protein significantly stimulates homology-independent coaggregation of dsDNA with the filament, which represents an essential step of the search for homologous DNA. The results obtained indicate that hRad54 protein serves as a dsDNA gateway for the hRad51-ssDNA filament, promoting binding and an ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation of dsDNA during the search for homologous sequences.

Calcium and Double-stranded Break RepairJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 50PreviewDouble-stranded breaks in DNA can be lethal if left unrepaired. Fortunately, cells have evolved several mechanisms, including one known as homologous recombination, to ensure the repair of these breaks. In homologous recombination, the undamaged sister chromatid is used as a template for repair. After an initial break is detected, the broken double-stranded DNA is processed to generate a single-stranded region with a 3′ overhang. Rad51 polymerizes onto the single-stranded DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament.

Its major function in the cell is to repair DNA double-stranded breaks, the most lethal type of DNA damage, and to promote correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis (3West S.C.

The process of HR involves enzymatic processing of the broken dsDNA into resected DNA heteroduplex with a protruding 3′-ssDNA tail (4Haber J.E.

Following resection, a homologous DNA pairing protein, Rad51/RecA, is loaded onto the ssDNA to form a contiguous helical nucleoprotein filament (8Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front.

Cell. 1997; 89: 163-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The DNA joint molecule formed as a result of strand exchange can be used to prime DNA synthesis on a homologous DNA template, restoring the structure of the damaged DNA. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in addition to Rad51 protein, several other proteins, members of the Rad52 epistasis group, are important for DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (12Game J.C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Massey P. Banerjee R. Berg P. Mol. Cell.

Res. 2000; 451: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rad54 protein belongs to the Swi2/Snf2 class of DNA-binding proteins that participate in the remodeling (assembly/disassembly) of chromatin complexes (14Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T.

Like most members of the Swi2/Snf2 class, Rad54 protein, both yeast and human, possesses dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity (16Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P.

Rad54 protein topologically modifies DNA structure, introducing transient positive and negative supercoils into covalently closed circular DNA (21Tan T.L. Essers J. Citterio E.

In vitro, yeast Rad54 protein strongly stimulates the DNA strand exchange activity of yRad51 protein (16Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P.

The interaction between yRad51 and yRad54 proteins appears to be synergistic; reciprocally, the yRad51-ssDNA filament enhances dsDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, dsDNA unwinding (23Mazin A.V.

Also, it was found that yRad54 protein forms a specific and stoichiometric co-complex with the yRad51-ssDNA filament and significantly stabilizes it (23Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A.

In addition, it was reported that yRad54 protein stimulates DNA branch migration mediated by yRad51 protein and facilitates the removal of yRad51 protein from the DNA heteroduplex product (27Solinger J.A.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1175-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The biochemical activities of human Rad54 protein, including its dsDNA-dependent ATPase and dsDNA-unwinding and interactions with hRad51 protein, have been discovered and characterized previously (17Swagemakers S.M. Essers J. de Wit J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Tan T.L. Essers J. Citterio E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4106-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, studies on the functions of hRad54 protein in DNA strand exchange promoted by hRad51 protein have only started to emerge (31Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar). The reason for this lag is that the reaction conditions which support the activities of both hRad51 and hRad54 proteins have not been readily identified. Recently, we discovered that in the presence of Mg2+, a traditional in vitro cofactor, hRad51 protein behaves as a self-inactivating ATPase; by hydrolyzing ATP the hRad51-ATP-ssDNA filament rapidly converts into an inactive hRad51-ADP-ssDNA form (32Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We further found that Ca2+ helps to preserve the filament in an active ATP-bound form by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis by hRad51 protein. As a consequence, DNA strand exchange activity of hRad51 protein is greatly stimulated by Ca2+. Here we tested the effect of Ca2+ on DNA strand exchange promoted by the hRad51 nucleoprotein filament in the presence of hRad54 protein. In the presence of Ca2+, hRad54 protein stimulates DNA strand exchange much greater than under standard conditions. The observed effect of Ca2+ on DNA strand exchange promoted by hRad51 and hRad54 proteins may have physiological relevance, since cellular concentration of Ca2+, a ubiquitous cellular regulator in vertebrates (33Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar), is elevated in response to DNA damage and during meiosis I, when homologous recombination takes place (34Spielberg H. June C.H.

High activities of both hRad51 and hRad54 proteins in the presence of Ca2+ allowed us to study the interactions between these two key human HR proteins in detail and to clarify the function of hRad54 protein in DNA strand exchange. Proteins and DNA—Yeast Rad54 and Rad51 proteins, human Dmc1, and Rad51 and RPA proteins were purified as described (41Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol.

Sf21 cells (density 1 × 106) were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses at multiplicity of infection of 5 and after 48 h of incubation were collected by centrifugation (1500 × g) and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7. 4), containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm NaHPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4. The cell pellet was frozen and stored at –80 °C. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells (10 g) were lysed by incubation in ten volumes of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min with a constant stirring. The crude extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100, 000 × g for 60 min) (Fraction I) and loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (20 ml) equilibrated with T20 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), containing 200 mm KCl. The Q-Sepharose column flow-through (Fraction II) was collected and the KCl concentration was increased to 500 mm. This fraction was loaded on a glutathione-Sepharose column (10 ml) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 mm KCl and washed with T20 buffer containing 500 mm KCl. hRad54 protein was eluted with T50 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 20 mm glutathione. The fraction containing hRad54 protein (Fraction III) was concentrated to 1 ml volume in a dialysis bag that was placed on solid polyethylene glycol (Mr 20,000) and further fractionated in a Superdex-200 column (58 ml), equilibrated with buffer K20 (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 500 mm KCl. The fraction containing hRad54 protein (Fraction IV) was diluted with 4 volumes of K20 and loaded on a Resource-S column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer K20 containing 100 mm KCl. The hRad54 protein was eluted with a 20-ml gradient of KCl (100 mm to 1 m) in buffer K20. The hRad54 protein fraction (Fraction V) was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm KCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 30% glycerol). The total yield of hRad54 protein was 2.7 mg. The protein contained no contaminating nuclease activities and appeared nearly homogeneous in Coomassie stained SDS-Polyacrylamide gels. To produce hRad54 K189R protein, the mutation in the hRAD54 gene was generated using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The gene was sequenced to ensure that no mutation other than this intended had been introduced. The hRad54 K189R mutant protein was expressed and purified as described for the wild type hRad54 protein. Spectrophotometric ATP Hydrolysis Assay—The hydrolysis of ATP by Rad54 protein was monitored spectrophotometrically as described (46Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The oxidation of NADH, coupled to ADP phosphorylation, resulted in a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, which was continuously monitored by a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer using UV-visible ChemStation software. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the rate of change in absorbance using the following formula: rate of A340 decrease (s–1) × 9880 = rate of ATP hydrolysis (μm/min) (46Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The reactions in standard buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase (20 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (20 units/ml), and NADH (200 μg/ml), and the indicated amounts of DNA and hRad54 protein were carried out at 30 °C. Prior to initiation of ATP hydrolysis by addition of hRad54 protein, the reactions were preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min. To examine the effect of hRad51-ssDNA filament on the ATPase activity of hRad54, hRad51 protein (800 nm) was incubated with ssDNA (#71, 94-mer; 2.4 μm) at 37 °C for 10 min and then at 30 °C for 5 min in standard buffer prior to addition of hRad54 (20 nm). Kinetic parameters of the ATPase reactions were determined using GraphPad Prism software version 4.0. ATPase Assay Using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)—The hRad54 protein (80 nm) was incubated with pUC19 supercoiled dsDNA (62 μm) and 1 mm ATP, 20 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.9 mm MgCl2, and 0.75 mm CaCl2 at 30 °C. To examine the effect of the hRad51-ssDNA filament on the ATPase activity of hRad54, Rad51 protein (800 nm) was incubated with ssDNA (#71, 94-mer; 2.4 μm) at 37 °C for 10 min and then at 30 °C for 5 min in the same buffer prior to addition of hRad54 (80 nm). The level of ATP hydrolysis was determined using TLC on PEI-cellulose plates in running buffer containing 1 m formic acid and 0.3 m LiCl. The products of ATP hydrolysis were quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). D-loop Formation—The nucleoprotein filaments were formed by incubating of hRad51 protein with 32P-labeled ssDNA (#90, 90-mer) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1mm DTT, 20 mm KCl (added with the protein stock), 0.9 mm MgCl2 (or indicated otherwise), CaCl2 (in the indicated concentrations), and the ATP regenerating system (30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 20 mm phosphocreatine) for 10 min at 37 °C (or as indicated otherwise). Then hRad54 was added to the filaments followed by addition of pUC19 dsDNA (62 μm nucleotide or 11.6 nm molecules) to initiate joint molecule (D-loops) formation. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn, and joint molecules were deproteinized by treatment with 25 mm EDTA, 1.2% SDS, and proteinase K (880 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C; mixed with a 0.10 volume of loading buffer (70% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue); and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose-TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) gels. The gels were dried on DE81 chromatography paper and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The yield was expressed as percentage of the total plasmid DNA. The yeast Rad51-ssDNA filaments were formed by incubating yRad51 protein (2.0 μm) with 32P-labeled ssDNA (#90, 90-mer; 6.0 μm) in buffer containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, and the ATP regenerating system (30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 20 mm phosphocreatine) for 15 min at 30 °C, followed by addition of yRad54 or hRad54 (200 nm). Joint molecule formation was initiated by addition of supercoiled pUC19 dsDNA (130 μm) and was carried out at 30 °C. The products were analyzed as described above. Assay for Coaggregation of DNA—This assay measures homology-independent conjunction of the hRad51-ssDNA filaments with dsDNA in complexes that sediment at more than 10,000 S (Svedberg) (2 min at 15,000 × g) (47Tsang S.S. Chow S.A. Radding C.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3226-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). hRad51 protein was incubated with ssDNA in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm KCl (added with the protein stocks), NaCl (in the indicated concentrations), 0.9 mm MgCl2, CaCl2 (in the indicated concentrations), and the ATP regenerating system (30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 20 mm phosphocreatine) for 15 min at 37 °C. When required, the indicated amounts of hRad54 protein were added to the filaments. Coaggregation was initiated by addition of 32P-labeled pUC19 dsDNA, linearized by BamHI restriction endonuclease, and carried out for 5 min at 37 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn from the reaction mixture and coaggregates were collected by centrifugation in 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 21 °C. The yield of coaggregates was determined using a radioactive counter (Beckman LS 6500). Residual retention of the radioactive DNA on the tube walls, ∼2–3%, was subtracted from the measurements. hRad54 Protein Efficiently Stimulates DNA Strand Exchange Activity of hRad51 Protein in the Presence of Ca2+— Using the D-loop assay we tested the stimulatory effect of hRad54 on DNA pairing promoted by hRad51 protein. In accord with previously published data (31Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar), we observed that in the presence of Mg2+ at 30 °C stimulation of joint molecule formation was transient and the yield of joint molecules was low (Fig. 1, A and B). We then tested whether this stimulation can be enhanced in the presence of Ca2+, which increases DNA pairing activity of hRad51 protein (32Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Indeed, when we incorporated 0.5 mm CaCl2 into the reaction mixture, we observed a dramatic 12-fold increase of joint molecule formation in the presence of hRad54 protein, whereas the activity of hRad51 alone was still low at 30 °C (Fig. 1, C and D). We repeated this experiment at 37 °C, a temperature optimal for hRad51 protein. We found that at 37 °C, hRad54 protein also strongly stimulated hRad51 protein, ∼3-fold (Fig. 2A, squares and circles). Similar to yeast Rad54 protein, the ATPase activity of hRad54 protein is essential for stimulation of joint molecule formation; little or no stimulation was observed with the ATPase-deficient mutant of hRad54 protein, hRad54 K189R (Fig. 2A, triangles). Compared with yeast Rad54 protein (48Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43578-43587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), hRad54 protein appears to be sufficiently stable at 37 °C; after 5 min of preincubation at 37 °C in the presence of the hRad51-ssDNA filament, hRad54 protein maintained 98% of its ATPase activity (Fig. 2B). Therefore, D-loop formation, a rapid reaction completed in 2–5 min, was not significantly affected by thermal denaturation of hRad54 protein. Therefore, we used 37 °C temperature for joint molecule formation in all experiments described below.Fig. 2Stimulation of joint molecule formation by hRad54 nucleoprotein requires ATP hydrolysis and efficiently occurs at 37 °C. A, the hRad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments were formed at 37 °C in standard buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2. Then hRad54 storage buffer (circles) or hRad54 protein (120 nm), the wild type (squares) or the K189R mutant (triangles), were added to the filaments. Joint molecule formation was initiated by addition of pUC19 dsDNA and carried out for the indicated periods of time. B, hRad54 protein (20 nm) was incubated with the hRad51-ssDNA filament in standard buffer for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C, then the reaction mixtures were transferred to 30 °C, and ATP hydrolysis was initiated by addition of dsDNA (6 μm). The ATP hydrolysis rate of Rad54 protein was monitored using a spectrophotometric assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We determined the effect of Ca2+ concentration on joint molecule formation promoted by hRad51 protein alone or in the presence of hRad54 protein. hRad54 protein lowered the Ca2+ concentration required for the maximal DNA pairing activity (Fig. 3A). The stimulatory effect of hRad54 protein was especially strong at Ca2+ concentrations lower than 1 mm. At higher than 1 mm Ca2+, both the ATPase activity of hRad54 protein and its stimulatory effect on hRad51 DNA pairing declined (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating further the important role of the hRad54 protein ATPase activity for stimulation of DNA strand exchange. Thus, our current results together with the previously published data (32Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) demonstrate that Ca2+ is important for both DNA strand exchange activity of hRad51 protein and for stimulation of this activity by hRad54 protein. hRad54 Protein Stimul"

The interaction is enhanced by the RecA C terminus and by significant concentrations of free Mg2+ ion. The interaction is also enhanced by an N-terminal His6 tag on the RecX protein. We conclude that RecX protein interacts most effectively with a RecA functional state designated Ao and that the RecA C terminus has a role in modulating the interaction.

Homologous recombinational repair of damaged DNA mediated by the bacterial RecA protein is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the genome (1Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J.

In vitro, the RecA protein promotes a series of DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions that are thought to mimic the function of this protein in vivo (6Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev.

RecA functions as a nucleoprotein filament. Filaments are assembled most readily on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA.1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. However, filament assembly on duplex DNA (dsDNA) can also be achieved under some conditions, especially if a suitable nucleation site is available. RecA is a DNA-dependent ATPase, promoting ATP hydrolysis with a kcat of about 30 or 20 min–1 when bound to ssDNA or dsDNA, respectively. RecA filaments assemble and disassemble in the 5′ to 3′ direction on ssDNA, with protomers added to one end and subtracted from the other under appropriate conditions (6Lusetti S.L. Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 71-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The activities of RecA protein must be regulated in the cell to target RecA to locations where it is needed and to avoid aberrant DNA transactions. The same must be true of all RecA homologs. In humans, aberrant recombination reactions could include the gross chromosomal rearrangements that lead to many human diseases, including cancer (8Yu V.P. Koehler M. Steinlein C. Schmid M. Hanakahi L.A. van Gool A.J. West S.C. Venkitaraman A.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1400-1406PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which RecA family recombinases are regulated is of utmost importance. RecA itself provides one level of control. This involves autoregulation mediated by the RecA C terminus (9Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, many additional proteins are known to regulate RecA function. The RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins have been implicated in the modulation of RecA filament assembly and disassembly (10Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol.

The RecX protein is among the least understood of these RecA modulator proteins. Recently, evidence has been obtained that RecX protein acts to cap the growing end of a RecA filament (20Drees J.C.

The RecX protein (19.3 kDa) is encoded by a widespread bacterial gene, often but not always found as it is in E. coli, just downstream of the recA gene (21De Mot R. Schoofs G. Vanderleyden J.

DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The resulting hairpin interrupts transcriptional read-through and limits the amount of recA-recX transcript to about 5–10% of the levels of the recA transcript alone. Protein levels of RecX were estimated to be 500 times less than those of the RecA protein (27Pages V. Koffel-Schwartz N. Fuchs R.P.

These data suggest that the effects of RecX protein might involve an interaction with the C terminus of RecA. In addition, RecA protein has several defined functional states that could affect the RecX-RecA interaction. When bound to ssDNA, RecA is in a functional state designated A (active). There are two forms of the A state (9Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Haruta N. Yu X.N.

One of these, present at low Mg2+ concentrations, is relatively restricted in terms of allowed DNA pairing reactions (called Ac, with the c reflecting a “closed” state). The other is present at higher Mg2+ concentrations and is unrestricted in DNA pairing (the open or Ao form). Addition of another strand of bound DNA to the RecA filament, either when RecA is bound to dsDNA or during DNA strand exchange, causes a transition to a state designated P (pairing) (7Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1986; 261: 8276-8282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of ssDNA and dsDNA were determined by absorbance at 260 nm, using 36 and 50 μg ml–1A260–1, respectively, as conversion factors. All DNA concentrations are given in micromolar nucleotides. Cloning and Overexpressing the RecX Protein—The recX gene was isolated from the E. coli genome (strain MG1655, a gift from George Weinstock, Ref. 40Guyer M.S. Reed R.R. Steitz J.A. Low K.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1981; 45: 135-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction. One DNA primer corresponded to the first 19 bases of the recX gene with the sequence 5′-CACCGTTC added to the 5′-end to provide a BspHI restriction site. The second DNA primer corresponded to the last 8 bases of the recX gene with the sequence 5′-CGGGATCCCCGTATGCGT added to the 5′-end to provide a BamHI restriction site. These primers were used to amplify a DNA fragment of the appropriate size (529 bp) by the polymerase chain reaction. The recX gene fragment was digested with BspHI and BamHI and then ligated into the cloning vector pET21d (Novagen), which was digested with NcoI and BamHI (the NcoI and BspHI restriction sites have compatible cohesive ends). This plasmid containing the native recX gene under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter was designated pEAW224. The integrity of the entire recX gene in this construct was verified by direct sequencing. Competent cells of E. coli strain STL327/pT7pol26 (35Lusetti S.L. Wood E.A. Fleming C.D. Modica M.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were transformed with plasmid pEAW224. Ten liters of culture were grown in LB broth to an OD600 of 0.7. RecX protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm. Following a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, ∼19 g of cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. The protein expressed is the native polypeptide, with no protein tags or other additions present. Purification of the RecX Protein—All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell paste (19 g) was thawed and fully resuspended in 95 ml of a solution of 25% (w/v) sucrose and 250 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5). Cells were lysed by a 60-min incubation with 37 ml of 5 mg/ml solution of lysozyme in 250 mm Tris-HCl (80% cation, pH 7.5), followed by the addition of 52 ml of 25 mm EDTA, sonication, and centrifugation. The lysate was precipitated with 16 ml of 5% (w/v) polyethyleneimine, pH 7.5, and centrifuged. The pellet was extracted two times with R buffer plus 150 mm ammonium sulfate. The extracted protein solution was precipitated by the addition of 0.144 g of solid ammonium sulfate per ml of solution. The RecX protein was precipitated from the supernatant fraction after centrifugation with an additional 0.227 g of solid ammonium sulfate per ml of solution. The resulting pellet was washed two times with R buffer plus 2.9 m ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 200 ml of 500 mm phosphate buffer. The protein solution was dialyzed against 2 liters of 320 mm phosphate buffer, then two times against 2 liters of 220 mm phosphate buffer. The protein solution was then loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column, washed with two column volumes of 220 mm phosphate buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient from 220 to 700 mm phosphate buffer over 8 column volumes. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and dialyzed two times against 220 mm phosphate buffer. The protein was then loaded over the same hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 220 mm phosphate buffer, washed with two column volumes of 220 mm phosphate buffer, and eluted with a wash of 270 mm phosphate buffer. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, pooled, and concentrated with a Centricon Plus-20, 10,000 molecular mass cut-off concentrator (Amicon). The concentrated protein was dialyzed against R buffer plus 300 mm potassium chloride or potassium glutamate, 30% (w/v) glycerol, then twice against RecX storage buffer (R buffer, 100 mm KCl or KGlu, 50% (w/v) glycerol). The protein was flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C. The concentration of the RecX protein was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient 2.57 × 104m–1 cm–1. The RecX extinction coefficient (ϵnat, 280 nm = 2.57 × 104± 0.027 m–1 cm–1) was determined during the course of the present work, using procedures described elsewhere (42Marrione P.E. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9809-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10973-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The A280/A260 ratio for the native RecX is 1.59 ± 0.031. The error in both numbers is 1 S.D. The protein was free of detectable nuclease activities and was determined to be greater than 99% pure by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight ass spectrometry. The measured mass of the protein was 19,274, in good agreement with the calculated mass of RecX protein of 19,294 (with the initiator Met residue removed). The RecX protein with a His6 N-terminal tag, used in one experiment, was generously provided by Elizabeth Stohl and Hank Seifert (Northwestern University). The purification of this protein has been described (19Stohl E.A. Brockman J.P. Burkle K.L. Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Seifert H.S. J. Biol.

Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the course of these studies we noted that the native RecX protein was relatively unstable. RecX protein preparations stored at –80 °C exhibit a measurable loss of activity after four or more months of storage (data not shown). When thawed aliquots of the purified native RecX protein were kept at 4 °C for several days, its inhibitory effects declined (Fig. 2). For this reason, all of the experiments in this study made use of RecX aliquots thawed on the day of the experiment. Further, all native RecX protein, stored at –80 °C, was used within 12 weeks of its purification. ATPase Assay—A coupled spectrophotometric enzyme assay (44Lindsley J.E. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9043-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was used to measure the DNA-dependent ATPase activities of the wild-type RecA and RecAΔC17 proteins. The regeneration of ATP from PEP and ADP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH and followed by the decrease in absorbance of NADH at 380 nm (380-nm wavelength was used so that the signal remained within the linear range of the spectrophotometer for the duration of the experiment). The assays were carried out on a Varian Cary 300 dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and a 12-position cell changer. The cell path length and band pass were 0.5 cm and 2 nm, respectively. The NADH extinction coefficient at 380 nm of 1.21 mm–1 cm–1 was used to calculate the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation, pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 3 mm potassium glutamate, the indicated concentration of Mg(OAc)2, 5% (w/v) glycerol, an ATP regeneration system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate), a coupling system (3 mm NADH and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase), and 5 μm M13mp8 circular single-stranded DNA. The aforementioned components were incubated for 10 min. The figure legends note the time of addition of wild-type RecA or RecA mutant proteins (3 μm), the RecX protein (concentration indicated in the figure legends), the SSB protein (to 0.5 μm), and ATP (to 3 mm). DNA Three Strand Exchange Reactions Promoted by the Wild-type RecA and RecAΔC17 Proteins—Three strand exchange reactions were carried out in 25 mm Tris-OAc (80% cation, pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm potassium glutamate, and the concentration of Mg(OAc)2 indicated in the figure legend. An ATP regeneration system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate) was also included. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C. The following are final concentrations. The wild-type RecA or RecA mutant protein (6.7 μm) and the indicated concentration of RecX protein were preincubated with 20 μm ϕX174 circular ssDNA for 10 min. SSB protein (2 μm) and ATP (3 mm) were then added, followed by another 10-min of incubation. The reactions were initiated by the addition of ϕX174 linear dsDNA to 20 μm. The reactions were incubated for 90 min. To stop the reaction, a 10-μl aliquot was removed and added to 5 μl of a solution containing 15% Ficoll, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 72 mm EDTA, and 4% SDS. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels with TAE buffer, stained with ethidium bromide, and exposed to ultraviolet light. Gel images were captured with a digital CCD camera utilizing GelExpert software (Nucleotech). When indicated, the intensity of DNA bands was quantitated with the software package TotalLab version 1.10 from Phoretix. The RecX Protein Inhibits the Circular ssDNA-dependent ATPase Activity of the RecA Protein—The RecA protein hydrolyzes ATP when bound to DNA and the rate of ATP hydrolysis generally correlates well to the amount of RecA bound to the DNA (46Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 479-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We previously showed that when RecX protein was added to RecA filaments assembled on circular ssDNA, a slow decline in ATP hydrolysis was observed that reflected a net end-dependent disassembly of the filaments (20Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and occurred over a time span of 15–20 min. Analysis of this effect led to the conclusion that RecX regulated the extension of RecA filaments, capping the growing end (the 3′-proximal end) (20Drees J.C. Lusetti S.L. Chitteni-Pattu S. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we wished to examine the effects of Mg2+ and the RecA C terminus on the inhibitory effects of RecX. These factors are of interest since both of them modulate the functional state of RecA filaments in vitro (9Lusetti S.L. Shaw J.J. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16381-16388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the effects of the RecX protein on the rate of the circular ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity of the wild-type RecA and RecAΔC17 proteins, at two different Mg2+ concentrations. The RecA and RecX proteins were added at the same time in all experiments in this study, preincubated with the DNA for 10 min prior to the addition of ATP and SSB. Fig. 3 shows the amount of ATP hydrolyzed by the wild-type (Fig. 3A) or the RecAΔC17 (Fig. 3B) protein over time as a function of RecX concentration. At lower concentrations of RecX protein, the wild-type RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis reaction is quite robust initially, suggesting that RecA filaments have been able to form. In the presence of 20–60 nm RecX protein, there is then a slow decline in the rate of ATP hydrolysis, indicating a relatively slow effect of RecX on the activity of the RecA filament. A significant inhibitory effect is obtained by the addition of 10 nm RecX protein. The addition of 80 nm RecX brings about almost complete inhibition i"
https://openalex.org/W2052713251,"Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas. Merlin, the neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor protein, is related to the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins and, like its family members, is thought to play a role in plasma membrane-cytoskeletal interactions. We report a novel protein as a merlin-specific binding partner that we have named magicin (merlin and Grb2 interacting cytoskeletal protein) and show that the two proteins interact in vitro and in vivo as well as colocalize beneath the plasma membrane. Magicin is a 24 kDa protein that is expressed in many cell lines and tissues. Magicin, similar to merlin, associates with the actin cytoskeleton as determined by cofractionation, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Analysis of the magicin sequence reveals binding motifs for the adaptor protein Grb2. Employing affinity binding, blot overlay and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrate an interaction between Grb2 and magicin. In addition, merlin is capable of forming a ternary complex with magicin and Grb2. These results support a role for merlin in receptor-mediated signaling at the cell surface, and may have implications in the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W1999141851,"Acute stimulation of the receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor Met leads to receptor monoubiquitination and down-regulation through the lysosomal degradation pathway. We have determined that the Met receptor undergoes multiple monoubiquitination as opposed to the appendage of polyubiquitin chains. Nevertheless, overexpression of ubiquitin in HEK293T cells enhances the rate of Met receptor degradation, in contrast to a point mutant of ubiquitin (K48R) that cannot form Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. Furthermore, an enhancement of Met degradation is also seen under conditions where the proteasome is inhibited by lactacystin. We propose that this reflects polyubiquitin-dependent sorting of Met, as the overexpression of ubiquitin but not K48R ubiquitin also restores hepatocyte growth factor-dependent phosphorylation of the endosomal coat protein Hrs from inhibition by lactacystin. Our data indicate a requirement for K48R-linked polyubiquitin for Met endosomal trafficking independent of its canonical function of targeting for proteasomal degradation.

The receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 1The abbreviations used are: HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SF, scatter factor; Ub, ubiquitin.1The abbreviations used are: HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SF, scatter factor; Ub, ubiquitin./scatter factor (SF), c-Met, is a tyrosine kinase that, upon stimulation, elicits a variety of cellular responses. Collectively, these responses may be thought of as components of a program of “invasive growth” that are expressed according to cellular context and the developmental stage of the organism (1Comoglio P.M. Boccaccio C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Aberrant c-Met signaling is likely to contribute toward tumor progression and metastasis. Elevated c-Met expression is found in many late stage tumors and is often an indicator of a poor prognosis (2Haddad R. Lipson K.E. Webb C.P. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 4243-4252PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of oncogenic germ line mutations have been isolated from sporadic tumors such as renal papillomas and gastric carcinoma (3Lee J-H. Han S.-U. Cho H. Jennings B. Gerrard B. Dean M. Schmidt L.

Comoglio P.M. Di Renzo M.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 640-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that acute HGF stimulation leads to down-regulation of the receptor (6Hammond D.E. Carter S. Clague M.J. Curr. Top. Immunol. Microbiol. 2004; 286: 21-44PubMed Google Scholar). This degradation pathway accompanies receptor endocytosis and is sensitive to the proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin (7Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which indirectly inhibits acid-dependent lysosomal proteases. The HGF-dependent degradation pathway is also sensitive to inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome such as lactacystin, which appear to exert their effect through the perturbation of c-Met trafficking to late endosomal degradative compartments (7Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Jeffers M. Taylor G.A. Weidner K.M. Omura S. Vande Woude G.F. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2003; 14: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this respect the degradation pathway of Met differs from several other tyrosine kinase receptors such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which are relatively insensitive to lactacystin (10Mori S. Tanaka K. Omura S. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29447-29452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the case of EGFR, lactacystin inhibits the transfer of EGFR to lumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies while still allowing sorting to the limiting membrane of late endosomes/lysosomes, where the receptor can be degraded (11Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For many receptors, ubiquitination plays a key role in their endosomal trafficking. Several yeast receptors and transporters (e.g. the α-factor receptor (Ste2p) and the uracil permease (Fur4p)) require ubiquitination as a targeting signal for endocytosis and subsequent degradation (reviewed in Ref. 12Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Indeed, in yeast all endogenous proteins, which are known to be internalized, use ubiquitin as an internalization signal. For certain receptors (e.g. the α-factor receptor), monoubiquitination alone is sufficient for signal internalization (13Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Such a modification is distinct from that required for targeting to and degradation by proteasomes, where polyubiquitination resulting in a chain of at least four ubiquitin molecules is required (14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6878) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin can form chains expressing different functions by linking through different lysines. To specify proteasomal degradation a Lys48-linkage is required, whereas Lys63-linked chains participate in the coordination of error-free DNA repair (15Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Activation of tyrosine kinase receptors such as EGFR and Met results in ubiquitination that manifests itself as a higher molecular weight smeared band suggestive of the addition of several ubiquitin moieties. In the case of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, this effect has been shown to be due to multi-monoubiquitination rather than an extension of polyubiquitin chains, but to date this finding has not been confirmed for other tyrosine kinase receptors (16Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 17Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21323-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of Met and EGFR are both dependent on the E3 monoubiquitin ligase Cbl (18Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 19Peschard P. Fournier T.M. Lamorte L. Naujokas M.A. Band H. Langdon W.Y. Park M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), yet their degradation pathways show differential sensitivity to lactacystin. In this paper we demonstrate that, in common with the EGFR, the Met receptor is multi-monoubiquitinated. Nevertheless, in contrast to EGFR, Met degradation appears to require the cellular capacity for the production of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. Remarkably, we find that Lys48-linked ubiquitin enhances Met degradation under conditions where proteasome activity is blocked, suggesting a novel function for this type of linkage. Cell Culture—All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. HeLa and HEK293T cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin sulfate with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Purified recombinant human HGF/SF was a kind gift from Dr. George Vande Woude (Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, MI). Lactacystin and concanamycin were obtained from Merck Biosciences. The antibodies used were the anti-MetHu intracellular domain antibody (25H2) from Cell Signaling Technology, the anti-MetHu extracellular domain antibody (DO-24) from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin and antiphospho-tyrosine (PY20) antibodies from BD Transduction Laboratories, the anti-tubulin antibody from Sigma, and the anti-RGS-His antibody from Qiagen. Anti-ubiquitin antibodies were obtained from Sigma (rabbit polyclonal antibody; U-5379), Covance (mouse monoclonal antibody; P4G7), and Affiniti (FK1 and FK2 monoclonal antibodies). The rabbit polyclonal anti-Hrs antibody has been described previously (9Hammond D.E. Carter S. McCullough J. Urbe S. Vande Woude G. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Molecular Biology and Transfections—Wild-type and K48R His6-ubiquitin-GFP constructs were generous gifts from Doug Gray (Ottawa Regional Cancer Centre, Ottawa, Canada). A K29R/K48R/K63R and K63R mutant were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). HEK293T cells were transfected using GeneJuice (Novagen) for 39 h. Ubiquitin Detection—To resolve free monomeric endogenous and exogenous ubiquitin, a modified SDS-PAGE/Western blotting protocol was used as described previously (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Total ubiquitinated proteins were analyzed by resolving lysate proteins on 5 or 8% SDS-PAGE gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and probing with either an anti-ubiquitin antibody (P4G7) or an anti-RGS-His antibody. β-Catenin Degradation—Following transfection, cells were incubated either with or without 10 μm lactacystin for 6 h. Cells were then lysed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Met Down-regulation, Ubiquitination, and HGF-dependent Hrs Phosphorylation—Met down-regulation was measured as described previously for HeLa cells using anti-MetHu (25H2) for detection (7Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Met ubiquitination and Hrs phosphorylation were determined as described previously (9Hammond D.E. Carter S. McCullough J. Urbe S. Vande Woude G. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For ubiquitin experiments, lysis buffer was also supplemented with 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide where required. HGF-dependent Multiple Monoubiquitination of the Met Receptor—The anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibodies FK1 and FK2 differ in their ability to recognize monoubiquitinated proteins. FK1 only recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins, whereas FK2 recognizes both polyubiquitin and monoubiquitin appended to proteins (21Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, these reagents can be used to discriminate monoubiquitination from polyubiquitination, as exemplified by studies that established EGFR monoubiquitination (16Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Blotting cell lysates with either FK1 or FK2 shows similar band patterns, indicating that most ubiquitinated proteins are polyubiquitinated (Fig. 1A). Note that under the antibody dilutions presented, the intensity of the bands is higher with FK1. Using these same dilutions we probed anti-Met immunoprecipitates derived from HeLa cell lysates. No bands could be detected with FK1, but an HGF-dependent ubiquitinated Met smear was clearly detected with FK2. The smeary appearance of this signal indicates multi-monoubiquitination of the Met receptor following HGF stimulation (Fig. 1B). K48R-linked Polyubiquitin Enhances Met Degradation—We have previously demonstrated a role for the 26 S proteasome in sorting the Met receptor to the lysosomal pathway (7Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Hammond D.E. Carter S. McCullough J. Urbe S. Vande Woude G. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol.

Therefore, a requirement for polyubiquitination and the consequent proteasomal degradation of an accessory factor cannot be discounted. In principle, cellular events requiring polyubiquitin chain formation can be inhibited by the overexpression of forms of ubiquitin-bearing lysine mutations that terminate chain assembly. We have used ubiquitin that contains either single K48R or K63R mutations or ubiquitin containing three mutations (K29R/K48R/K63R, referred to as mono-Ub). This latter mutant lacks any lysine residues known to have a role in polyubiquitin chain formation in vivo. In practice, this approach can suffer from the high levels of endogenous ubiquitin expression, which has been estimated to be up to 20 μm (22Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 345-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A further complication is the abundance of cellular de-ubiquitinating enzymes, which may render ubiquitin chains unstable. Nevertheless, the expression of K63R Ub has been shown to sensitize cells to protein-damaging agents (23Tsirigotis M. Zhang M. Chiu R.K. Wouters B.G. Gray D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46073-46078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have transiently transfected HEK293T cells with His6-ubiquitin-GFP constructs (23Tsirigotis M. Zhang M. Chiu R.K. Wouters B.G. Gray D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46073-46078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Following synthesis, the GFP portion of this chimeric protein is cleaved to yield free His6-ubiquitin at levels approximately equal to those of endogenous ubiquitin (Fig. 2A, bottom). The His-tagged form is slightly larger than the endogenous ubiquitin and, therefore, can be resolved from endogenous ubiquitin on a 15% gel. Wild-type, K48R, and mono-Ub plasmids express approximately equal levels of free His-ubiquitin, and all three appear to be incorporated into proteins with similar efficiency (Fig. 2A, top). Overexpression of wild-type or mutant forms of ubiquitin also leads to a moderate increase in total ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2A, middle). Crucially, HEK293T cells can be transfected with close to 100% efficiency, allowing clear analysis of the effects of mutant ubiquitin on endogenous receptors without recourse to co-expression, which introduces a number of technical difficulties. In these cells the HGF-dependent degradation of the Met receptor displays sensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and the lysosomal protease inhibitor concanamycin (Fig. 2B), albeit not as profoundly as we have previously observed in HeLa cells (7Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the biological effects of mutant ubiquitin expression we looked at levels of β-catenin, a known substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (24Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). We can detect clear differences in the pattern of lower molecular mass bands both in the absence and the presence of lactacystin. Most notably, K48R-Ub completely inhibits the generation of a 50-kDa form that is accumulated upon lactacystin treatment. In untreated cells, levels of an 80-kDa band are decreased by the expression of Ub and increased by the expression of K48R-Ub. This band may be an unmodified form, which is accumulated in cells where the proteasomal turnover of polyubiquitinated proteins is compromised. In HEK293T cells the degradation rate of endogenous Met is significantly increased by the expression of wild-type or K63R-Ub but not mono-Ub, suggesting that polyubiquitin chain formation stimulates Met degradation (Fig. 3, A–C). This observation is in direct contrast to the case of EGFR, where similar experiments showed that mono-Ub was equipotent with the wild-type in enhancing EGFR degradation (16Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). K48R-ubiquitin also failed to fully recapitulate the enhancement of Met receptor degradation provided by the overexpression of wild-type ubiquitin. After 2 h of acute stimulation with HGF, the percentage amount of Met receptor remaining for mock transfected cells is 23.75% (± 2.1%), which is reduced to 6% (± 1.2%) when wild-type ubiquitin is overexpressed. The corresponding values following overexpression of mono-Ub and K48R-Ub are 27.25 (± 4.8%) and 13.75% (± 0.5%) respectively (n = 4). No reduction in the degree of Met ubiquitination was observed in cells transfected K48R or mono-Ub compared with wild-type (Fig. 3D). Lys48-linked Ubiquitin Enhances Met Receptor Degradation under Conditions of Proteasome Inhibition—We have also studied the effect of the overexpression of wild-type and K48R-Ub on Met down-regulation in cells that have been pre-treated with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Fig. 4A). The expression of wild-type Ub reduces the amount of Met remaining after 4 h of acute stimulation in the presence of lactacystin by ∼6-fold, whereas K48R-Ub has a markedly weaker effect (∼2-fold). Surprisingly, this result indicates a potential role in Met degradation for Lys48-linked polyubiquitin in the absence of proteasome activity. We have shown previously that the majority of Met receptors are degraded in the lysosome. In HeLa cells more than two-thirds of the receptors follow this pathway to degradation, but the presence of other degradation pathways is evident. In the case where endocytosis is blocked by the expression of mutant dynamin, degradation of the receptor still occurs at a slower rate and can be partially blocked by lactacystin (7Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is possible that Ub expression is enhancing this pathway rather than the endosomal route. One signature of the correct endosomal sorting of activated Met is the phosphorylation of the endosomal protein Hrs, which may reflect capture in a clathrin-coated region of the sorting endosome. Lactacystin treatment inhibits HGF- but not EGF-dependent Hrs phosphorylation (9Hammond D.E. Carter S. McCullough J. Urbe S. Vande Woude G. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have now used this assay to show that wild-type but not K48R-Ub can restore HGF-dependent Hrs phosphorylation in the presence of lactacystin (Fig. 4B). Our data indicate that, similar to other tyrosine kinase receptors (EGFR and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor), stimulation of the Met receptor leads to multiple monoubiquitination rather than the attachment of polyubiquitin chains to the receptor. Multi-monoubiquitination of receptors such as EGFR and Met is likely to be required for the sorting of these receptors at the early endosome by interaction with ubiquitin interaction motif-containing proteins that are components of the sorting machinery such as Hrs, STAM, eps15, and epsin (25Polo S. Confalonieri S. Salcini A.E. Di Fiore P.P. Science's STKE. 2003; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sigtrans;2003/213/re17)PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the appendage of a single non-cleavable form of ubiquitin to the EGFR is sufficient to ensure efficient lysosomal targeting (16Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). A pathway utilizing monoubiquitin as a sorting signal will not require the active involvement of the proteasome other than to maintain free ubiquitin levels. We have previously found that the degree of HGF-dependent Met receptor ubiquitination is not significantly changed by proteasome inhibition (9Hammond D.E. Carter S. McCullough J. Urbe S. Vande Woude G. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Met receptor degradation is exceptionally sensitive to proteasomal inhibition, in comparison with the other tyrosine kinase receptors that have been characterized to date. However, studies of non-tyrosine kinase receptors such as the growth hormone receptor and the interleukin 2 receptor have also shown a requirement of proteasomal activity for endocytosis and/or subsequent sorting into the lysosomal pathway (26Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 197: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Rocca A. Lamaze C. Subtil A. Dautry-Varsat A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ubiquitination of the growth hormone receptor itself appears to be dispensable for down-regulation, which has led to a model in which polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of an unidentified accessory factor is required. α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors also require ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the scaffolding protein PSD-95 in order to undergo endocytosis (28Colledge M. Snyder E.M. Crozier R.A. Soderling J.A. Jin Y. Langeberg L.K. Lu H. Bear M.F. Scott J.D. Neuron. 2003; 40: 595-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Our previous findings that Met degradation requires both correct endosomal sorting and proteasome activity have also been proposed to reflect a requirement for degradation of an accessory factor (6Hammond D.E. Carter S. Clague M.J. Curr. Top. Immunol. Microbiol. 2004; 286: 21-44PubMed Google Scholar). Our data showing enhancement of Met receptor degradation by the expression of Ub but not mono-Ub represent a further departure from the EGFR degradation pathway (16Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). We must consider that this finding could be due to the promotion of other poorly defined endocytosis-independent degradation routes, which we have previously reported to be minor components of HGF-dependent Met degradation in HeLa cells (7Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, we show that the expression of Ub but not K48R-Ub can restore a lactacystin-imposed block to HGF-dependent phosphorylation of Hrs, which we have defined previously as a signature of the correct endosomal sorting of the Met receptor (9Hammond D.E. Carter S. McCullough J. Urbe S. Vande Woude G. Clague M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1346-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 29Urbé S. Mills I.G. Stenmark H. Kitamura N. Clague M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7685-7692Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For this reason we prefer a model in which Lys48-linked polyubiquitin promotes lysosomal sorting of the Met receptor. This mechanism could correspond to the enhanced proteasomal degradation of the proposed accessory factor; but how then can we account for our observation that we retain Lys48-linkage dependent enhancement of Met degradation under conditions where we have blocked proteasome activity with lactacystin? Does this represent an entirely novel function for Lys48-linked ubiquitin, which has previously been uniquely associated with a proteasomal targeting signal? One scenario is that the critical step is the sequestration of a polyubiquitinated accessory factor away from Met, which is followed by incidental proteasomal degradation. In this model, proteasome activity is only required to generate ubiquitin (possibly locally), which can contribute to Lys48 chain formation. It bears analogy with endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation, in which misfolded proteins are polyubiquitinated and removed from the endoplasmic reticulum by the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex prior to proteasomal degradation (30Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Lys48-linked ubiquitin may interact with or otherwise regulate ubiquitin-binding proteins on the endosomal pathway. Some of these proteins are themselves either monoubiquitinated or polyubiquitinated. Polyubiquitination may in fact determine the extent of monoubiquitination. It has recently been suggested that polyubiquitin chains are assembled in the cytosol, added en bloc to ubiquitin interaction motif domain proteins, and then trimmed to generate monoubiquitinated proteins (31Miller S.L. Malotky E. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33528-33537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The formation of Lys48-linked chains could thus promote the monoubiquitination of endosomal sorting factors, which, in turn, may influence Met receptor sorting.

We report that the complex between Deinococcus radiodurans NOS (deiNOS) and an unusual tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS II) catalyzes the regioselective nitration of tryptophan (Trp) at the 4-position. Unlike non-enzymatic Trp nitration, and similar reactions catalyzed by globins and peroxidases, deiNOS only produces the otherwise unfavorable 4-nitro-Trp isomer. Although deiNOS alone will catalyze 4-nitro-Trp production, yields are significantly enhanced by TrpRS II and ATP. 4-Nitro-Trp formation exhibits saturation behavior with Trp (but not tyrosine) and is completely inhibited by the addition of the mammalian NOS cofactor (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B). Trp stimulates deiNOS oxidation of substrate l-arginine (Arg) to the same degree as H4B. These observations are consistent with a mechanism where Trp or a derivative thereof binds in the NOS pterin site, participates in Arg oxidation, and becomes nitrated at the 4-position.

In mammals, a primary source of RNS is nitric oxide (NO), which is largely produced by the three isozymes of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) (8Stuehr D.J. Santolini J. Wang Z. Wei C. Adak S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36167-36170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Whereas mammalian NOS-mediated nitration events are generally nonspecific, a bacterial nitric-oxide synthase protein has recently been shown to participate in a specific biosynthetic nitration reaction (9Kers J.A. Wach M.J. Krasnoff S.B. Widom J. Cameron K.D. Bukhalid R.A. Gibson D.M. Crane B.R. Loria R. Nature. 2004; 429: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Some pathogenic Streptomyces produce a family of unusual phytotoxin dipeptides (derivatives of cyclo-(l-tryptophanyl-l-phenylalanyl)) called thaxtomins that contain a 4-nitro-tryptophanyl moiety (10Healy F.G. Wach M. Krasnoff S.B. Gibson D.M. Loria R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 794-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The transferable pathogenicity island that contains the genes responsible for thaxtomin biosynthesis also codes for a NOS (9Kers J.A. Wach M.J. Krasnoff S.B. Widom J. Cameron K.D. Bukhalid R.A. Gibson D.M. Crane B.R. Loria R. Nature. 2004; 429: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Genetic and isotope labeling studies have shown that the Streptomyces NOS participates in thaxtomin nitration (9Kers J.A. Wach M.J. Krasnoff S.B. Widom J. Cameron K.D. Bukhalid R.A. Gibson D.M. Crane B.R. Loria R. Nature. 2004; 429: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The chemical mechanism of a NOS-mediated nitration is intriguing because NO is unlikely to react directly wiith indole (11Koppenol W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 12Hughes M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Another link between tryptophan metabolism and bacterial NOS comes from our recent finding that in Deinococcus radiodurans, an unusual tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS II) interacts with the D. radiodurans NOS (deiNOS) (31Buddha M.R. Keery K. Crane B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; (U. S. A., in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to catalyzing charging of tRNATrp, TrpRS II increases NOS solubility, affinity for substrate, and NO-synthase activity (31Buddha M.R. Keery K. Crane B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; (U. S. A., in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Uncharacteristically, D. radiodurans has two TrpRS genes: the first has ∼40% identity to other typical TrpRS sequences, and the second, which interacts with NOS, has only ∼28% identity to other TrpRS sequences. Type I tRNA synthetases catalyze two reactions in the production of aminoacyl-tRNA (13Doublie S. Bricogne G. Gilmore C. Carter C.W. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). First, the amino acid is activated to the aminoacyl-5′-adenylate, which is then reacted with the 3′-acceptor stem of tRNA to form the aminoacyl-tRNA. Adenylation of amino acids also precedes their condensation into natural products by non-ribosomal peptide synthases, such as the enzymes that produce thaxtomin (10Healy F.G. Wach M. Krasnoff S.B. Gibson D.M. Loria R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 794-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, deiNOS and stNOS both associate, either physically or genetically, with enzymes capable of activating Trp for subsequent chemical coupling. Bacterial NOSs are homologous to the mammalian oxygenase domain (mNOSox) but lack an associated reductase domain (NOSred) (14Adak S. Bilwes A.M. Panda K. Hosfield D. Aulak K.S. McDonald J.F.

Compared with mNOSs, bacterial NOSs have many similar physical, chemical, and structural properties that include that ability to catalyze the formation of nitric oxide from Arg in a manner dependent on reduced pterins (either with (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B) or with the related cofactor tetrahydrofolate (14Adak S.

In mNOS, H4B functions to rapidly supply an electron to the heme center during oxidation activation for conversion of Arg to the intermediate Nω-hydroxyl-l-arginine (NHA) and for subsequent oxidation of NHA to citrulline and NO (8Stuehr D.J.

Un-like non-enzymatic nitration of Trp, as well as those reactions catalyzed by peroxidases and globins, no other nitrated Trp byproducts are formed in appreciable amounts. Furthermore, the nitration reaction has saturation kinetics and is completely inhibited by H4B. Finally, Trp is shown to stimulate NO synthesis by deiNOS from Arg. These observations indicate that the nitration reaction occurs by Trp binding to a site that binds pterins in the mammalian enzymes. Preparation of deiNOS and TrpRS II—DeiNOS was cloned with a N-terminal His6-affinity tag, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen) as described previously (14Adak S.

Under these conditions the protein could be concentrated to 40 mg/ml. TrpRS II was expressed, purified, and concentrated up to 40 mg/ml (31Buddha M.R. Keery K. Crane B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; (U. S. A., in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain a 1:1 complex with deiNOS, 100 μl of deiNOS (1 mm in SB) was mixed with 100 μl of TrpRS II (1 mm in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl). Preparation of iNOS Reductase—The iNOS reductase construct was prepared from a plasmid containing cDNA for full-length iNOS using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers were made to amplify the final 621 residues of human iNOS-2A type 1, starting immediately following the calmodulin binding domain (residue 533). The PCR product was cloned into pET28 (Novagen) and expresed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. NOSred was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal-affinity chromatography under standard procedures. Synthesis of 4-Nitro-Trp—4-Nitro-dl -tryptophan was synthesized from commercial 4-nitroindole by conversion of the latter to 4-nitrogramine using the procedure of Melhado and Brodsky (19Melhado L.L. Brodsky J.L. J. Org. Chem. 1988; 53: 3852-3855Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 4-nitrogramine was then converted to the hydrochloride salt of 4-nitro-dl -tryptophan in three steps by modification of the procedure of Settimo (20Da Settimo A. Ann. Chim. (Rome). 1962; 52: 17-24Google Scholar). The free amino acid was obtained from the hydrochloride salt by cation-exchange chromatography. DeiNOS Nitration from Hydrogen Peroxide—50 μm deiNOS in SB was treated with 20 mm hydrogen peroxide, and the reaction mix was monitored for 2 h at 22 °C. Similarly, 50 μm complex prepared as mentioned above was treated with 20 mm hydrogen peroxide and incubated at 22 °C for 2 h. Products of the reaction were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (see below) and progress of the reaction was followed by the increase in absorbance at 400 nm. Due to the relatively small extinction coefficient of nitro-Trp, ∼10–50 times more deiNOS was used for nitration reactions that is typical for standard NOS assays. Nitro-Trp formation as a function of Trp concentration was carried out with peroxide, deiNOS, and the TrpRS II-deiNOS complex exchanged in SB that did not contain tryptophan; final reaction mixtures were made up in buffers containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 0.3 m Arg, and increasing concentrations of tryptophan (1–20 mm). In the absence of sucrose/imidazole, deiNOS requires a high concentration of Arg for solubility. Progress of the nitration reaction was monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 400 nm and applying an extinction coefficient for nitro-Trp of ϵ400 = 3000 m–1 cm–1: ϵ400 = 4200 m–1 cm–1 was used to follow nitro-Tyr production (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because of the relatively large concentrations of deiNOS employed in the reactions, 0.2-cm cells were used to maintain an optical density under 1.0 during kinetic assays. Nitration Reaction from Mammalian NOS Reductase—For nitration reactions using mammalian reductase (mNOSred) instead of peroxide, 50 μm deiNOS or deiNOS-TrpRS II complex was treated with 10 μm iNOS reductase, 2 μm FAD, 20 μm NADPH, in presence or absence of 5–50 μm H4B (Km of H4B for deiNOS = 10 μm (14Adak S. Bilwes A.M. Panda K. Hosfield D. Aulak K.S. McDonald J.F. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Non-enzymatic Nitration of Tryptophan—Hydrogen peroxide and nitrite were used to generate nitrating agents, which primarily include peroxynitrite (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Alvarez B. Rubbo H. Kirk M. Barnes S. Freeman B.A. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide (10 mm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9)) was treated with sodium nitrite (10 mm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9)) and vortexed for about 1 min. The vortexed mixture was added to l -tryptophan (10 mm), and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for about 1 h, and the products were evaluated using reverse-phase HPLC, mass spectroscopy, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Purification of Nitration Products—The reaction mixture was passed through Supelco's Bio Wide Pore C18-5 column (25 cm × 4 mm) with pore size of 300 Å. A gradient was run using buffers A (0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and B (0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) and the products collected, lyophilized, and analyzed using Micromass ZMD 4000 mass spectrometer operated in the positive ion mode with a capillary voltage of 3000 V and cone voltage of 3.0 V. NOS Assays—Nitrite formation by deiNOS was monitored using the Griess reagents, whereas NO production was followed with the oxyhemoglobin assay (14Adak S. Bilwes A.M. Panda K. Hosfield D. Aulak K.S.

Production of 4-Nitro-tryptophan by deiNOS-TrpRS II—D. radiodurans NOS catalyzes the production of nitro-tryptophan and nitrite/nitrate from Arg or NHA in the absence or presence of TrpRS II (Table I). Nitrite is an end product of NO or related species (e.g. nitroxyl, nitrosium, collectively hereafter referred to as [NO]) reacting in oxygenated solution and a typical marker of NOS activity. As has been demonstrated for mNOS under some conditions (22Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), deiNOS will catalyze nitrite production from Arg and peroxide (Table I). Alternatively, we employed a surrogate mammalian NOSred and NADPH to drive the reaction in the absence of peroxide (14Adak S. Bilwes A.M. Panda K. Hosfield D. Aulak K.S. McDonald J.F. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Table I). Human inducible NOSred was chosen as the best electron donor after also testing rat neuronal NOSred and four other homologous multiflavin reductases from B. subtilis and E. coli. Products were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 1A), mass-spectroscopy (Fig. 1B), and optical spectroscopy (Fig. 1B). Under all conditions tested, the reaction produced one nitro-Trp isomer, which elutes on a reverse-phase HPLC column at the same retention time as a synthetic 4-nitro-Trp standard (Fig. 1A). The product was further confirmed to be 4-nitro-Trp by its characteristic absorption spectrum (Fig. 1B) and mass spectrum (Fig. 1B), whose parent ion and fragments also match the 4-nitro-Trp standard. Consistent with previous reports of nonspecific Trp nitration (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J.

Toxicol. 1996; 9: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)) produced primarily a product whose much longer HPLC retention time and mass spectrum identify it as N1-nitro-Trp (data not shown) and a minor product (Fig. 1A) with a mass and elution profile consistent with the more favorable 6-nitro-Trp isomer (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Herold S. Shivashankar K. Mehl M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13460-13472Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Comparisons between HPLC elution areas of the 4-nitro-Trp product and absorption changes in the reaction mixture indicated that 4-nitro-Trp formation accounted for at least 80% of the absorbance change at 400 nm (ΔA400). No other small molecule products with far UV-visible absorption were observed in appreciable quantities. Thus, kinetics of Trp nitration were followed by monitoring (ΔA400). Addition of 50 units/ml superoxide dismutase also did not significantly reduce the production of nitro-Trp by deiNOS in either the reaction with peroxide or with mNOSred.Table IFormation of nitro-tryptophan and nitrite by deiNOS under various conditionsReaction monitoredaUnless indicated, all reactions were carried out in the presence of 20 mm Trp at 22 °C.kcat (4-nitro-tryptophan)kcat (nitrite)×100 min-1×100 min-1deiNOS + mRedbMammalian human inducible NOS reductase domain and NADPH.1.5 ± 0.152.3 ± 0.5deiNOS + TrpRS II + mRed - TrpNDcNot detectable.0.5 ± 0.2deiNOS + TrpRS II + mRed + H4Bd50 μm H4B. - TrpND4.5 ± 0.5deiNOS + TrpRS II + mRed3.2 ± 0.55.0 ± 0.5deiNOS + mRed + H4Bd50 μm H4B.ND2.5 ± 0.7deiNOS + TrpRS II + 5 mM H4B + mRed2.5 ± 0.24.8 ± 0.9deiNOS + TrpRS II + 25 mM H4B + mRed0.3 ± 0.014.3 ± 0.5deiNOS + TrpRS II + 50 mM H4B + mRedND4.9 ± 0.6deiNOS + TrpRS II + ATP + mRed5.1 ± 0.42.3 ± 0.7deiNOS + H2O23.5 ± 0.87.5 ± 0.5deiNOS + TrpRS II + H2O211.0 ± 3.015.0 ± 5.0deiNOS + ATP + H2O22.0 ± 0.87.1 ± 0.6deiNOS + TrpRS II + ATP + H2O225.0 ± 7.06.9 ± 0.5deiNOS + H2O2 + l-cysteine2.9 ± 0.67.0 ± 0.6a Unless indicated, all reactions were carried out in the presence of 20 mm Trp at 22 °C.b Mammalian human inducible NOS reductase domain and NADPH.c Not detectable.d 50 μm H4B. Open table in a new tab Stimulation of 4-Nitro Formation by TrpRS II and ATP— Addition of TrpRS II stimulates the production of 4-nitro-Trp by a factor of 2–3 whether peroxide or NOSred/NADPH drives the reaction (Table I). Surprisingly, the peroxide-catalyzed Trp nitration reaction is enhanced further by the addition of ATP (Table I). Consistent with greater incorporation of [NO] into the 4-nitro-Trp product, the amount of nitrite produced decreases as the amount of 4-nitro-Trp increases when ATP is present. ATP has no effect on 4-nitro-Trp or [NO] formation by deiNOS alone. ATP binds tightly to TrpRS II (31Buddha M.R. Keery K. Crane B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; (U. S. A., in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and is required for Trp-adenylation by the synthetase. The Effects of Pterin on 4-Nitro-Trp and NO Production—Trp acts analogously to H4B in the deiNOS catalyzed nitration reaction. Similar to mNOS (22Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), production of [NO] from Arg and mNOSred by deiNOS is enhanced ∼10× by H4B (Table I). This is consistent with the role of H4B in donating an electron to the NOS heme center during oxygen activation (8Stuehr D.J. Santolini J. Wang Z. Wei C. Adak S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36167-36170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 18Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in the absence of H4B, but presence of Trp, nitrite is still produced from Arg at nearly equal amounts (despite 4-nitro-Trp also being formed) (Table I). Notably, in the presence of Trp, H4B allows nitrite production but inhibits 4-nitro-Trp formation with increasing concentration until no 4-nitro-Trp is formed at an H4B:deiNOS-TrpRS II stoichiometry of 1:1 (Table I). H4B does not reduce the amount of nitrated product (A400) in the non-enzymatic nitrite/peroxide reaction nor does it affect nitrite formation by deiNOS in the presence of Trp. Thus, the ability of H4B to inhibit nitro-Trp formation but not nitrite formation suggests that Trp binds in the deiNOS pterin site and furthermore can stimulate oxidation of Arg from this position. We were unable to detect NO production from deiNOS-TrpRS II in the presence of Trp by the oxy-hemoglobin assay. NO production from Trp is of interest because H4B-depleted mNOS will still produce nitrite in oxygenated solution but does so through nitroxyl (NO–), rather than NO formation (22Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 23Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Trp Nitration by deiNOS Exhibits Saturation Behavior—The dependence of 4-nitro-Trp formation by deiNOS on Trp concentration exhibits saturation behavior with an observed Michaelis constant (Km) of 2.8 ± 0.6 mm (Fig. 2). Addition of TrpRS II increases the effective Vmax two to three times and decreases Km to 1.5 ± 0.5 mm (Fig. 2). Such saturation kinetics also indicate that 4-nitro-Trp production involves Trp binding to deiNOS. A different concentration dependence would be expected for reaction of free Trp with a diffusing RNS generated by deiNOS. We also tested inhibition of Trp nitration by the peroxynitrite scavanger cysteine (21Alvarez B. Rubbo H. Kirk M. Barnes S. Freeman B.A. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although 1 mm cysteine completely prevented nitro-Trp formation from nitrite and peroxide, 4-nitro-Trp formation by deiNOS decreased only slightly (15%) in the presence of cysteine (Table I). Tyrosine, the more reactive amino acid for nitration (24Bonnet R. Nicolaidou P. Heterocycles. 1977; 7: 637-659Crossref Google Scholar), is also nitrated by dei-NOS but with lower turnover numbers than Trp. At the Tyr concentrations we could evaluate, the reaction did not saturate and appeared to be roughly first order (Fig. 2). The regioselective nitration reaction catalyzed by deiNOS that produces only 4-nitro-Trp is in marked contrast to non-enzymatic and heme protein catalyzed Trp nitration reactions. Agents capable of nitrating aromatic aminoacids include peroxynitrite, nitrous acid, nitrite and hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide and dioxygen, and acyl nitrates (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Koppenol W.H. Free Radic. Biol.

Heterocycles. 1977; 7: 637-659Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, peroxidases in the presence of nitrite and H2O2, and myoglobin in the presence of nitrite, NO, or O2, are well characterized in their ability to nitrate Trp (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Herold S. Shivashankar K. Mehl M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13460-13472Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Herold S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Alvarez B. Rubbo H.

These reactions generate a large number of products which include the 4-nitro, 5-nitro, 6-nitro, 7-nitro, N1-nitro, and N1-nitroso derivatives of Trp as well as hydroxylated Trp and N-formylkinureine (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Herold S. Shivashankar K. Mehl M.

Trp nitration reactions catalyzed by hemeproteins involve multiple competing reaction pathways; that can involve peroxynitrite intermediates and indole radicals generated by compound I or II peroxidase species (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Koppenol W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 12Hughes M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 24Bonnet R. Nicolaidou P. Heterocycles. 1977; 7: 637-659Crossref Google Scholar). Given the nonspecific character of these reactions, it is then remarkable that deiNOS produces a single nitrated derivative of Trp, the same 4-nitro isomer produced by the Streptomyces NOS in the thaxtomin phytotoxin. deiNOS likely interacts with Trp to protect the more reactive sites on the indole ring from modification. The mammalian NOS cofactor H4B does not significantly affect [NO] production by deiNOS in the peroxide assay but completely inhibits production of nitro-Trp. This result indicates that Trp nitration by deiNOS does not occur by reaction between free Trp and a diffusible nitrating agent derived from deiNOS and Arg. Furthermore, the inability of the peroxynitrite scavanger cysteine to prevent nitro-Trp formation rules out the obligatory participation of free preoxynitrite. Saturation behavior of the nitration reaction with Trp concentration also supports Trp binding to deiNOS. Neither saturation kinetics nor comparably high product yields are observed with Tyr, which is at least as reactive toward nitrating agents as Trp (24Bonnet R. Nicolaidou P. Heterocycles. 1977; 7: 637-659Crossref Google Scholar). Inhibition of 4-nitro-Trp formation by H4B indicates that rates saturate with Trp concentration because Trp binds in the pterin site. In Bacillus subtilis NOS, H4B accelerates decay of the heme ferrous-oxy species by presumably acting as a rapid electron donor to heme, akin to its role in mammalian NOS catalysis (8Stuehr D.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48602-48610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The dependence of deiNOS on reduced pterins (15Pant K. Bilwes A.M. Adak S. Stuehr D.J. Crane B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11071-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or Trp for [NO] formation from Arg could imply that deiNOS maintains this mechanism but that Trp can substitute for H4B as an electron donor. This is surprising, given that the reduction potential of the Trp radical (1.0 V (28Tommos C. Skalicky J.J. Pilloud D.L. Wand A.J. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9495-9507Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) is expected to be much higher than that for H3B+ (0.15–0.3 V (Ref. 29Gorren A.C.F. Kungl A.J. Schmidt K. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Nitric Oxide-Biol. Chem. 2001; 5: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and references therein)). Nonetheless, the protein and or protonation environment could modulate these potentials (27Sorlie M. Gorren A.C.F. Marchal S. Shimizu T. Lange R. Andersson K.K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48602-48610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and indeed, NOSs do provide a negative electrostatic field at the pterin site that will facilitate oxidation of cofactors (18Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Trp could be oxidized by the compound I-like oxidation state of NOS, as is seen in reactions by peroxidases (4Sala A. Stefania N. Roncone R. Casella L. Monzani E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). But such a mechanism does not explain how Trp stimulates nitrite production from deiNOS-NOSred. Coupling oxidation of Trp to the heme chemistry that oxidizes Arg to NO is an attractive means of providing a reactive indole radical to the [NO] species derived at the heme site. Such a mechanism would limit the toxic effects of [NO] diffusion away from deiNOS. If [NO] coupling with the radical proceeded prior to [NO] reaction with oxygen, a 4-nitroso-Trp would be a likely initial product (see Supplemental Fig. 3). As C-nitroso-Trp may be unstable to both oxidation and nitroso migration (24Bonnet R. Nicolaidou P. Heterocycles. 1977; 7: 637-659Crossref Google Scholar, 30Castro A. Iglesias E. Leis J.R. Pena M.E. Tato J.V. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 1986; 2: 1165-1168Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it is not surprising no such species was observed. Significantly, TrpRS II activation of deiNOS catalyzed nitration is greater in the presence of ATP. TrpRS II requires ATP to adenylate Trp prior to tRNA charging. deiNOS itself does not interact with ATP nor does ATP affect nitro-Trp or [NO] production of deiNOS alone. Thus, 5′-adenyl-Trp, produced by TrpRS II, may be a preferred substrate for deiNOS nitration (see supplemental Fig. 3). The 5′-adenyl-Trp is unstable to hydrolysis and difficult to isolate as an intermediate (13Doublie S. Bricogne G. Gilmore C. Carter C.W. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ATP binding to TrpRS II may influence deiNOS in a manner that stimulates Trp nitration. The ability of TrpRS II and ATP to enhance the deiNOS nitration reaction underscores the functional coupling of these two enzymes. Many enzymes involved in secondary metaboilsm, such as non-ribosomal peptide synthases, polyketide synthases, terpene synthases, and taxadiene synthases, have relatively slow turnover numbers that often range between 0.001 and 0.8 min–1 (The Comprehensive Enzyme Information System, www.brenda.uni-koeln.de). Furthermore, enzymes that metabolize Trp, such as tryptophan transaminase, peptide-tryptophan dioxygenase, tryptophanase, and l-tryptophan oxidase, have Km values for Trp of ∼1mm. Thus, the catalytic parameters for Trp nitration by deiNOS are well within the range expected for a biosynthetic function. The production of 4-nitro-Trp isomer by both deiNOS and the Streptomyces NOS that biosynthesizes thaxtomin may not be coincidental, particularly if both reactions require Trp binding to NOS proteins that do indeed share high homology in their pterin binding sites.

The minimal oligomerization domain of this protein consists of two coiled-coil subdomains named Coiled-coil 2 (CC2) and leucine zipper (LZ) (Agou, F., Traincard, F., Vinolo, E., Courtois, G., Yamaoka, S., Israel, A., and Veron, M.

To search for drugs inhibiting NF-κB activation, we have rationally designed cell-permeable peptides corresponding to the CC2 and LZ subdomains that mimic the contact areas between NEMO subunits. The peptides were tagged with the Antennapedia/Penetratin motif and delivered to cells prior to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Peptide transduction was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, and their effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation was quantified using an NF-κB-dependent β-galactosidase assay in stably transfected pre-B 70Z/3 lymphocytes. We show that the peptides corresponding to the LZ and CC2 subdomains inhibit NF-κB activation with an IC50 in the μm range. Control peptides, including mutated CC2 and LZ peptides and a heterologous coiled-coil peptide, had no inhibitory effect. The designed peptides are able to induce cell death in human retinoblastoma Y79 cells exhibiting constitutive NF-κB activity. Our results provide the “proof of concept” for a new and promising strategy for the inhibition of NF-κB pathway activation through targeting the oligomerization state of the NEMO protein. NF-κB essential modulator/IKK-γ (NEMO/IKK-γ) plays a key role in the activation of the NF-κB pathway in response to proinflammatory stimuli. Previous studies suggested that the signal-dependent activation of the IKK complex involves the trimerization of NEMO. The minimal oligomerization domain of this protein consists of two coiled-coil subdomains named Coiled-coil 2 (CC2) and leucine zipper (LZ) (Agou, F., Traincard, F., Vinolo, E., Courtois, G., Yamaoka, S., Israel, A., and Veron, M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2552-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB transcription factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm via their association with IκB proteins. Stimulation of cells by several factors, including the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1, and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), results in the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. This complex is composed of two protein kinases (IKK-α and IKK-β) and a non-catalytic regulatory protein called NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) (5Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the IKK complex phosphorylates the IκB proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. The released NF-κB transcription factors are then translocated into the nucleus. NEMO plays a critical role in the activation of this pathway. Indeed, the inability of NEMO-deficient cells to activate NF-κB genes in response to extracellular stimuli can be overcome by transfection with the wild-type NEMO gene (5Yamaoka S. Courtois G.

The biochemical mechanisms triggering IKK activation in response to proinflammatory stimuli remain obscure. It was recently reported that NEMO is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated upon tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation (7Carter R.S. Geyer B.C. Xie M. Acevedo-Suarez C.A. Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

Oligomerization of NEMO is necessary for kinase activation; enforced oligomerization of NEMO leads to constitutive activation of the IKK complex (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C.

The N-terminal part of the polypeptide contains a large coiled-coil motif (CC1) and all the residues involved in the interaction of the protein with the IKK kinases (IKK-binding domain, see Fig. 1) (13May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half (residues 250–412) is composed of two successive coiled-coil motifs, CC2 (residues 253–285) and LZ (residues 301–337), and a zinc finger motif (ZF) at the extreme C terminus of the polypeptide. It is this C-terminal part of NEMO that is involved in the oligomerization of the protein (14Tegethoff S. Behlke J. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Agou F. Ye F. Goffinont S. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israël A. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17464-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region is essential for protein function as NF-κB activation in NEMO-deficient cells cannot be restored by complementation with a gene carrying a mutation in the oligomerization domain (16Agou F. Traincard F. Vinolo E. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27861-27869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, the mutations responsible for the NEMO-associated pathologies, incontinentia pigmenti and anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency, are found within the gene encoding this C-terminal part of the protein (17Doffinger R.

The design of inhibitors able to block the NF-κB pathway is of obvious interest, and targeting NEMO is a promising approach because this protein is a central and non-redundant component of the IKK complex. In general, peptides designed to affect the function of the protein by interfering with protein-protein interactions have long been considered, but concerns over their low bioavailability and stability have limited their development (20Latham P.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 755-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, there is currently renewed interest in developing peptides for use as drugs (21Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 22Lien S. Lowman H.B. Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), particularly when the protein targets are signaling proteins exhibiting flexible and dynamic binding properties (for a review, see Ref. 23Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Therapeutic peptides have already been successfully designed, such as the gp41 peptide involved in HIV-1 penetration into cells (24Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 25Chan D.C. Kim P.S. Cell. 1998; 93: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). We have shown that the minimal oligomerization domain required for NEMO trimerization is comprised of both the CC2 and LZ coiled-coil subdomains and proposed a model for the organization of these subdomains within the oligomer (16Agou F. Traincard F. Vinolo E. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27861-27869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we report a specific inhibition by low concentrations of peptides designed to interfere with the oligomeric structure of the protein. The potential use of these peptides as therapeutic drugs for future clinical applications is discussed. Cell Lines, Stable and Transient Transfections, and Conditions for FACS Analysis—Stable cell lines (70Z/3-C3) were obtained after electroporation of 70Z/3 cells (26Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of a cx12lacZ-κB plasmid containing three tandem copies of an NF-κB-binding site in the interleukin-2 promoter (27Fiering S. Northrop J.P. Nolan G.P. Mattila P.S. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1823-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) upstream from the lacZ reporter gene (a gift from G. R. Crabtree). The human retinoblastoma cell line Y79 (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA), was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Jurkat T cells were transiently transfected by a DEAE-dextran method with an SRE-Luc reporter plasmid as described (26Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated without or with NEMO-derived peptides for 2 h and then mock-stimulated or stimulated with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1 μg/ml ionomycin for 5 h. Luciferase expression was carried out as described in Ref. 26Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. To analyze the internalization of the peptides, 70Z/3-C3 pre-B lymphocytes (0.5 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml of culture medium) were incubated at 37 °C for different lengths of time with various peptide concentrations. The cell suspension was centrifuged (400 × g for 7 min at room temperature), and the resulting cell pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of PBS buffer before being resuspended in 500 μl of a PBS buffer containing 0.1% sodium azide. Fluorescence analysis of the cells was performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). A minimum number of 15,000 counts were made per sample. All experiments were performed in duplicate. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides shown in Table I as well as the long peptide sp-CC2-LZ (residues 253–336 in the mouse sequence) were synthesized as described previously (28Mousson F. Coic Y.M. Baleux F. Beswick V. Sanson A. Neumann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) by using a continuous-flow Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/terbutyl strategy on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Pioneer peptide synthesizer. All chemical reagents were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Peptides were N-terminally blocked with an acetyl group and C-terminally blocked with an amide. As the peptide sequences contained no cysteine residues, a single cysteine was incorporated at the N terminus to allow N-terminal specific labeling (see Table I). Biot-LZ peptides were biotinylated using EZ-link (Pierce). In cell death experiments (Fig. 9), the peptides were pretreated with iodoacetamide to prevent oxidation of the incorporated cysteine residue. Crude peptides were purified by reverse-phase MPLC using a preparative column packed with Nucleoprep (20-μm particle size, 100-Å pore size) C18 100 Å and a linear gradient of acetonitrile (1%/min) in 0.08% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2). The run time was 60 min at a flow rate of 18 ml/min. To improve the purity of the peptides, reverse-phase HPLC was repeated using a semipreparative column packed with nucleosil C18 (5 μm particle size, 300 Å pore size). The BODIPY® FL N-(2-aminoethyl) maleimide fluorophore (Molecular Probes) was conjugated to the incorporated N-terminal cysteine by incubation of equimolar concentrations of the peptide and fluorophore in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6) for 30 min in the dark. Free fluorophore was then removed by reversephase MPLC using a preparative column packed with Nucleoprep (20-μm particle size, 100-Å pore size) C18 100 Å. Peptide integrity and coupling efficiency were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Extinction coefficients were determined at 280 and 505 nm by using peptide concentrations resulting from amino acid analysis The absorbance ratio was then monitored periodically to assess the stability of the labeling. Peptides were stored at a concentration of 2 mm in water at –20 °C.Table INEMO-derived peptidesNameSequenceaAn N-terminal extra cysteine residue was added to each Antennapedia sequence (A) for coupling with BODIPY (B).

Open table in a new tab NF-κB Inhibition Assays—In Protocol A, 2.2 × 105 70Z/3-C3 cells in 220 μl of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (referred to as the complete medium) were incubated with 0–20 μm peptide. After 2 h at 37 °C, 100 μl of cell samples were transferred in duplicate to a 96-well microtiter plate. One well was treated for 5 h with 15 μg/ml LPS from Salmonella abortus (Sigma), and the control well was left untreated. After 5 h at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature, the pellets were washed three times with cold PBS (250 μl), and the cells were lysed in a 25 mm Tris-phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol (LB buffer), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was kept on ice before performing the β-galactosidase assay. Assays were performed on 30 μl of the supernatant and in an assay mix containing 4 μl of Galacton-star chemiluminescent substrate (29Bronstein I. Edwards B. Voyta J.C. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1989; 4: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and 200 μl of reaction buffer (Clontech). The activity was measured with a plate luminometer (Berthold). In Protocol B, 70Z/3-C3 cells were incubated for 2 h with the peptide. Following this incubation, cells were centrifuged at 400 × g for 7 min at room temperature, and the resulting pellets were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS. The cell pellet was diluted three times with complete medium, after which the cells were allowed to continue their growth for at least 24 h before being stimulated with LPS. All subsequent steps were carried out as described in Protocol A. Analytical Gel Filtration—The oligomeric state of the peptides was determined by the gel filtration of 500 μl of samples on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column equilibrated using a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm dodecyl maltoside with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Dodecyl maltoside was added to minimize adsorption and increase peptide recovery. The column was calibrated by supplementing the equilibration buffer with dextran blue 2000 (void volume), BSA (67 kDa, RS = 35.2 Å), ovalbumin (43 kDa, RS = 27.5 Å), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa, RS = 21.1 Å), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, RS = 16.4 Å), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa, RS = 17.7 Å), aprotinin (6.5 kDa, RS = 13.5 Å), and dithiothreitol (total volume). Fluorescence Anisotropy—Anisotropy measurements were performed with a PTI Quantamaster fluorometer, equipped with polarizing filters for excitation and emission, and using a photomultiplier tube in the L-configuration. All experiments were carried out in a 1-cm path length cuvette at 22 °C, with excitation and emission wavelengths at 495 and 520 nm. The band pass of the excitation and emission wavelengths was 2 and 4 nm, respectively. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, expressed as millianisotropy units was measured as described by (16Agou F. Traincard F. Vinolo E. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27861-27869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All measurements were carried out in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 150 mm KCl. Experiments were performed at least in duplicate, and each data point is the result of 20 recordings taken over a 2-min period. We verified that the effect of the inner filter was negligible at the peptide concentration used. Prior to anisotropy measurement, BA-CC2 (1 μm) was preincubated overnight at 22 °C, alone or with increasing concentrations (1–125 μm) of sp-CC2. BA-LZ (100 nm) was preincubated overnight at 22 °C alone or with 10 or 100 μm concentrations of sp-CC2 (see the legend for Fig. 6). The KD was estimated by fitting the anisotropy data to the binding isotherm equation using the KaleidaGraph non-linear regression software. The binding stoichiometry (n), which is the number of bound sp CC2 per mol of BA-CC2, was estimated from the intersection of the lines (see Fig. 6, dashed lines) fitted onto the linear and plateau regions of the graph generated from the anisotropy data (30Agou F. Raveh S. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19630-19638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Competitive Titration of the Untagged sp-CC2-LZ with sp-CC2 and sp-LZ Peptides—The recombinant His-tagged CC2-LZ corresponding to the minimal oligomerization domain of NEMO was purified as described earlier (16Agou F. Traincard F. Vinolo E. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27861-27869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The synthetic sp-CC2-LZ and recombinant (His-CC2-LZ) oligomers were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0 containing 150 mm potassium chloride and 2 m potassium thiocyanate to destroy their trimeric structure and mixed together in a final volume of 0.24 ml at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml for sp-CC2-LZ and His-tag-CC2-LZ, respectively. After an extensive dialysis at 4 °C overnight against a 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm potassium chloride, and 10% glycerol (buffer A), 20 μl of the mixture was incubated at 4 °C with 50 μl of Ni-NTA magnetic beads (Qiagen) to immobilize the heterotrimer composed of His-tagged and untagged subunits. After separation with a magnet, beads were washed three times at 4 °C with 2 volumes of buffer A without (control) or with variable concentrations of sp-CC2 (WT), sp-CC2 (Mut), sp-LZ (WT), or sp-LZ (Mut). The amount of sp-CC2-LZ released was evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie Blue staining. As staining and destaining of small peptides can result in diffusion out of the gel, the competitive titration was evaluated by monitoring the displacement of sp-CC2-LZ rather than by measuring the staining intensity of bound peptides. Identification of Proteins Bound to Biotinylated LZ Peptides—70Z/3-C3 cells were seeded at a density of 106/ml in 2 ml in 6-well plates and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C without or with 10 μm biotinylated LZ peptides. Cells were then extensively washed two times with cold PBS to remove excess peptide and lysed in 100 μl of LB buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and aliquots of 10 μl (10% of input) were withdrawn before incubating 50 μl of magnetic streptavidin beads (Novagen) for 30 min at 4 °C with the remaining materials (180 μg of protein each). Biotinylated peptides were pulled down with streptavidin beads and washed twice with LB buffer. Bound proteins and clarified lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-NEMO (5Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) and anti-NRP (gift of Dr R. Weil) antibodies. Cell Death Assays—Cell death was quantified using the MTS assay from Promega (CellTiter 96® AQueous one solution cell proliferation assay). To increase the sensitivity of the assay, we used BODIPY-free peptides as the absorption spectrum of the fluorophore interferes with that of the formazan generated in the assay. The assay was carried out as follows: 50 μl (0.1–20 μm final concentration) of the relevant peptide was added to 450 μl of a Y79 cell culture (0.3 × 106). As a control, a cell sample was left untreated in serum-free RPMI medium at 37 °C. After incubation for either 1 or 14 h, 200 μl (0.12 × 106 cells) of the assay culture was transferred to a 96-well plate and mixed with 40 μl of MTS solution. The amount of formazan produced by viable cells was measured 2 h later at 490 nm. Cell survival, estimated by observation of the untreated cells under the microscope, was expressed as the percentage of OD490 nm. The background level of fluorescence in the reaction was caused by the cell-free RPMI medium. All experiments were repeated twice, and samples were tested in duplicate in each experiment. Rational Design of Peptides from the Minimal Oligomerization Domain of NEMO—We have identified the minimal oligomerization domain required for the formation of the NEMO trimer. It consists of residues 251–337 of the C-terminal half of the sequence (16Agou F. Traincard F. Vinolo E. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27861-27869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Our model predicts that the CC2-LZ domain forms a six-stranded helical bundle composed of a trimer of CC2 domains surrounded by three LZ coiled-coils (16Agou F. Traincard F. Vinolo E. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27861-27869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This model was used to design the sp-CC2 and sp-LZ peptides, which contain residues 253–287 and residues 294–336, respectively. These peptides were designed to interfere with the oligomerization of NEMO (Table I). A 16-residue extension derived from the Antennapedia/Penetratin protein, which acts as a peptide internalization vector, was added to the N terminus of each peptide. The fluorescent chromophore BODIPY was conjugated to an incorporated N-terminal cysteine to monitor peptide uptake (Table I). For clarity, we refer to the peptides labeled with BODIPY-Antennapedia as BA-CC2 and BA-LZ and to the unlabeled peptides as sp-CC2 and sp-LZ. Cellular Uptake of NEMO-derived Peptides—We analyzed the uptake of BA-CC2, BA-LZ, and two controls (free BODIPY and BODIPY-conjugated BSA) into 70Z/3-C3 cells, which had been preincubated with the samples for 2 h, by FACS (Fig. 2A shows the cellular uptake of BA-CC2). The fluorescence patterns of the four peptides were identical (Fig. 2B, BA-pp peak), indicating that their intracellular concentrations were similar. Free BODIPY or BODIPY-conjugated BSA was not internalized (Fig. 2B). The autofluorescence of untreated cells was similar to the fluorescence of cells treated with BODIPY-BSA or with free BODIPY (Fig. 2B), indicating that the washing protocol eliminated any dye adhering to the cell surface. The kinetics and concentration dependence of BA-CC2 uptake were linear (not shown). The intracellular concentration of BA-CC2 reached a maximum after 30 min in the presence of 20 μm peptide and was unchanged after a further incubation of 5 h, the time required to monitor LPS-induced NF-κB activation by our β-galactosidase reporter assay. Inhibition of LPS-induced NF-κB Activation by BA-CC2 and BA-LZ—To analyze the effect of BA-CC2 and BA-LZ on LPS-induced NF-κB activation, murine pre-B 70Z/3 cells were stably tran"
https://openalex.org/W2008360087,"E4B (also known as UFD2a) is a mammalian homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ufd2, which was originally described as a ubiquitin chain assembly factor (E4). E4B is a U-box-type ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) and likely functions as either an E3 or an E4. With a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have now identified FEZ1 (fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1) as a protein that interacts with E4B. FEZ1 is implicated in neuritogenesis when phosphorylated by protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ). Interaction between E4B and FEZ1 in mammalian cells was enhanced by coexpression of constitutively active PKCζ. E4B mediated the polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 but did not affect its intracellular stability, suggesting that such modification of FEZ1 is not a signal for its proteolysis. Polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 by E4B required Lys27 of ubiquitin. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of E4B in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells resulted in inhibition of neurite extension induced either by nerve growth factor or by coexpression of FEZ1 and constitutively active PKCζ. These findings indicate that E4B serves as a ubiquitin ligase for FEZ1 and thereby regulates its function but not its degradation.

The steady-state concentrations of cellular proteins are maintained by the balance between their synthesis and degradation, with the regulation of this balance underlying the control of many cellular functions. The ubiquitin proteolytic pathway plays an important role in the elimination of short-lived regulatory proteins (1Peters J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), including those that contribute to the cell cycle, cellular signaling in response to environmental stress or extracellular ligands, morphogenesis, secretion, DNA repair, and organelle biogenesis (2Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6903) Google Scholar). This pathway includes two key steps: covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules to the protein substrate and degradation of the ubiquitylated protein by the 26 S proteasome complex. The system responsible for the attachment of ubiquitin to the target protein consists of several components that act in concert (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 5Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M.

E3 is thought to be the component of the ubiquitin conjugation system that is most directly responsible for substrate recognition (5Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M.

On the basis of structural similarity, E3 enzymes have been classified into two families: the HECT (homologous to E6-AP COOH terminus) family (7Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) and the RING finger-containing protein family (8Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13829-13837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) identified a third family of E3 enzymes known as the U-box proteins. The prototype U-box protein, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ufd2, was originally described as a ubiquitin chain assembly factor (also designated E4) that promotes the polyubiquitylation of artificial ubiquitin fusion proteins in conjunction with E1 (Uba1), E2 (Ubc4), and E3 (Ufd4, a HECT-type E3) enzymes (17Johnson E.S.

Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Ufd2 and its homologs in other eukaryotes share a conserved domain of ∼70 amino acids termed the U-box. E4 is required for further elongation of an oligoubiquitin chain on certain types of substrates, and the resulting polyubiquitylated proteins are then recognized by the 26 S proteasome for degradation. Aravind and Koonin (19Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) showed, by means of sequence profile analysis, that the U-box is a derived version of the RING finger domain. However, most of the signature cysteines, the hallmark metal-chelating residues of the RING finger, are not conserved in the U-box. Nevertheless, the predicted three-dimensional structure of the U-box is similar to that of the RING finger domain (19Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 20Ohi M.D. Vander Kooi C.W. Rosenberg J.A. Chazin W.J. Gould K.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This observation suggested the possibility that U-box proteins in general are able to function as E3 enzymes. Indeed, Patterson and co-workers (12Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) showed that CHIP (COOH terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) functions as an E3. We also showed that all six mammalian U-box proteins tested mediate polyubiquitylation in the presence of E1 and E2 enzymes independent of the presence of other E3 enzymes (11Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Thus, U-box proteins do possess E3 activity, and their E4 activity likely represents a specialized type of E3 activity apparent with oligoubiquitylated artificial fusion proteins as substrates. In yeast, Ufd2 is implicated in cell survival under stressful conditions and is associated with Cdc48 (18Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), which belongs to the large family of AAA-type ATPases that are thought to possess chaperone activity (21Cruciat C.M. Hell K. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5226-5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 22Golbik R. Lupas A.N. Koretke K.K. Baumeister W. Peters J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1049-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that mouse E4B (UFD2a), a homolog of yeast Ufd2, is abundant in neurons (23Kaneko C. Hatakeyama S. Matsumoto M. Yada M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). E4B interacts with VCP, a mammalian ortholog of yeast Cdc48, suggesting that the association of AAA-type ATPases with Ufd2-like proteins has been conserved through evolution and thus may be functionally important (23Kaneko C. Hatakeyama S. Matsumoto M. Yada M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also found that E4B interacts with, and thereby mediates the polyubiquitylation of, ataxin-3, the protein in which the abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine tract is responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (24Matsumoto M. Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Ishimoto H. Tanimura T. Tsuji S. Kakizuka A. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K.I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated FEZ1 (fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1), a protein implicated in neurite extension, as a binding partner of E4B. FEZ1 is a mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-76, which is required for axonal bundling and elongation in the nematode (25Bloom L. Horvitz H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3414-3419Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), suggesting that FEZ1 also participates in axonal outgrowth and fasciculation in mammals. FEZ1 is phosphorylated by protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), and this phosphorylation reaction appears to be required for neurite extension in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (26Kuroda S. Nakagawa N. Tokunaga C. Tatematsu K. Tanizawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Wooten M.C. Seibenhener M.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The possible role of E4B in the functional regulation of FEZ1 as well as in neuritogenesis was investigated. Antibodies—Immunoblot analysis was performed with antibodies to Myc (1 μg/ml; clone 9E10, Covance), to FLAG (1 μg/ml; clone M5, Sigma), to the hemagglutinin epitope (1 μg/ml; clone HA.11/16B12, Babco), to Hsp70 (1 μg/ml; clone 7, Transduction Laboratories), to E4B (0.25 μg/ml; clone 7, Transduction Laboratories), to ubiquitin (1 μg/ml; clone 1B3, Medical Biological Laboratories), and to hexahistidine (0.2 μg/ml; clone H15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human FEZ1 (used at 1 μg/ml) were generated by standard procedures with the use of a recombinant protein expressed in Sf21 insect cells. Yeast Two-hybrid System—Yeast strain L40 (MATa LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ trp1 leu2 his3) (Invitrogen) was transformed both with the plasmid pGBKLexA encoding the U-box domain (amino acids 919–1173) of mouse E4B (GenBank™/EBI accession number NP_071305) and with a human brain cDNA library in the pACT2 vector (Clontech). The cells were then streaked on plates of medium lacking histidine to detect interaction-dependent activation of HIS3 according to the assay protocol (Matchmaker, Toyobo). Cloning of cDNAs—The cDNAs for human FEZ1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number U48249) and human PKCζ (accession number XM_049769) were amplified from a brain cDNA library (BD Biosciences) by PCR with Taq polymerase (Takara). The amplified fragments were subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced. The cDNA for constitutively active PKCζ (caPKCζ) was prepared by deleting the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the pseudo-substrate region (Arg116–Trp122) from the full-length cDNA (28Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). These various cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pCGN (kindly provided by A. Nagafuchi), pCR (Invitrogen), pFASTBAC (Invitrogen), or pGBKT7 (BD Biosciences). The plasmid pT7-7-UbcH5c (Novagen) was described previously (11Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and pMT107 encoding His6-ubiquitin was kindly provided by D. Bohmann. The plasmids pcDNA3-FLAG-E4B, pGEX-6P-HA-ubiquitin, and pBacPAC9-GST-FLAG-E4B were described previously (11Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). A cDNA for E4B tagged at its N terminus with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was generated by PCR, sequenced, and cloned into pcDNA3. A cDNA for β-galactosidase was subcloned into pcDNA3.1-Myc-His (Invitrogen). Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblot Analysis—Transfection, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (29Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A. Nakayama K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3859-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Urea (8 m) was added to the cell lysis buffer for the purification of His6-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins by chromatography on ProBond resin (Invitrogen); proteins were eluted from the resin with a solution containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 200 mm imidazole. For detection of the interaction between endogenous E4B and Myc-FEZ1 in PC12 cells, the cells were lysed in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 0.2% CHAPS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Phosphatase Treatment—λ-Protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used to dephosphorylate immunoprecipitated HA-FEZ1 expressed in HEK293T cells. The reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with or without 800 units of enzyme in 100 μl of λ-phosphatase reaction buffer at 30 °C for 2 h. After washing three times with in vitro ubiquitylation buffer, the immune complex was used as substrate in an in vitro ubiquitylation assay. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—Recombinant glutathione S-transferase-HA-ubiquitin, glutathione S-transferase-FLAG-E4B, His6-UbcH5c, and His6-Myc-FEZ1 were expressed and purified as described previously (11Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The in vitro ubiquitylation assay was performed as described previously (8Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 15 ng of FLAG-E4B, 0.1 μg of recombinant rabbit E1 (Boston Biomedica), 0.5 μg of purified His6-UbcH5c, 3.5 units of phosphocreatine kinase, 0.6 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 0.3 μg of HA-tagged wild-type or mutant ubiquitin, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm creatine phosphate were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with 50 ng of His6-Myc-FEZ1 as substrate. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer containing 4% β-mercaptoethanol and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Pulse-Chase Analysis—Pulse-chase analysis was performed as described previously (30Shirane M. Hatakeyama S. Hattori K. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28169-28174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. In brief, HEK293T cells grown in 15-cm dishes to 50% confluence were transiently transfected with 45 μg of pCGN-HA-FEZ1 and 45 μg of either pcDNA3-FLAG-E4B or pcDNA3-FLAG-E4B(P1140A). After 36 h, the cells were metabolically labeled by incubation for 1 h with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml). After further incubation for various times in complete medium without isotope, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. To investigate whether FEZ1 is degraded by the proteasome, we added a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Peptide Institute) or clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Calbiochem), to the chase medium at a final concentration of 10 or 50 μm, respectively. In other experiments, PC12 cells were cultured with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) for 0, 3, 6, or 9 h, after which cell lysates were prepared and subjected (30 μg of protein) to immunoblot analysis. The amount of FEZ1 was quantified with Image Gauge Version 3.45 software (Science Lab). Assay of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)-induced Neuritogenesis in PC12 Cells—PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. They were subsequently seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated 2-cm2 dishes at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2. After incubation overnight in the same culture medium, the cells were exposed for 3 days to NGF (50 ng/ml; Alomone Labs) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% horse serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. The cells were then examined by phase-contrast microscopy, and photographs were taken at ×40 magnification. About 100 cells were scored for the presence of neurites with a length greater than the diameter of the soma. Retroviral Expression System—cDNAs encoding mouse wild-type E4B or E4B(P1140A) containing an N-terminal FLAG tag and a cDNA for human FEZ1 containing an N-terminal Myc epitope tag were subcloned into pMX-puro (kindly provided by T. Kitamura), and the resulting vectors were used to transfect Plat E cells and thereby to generate recombinant retroviruses. PC12 cells were infected with the recombinant retroviruses and subjected to selection in medium containing puromycin (5 μg/ml) for 14 days. Cells expressing the recombinant proteins were pooled for experiments. RNA Interference—The pMX-puro II vector was constructed by deletion of the U3 portion of the 3′-long terminal repeat of pMX-puro. The mouse U6 gene promoter followed by a DNA sequence encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was subcloned into the NotI and XhoI sites of pMX-puro II, yielding pMX-puro II-U6/shRNA. The DNA sequence for the shRNA comprised two 21-nucleotide complementary tracts specific for the mRNA target separated by a loop sequence (-TTCAAGAGA-) and followed by a string of five T nucleotides to terminate transcription. The hairpin sequences specific for mouse E4B and enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clontech) mRNAs corresponded to nucleotides 2466–2486 and nucleotides 126–146 of the respective coding regions. Recombinant retroviruses were generated and used to infect PC12 cells as described above. After selection in medium containing puromycin (5 μg/ml), cells stably expressing the shRNAs were pooled for experiments. Electroporation and X-Gal Staining—PC12 cells (2.0 × 107) were suspended in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum and containing 33 μg of pCGN-HA-PKCζ, 38 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-E4B, and 4 μg of pcDNA3.1-LacZ-Myc-His6 as a reporter plasmid (10:10:1 molar ratio). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cells were subjected to electroporation using a Gene-Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 1.25 kV/cm and 975 microfarads. The cells were then incubated on ice for an additional 10 min before plating in the same culture medium on 10-cm Petri dishes coated with poly-l-lysine. After culture for 72 h, the cells were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity with X-gal as described previously (26Kuroda S. Nakagawa N. Tokunaga C. Tatematsu K. Tanizawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). About 100 β-galactosidase-positive (blue) cells were scored by phase-contrast microscopy for the presence of neurites with a length greater than the diameter of the soma. FEZ1 Interacts with E4B—We screened a human brain cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid assay and the U-box domain of mouse E4B (amino acids 919–1173) as bait. From 1 × 106 transformants that were able to grow on Leu- and Trp-deficient medium, eight positive clones were isolated after two rounds of growth in the absence of His and screening for β-galactosidase activity. The nucleotide sequence of one of these eight clones was highly homologous to that of human FEZ1 cDNA. To determine whether E4B and FEZ1 interact in mammalian cells, we stably transfected PC12 cells with an expression plasmid encoding Myc epitope-tagged FEZ1. Lysates of the transfected cells were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody, and the resulting precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-E4B antibody (Fig. 1A). Endogenous E4B was detected in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates but not in control precipitates, indicating that Myc-FEZ1 specifically interacts with endogenous E4B in mammalian cells. Immunoblot analysis of HA-tagged FEZ1 expressed in HEK293T cells with anti-HA antibodies revealed that these antibodies recognized several bands, suggesting that the lower mobility bands might correspond to phosphorylated FEZ1 (Fig. 1B). Given that FEZ1 is phosphorylated by PKCζ (26Kuroda S. Nakagawa N. Tokunaga C. Tatematsu K. Tanizawa K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 403-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this phosphorylation might affect the interaction between E4B and FEZ1. The mobility shift of FEZ1 was enhanced by expression of caPKCζ. The extent of the interaction between HA-FEZ1 and FLAG-E4B was markedly greater in cells expressing caPKCζ than in those expressing the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1B), suggesting that phosphorylation of FEZ1 by PKCζ promotes its interaction with E4B. We also generated various deletion mutants of E4B (Fig. 1C) and examined them for the ability to interact with FEZ1 (Fig. 1D). Although we identified FEZ1 as a protein that interacts with the U-box domain of E4B, E4BΔC, which lacks the C-terminal region containing the U-box domain, interacted with FEZ1 as well as did wild-type E4B. E4BΔNM, which lacks the N-terminal and middle regions, and E4BΔNC, which lacks the N- and C-terminal regions, weakly associated with FEZ1, whereas E4BΔMC, which lacks the middle and C-terminal regions, did not bind to FEZ1. These findings suggest that multiple sites of E4B contribute to the interaction with FEZ1. Polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 Mediated by E4B in Vivo and in Vitro—We next investigated whether the interaction of FEZ1 with the U-box-type ubiquitin ligase E4B results in the polyubiquitylation of the former by the latter. Coexpression of FLAG-E4B with HA-FEZ1 in HEK293T cells resulted in a marked increase in the extent of polyubiquitylation of HA-FEZ1 (Fig. 2A). To rule out the possibility that a protein bound to FEZ1 was polyubiquitylated by E4B, we transfected HEK293T cells with a vector for His6-ubiquitin as well as with vectors for HA-FEZ1 and FLAG-E4B and then purified the His6-ubiquitin-labeled proteins under denaturing conditions (Fig. 2B). This approach again showed that overexpression of E4B increased the ubiquitylation of FEZ1. Given that expression of caPKCζ enhanced the interaction between E4B and FEZ1 (Fig. 1B), we examined the effect of caPKCζ on the polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 by E4B. Coexpression of caPKCζ with E4B further increased the polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 compared with overexpression of E4B alone or E4B and wild-type PKCζ (Fig. 2B). These results thus indicate that E4B catalyzes the polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 in mammalian cells. We also performed an in vitro ubiquitylation assay with His6-Myc-tagged FEZ1 that was expressed in and purified from Sf21 insect cells (Fig. 2C). FEZ1 was polyubiquitylated by recombinant E4B that was also expressed in and purified from Sf21 cells (Fig. 2C, compare fifth and eighth lanes), and this reaction was dependent on the presence of ATP, ubiquitin, E1, and E2 (UbcH5c). To investigate the relationship between phosphorylation and polyubiquitylation of FEZ1, experiments with phosphatase treatment of FEZ1 were performed. HA-FEZ1 was coexpressed with caPKCζ in HEK293T cells, and the lysates of the cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. Treatment of the immunoprecipitates with λ-protein phosphatase resulted in the disappearance of the lower mobility form of FEZ1 (Fig. 2D, compare third and fourth lanes). These results thus suggest that phosphorylation is responsible for the observed shift in the electrophoretic mobility of FEZ1. Furthermore, phosphatase treatment significantly decreased the polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 (Fig. 2D), suggesting that phosphorylation of this protein is critical for its polyubiquitylation. E4B-mediated Ubiquitylation Does Not Induce the Degradation of FEZ1—Pulse-chase analysis revealed that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone inhibited the degradation of HA-FEZ1 expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that FEZ1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We therefore examined the possible effect of overexpression of E4B or CHIP, another member of the U-box family of ubiquitin ligases, on the degradation of FEZ1. However, overexpression of neither E4B nor CHIP affected the stability of FEZ1, whereas MG132 markedly inhibited FEZ1 degradation in the same cells (Fig. 3, B–D). These results suggest that E4B-mediated ubiquitylation does not promote the degradation of FEZ1 by the proteasome. Inhibition of E4B Function by a Dominant-negative Mutant—We have shown that Pro1140 in the U-box domain of E4B is highly conserved in all U-box-type E3 enzymes and is essential for E3 activity (11Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). A mutant form of E4B in which Pro1140 is replaced with alanine (P1140A) might thus be expected to function in a dominant-negative manner. As with the interaction between wild-type E4B and FEZ1, that between E4B(P1140A) and FEZ1 was increased by expression of caPKCζ (Fig. 4A), although the extent of the increase was less pronounced than that observed with wild-type E4B. To examine the possible dominant-negative effect of E4B(P1140A), we performed in vitro ubiquitylation assays with wild-type E4B and FEZ1 in the presence of various amounts of E4B(P1140A) (Fig. 4B). E4B(P1140A) markedly inhibited the polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 mediated by wild-type E4B in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of E4B(P1140A) in HEK293T cells also inhibited the polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 induced by wild-type E4B (Fig. 4C). These in vitro and in vivo findings thus suggest that E4B(P1140A) acts in a dominant-negative manner. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that the turnover rate of FEZ1 in HEK293T cells was not affected by overexpression of wild-type E4B or E4B(P1140A), even in the presence of caPKCζ (Fig. 5). The degradation of FEZ1 was again inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating that FEZ1 is degraded by the proteasome under these conditions. These data thus provide further support for the notion that the polyubiquitylation of FEZ1 mediated by E4B does not result in FEZ1 degradation. E4B Does Not Promote the Degradation of FEZ1 in PC12 Cells—To examine whether E4B promotes the degradation of endogenous FEZ1 in PC12 cells, we infected the cells with recombinant retroviruses encoding either FLAG-E4B or FLAG-E4B(P1140A) or with the corresponding empty virus. Cell clones stably expressing the exogenous proteins were established and examined for FEZ1 stability by treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with anti-FEZ1 antibody revealed that the turnover rate of FEZ1 was not affected by expression of either wild-type E4B or the dominant-negative E4B(P1140A) mutant (Fig. 6).

We have demonstrated that Siah2 targets TRAF2 for proteasome-dependent degradation under stress conditions, which is required for the cell to commit to undergoing apoptosis (11Habelhah H. Frew I.J. Laine A. Janes P.W. Relaix F. Sassoon D. Bowtell D.D. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5756-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Siah, which is structurally very similar to the TRAF-C domain of the TRAF family of proteins, serves as the substrate binding domain for Siah substrates (12Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Common to both sina and Siah proteins is their association with phyllopod and SIP, respectively, adaptor proteins that mediate efficient targeting of Siah substrates (13Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). A search for novel Siah2 substrates led to the identification of prolyl hydroxylases PHD1 and PHD3 as Siah2-binding proteins. Siah1a and Siah2 regulate the abundance of both PHD1 and PHD3 by targeting their proteasome-dependent degradation more under hypoxic than normoxic conditions, thereby constituting a novel layer in the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1α) stability, as in the regulation of the cellular hypoxia response (15Nakayama K. Frew I.J. Hagensen M. Skals M. Habelhah H. Bhoumik A. Kadoya T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Frappell P.B. Bowtell D.D. Ronai Z.

The same analysis also identified an E2 subunit of the 2-oxoglutaric acid dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC) (also known as the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex), which serves as a rate-limiting enzyme in the Krebs cycle as a Siah2-associated protein. Chronic hypoxia and oxidative stress decrease OGDHC activity, especially in brain regions (olfactory bulb, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum) (16Lai J.C. White B.K.

Sci. 1999; 893: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A decrease in OGDHC activity is also noted in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including thiamine deficiency, and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (18Gibson G.E. Park L.C. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. Calingasan N.Y. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 36: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease that affects predominantly women and is characterized by the progressive destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts with portal inflammation and ultimately fibrosis (19Gershwin M.E. Ansari A.A. Mackay I.R. Nakanuma Y. Nishio A. Rowley M.J. Coppel R.L. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 174: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The serological hallmark of PBC is the presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies directed against E2 components of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex family (2-OADHC-E2), including the E2 component of the OGDHC (OGDHC-E2), the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC-E2), and the branched chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADHC-E2) (19Gershwin M.E. Ansari A.A. Mackay I.R. Nakanuma Y. Nishio A. Rowley M.J. Coppel R.L. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 174: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of 2-OADHC-E2 is often seen in biliary epithelial cells (BEC) in the natural history of PBC, as well as in BEC in allografts of patients with recurrent PBC following liver transplantation (20Joplin R.E.

Ansari A. Gershwin M.E. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these antigens have a causative role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of PBC. 2-OADHC-E2 proteins are localized normally within the mitochondrial matrix. Enhanced synthesis, impaired degradation, or abnormal targeting of these E2s to the surface and apical regions of BEC may induce the production of anti-2-OADHC-E2 antibodies, which in turn induces an autoimmune response resulting in the selective destruction of BEC in PBC patients (19Gershwin M.E. Ansari A.A. Mackay I.R. Nakanuma Y. Nishio A. Rowley M.J. Coppel R.L. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 174: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of PDHC-E2, OGDHC-E2, and BCOADHC-E2 mRNA, however, does not reveal differences in the number of transcripts present in PBC compared with other liver diseases (24Harada K. Sudo Y. Kono N. Ozaki S. Tsuneyama K. Gershwin M.E. Nakanuma Y. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that the elevated expression of E2 is the result of post-translational events. In the present study, we demonstrate that both Siah1 and Siah2 bind specifically to OGDHC-E2 and target the precursor form of OGDHC-E2 or the OGDHC-E2 that is released from mitochondria for ubiquitination-dependent degradation. Our data highlight a newly recognized function for the Siah family of ligases, which act through the regulation of OGDHC-E2 stability under certain pathological conditions. Cell Culture and Reagents—HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with calf serum (10%) and antibiotics. Wild-type and Siah2-/- MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), 0.02 mm β-mercaptoethanol, sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics.

GST-OGDHC-E2 was generated by cloning OGDHC-E2 cDNA in-frame into pGEX-4T-2. All plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. FLAG-Siah2 and GST-Siah2 plasmids were described previously (11Habelhah H.

Identification of OGDC-E2 as a Siah-binding Protein—A FLAG-Siah2-Rm or an empty pCDNA3 (as a control) plasmid was transfected into 293T cells (40 plates). 36 h after transfection, cells were washed and harvested, and cell pellets were lysed in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm NaVO3, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice. The lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation at 37,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and FLAG-Siah2-Rm was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads.

The cellular lysates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min in a swing-out rotor, and then the supernatants were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. Postmitochondria supernatants were further centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used as the cytoplasm protein fraction.

In Vitro Binding Assay—Bacterially expressed and purified GST, GST-OGDHC-E2, or GST-Siah2 bound to glutathione beads was incubated first with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation with 35S-labeled Siah2 or OGDHC-E2, which was in vitro translated using the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Bead-bound materials were washed four times with PBS containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm EDTA before being subjected to separation by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—In vitro translated [35S]OGDHC-E2 was subjected to an in vitro ubiquitination assay in ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NaF, and 3 μm okadaic acid) supplemented with purified HA-ubiquitin (0.5 μg), 2 mm ATP, E1 (15 ng) (Affinity Research, Exeter, UK), purified E2 (UbcH5b) (0.5 μg), and/or purified Siah2 for 45 min at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were then separated on 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to detect OGDHC-E2 ubiquitination. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—FLAG-OGDHC-E2 (1.0 μg) and/or HA-ubiquitin (2.0 μg) was transfected into HeLa cells. Thirty-six hours later, cells were treated with or without MG132 for 4 h, cell pellets were lysed, and FLAG-OGDHC-E2 was immunoprecipitated as described previously (27Habelhah H. Takahashi S. Cho S.G. Kadoya T. Watanabe T. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Bead-bound proteins were then eluted in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-HA Ab. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG Ab. OGDHC Activity Assay—The activity of OGDHC was assayed by measuring the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm (16Lai J.C. White B.K. Buerstatte C.R. Haddad G.G. Novotny Jr., E.J. Behar K.L. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate chloride, 2 mm NAD+, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm α-ketoglutarate, 0.1 mm CoA, and 25 μg of mitochondrial proteins. The reaction was initiated by the addition of CoA, and the initial rate was measured. The OGDHC activities obtained from wild-type MEF or 293T cells that were transfected with empty pCDNA3 were set as 100%, and the rest were calculated relative to the value of control. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—OGDHC-E2-HA-transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated for 1 min in permeabilization buffer (0.3% Triton X-100, 3 mm MgCl2, and 6.8% sucrose). After blocking the cells with 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 30 min, cells were incubated with 2.0 μg/ml anti-HA Ab for 1 h, washed, and further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary Ab (1:1000 dilutions) for 1 h. After they were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, coverslips were inverted and mounted on slides with Vectashield and affixed with nail polish. Fluorescence was monitored using a Leica TCS-SP (UV) confocal microscope. Identification of OGDHC-E2 as a Siah-binding Protein—To identify novel Siah2-binding proteins that might serve as adaptors or substrates, we expressed FLAG-tagged and RING domain-mutated Siah2 (FLAG-Siah2-Rm) in 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody and separation by two-dimensional PAGE. The selection of Siah2-bound proteins was based on a comparison with control immunoprecipitation, subject to the same analysis (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry analysis identified three of six positive spots as components of OGDHC, as follows: E1 (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (gene name OGDH)), E2 (dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (gene name DLST)), and E3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (gene name DLD)). OGDHC is a rate-limiting enzyme complex in the tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle, localized within the mitochondrial matrix, which converts α-ketoglutarate to high energy succinyl-CoA and CO2 and reduces NAD+ to NADH (18Gibson G.E. Park L.C. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. Calingasan N.Y. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 36: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An in vitro GST fusion protein pull-down assay confirmed that both Siah1 and Siah2 interact efficiently with OGDHC-E2 (Fig. 1B). OGDHC-E3 is a common subunit for all 2-OADHC family members, and Siah2 binding to OGDHC-E1 was very weak (Fig. 1A). We thus elucidated the role of Siah in the regulation of OGDHC-E2 stability and activity. Siah2 Binds to OGDHC-E2 in Vivo—Both Siah1 and Siah2 bind efficiently to OGDHC-E2 in vitro (Fig. 1B). To confirm this interaction in vivo, we expressed FLAG-tagged wild-type Siah1, Siah2, or RING mutant Siah2 in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation of exogenously expressed Siah followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies to endogenously expressed OGDHC-E2 revealed that RING mutant FLAG-Siah2 associated efficiently with endogenous OGDHC-E2 in vivo (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis using antibodies to OGDHC-E2 also revealed this interaction in vivo (Fig. 1D, lane 3). In contrast, PDHC-E2, another major autoantigen overexpressed in liver BEC cells in early stage PBC patients (19Gershwin M.E. Ansari A.A. Mackay I.R. Nakanuma Y. Nishio A. Rowley M.J. Coppel R.L. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 174: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), was not found as a Siah2-binding protein (Fig. 1E). Siah2 Targets Exogenously Expressed OGDHC-E2 for Ubiquitination and Degradation—Siah2 is a potent E3 ligase that targets most but not all of its associated proteins for proteasome-dependent degradation (11Habelhah H. Frew I.J. Laine A. Janes P.W. Relaix F. Sassoon D. Bowtell D.D. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5756-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Nakayama K. Frew I.J. Hagensen M. Skals M. Habelhah H. Bhoumik A. Kadoya T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Frappell P.B. Bowtell D.D. Ronai Z. Cell. 2004; 117: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To determine whether Siah2 targets OGDHC-E2 for ubiquitination and degradation, we generated two different OGDHC-E2 expression vectors, FLAG-OGDHC-E2, in which the FLAG tag was added to the N terminus of OGDHC-E2 cDNA, and OGDHC-E2-HA, in which the HA tag was added to the C terminus of OGDHC-E2. Expression of these two plasmids in 293T cells followed by Western blot analysis revealed that FLAG-OGDHC-E2 migrates as a 62-kDa protein, whereas OGDHC-E2-HA migrates as a 52-kDa protein (Fig. 2A). Common to mitochondrial proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm and imported to the mitochondria and also seen in OGDHC-E2 is an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is cleaved proteolytically on import into the mitochondria, generating the mature form of the protein. We failed to detect the precursor form of OGDHC-E2-HA by Western blot even after exogenous overexpression (Fig. 2A). Because removal of mitochondrial targeting sequence takes place within the mitochondria, the lack of a precursor form of OGDHC-E2-HA indicates that OGDHC-E2 is imported into mitochondria immediately after translation. The attachment of the FLAG tag in front of the mitochondrial targeting sequence impaired the efficient import of OGDHC-E2 into mitochondria (Fig. 2A). The expression of wild-type HA-Siah2 efficiently reduced the steady-state level of FLAG-OGDHC-E2, whereas the expression of RING mutant HA-Siah2 increased the level of FLAG-OGDHC-E2 (Fig. 2B). The Siah2-induced decrease in the FLAG-OGDHC-E2 protein level is proteasome-dependent, because it is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2B, lane 5). The expression of FLAG-Siah1 or FLAG-Siah2 also reduced the steady-state level of OGDHC-E2-HA (Fig. 2C). An in vivo ubiquitination assay also revealed that Siah2 induces FLAG-OGDHC-E2 ubiquitination in vivo, which is detected on treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 2D, lane 5). In addition, bacterially expressed and purified Siah2 also efficiently targeted in vitro translated [35S]OGDHC-E2 for ubiquitination in vitro (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these data establish the role of Siah2 in mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of OGDHC-E2. Siah2 Limits the Protein Level and Enzymatic Activity of OGDHC-E2 by Targeting Its Precursor Form for Degradation—To assess the role of Siah2 in bringing about endogenous OGDHC-E2 abundance, we exogenously expressed the wild-type and RING mutant Siah2 in 293T cells and analyzed the steady-state level of endogenous OGDHC-E2. Neither form of exogenously expressed Siah2 affected the steady-state levels of OGDHC-E2 significantly within 36 h after transfection (Fig. 3A). However, 72 h after transfection, wild-type Siah2, but not RING mutant Siah2, efficiently decreased the steady-state level of endogenous OGDHC-E2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In line with this, OGDHC activities were also inhibited by exogenous overexpression of wild-type Siah2 but not by RING mutant Siah2 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, these data revealed that under normal growth conditions Siah2 targets the precursor form of OGDHC-E2 for ubiquitination-dependent degradation and that the OGDHC-E2 that is localized within the mitochondria is protected from Siah2-mediated degradation. Expression and Activity of OGDHC-E2 Are Elevated in Siah2-/-Cells—To further assess the role of Siah2 in the regulation of OGDHC-E2 stability, we used MEFs prepared from Siah2+/+ and Siah2-/- mice. Interestingly, steady-state levels of endogenous OGDHC-E2 were found to be elevated in Siah2-/- MEF cells compared with those in the Siah2+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3D). These data provide important genetically based support for the observation that Siah2 can target the degradation of a precursor form of OGDHC-E2. Along these lines, analysis of OGDHC-E2 activity also revealed an increase in the enzymatic activity of the protein that coincides with the increase seen in the steady-state level of the protein (Fig. 3E). Exposure to TNFα and actinomycin D, which causes apoptosis, a condition that is expected to release OGDHC-E2 from the mitochondria and make it available for Siah2 activity, did not reveal changes in the steady-state levels of OGDHC-E2 within the first 4 h (Fig. 3D), although such changes were observed at later time points (see below). Reconstitution experiments revealed that exogenous expression of wild-type but not RING mutant Siah2 in Siah2-/- MEF cells decreased the steadystate level of OGDHC-E2 within 72 h after transfection (Fig. 3F). However, pulse-chase analysis did not reveal significant differences in the half-life of OGDHC-E2 between Siah2+/+ and Siah2-/- MEF cells (data not shown), suggesting that the difference seen in the steady-state level can be attributed to a higher amount of precursor protein that reaches the mitochondria, where it is protected from Siah2 E3 ligase activities. These data further confirm that Siah2 targets the precursor form of OGDHC-E2 for degradation. OGDHC-E2 from Which the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence Has Been Deleted Is Degraded Rapidly in Siah2+/+but Not in Siah2-/-Cells—Given that OGDHC-E2 is protected against Siah2 while residing in the mitochondria and in light of the differences observed in the steady state level of the protein between Siah2-/- and Siah2+/+ MEFs, we further elucidated the ability of Siah2 to elicit degradation of the cytoplasm-resident form of OGDHC-E2. To this end we generated an OGDHC-E2 expression vector in which an HA tag was added to the C terminus of the protein and the mitochondrial targeting sequence was deleted (ΔM-OGDHC-E2-HA). The expression of ΔM-OGDHC-E2-HA in 293T cells revealed that it is substantially less stable compared with the wild-type form of the protein and that it is subject to efficient proteasome-dependent degradation (Fig. 4A). An analysis of ΔM-OGDHC-E2-HA expression levels in Siah2+/+ and Siah2-/- MEF cells revealed that it is more stable in Siah2-/- than in Siah2+/+ MEF cells (Fig. 4B). These findings establish the role of Siah2 in targeting the degradation of OGDHC-E2 that lacks its mitochondrial targeting signal. Indeed, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that ΔM-OGDHC-E2-HA is located diffusely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these observations substantiate the role of Siah2 in targeting the degradation of cytoplasmic-resident forms of OGDHC-E2. Two possible forms that are expected to be targeted by Siah2 are the precursor form, prior to its entry into the mitochondria, and the mature form, on its leakage from the mitochondria. Overexpression or Disruption of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Causes OGDHC-E2 Release from Mitochondria and Its Degradation in Cytoplasm—The overexpression of OGDHC-E2-HA in 293T cells resulted in abundant expression within the mitochondria but also in leakage of the 52-kDa mature form of OGDHC-E2-HA from the mitochondria, which is seen more clearly in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5A). This finding suggests that the leakage of mature OGDHC-E2-HA into the cytoplasm renders it unstable. To further substantiate this observation, we treated cells with a mitochondria-specific ionophore (CCCP) that disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential (28Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Exposure to CCCP (20 μm for 4 h) resulted in the release of more OGDHC-E2-HA from mitochondria to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the treatment of HeLa cells with CCCP (50 μm for 8 h) induced the release of endogenous OGDHC-E2 from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, which was detectable only in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the treatment of MEF cells with CCCP (50 μm) or mTNFα/actinomycin D (10 ng/ml and 2 μg/ml) for 8 h induced the release of endogenous OGDHC-E2 from mitochondria, which was detectable in Siah2-/- but not in Siah2+/+ cells without MG132 treatment (Fig. 5C). More importantly, treatment of MEF cells with a high dose of mTNFα (50 ng/ml) alone was sufficient to induce the release of OGDHC-E2 from mitochondria, which was also detectable in Siah2-/- MEF cells without treating the cells with proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that Siah2 limits the availability of OGDHC-E2 that is released from the mitochondria on its overexpression or change in mitochondrial membrane potential. The present study identified and characterized OGDHC-E2 as a newly recognized substrate for the RING finger E3 ligase Siah2. In vitro and in vivo data provided direct support for the association and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of OG-DHC-E2 by Siah. Importantly, Siah2-/- cells exhibited elevated expression and activity of OGDHC-E2, providing genetic evidence for the regulation of OGDHC-E2 stability by Siah. Given the localization of OGDHC-E2 within the inner mitochondrial matrix, the ability of Siah2 to affect the stability of E2 was limited to situations in which E2 is situated within the cytoplasm. Under physiological conditions, OGDHC-E2 is imported into the inner matrix of the double layer of the mitochondrial membrane immediately after translation in the cytoplasm (29Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). It is therefore plausible that OGDHC-E2 could be targeted by Siah2 for degradation prior to its entry into the mitochondria when it is present as a proenzyme. Our data support this possibility because we provide evidence of the ability of Siah to decrease the stability of OGDHC-E2 in which the N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal has been deleted. Thus, the disruption of the OGDHC-E2 import is expected to result in lower amounts of this enzyme within the mitochondria and concomitantly limits mitochondrial metabolism. Alternatively, an increase in the Siah activity could also result in a more potent degradation of E2, which would limit its availability and activity. A decrease in the activity of the OGDHC complex is reported to take place in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer and Parkinson patients. Whether the reported changes in OGDHC are the result of an elevated activity of the Siah family of ubiquitin ligases has yet to be determined. Because Siah proteins are virtually undetectable in Western blots owing to their strong E3 ligase activity, which also limits their own availability, a simple analysis such as immunostaining is not possible. Of note, Siah2 expression and activity increase in hypoxia (15Nakayama K. Frew I.J. Hagensen M. Skals M. Habelhah H. Bhoumik A. Kadoya T. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Frappell P.B. Bowtell D.D. Ronai Z. Cell. 2004; 117: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), suggesting that certain hypoxia and stress conditions may increase Siah2 activity, which may decrease OGDHC activity. An alternate antecedent one can envision for the effect of Siah on OGDHC-E2 occurs when OGDHC-E2 is released from the mitochondria. The latter takes place on disruption of the mitochondrial membrane, as is often seen during programmed cell death. Indeed, treating cells with compounds that cause apoptosis results in the presence of OGDHC-E2 within the cytoplasm, which can be observed in Siah2-/- cells even in the absence of proteasome inhibitors. This finding suggests that for cases in which there is a decrease in the activity of Siah2, conditions may result in the accumulation of OGDHC-E2 entering into or being released from the mitochondria. PDHC-E2, OGDHC-E2, and BCOADHC-E2 are expressed abnormally in the apical region of BEC and are major targets of autoantibodies to mitochondria proteins in PBC patients (19Gershwin M.E. Ansari A.A.

Nakanuma Y. Coppel R.L. Gershwin M.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5157-5163PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of these autoantigens did not reveal an increase in mRNA transcription in the BEC cells of PBC patients (24Harada K. Sudo Y. Kono N. Ozaki S. Tsuneyama K. Gershwin M.E. Nakanuma Y. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), indicating that abnormal expression of these autoantigens in BEC cells is a post-translational event, consistent with the possibility that impaired degradation of OGDHC-E2 could be the cause of this condition. Taken together, our findings provide the first insight into the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of a mitochondrial protein, OGDHC-E2. Siah2-mediated degradation of OGDHC-E2 attenuates the activity of this key mitochondrial enzyme and is therefore expected to affect the energy-metabolic function of the mitochondria. Such changes are not expected to occur under normal physiologic conditions but rather when Siah expression and/or activities are modified. Because changes in the expression and activity of OGDHC-E2 are often seen in several pathological disorders, our findings may point to a mechanism that underlies impaired mitochondrial function in neurodegenerative disorders as well as in autoimmune disorders associated with primary biliary liver cirrhosis.

By combining genetic and biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that two enzymes, Rib2/Pus8p and Pus9p, are required for Ψ32 formation in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs, respectively. Pus9p acts mostly in mitochondria, and Rib2/Pus8p is strictly cytoplasmic. This is the first case reported so far of two distinct tRNA modification enzymes acting at the same position but present in two different compartments. This peculiarity may be the consequence of a gene fusion that occurred during yeast evolution. Indeed, Rib2/Pus8p displays two distinct catalytic activities involved in completely unrelated metabolism: its C-terminal domain has a DRAP-deaminase activity required for riboflavin biogenesis in the cytoplasm, whereas its N-terminal domain carries the tRNA:Ψ32-synthase activity. Pus9p has only a tRNA:Ψ32-synthase activity and contains a characteristic mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N terminus. These results are discussed in terms of RNA:Ψ-synthase evolution.

Pseudouridine residues are formed post-transcriptionally by a group of enzymes called RNA:Ψ-synthases (1Kammen H.O. Marvel C.C. Hardy L. Penhoet E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2255-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For a long time, the Escherichia coli RNA:Ψ-synthases were the only ones to be identified (3Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nurse K. Wrzesinski J. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 102-112PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ofengand J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Search for homologs of E. coli RNA:Ψ-synthases in genomic data banks of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya led to the identification of four families of RNA:Ψ-synthases (families TruA, TruB, RluA, and RsuA) (2Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Using this sequence homology approach, nine genes encoding putative RNA:Ψ-synthases were identified in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Six of them correspond to the already characterized RNA:Ψ-synthases (pseudouridine synthases Pus1p, Pus3p, Pus4p, Pus5p, Pus6p, and Cbf5p). Pus1p and Pus3p are TruA-related proteins. Pus1p is a multisite-specific RNA:Ψ-synthase acting at seven different positions in various cytoplasmic tRNAs (positions 26, 27, 28, 34, 36, 65, and 67), as well as at position 44 in U2 snRNA (6Simos G.

Pus3p catalyzes Ψ formation at positions 38 and 39 in the anticodon stem-loop of several cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (9Lecointe F. Simos G. Sauer A. Hurt E.C. Motorin Y. Grosjean H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1316-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Like the E. coli TruB enzyme, the related yeast Pus4p is responsible for the formation of the highly conserved Ψ residue at position 55 in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (10Becker H.F. Motorin Y. Planta R.J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4493-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probably as much as 40 Ψ residues in yeast cytoplasmic rRNAs are formed by a unique enzyme of the TruB family, Cbf5p, that is guided by H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs (11Lafontaine D.L.J.

Fabrizio P. Mann M. Lührmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1549-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A unique Ψ residue is present in yeast mitochondrial rRNA, and its formation is catalyzed by Pus5p, a member of the RluA family (13Ansmant I. Massenet S. Grosjean H. Motorin Y. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Pus6p, another member of the RluA family, is responsible for Ψ formation at position 31 in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (14Ansmant I. Motorin Y. Massenet S. Grosjean H. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34934-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pus7p, which was not listed initially among the putative RNA: Ψ-synthases because of its divergent amino acid sequence, was identified as an U2 snRNA:Ψ-synthase (15Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that it acts at position 13 in cytoplasmic tRNAs and position 35 in the pre-tRNATyr (16Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Presently, only three of the putative RNA:Ψ-synthases identified by Koonin (2Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) have no assigned RNA substrate: Pus2p, a TruA-related protein, and two proteins of the RluA family. They are encoded by the YDL036 and RIB2 (YOL066) ORFs, respectively. In addition to its potential RNA:Ψ-synthase encoding capacity, the S. cerevisiae RIB2 gene was described a long time ago as encoding a DRAP-deaminase. This enzyme catalyzes the deamination of the 2,5-diamino-6-ribitylamino-4(3H)-pyrimidinone 5′-phosphate (DRAP) into 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione 5′-phosphate in the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway (17Bacher A. Eberhardt S. Eisenreich W. Fischer M. Herz S. Illarionov B. Kis K. Richter G. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 1-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The implication of the RIB2 gene in riboflavin biosynthesis was demonstrated by genetic approaches (18Oltmanns O. Bacher A. Lingens F. Zimmermann F.K. Mol. Gen.

Genetika. 1979; 15: 1561-1568PubMed Google Scholar). However, the deaminase activity of Rib2p was never demonstrated directly. On the other hand, the activity and function of the putative RNA:Ψ-synthase domain present in Rib2p remained obscure. In yeast, only rRNAs, tRNAs, and UsnRNAs are known to be the substrates of RNA:Ψ-synthases. The S. cerevisiae cytoplasmic tRNAs contain altogether 15 pseudouridylation sites, and 8 additional ones were detected in mitochondrial tRNAs (20Sprinzl S. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Several of these modification sites are common to cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs, and the RNA:Ψ-synthases responsible for their formation have been identified (Fig. 1). Only the enzymes responsible for the formation of residue Ψ1 found in two cytoplasmic tRNAs (tRNAArg(ACG) and tRNALys(UUU)), Ψ72 found in the mitochondrial tRNAMeti-(CAU), and Ψ32, a frequent modification, present in the anticodon loop of 14 cytoplasmic tRNAs and 7 mitochondrial tRNAs, have not been characterized yet. The presence of Ψ32 was shown to stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the anticodon loop of tRNAGln by its implication in a water bridge interaction (21Arnez J.G. Steitz T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7560-7567Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Auffinger P. Westhof E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 326-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was thus important to look for the enzyme(s) responsible for Ψ32 formation in tRNAs. As far as the UsnRNAs are concerned, only the enzymes responsible for the formation of 2 of the 6 pseudouridines identified in these RNAs are known (8Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Ma X. Zhao X. Yu Y.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1889-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The enzymes that catalyze the U to Ψ conversion at positions 5 and 6 in U1 snRNA, 42 in U2 snRNA, and 99 in U5 snRNA remain to be characterized. In this work, by use of strains with disrupted RIB2 and/or YDL036 ORF(s), and by production of the recombinant proteins, encoded by these two ORFs, we demonstrated that these two proteins, now renamed Rib2/Pus8p and Pus9p, respectively, are tRNA:Ψ32-synthases. Rib2/Pus8p acts on cytoplasmic tRNAs, whereas Pus9p modifies the same position in mitochondrial tRNAs. Accordingly, the corresponding ORFs are renamed as RIB2/PUS8 and PUS9. Deletions of the PUS9(YDL036c) and RIB2/PUS8(YOL066c) ORFs in S. cerevisiae—Deletions of the PUS9(YDL036c) and RIB2/PUS8(YOL066c) ORFs were performed in the diploid BMA64 (MATa/α; ura3–52; trp1Δ2; leu2–3_112; his3–11; ade2–1; can1–100) and haploid BMA64A (Mata) S. cerevisiae strains, by replacement of the entire coding regions by the TRP1 auxotrophic marker that was amplified from plasmid pFL35 (23Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). Positive transformants (pus9Δ::TRP1 and rib2/pus8Δ::TRP1) were selected on YNB plates lacking tryptophan. Independent deletion of the RIB2/PUS8 ORF was also done by substitution for the Kanr gene followed by selection on Geneticin G418 (200 mg/liter). The Kanr gene was amplified from plasmid pFA6a-kanMX2 (23Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). A haploid strain with simultaneous deletion of both the PUS9 and RIB2/PUS8 ORFs was also prepared by replacement of the RIB2/PUS8 ORF by the Kanr resistance gene in the pus9Δ::TRP1 haploid strain. Positive transformants (pus9Δ::TRP1/rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr) were selected in the presence of riboflavin (15 mg/liter) on YNB plates containing Geneticin G418 (200 mg/liter), but lacking tryptophan. All gene disruptions were confirmed by PCR amplification on yeast colonies. Sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in this study can be obtained on request. Complementation of the Disrupted Strains—To generate S. cerevisiae plasmids expressing proteins encoded by PUS9 and RIB2/PUS8 ORFs in a functional form, these ORFs were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of the S. cerevisiae BMA64 strain using oligonucleotides that generated NheI and HindIII restriction sites at the N and C termini, respectively. The amplified DNA fragments were subcloned at the SmaI site of plasmid pUC18. After sequencing, the resulting constructs (pUC18-PUS9 and pUC18-RIB2/PUS8) were cleaved by the NheI and HindIII restriction endonucleases, and the fragments containing the complete ORFs were inserted, downstream from the GalS promoter, between the XbaI and HindIII sites of plasmid p416GalS (24Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Several mutants of these constructions were prepared: point mutations in the regions coding the putative RNA:Ψ-synthase active site of both ORFs were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (D238A, GAT → GCT for PUS9 and D211A, GAC → GCC for RIB2/PUS8). By application of the megaprimer approach to plasmid pUC18-RIB2/PUS8, we also produced genes encoding N-terminally (amino acids 1–448) or C-terminally (amino acids 450–591) truncated Rib2/Pus8p. The truncated genes were PCR-amplified, cut by the NheI and BamHI restriction endonucleases, and inserted into plasmid p416GalS to generate the p416GalS-RIB2/PUS8ΔPUS8 and the p416GalS-RIB2/PUS8ΔDRAP plasmids. For PCR amplification of the C-terminally truncated RIB2/PUS8 gene, we used an oligonucleotide that created a UAA STOP codon. Deletion of the mitochondrial targeting sequence in the PUS9 ORF (amino acids 8–30) was done by PCR amplification. Yeast transformations were performed by the standard lithium acetate procedure (25Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins—Plasmids pET28-PUS9 and pET28-RIB2/PUS8 were built for overexpression of the recombinant His6-Pus9p and His6-Rib2/Pus8p proteins in E. coli. To this end, the NheI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pUC18-PUS9 or the NheI-BamHI fragment of pUC18-RIB2/PUS8 was inserted into plasmid pET28b (Novagen), that was cut by the same enzyme pairs. Point mutations in the region coding the putative RNA:Ψ-synthase active site of both ORFs were introduced as described above (D238A, GAT to GCT for PUS9 and D211A, GAC to GCC for RIB2/PUS8). The resulting constructs were used to transform E. coli BL21CodonPlus(DE3)RIL cells (Stratagene). Recombinant His6-Pus9p and His6-Rib2/Pus8p were overproduced in cells grown at 18 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin by using an isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside concentration of 50 μm for the induction. The recombinant proteins were purified from E. coli cell extracts by adsorption chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, France), as described earlier (7Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 26Urban A. Ansmant I. Motorin Y. J. Chromatogr. B. 2003; 786: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The protein fractions eluted by 250 mm imidazole were diluted twice with 87% of glycerol and stored at –20 °C. In Vitro Tests—Cell-free S10 extracts from yeast were prepared as described previously (27Jiang H-Q. Motorin Y.A. Jin Y.-X. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The activities of RNA:Ψ-synthases acting at positions 1, 13, 32, and 72 in tRNAs were tested using T7 transcripts of the yeast tRNAArg(anticodon ACG), tRNAAsp(anticodon GUC), and tRNAMeti(anticodon CAU), respectively (16Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In vitro tests of the tRNA: Ψ32-synthase activities of the recombinant His6-Pus9p and His6-Rib2/Pus8p were performed on yeast tRNAHis(anticodon GUG) and tRNAAsp(anticodon GUC) T7 transcripts, or on total RNA extracted from the mutated strains. The plasmids, pTFM-Asp and pTFM-His, used for in vitro transcription of tRNAAsp and tRNAHis were kindly provided by C. Florentz (Institut de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France). For in vitro enzymatic assays, total yeast RNA (10 μg) or tRNA transcript (4 pmol) was incubated for 2 h with about 0.5 μg of recombinant protein in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NH4-OAc, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. After incubation, the modified RNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and used for CMCT/RT mapping of Ψ residues. CMCT/RT Mapping of Ψ Residues in RNA—Preparation of total RNA from yeast strains and CMCT/RT mapping of pseudouridine residues were performed as described previously (8Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This method is based on the production of alkaline-resistant modification of Ψ residues by a water-soluble carbodiimide CMCT, followed by detection of the modified residues by primer extension. The oligonucleotides, used for analysis of the yeast snRNAs are described in Ref. 8Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar. CMCT/RT mapping of Ψ residue at position 31 in cytoplasmic tRNAMet(anticodon CAU) and mitochondrial tRNAMet(anticodon CAU) was done with oligonucleotides complementary to residues 40–57 and 46–67, respectively. CMCT/RT mapping of Ψ residue at position 32 in cytoplasmic tRNAGly-(anticodon GCC) and tRNAVal(anticodon UAC) was performed with oligonucleotides complementary to residues 59–76 and 39–57, respectively. Mitochondrial tRNASer(anticodon GCU) and tRNATrp(anticodon UCA) were also tested for Ψ32 formation, using oligonucleotides complementary to residues 44–57 and to residues 58–76, respectively. Sequence Analysis—Subcellular localization of Pus9p and Rib2/Pus8p was predicted by the PSORTII (Ref. 29Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar and psort.nibb.ac.jp) and NNPSL (Ref. 30Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar and predict.sanger.ac.uk/nnpsl/) prediction software. Screening of the non-redundant protein data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information was performed with the BLASTP2 software (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Analysis of protein sequence was done by construction of multiple sequence alignments using the ClustalW software. The RIB2/PUS8 and PUS9 ORFs Encode Proteins with Highly Homologous RNA:Ψ-synthase Domains—Schematic representations of the organization and sequence homologies of several proteins of the RluA RNA:Ψ-synthases family, including Pus5p, Pus6p, and the proteins encoded by the PUS9 and RIB2/PUS8 ORFs are presented in Fig. 2. The RNA:Ψ-synthase domains of Rib2/Pus8p and Pus9p are more similar to the one of Pus6p, than to that of Pus5p (Fig. 2). Because Pus5p is a mitochondrial rRNA:Ψ-synthase (13Ansmant I. Massenet S. Grosjean H. Motorin Y. Branlant C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas Pus6p is a tRNA:Ψ-synthase (14Ansmant I. Motorin Y. Massenet S. Grosjean H. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34934-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), this was a hint for possible activity of Rib2/Pus8p and Pus9p on tRNAs. In agreement with the finding that Rib2/Pus8p is implicated in riboflavin biosynthesis (19Shavlovskii G.M. Sibirnyi A.A. Kshanovskaia B.V. Koltun L.V. Logvinenko E.M. Genetika. 1979; 15: 1561-1568PubMed Google Scholar), it contains a long C-terminal extension (160 amino acids), which displays sequence similarity with members of the bacterial RibD family of deaminases. These enzymes are involved in riboflavin biosynthesis in bacteria (19Shavlovskii G.M. Sibirnyi A.A. Kshanovskaia B.V. Koltun L.V. Logvinenko E.M. Genetika. 1979; 15: 1561-1568PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Altogether, the sequence alignments suggested the presence in Rib2/Pus8p of an N-terminal domain withaUto Ψ conversion activity and a C-terminal domain with a DRAP-deaminase activity. Analysis with the PSORTII (29Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) and NNPSL (30Reinhardt A. Hubbard T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) software suggested that Rib2/Pus8p is a cytoplasmic enzyme, which was experimentally confirmed (see ygac.med.yale.edu/ygac-cgi/). In contrast, Pus9p was predicted to be targeted in mitochondria by its N-terminal sequence. The PUS9 and RIB2/PUS8 ORFs Are Not Essential in S. cerevisiae—To study the functions of the Pus9p and Rib2/Pus8p proteins, each of the two corresponding ORFs was disrupted in the S. cerevisiae BMA64A strain by the one-step PCR-based approach (23Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). The PUS9 ORF was replaced by the S. cerevisiae TRP1 auxotrophic marker in the BMA64A strain. The resulting pus9Δ::TRP1 strain showed no marked growth phenotype, both in rich (YPD yeast extract, peptone, dextrose) and in minimal (YNB yeast nitrogen base) media, and this, at any of the tested temperatures (data not shown). The doubling times, measured at 30 °C in YPD medium for the WT and pus9Δ::TRP1 strains were identical (about 90 ± 5 min). The RIB2/PUS8 ORF was substituted either by the TRP1 marker (rib2/pus8Δ::TRP1 strain) or by a bacterial Kanr resistance gene (rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr strain). After verification by PCR amplification that the expected DNA recombination had occurred, growth phenotypes were analyzed. Unexpectedly, the growth phenotype generated by the RIB2/PUS8 ORF substitution depended upon the kind of substitution. The rib2/pus8Δ::TRP1 substitution had no detectable effect on growth in YPD medium (doubling time of 95 min, which is identical to the value obtained for the WT strain), whereas the rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr replacement led to a marked decrease of growth rate (Fig. 3). The rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr substitution even had a greater effect in the genetic background of the BY474 strain, because no growth was detected on YPD medium (see also www-deletion.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/deletion/search3.pl). We confirmed these data with a haploid strain (BY4742 rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr) generated by A. P. Gerber (Fig. 3). Disruption of the RIB2 DRAP-deaminase gene in the yeast Pichia guilliermondii was also found to be lethal, but growth could be restored by addition of riboflavin in the culture medium (31Shavlovskii G.M. Sibirnyi A.A. Fedorovich D.V. Seniuta E.Z. Mikrobiologiia. 1982; 51: 96-101PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that a normal growth of the BMA64A rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr strain on both YPD and YPG media is restored by addition of 15 mg/liter riboflavin (Fig. 3). To test whether expression of the DRAP-deaminase domain can also restore growth, the two Rib2/Pus8p domains were delineated with the Predict Protein program, and their coding regions were inserted in the p416GalS yeast expression vector. As shown in Fig. 3B, expression of the deaminase (p416GalS-RIB2/PUS8ΔPUS8), but not of the RNA: Ψ-synthase domain (p416GalS-RIB2/PUS8ΔDRAP), restored normal growth on YPG medium in the absence of riboflavin. To verify that the growth defect was not related to the absence of Rib2/Pus8p RNA:Ψ-synthase activity, we produced a RIB2/PUS8 ORF mutated in the codon corresponding to the postulated essential Asp residue of the RNA:Ψ-synthase active site (D211, Fig. 2). Expression of the variant D211A protein in the rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr strain restored normal growth on YPG medium in the absence of riboflavin (Fig. 3B). Altogether, the data demonstrated that, as previously found for the Pus1p, Pus4p, Pus5p, and Pus6p RNA:Ψ-synthases, the Pus9p and Rib2/Pus8p RNA:Ψ-synthase activities can be abolished without marked effect on cell growth. The different behaviors of rib2/pus8Δ::TRP1 and rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr strains suggest that the Kanr gene product may interfere with some metabolic pathways in S. cerevisiae, leading to the requirement of an increased riboflavin concentration. Only Ψ32 Formation in tRNAs Is Affected by Individual Disruption of the PUS9 and RIB2/PUS8 ORFs—Because several UsnRNA:Ψ-synthases remained to be identified, we first tested the effect of individual PUS9 and RIB2/PUS8 ORF disruptions on UsnRNA pseudouridylation. Total RNA was extracted from the BMA64A strain and its derivatives (pus9Δ::TRP1 and rib2/pus8Δ::Kanr), which will now be designated as Δpus9 and Δrib2/pus8 strains, for simplification. The presence of Ψ residues was analyzed by the CMCT/RT approach (8Massenet S. Motorin Y. Lafontaine D.L.J. Hurt E.C. Grosjean H. Branlant C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2142-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Neither of the two ORF substitutions was found to alter the pattern of UsnRNA pseudouridylation (data not shown). Thus, Rib2/Pus8p and Pus9p are probably not involved in UsnRNA modification. We then tested the possible activity of each enzyme at the tRNA positions, which had no assigned RNA:Ψ-synthases: namely, positions 1 and 32 in cytoplasmic tRNAs, and positions 32 and 72 in mitochondrial tRNAs (Fig. 1). The tRNA:Ψ32-synthase activity of yeast extracts from the Δrib2/pus8 and Δpus9 strains was tested using as substrate an in vitro transcribed S. cerevisiae cytoplasmic tRNAAsp labeled by incorporation of [α-32P]UTP (7Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this tRNA, only Ψ32 is located 5′ to a U residue and thus can be labeled and detected after RNase T2 digestion. As a control we measured the tRNA:Ψ13-synthase activity of the extracts, as described previously (16Behm-Ansmant I. Urban A. Ma X. Yu Y.T. Motorin Y. Branlant C. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas the disruption of the PUS9 ORF had no detectable effect on the tRNA:Ψ32-synthase activity, the replacement of RIB2/PUS8 ORF decreased this activity by a factor of about 2 (Table I and Fig. 4). Hence, Rib2/Pus8p might have a tRNA: Ψ32-synthase activity that is partially redundant with another RNA:Ψ-synthase activity present in total yeast extract. The PUS9-encoded protein was a possible candidate. It might indeed be a tRNA:Ψ32-synthase specific for the mitochondrial compartment. To test for this possibility, Ψ32 formation in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs of the Δrib2/pus8 and Δpus9 strains was tested by the CMCT/RT approach. Because of natural post-transcriptional modifications that impair primer extension analysis, the cytoplasmic tRNAAsp, used in the above experiments, could not be analyzed by this method. Hence, the mitochondrial tRNASer and the cytoplasmic tRNAGly, which both contain a Ψ residue at position 32, were selected for this experiment. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, Ψ32 formation in the mitochondrial tRNASer was completely abolished in the Δpus9 strain, but remained unaffected in the Δrib2/pus8 strain. The same result was obtained for the mitochondrial tRNATrp (not shown). In contrast, the PUS9 deletion had no significant effect on Ψ32 formation in the cytoplasmic tRNAGly (Fig. 5B, lanes 7 and 8) and tRNAVal (not shown). These data strongly suggested that Pus9p catalyzes Ψ32 formation in mitochondrial tRNAs. A confirmation was obtained by complementation of the Δpus9 strain by a plasmid bearing the WT or a mutated PUS9 ORF (Fig. 6). Indeed, the p416GalS-PUS9WT plasmid expressing the active protein was able to restore Ψ32 formation in the mitochondrial tRNASer (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8), whereas its derivative p416GalS-PUS9D238A, encoding a Pus9p with a D238A amino acid substitution in the GRLD motif of the RNA: Ψ-synthase domain (Fig. 2), did not restore the activity (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 10). Hence, we concluded that the S. cerevisiae PUS9 ORF encodes the tRNA:Ψ32-synthase responsible for modification of mitochondrial tRNAs.Table IPseudouridine formation in selected yeast tRNA transcripts catalyzed by extracts of WT, Δpus9, Δrib2/pus8, and Δrib2/pus8/Δpus9 yeast strainsPosition tested in tRNAtRNA transcript/labelingWild-type strainΔpus9 strainΔrib2/pus8 strainΔrib2/pus8/Δpus9 strain1Yeast tRNAArg/UTP0.850.840.910.8713Yeast tRNAAsp/ATP0.750.790.780.8132Yeast tRNAAsp/UTP0.710.760.340.0272Yeast tRNAMeti/ATP0.780.870.820.83 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5Mapping of residue Ψ32 in the mitochondrial tRNASer (A) and cytoplasmic tRNAGly (B) from the WT and mutated S. cerevisiae BMA64A strains.

It is unclear, however, what kind of cellular event(s) are triggered after the binding of VP1 to the cells. In this study, we show that aqueous soluble recombinant DNA-derived VP1 (rVP1) of FMDV induced apoptosis of BHK-21 cells after binding to integrins. In addition, treatment of BHK-21 cells with rVP1 resulted in deactivation of Akt and enhancement of several proapoptotic responses such as dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and cleavage of procaspase-3, -7, and -9. Additional studies revealed that the rVP1 treatment caused apoptosis of cancer cells, including MCF-7 (a breast carcinoma cell line with a functional deletion of the caspase-3 gene) and PC-3 (a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 3-deficient androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line). These results suggest that rVP1 of FMDV may be used selectively as a potent apoptotic agent for human cancer by modulating the Akt signaling pathway and that its effect is not primarily dependent on either activation of procaspase-3 or deactivation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 3.

Integrins belong to a family of cell-surface α-β heterodimeric glycoproteins that are responsible for a variety of processes, including the induction of signal transduction pathways that modulate cell proliferation, morphology, migration, and apoptosis (10Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). To date, four species of integrins (αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ6, and α5β1) have been shown to mediate FMDV infection (6Jackson T. Blakemore W. Newman J.W. Knowles N.J. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. King A.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Jackson T. Sheppard D. Denyer M. Blakemore W. King A.M. J.

Regulation of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, allows the organism to replace aged cells, to control the cell number and tissue size, and to protect itself from rogue cells that may lead to lethality (13Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Apoptosis requires integration and fine-tuning of multiple proteins that are either regulators or executors of the survival and death processes. Cancer, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency disease, reperfusion injury, and neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by disregulation of apoptosis. Integrin signaling can activate the Akt pathway (14King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), an anti-apoptotic mechanism utilized by many types of cells (15Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Akt mediates cell survival in response to stimulation by growth factors (16Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 17Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that binds phosphorylated lipids at the membrane in response to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (18Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K through G protein-coupled receptors such as sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptors or use of PI3K inhibitors (e.g. LY294002) may thus modulate the activity of Akt (19Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Akt can activate anti-apoptotic or inhibit pro-apoptotic processes in the cell by phosphorylating Bad, Forkhead transcription factors, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), and caspase-9 (20Belham C.

On the other hand, deactivation of Akt has been shown to activate pro-apoptotic responses (26Luo H.R. Hattori H. Hossain M.A. Hester L. Huang Y. Lee-Kwon W. Donowitz M. Nagata E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11712-11717Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Both GSK-3β and caspase-9 are pro-apoptotic factors (27Loberg R.D. Vesely E. Brosius F.C. II I J. Biol.

Cleavage of caspase-9 results in induction of a caspase cascade, including the processing of procaspase-3 and -7 (29Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C.

The initiation of the caspase cascade eventually leads to apoptosis (28Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Although integrins have been shown to mediate FMDV infection (6Jackson T. Blakemore W. Newman J.W. Knowles N.J. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. King A.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Jackson T. Sheppard D. Denyer M. Blakemore W. King A.M. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whether the binding of FMDV and VP1 to integrins results in activation, deactivation, or any cellular response is unclear. Full-length and truncated forms of recombinant DNA-derived VP1 (rVP1) of FMDV have been generated previously by several investigators (30Bayry J. Prabhudas K. Gopalakrishna S. Patil P.K. Ramakrishna C. Misra L.D. Suryanarayana V.V. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 43: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To solve the problem of poor water solubility, however, rVP1 has been routinely used together with denaturing agents such as urea (31Wang J.H. Liang C.-M. Peng J.-M. Shieh J.J. Jong M.-H. Lin Y.L. Sieber M. Liang S.-M. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The presence of denaturing agents has made it quite difficult to evaluate the biological effects of rVP1. Recently, we have not only expressed and isolated two aqueous soluble forms of rVP1, but also showed that, like native VP1, they can elicit protective immunity against FMDV (31Wang J.H. Liang C.-M. Peng J.-M. Shieh J.J. Jong M.-H. Lin Y.L. Sieber M. Liang S.-M. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we further investigated the binding of purified rVP1 to integrins and examined their cellular effects, mechanism of action, and potential applications. Materials—The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and antibodies against Akt; phospho-Ser473 Akt; phospho-Ser9 GSK-3β; caspase-3, -7, and -9; and procaspase-3, -7, and -9 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-actin antibody, anti-integrin VLA-5 (α5β1) monoclonal antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Effectene transfection reagent was obtained from QIAGEN Inc. (Valencia, CA). Lipofectamine Plus™ was obtained from Invitrogen. Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB was from PeproTech EC Ltd. (London, United Kingdom). GSK-3β inhibitor I (GSK-3βI) came from Calbiochem. 4′, 6′-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate (DAPI) was from Sigma. Polypeptide P29 (NGSSKYGDTSTNNVRGDLQVLAQKAERTL), representing residues 131–159 of VP1 of the FMDV O/Taiwan/97 strain, was synthesized using an ABI peptide synthesizer (32Shieh J.J. Liang C.-M. Chen C.Y. Lee F. Jong M.-H. Lai S.S. Liang S.-M. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the protocol of Du et al. (33Du Z. Regier D.A. Desrosiers R.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 376-378PubMed Google Scholar) on the VP1 gene using primers that mutate Cys187 to serine and Arg145 to glycine. The primers that we used were as follows: VP1R145G-F, 5′-CGGTGACACCAGCACTAACAACGTGGGAGGTGACCTTCAAG-3′; VP1R145G-R, 5′-CTTGAAGGTCACCTCCCACGTTGTTAGTGCTGGTGTCACCG-3′; VP1C-187S-F, 5′-GAATGAAGAGAGCCGAGACATACAGTCCCAGGCCCCTTC-3′; and VP1C187S-R, 5′-GAATGGCGAGAAGGGGCCTGGGACTGTATGTCTCGGCTC-3′. The nucleotide sequences of truncated and mutant VP1 constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of rVP1—The mutant VP1 gene in the expression vector pET24a(+) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to our procedure described previously (31Wang J.H. Liang C.-M. Peng J.-M. Shieh J.J. Jong M.-H. Lin Y.L. Sieber M. Liang S.-M. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments showed that the apoptotic effect of the monomeric rVP1 mutant (rVP1(C187S)) was of the same magnitude as that of rVP1 without mutation at position 187. This monomeric rVP1 mutant was thus used in all experiments and is hereafter referred to as rVP1 in this study. After being processed according to our purification method, wild-type and mutant rVP1 become water-soluble (up to 5 mg/ml). Moreover, the lyophilized powder can be easily reconstituted in water without any precipitation. Because our purification process is quite simple (31Wang J.H. Liang C.-M. Peng J.-M. Shieh J.J. Jong M.-H. Lin Y.L. Sieber M. Liang S.-M. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it can be easily used for large-scale production of rVP1. Cell Lines and Treatments—BHK-21 cells are known to be permissive for FMDV to bind and replicate through the RGD motif (34Baxt B. Morgan D.O. Robertson B.H. Timpone C.A. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 298-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, BHK-21 cells and several human cancer cell lines such as MCF-7, 22Rv1, and PC-3 were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate (400 μl/well) 1 day before the experiments. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with rVP1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum. Some of the cells were then lysed with 0.2 ml of boiling protein loading buffer (Invitrogen) at the indicated time points, and 20-μl samples were analyzed for Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation by Western blotting. The remaining cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C for apoptosis experiments. DNA Fragmentation Assay—In brief, BHK-21 cells were cultured in monolayer cultures overnight and treated with various amounts of rVP1. The treated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and transferred to a centrifuge tube. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 μl of solution containing 10 mm Tris-Cl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). One ml of extraction buffer consisting of 0.1 m EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 20 μg/ml pancreatic RNase, and 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) was added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteinase K (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the suspension of lysed cells was kept at 50 °C for 3 h with periodically swirling. An equal volume of phenol was added to the solution. The mixture was kept at room temperature for 10 min and then subjected to centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min to separate into two phases. After extraction three times with phenol, the aqueous phases were pooled, transferred to a centrifuge tube, and mixed with 0.2 volume of 10 m ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol. The genomic DNA was collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, washed with 70% ethanol, and separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Assay for Cell Survival and Apoptosis—BHK-21 cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were transfected with plasmid pEGFP-C3 (0.5 μg/well), which encodes green fluorescent protein (GFP), in Effectene for 24–48 h. After incubation with rVP1 at the indicated time points, the surviving and dead cells were distinguished by examination under a fluorescence microscope. To visualize DNA condensation in nuclei, the control and treated cells were stained with DAPI (0.5 μg/ml in PBS) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then examined by light microscopy. The level of apoptosis was determined as the ratio of cells with morphologically changed nuclei to the total number of cells present. Cell Transfection and Plasmid Expression—BHK-21 cells were transfected with pIBSY1 or pIBSY1-VP1 (32Shieh J.J. Liang C.-M. Chen C.Y. Lee F. Jong M.-H. Lai S.S. Liang S.-M. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine Plus™ according to the protocol specified by the manufacturer. The cell extracts were assayed by Western blotting 48 h after the start of transfection. Indirect Immunofluorescence—The binding of rVP1 and binary ethyleneimine (BEI)-inactivated FMDV to the cells was detected following an established procedure (35Nishida K. Misumi O. Yagisawa F. Kuroiwa H. Nagata T. Kuroiwa T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, BHK-21 cells were grown on a glass coverslip overnight and then treated with rVP1 (1 μm) or BEI-inactivated FMDV (125 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 2 h. Cells on the coverslip were washed with PBS once and immersed in 100% methanol at –20 °C for 10 min. Fixed cells were rinsed three times with PBS, blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 40 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-FMDV neutralizing antibodies) at 1:500 in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C. After the primary antibody reaction, cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled pig anti-rabbit IgG) at 1:1000 in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min at 30 °C under low light conditions, and washed twice with PBS. Coverslips were mounted on slides using Gel/Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). The slides were air-dried for 1 h and stored at room temperature in the dark. Cells were observed using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope. rVP1 Induces Apoptosis—VP1 of FMDV contains an RGD motif, which is characteristic of the ligands that bind to cellular integrins (4Logan D. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Blakemore W. Curry S. Jackson T. King A. Lea S. Lewis R. Newman J. Parry N. Rowlands D. Stuart D. Fry E. Nature. 1993; 362: 566-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 8Ruoslahti E. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). Although we previously produced aqueous soluble rVP1, it was found to form monomers or dimers depending upon the redox conditions of the experiments (31Wang J.H. Liang C.-M. Peng J.-M. Shieh J.J. Jong M.-H. Lin Y.L. Sieber M. Liang S.-M. Vaccine. 2003; 21: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To avoid any uncertainty in this study, we thus generated a monomeric rVP1 mutant by changing Cys187 to Ser by site-directed mutagenesis and investigated the cellular effect of this rVP1. Treating BHK-21 cells with 1 μm rVP1 for 24 h resulted in DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1A), one of characteristic features of apoptosis (28Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether DNA fragmentation was accompanied by cell death and DNA condensation, we transfected BHK-21 cells with plasmid pEGFP-C3 and observed them under a fluorescence microscope. The number of GFP-transfected cells (green color under fluorescence) was reduced when the cells were treated with 1 μm rVP1 for 2 h. The number of GFP-transfected cells was severely reduced when the treatment lasted for 24 h (Fig. 1B, left panels). Staining of cell nuclei with DAPI confirmed that rVP1-treated cells had nuclear condensation indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 1B, right panels). The apoptotic effect of rVP1 was not due to site-directed mutagenesis at position 187, as wild-type rVP1 also showed a similar effect (Fig. 1C, open bars). However, both FMDV and FMDV inactivated by BEI, an agent known to inactivate FMDV without damaging viral proteins (37Patil P.K. Suryanarayana V. Bist P. Bayry J. Natarajan C. Vaccine. 2002; 20: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), did not show any apoptotic effect (Fig. 1D). rVP1 Induces Apoptosis by Binding to Integrin—To compare the apoptotic effect of rVP1 with that of other RGD motif-containing molecules, BHK-21 cells were treated with rVP1, cyclic RGD, or peptide P29 (containing residues 131–159 with the RGD motif at positions 145–147) (32Shieh J.J. Liang C.-M. Chen C.Y. Lee F. Jong M.-H. Lai S.S. Liang S.-M. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Treating BHK-21 cells with 1 μm rVP1 resulted in apoptosis of almost all BHK-21 cells (Fig. 1C, closed bars), whereas both peptide P29 and cyclic RGD at the same concentration had little effect (data not shown). The 50% effective concentration of rVP1 in causing apoptosis was ∼0.3 μm, which was ∼100- and 10,000-fold more potent than those of peptide P29 (30 μm) and cyclic RGD (3 mm), respectively. Pretreatment of the cells with antibodies before addition of rVP1 revealed that the apoptotic effect of rVP1 was blocked specifically not only by rabbit anti-FMDV neutralizing antibodies, but also by anti-integrin α5β1 antibodies (Fig. 1D). Because fibronectin is a natural ligand for the integrin α5β1 receptor (9Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1985; 40: 191-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 36Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar), we investigated whether addition of fibronectin could reverse the apoptotic effect caused by rVP1. Our results show that fibronectin at 0.8 μm abolished the apoptotic effect of 1 μm rVP1 on BHK-21 cells (Fig. 1D). To further determine whether the apoptotic effect of rVP1 could be obtained only after its interaction with integrin receptors, we constructed a mutant VP1 protein containing GGD instead of RGD and found that this mutant (rVP1(R145G)) caused little, if any, apoptosis (Fig. 1D). In addition, we were able to show that rVP1, like BEI-inactivated FMDV, bound to BHK-21 cells and that the binding was blocked by anti-integrin α5β1 antibody (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we transfected BHK-21 cells with plasmid pIBSY1-VP1, an expression vector containing the VP1 gene, to express rVP1 intracellularly. Although rVP1 was significantly expressed in the transfected cells, little apoptosis was observed even after 3 days of culture (Fig. 2, B and C). On the other hand, addition of rVP1 to the culture medium resulted in the death of the transfected cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that induction of apoptosis by rVP1 is most likely due to its binding to integrin receptors. rVP1 Treatment Deactivates Akt—Binding of growth factors such as PDGF to cells activates PI3K/Akt pathways and causes cell proliferation (17Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deactivation of Akt causes apoptosis (28Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). To determine whether rVP1 has any effect on the Akt pathway after binding to integrin, we treated BHK-21 cells with PDGF and rVP1. As expected, PDGF activated Akt phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 3, A and B). When BHK-21 cells were treated with rVP1 for 30 min, Akt phosphorylation was inhibited, in contrast to the activation induced by PDGF (Fig. 3C). The effect was more pronounced when the incubation time was increased to 60 min (Fig. 3C). This inhibitory effect of rVP1 on Akt was reversed not only by increasing concentrations of PDGF (0.1–10 μg/ml) (Fig. 3D), but also by pretreatment of cells with anti-integrin α5β1 antibodies for 30 min (Fig. 3C). Because BEI-inactivated FMDV, unlike rVP1, did not cause apoptosis (Fig. 1D), we also investigated its effect on Akt. BEI-inactivated FMDV was found to increase rather than decrease the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3E), substantiating a positive correlation between reduction of Akt phosphorylation and apoptosis. We then determined whether downstream elements of the Akt pathway, such as GSK-3β phosphorylation (24Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar), could also be inhibited by rVP1 treatment. We found that PDGF treatment of BHK-21 cells increased, whereas rVP1 treatment reduced, the phosphorylation of GSK-3β (Fig. 3F). The reduction in phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β upon treatment of BHK-21 cells with rVP1 was dose-dependent (Fig. 3G). To verify that the level of GSK-3β correlated positively with BHK-21 cell apoptosis, BHK-21 cells were treated with a non-ATP competitive GSK-3β inhibitor, GSK-3βI, to inhibit the apoptotic effect of GSK-3β (38Martinez A. Alonso M. Castro A. Perez C. Moreno F.J. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Our results show that treatment of BHK-21 cells with both PDGF and GSK-3βI attenuated the apoptotic effect of rVP1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B). rVP1 Activates Cleavage of Procaspases—Caspases, a family of cysteine/aspartic acid proteases, are central regulators of apoptosis (28Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Fragmentation of DNA has been shown to cause cleavage of procaspase-9, resulting in processes of other procaspases such as procaspase-3 and -7. The initiation of the caspase cascade eventually leads to apoptosis (28Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R.

The effects of rVP1 treatment on the activation of procaspase-9 and downstream procaspase-7 and -3 were therefore evaluated. We found that rVP1 treatment caused the cleavage of procaspase-9, -7, and -3 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5). rVP1 Induces Cancer Cell Apoptosis Irrespective of the Absence of Caspase-3 and S1P Receptor Subtype 3 (S1P3)—The Akt pathway has been a major target for treatment of all four major human cancers, i.e. breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal (39Brognard J.

To evaluate further the apoptotic effect and mechanism of action of rVP1, we concentrated on cells that might not be responsive to it. One of these cancer cells is MCF-7, a breast carcinoma cell line with a functional deletion of the caspase-3 gene (43Buckley C.D. Pilling D. Henriquez N.V. Parsonage G. Threlfall K. Scheel-Toellner D. Simmons D.L. Akbar A.N. Lord J.M. Salmon M. Nature. 1999; 397: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Buckley et al. (43Buckley C.D. Pilling D. Henriquez N.V.

Nature. 1999; 397: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) found that seven peptides containing an RGD motif were unable to induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells and concluded that the apoptotic effect of these RGD motif-containing peptides is caspase-3-dependent. To evaluate whether the apoptotic effect of rVP1 would also be caspase-3-dependent, we treated MCF-7 cells with rVP1 to evaluate their apoptosis. Our results show that rVP1 caused apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner and that this effect was reversed by addition of increasing concentrations of GSK-3βI (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that the apoptotic effect of rVP1 is not necessarily dependent on caspase-3. Other cancer cell lines that we selected for study were PC-3 and 22Rv1, both of which are prostate cancer cells. 22Rv1 cells express S1P3 and responds to androgen stimulation, whereas PC-3 cells do not (44Baudhuin L.M. Jiang Y. Zaslavsky A. Ishii I. Chun J. Xu Y. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 341-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells such as PC-3 are usually much more lethal and difficult to treat. As S1P binds to S1P3 to mediate Akt activation and cross-talk with PDGF receptors (44Baudhuin L.M. Jiang Y. Zaslavsky A. Ishii I. Chun J. Xu Y. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 341-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rVP1 could cause deactivation of Akt via S1P3. In this case, treating PC-3 with rVP1 would not result in apoptosis. Our results show that rVP1 not only caused apoptosis of both cell types, but also showed greater apoptotic effect on PC-3 cells, suggesting that the apoptotic effect of rVP1 is not via deactivation of S1P3 (Fig. 6C). The capsid protein(s) of FMDV (45Surovoi A. Ivanov V.T. Chepurkin A.V. Ivaniushchenkov V.N. Driagalin N.N. Bioorg. Khim. 1988; 14: 965-968PubMed Google Scholar) and a variety of pathogens, including adenovirus 2 (46Wickham T.J. Mathias P. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar), coxsackievirus A9 (47Roivainen M. Hyypia T. Piirainen L. Kalkkinen N. Stanway G. Hovi T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4735-4740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and echovirus 22 (48Stanway G. Kalkkinen N. Roivainen M. Ghazi F. Khan M. Smyth M. Meurman O. Hyypia T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8232-8238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contain an RGD motif that can bind to cellular integrin receptors such as αvβ1, αvβ3, αvβ6, and α5β1 (6Jackson T. Blakemore W. Newman J.W. Knowles N.J. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. King A.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Jackson T. Sheppard D. Denyer M. Blakemore W. King A.M. J.

Whether the binding of the RGD motif of these pathogens to the receptors elicits any cellular events has not been well documented. Our results in this study show clearly that rVP1 of FMDV bound to the integrin receptors and resulted in cellular apoptosis. Because integrin-mediated cell attachment has been shown to regulate both PI3K and Akt (49Vuori K. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 50Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), our observation that rVP1 treatment resulted in apoptosis and inhibition of Akt within the same effective dose range (Figs. 1C and 3G) is consistent with the proposal that the effect of rVP1 is most likely via its deactivation of Akt after its binding to integrin. It must be noted, however, that FMDV and BEI-inactivated FMDV caused activation of Akt and resulted in less cellular apoptosis (Figs. 1D and 3E). These results suggest that, although both FMDV and VP1 bind to integrin, the former acts as an agonist and the latter as an antagonist of integrin receptors. Which portion(s) of FMDV enables it to act as an agonist to activate Akt remains to be elucidated. The Akt signaling pathway has been shown to regulate cell survival via both BAD and caspase-3 in Chang liver cells (51Lee Y.I. Kang-Park S. Do S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16969-16977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and via only caspase-3 in cardiomyocytes (52Wu W. Lee W.L. Wu Y.Y. Chen D. Liu T.J. Jang A. Sharma P.M. Wang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40113-40119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, Zhang et al. (53Zhang H.M. Yuan J. Cheung P. Luo H. Yanagawa B. Chau D. Stephan-Tozy N. Wong B.W. Zhang J. Wilson J.E. McManus B.M. Yang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) found that the Akt pathway in HeLa cells affect cell survival via regulation of not only caspase-3, but also caspase-9 and GSK-3β. It thus appears that, depending on cell types and stimuli, the Akt pathway may regulate cell survival and apoptosis via modification of different downstream molecular targets. Although we have not tested all the potential downstream targets, our results so far reveal clearly that rVP1 treatment of BHK-21 fibroblast cells down-regulates the Akt pathway, resulting in apoptosis via dephosphorylation of GSK-3β and cleavage of procaspase-9, -7, and -3 (Figs. 3, 4, 5). Whether these are the only major factors or there are other factors involved requires further elucidation. However, the observation that GSK-3βI could effectively attenuate the apoptotic effect of rVP1 suggests that the effect of rVP1 involves primarily the Akt/GSK-3β/caspase pathway. By observing that seven RGD motif-containing peptides could not cause apoptosis of MCF-7 cells (human breast carcinoma cells deficient in a functional caspase-3 gene), Buckley et al. (43Buckley C.D. Pilling D. Henriquez N.V. Parsonage G. Threlfall K. Scheel-Toellner D. Simmons D.L. Akbar A.N. Lord J.M. Salmon M. Nature. 1999; 397: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) concluded that the apoptotic effect of these peptides was most likely due to their direct intracellular activation of caspase-3. However, our results show that the potency of rVP1 in causing apoptosis of MCF-7 cells was only slightly lower than that observed for BHK-21 cells (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the apoptotic effect of rVP1 is not necessarily dependent on the direct activation of caspase-3. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of rVP1 and the peptides used by Buckley et al. reveals that, unlike rVP1, none of the peptides used by Buckley et al. contained leucine at position +1 after the RGD motif. Whether this difference or other amino acids of rVP1 contribute to the difference in the mechanism of action of rVP1 compared with that of the RGD motif-containing peptides used by Buckley et al. remains to be elucidated. A number of tumor cells undergo apoptotic cell death when treated with chemotherapeutic agents such as camptothecin, cisplatin, adriamycin, and vincristine. Induction of apoptosis has thus been suggested as one of the major means to explore for cancer treatment (54Kiaris H. Schally A.V. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 221: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 55Tsuruo T. Naito M. Tomida A. Fujita N. Mashima T. Sakamoto H. Haga N. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). By identifying RGD as an active moiety of fibronectin (36Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar) and by isolation of fibronectin and vitronectin receptors (8Ruoslahti E. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1985; 40: 191-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), Ruoslahti and co-workers have revealed the biological and pharmacological importance of RGD motif-containing molecules. In this study, we found that aqueous soluble rVP1, an RGD motif-containing protein, was extremely potent in causing apoptosis of MCF-7, PC-3, and 22Rv1 cells (ED50 < 1 μm). Its effect was not completely dependent on either caspase-3 or S1P3 (Fig. 6). Moreover, as more integrin α5β1 receptors on the cells have been linked to a higher metastatic potential of cancer cells (56Stoeltzing O. Liu W. Reinmuth N. Fan F. Parry G.C. Parikh A.A. McCarty M.F. Bucana C.D. Mazar A.P. Ellis L.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), rVP1 may selectively cause the apoptosis of these cancer cells and prevent the occurrence of metastasis. FMDV affects many domestic livestock and results in economic disaster. However, our finding that a recombinant form of VP1 of FMDV can kill cancer cells shows that the capsid protein of this pathogen may be beneficial for human beings. We thank Dr. Shui-Tein Chen for providing cyclic RGD and Dr. Ming-Hwa Jong for providing BEI-inactivated FMDV."

DNA gyrase supports replication and transcription with its unique supercoiling activity, whereas Topo IV preferentially relaxes (+) supercoils and is a decatenating enzyme required for chromosome segregation. Here we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of Topo IV ParC subunit (ParC-CTD) from Bacillus stearothermophilus and provide a structure-based explanation for how Topo IV and DNA gyrase execute distinct activities. Although the topological connectivity of ParC-CTD is similar to the recently determined CTD structure of DNA gyrase GyrA subunit (GyrA-CTD), ParC-CTD surprisingly folds as a previously unseen broken form of a six-bladed β-propeller. Propeller breakage is due to the absence of a DNA gyrase-specific GyrA box motif, resulting in the reduction of curvature of the proposed DNA binding region, which explains why ParC-CTD is less efficient than GyrA-CTD in mediating DNA bending, a difference that leads to divergent activities of the two homologous enzymes. Moreover, we found that the topology of the propeller blades observed in ParC-CTD and GyrA-CTD can be achieved from a concerted β-hairpin invasion-induced fold change event of a canonical six-bladed β-propeller; hence, we proposed to name this new fold as “hairpininvaded β-propeller” to highlight the high degree of similarity and a potential evolutionary linkage between them.

The intertwining nature of long bacterial chromosome encounters two topological problems during the process of semiconservative replication (reviewed in Refs. 1Postow L. Crisona N.J. Peter B.J.

Microbiol. 2004; 52: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By pulling the interwoven complementary strands apart, the progression of replication machinery inevitably generates (+) supercoils in front of the replication fork. Failure to remove the excess (+) supercoils will cause replication elongation to stop. In addition, the newly synthesized sister chromosomes are interlinked as catenanes. Consequently, decatenation is an essential step for chromosome segregation. Although these replication-induced topological entanglements are harmful for the cell, a proper level of (–) supercoiling is considered to set the topological homeostasis, which governs certain cellular processes (2Espeli O. Marians K.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), such as transcription and replication initiation, that require DNA unwinding (3Zechiedrich E.L.

In bacteria, the resolution of DNA entanglements and maintenance of topological homeostasis are largely handled by two essential type IIA topoisomerases (Topos), 1The abbreviations used are: Topo, topoisomerase; CTD, C-terminal domain; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; ParC, topoisomerase IV A subunit; GyrA, DNA gyrase A subunit; Se, selenium; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; G-segment, gate-forming segment; T-segment, transported segment.1The abbreviations used are: Topo, topoisomerase; CTD, C-terminal domain; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; ParC, topoisomerase IV A subunit; GyrA, DNA gyrase A subunit; Se, selenium; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; G-segment, gate-forming segment; T-segment, transported segment. DNA gyrase and Topo IV (4Levine C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). All of the members of the type IIA Topo family share significant sequence similarity and essentially the same ATP-dependent catalytic mechanism (5Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 6Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Specifically, type IIA enzymes alter the topological state of DNA by producing a transient double-stranded break in one duplex (termed G-segment for the gate-forming segment), transporting another duplex (termed T-segment for transported segment) through the enzyme-mediated gate, and religating the cleaved G-segment. Interestingly, although DNA gyrase and Topo IV share a high degree of similarity, they possess distinct cellular functions and thus cannot complement each other in vivo (7Adams D.E. Shekhtman E.M. Zechiedrich E.L. Schmid M.B. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). DNA gyrase is the only type IIA enzyme capable of actively introducing (–) supercoils into DNA, an activity involved in replication initiation and transcription of (–) supercoil-dependent promoters (9Funnell B. Baker T. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10327-10334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Miller W.G. Simons R.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additionally, this unique supercoiling capability made DNA gyrase particularly effective for removing (+) supercoils generated during replication elongation (11Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Schmid M.B. DeRisi J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9419-9424Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, Topo IV does not possess supercoiling activity and is normally localized behind the replication forks to serve as a decatenating enzyme for disentangling the interlinked daughter chromosomes (12Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21529-21535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Khodursky A.B. Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11801-11805Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Recent studies further sustain its role as a decatenase by demonstrating that, through the interaction with a septal ring protein FtsK, Topo IV is only accessible to DNA at the end of replication (14Espeli O. Lee C. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44639-44644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because the decatenating activity of Topo IV is stimulated by (–) superhelical density, the two enzymes appear to work in concert to complete replication (15Ullsperger C. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31549-31555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition to its apparent function in decatenation, in vitro analyses also revealed that Topo IV is able to catalyze relaxation of supercoiled DNA (16Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in sharp contrast to the eukaryotic type IIA Topos, which act indistinguishably on the supercoils of both signs, recent studies show that Topo IV relaxes (+) supercoils much faster than (–) supercoils (17Charvin G. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Crisona N.J. Strick T.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Cozzarelli N.R.

A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although this distinctive substrate specificity provides an explanation of why Topo IV can promote replication elongation without counteracting the activity of DNA gyrase, it raises the question of how Topo IV preferentially recognizes (+) supercoiled DNA as preferred substrate. Substrate binding affinity does not appear to solve this question, because both (+) and (–) supercoiled DNA compete equally well with linear DNA for Topo IV binding (19Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A. Bustamante C. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cozzarelli's and Charvin's groups have engaged similar single-molecule relaxation assays on mechanically braided DNA molecules, and both groups hypothesized that Topo IV is able to sense the geometry of DNA cross-overs. A left-handed crossing of the T- and G-segments imposed by the (+) superhelix makes a preferred substrate for duplex passage reaction (17Charvin G. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Stone M.D. Bryant Z. Crisona N.J. Smith S.B. Vologodskii A. Bustamante C. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8654-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). How do homologous type IIA Topos diverge in catalytic activities and substrate specificities? Multiple sequence alignment revealed that, although most functional domains are conserved in all type IIA enzymes, the highly charged C-terminal domain (CTD) of the eukaryotic Topo has no detectable sequence similarity with the corresponding regions in either DNA gyrase or Topo IV (20Gadelle D. Filee J. Buhler C. Forterre P. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Instead of involving catalysis, various studies have suggested that the intracellular localization of eukaryotic Topo IIA is regulated by its CTD (21Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6093-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21335-21343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Caron P.R. Watt P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two prokaryotic enzymes are assembled from two closely related subunits. The GyrA and GyrB subunits of DNA gyrase can be aligned over their entire lengths with the corresponding ParC and ParE subunits of Topo IV, respectively. Moreover, unlike the eukaryotic CTD, which is probably unstructured and dispensable for catalysis, the ∼35-kDa CTDs of both DNA gyrase (GyrA-CTD) and Topo IV (ParC-CTD) were predicted to adopt a six-bladed β-propeller fold (25Qi Y. Pei J. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2002; 47: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the negative supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase is clearly dependent on GyrA-CTD (26Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Due to the absence of this domain, the involvement of GyrA-CTD during catalysis explains why the eukaryotic type IIA enzymes may differ from DNA gyrase. However, the basis for the functional differences between DNA gyrase and Topo IV remains unanswered. Using DNA footprint assay, it was found that DNA gyrase protects ∼140-bp long DNA from nuclease digestion, whereas only 35 bp of DNA is protected by Topo IV (27Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Cell. 1978; 15: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, GyrA-CTD was found to be a nonspecific DNA-binding protein capable of bending and wrapping DNA around itself (27Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Reece R. Maxwell A.

Together, these results suggested that the DNA binding properties of these two prokaryotic enzymes are very different. It has been proposed that, with the help from GyrA-CTD, a continuous stretch of DNA can be wrapped by DNA gyrase to generate a (+) supercoil-like intramolecular DNA cross-over to facilitate subsequent duplex passage reaction that produces net (–) supercoils in DNA (28Liu L.F.

A. 1999; 96: 8414-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Consistent with its predicted catalytic function, deletion of GyrA-CTD converted DNA gyrase into a conventional type IIA Topo (26Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It appears that the functional differences between DNA gyrase and Topo IV can be attributed in part to their respective CTDs. Recently, the crystal structure of GyrA-CTD from Borrelia burgdorferi has been determined (30Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the structure was globally reminiscent of a six-bladed β-propeller as predicted (25Qi Y. Pei J. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2002; 47: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), GyrA-CTD folds with a novel topology and was alternatively termed to adopt a β-pinwheel fold (30Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). An arc-shaped positively charged patch on the outside surface was predicted as the region responsible for DNA bending. Guided by electron microscopy images of the holoenzyme (33Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), GyrA-CTD was positioned relative to the catalytic core of DNA gyrase and a model was constructed to explain how this domain is involved in generating (–) supercoils (30Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This model was further supported by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurement showing that DNA can be effectively bent by GyrA-CTD. Interestingly, albeit ∼10-fold less efficient, ParC-CTD was also found to possess DNA bending activity. This finding suggests that the different bending efficiency of the two CTDs may define the functional differences between DNA gyrase and Topo IV. Moreover, this previously unknown DNA bending activity raises the possibility that ParC-CTD may play significant roles during Topo IV catalysis. In this report, we present the crystal structure of ParC-CTD from bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus. Surprisingly, although the structure displays similar topological connectivity as observed in GyrA-CTD (30Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), ParC-CTD folds as a previously unseen broken form of a six-bladed β-propeller in which no close contacts are observed between the first and last propeller blades. Besides, we found that the topological connectivity of GyrA-CTD and ParC-CTD type can be achieved from a β-hairpin invasion-mediated fold change event of a canonical six-bladed β-propeller structure. Hence, we proposed to name this newly observed protein fold as “hairpin-invaded β-propeller” to highlight the high degree of structural similarity and a possible evolutionary linkage between them. Similar to GyrA-CTD, a continuous electropositive patch is present on the outside perimeter of the broken β-propeller, which may represent the DNA binding surface of ParC-CTD. Compared with GyrA-CTD, the lesser surface curvature and lower electropositive potential of this CTD region suggest why ParC-CTD bends DNA less efficiently when DNA is docked against it. Most significantly, a structural comparison revealed the reason why ParC-CTD folded into a broken β-propeller. It was due to the absence of a Lys/Arg-rich sequence motif named GyrA box, which is conserved in all of the DNA gyrases (34Ward D. Newton A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This finding supports the use of GyrA box as one of the features to distinguish GyrA and ParC proteins and provides a structural basis for how this sequence motif dictates the functional differences between the two prokaryotic type IIA Topos. Our results also imply how ParC-CTD may act as a geometry facilitator during Topo IV catalysis. Preparation and Crystallization of Selenomethionyl ParC-CTD— Residues constituting the CTD of prokaryotic type IIA Topo have been clearly defined by various techniques (25Qi Y. Pei J. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2002; 47: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Reece R. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Based on this information and multiple sequence alignment performed using the ClustalX program (35Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35296) Google Scholar), residues 499–810 of the B. stearothermophilus ParC were easily recognized as the region that corresponds to its CTD. The cloning, expression, purification, and crystallization of this domain have been described previously (36Hsieh T.J. Chan N.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Expression of selenomethionyl ParC-CTD was achieved at 20 °C after inducing for 16 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3) in M9 medium supplemented with 40 μg/ml seleno-l-methionine (37Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Purification and crystallization of labeled ParC-CTD were performed using protocols established for native protein with the exception that 1 mm dithiothreitol was used in all of the buffers to replace β-mercaptoethanol as the reducing agent (36Hsieh T.J. Chan N.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Data Collection and Structural Determination—Crystals of selenomethionyl ParC-CTD were stabilized in mother liquor containing 35% methylpentanediol plus 15% ethylene glycol before freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data sets were collected from a single Selabeled crystal at three different wavelengths at SPring8 (Beamline SP12B2, ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector, 100K) and processed by using HKL2000 (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar). Data from each wavelength were indexed according to the same crystal orientation matrix but integrated and scaled independently. Scaled data sets from each of the three wavelengths were then scaled together from 30.0- to 1.8-Å resolution using Scaleit (39Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The structure of ParC-CTD was determined to 1.8-Å resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. Specifically, the selenium substructure was determined with the program Shake-and-Bake (40Weeks C.M. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The refinement of selenium positions, calculation of phases, density modification, and the building of an initial model were all performed by using SHARP/autoSHARP (41De la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The program O (42Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were then used for rounds of manual model rebuilding and refinement, respectively, to a final Rcryst of 16.0% and Rfree of 21.4%. The final model includes all 312 amino acid residues of ParC-CTD and 377 water molecules. Because electron density for part of the histidine tag is well defined, the final ParC-CTD model contains an additional 11 amino acid residues (KLAAALEHHHH from pET21b, Novagen) at the C terminus. 93.4% non-glycine residues have main-chain torsion angles in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Structural Analysis and Homology Modeling—For simplicity, amino acid residues of the histidine tag (residues 313–323) were excluded from all of the subsequent analyses. The figures were prepared using Swiss-Prot Data Base Viewer (43Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments and homology models were conducted by ClustalX (35Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35296) Google Scholar) and WHAT IF (44Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3357) Google Scholar), respectively. Structure of ParC-CTD: a Broken β-Propeller with Hairpin-invaded Blade Topology—ParC-CTD is composed of six highly twisted antiparallel β-sheet modules arranged sequentially along a curved surface to give an overall arc-shaped appearance (Fig. 1A). This architecture approximates the well known β-propeller structures (45Jawad Z. Paoli M. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 447-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 46Paoli M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 103-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 47Fulop V. Jones D.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and resembles the newly discovered GyrA-CTD β-pinwheel in particular (30Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, in sharp contrast to other β-propeller structures (including GyrA-CTD β-pinwheel) where the first and the last propeller blades are always tethered together to form a closed-ring structure, a gap was clearly present in the ParC-CTD between blades 1 and 6, resulting in the breakage of the six-bladed β-propeller ring (Fig. 1A). The closed ring structures seen in all of the other β-propeller proteins were achieved by one or a combination of the three following ways: 1) disulfide linkages; 2) strand exchange (the so-called Velcro topology); or 3) tight packing between the two end blades (47Fulop V. Jones D.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 48Engel M. Hoffmann T. Wagner L. Wermann M. Heiser U. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Bode W. Demuth H.U. Brandstetter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5063-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In ParC-CTD, no close contacts were observed between end blades 1 and 6, and the resulting H2O-filled interblade cleft led directly to the central tunnel. Closer examination revealed that, although blades 2–6 are approximately related around a central pseudosymmetry axis, blade 1 adopts a different orientation regarding this axis. To our knowledge, ParC-CTD revealed for the first time that a protein can fold as a broken β-propeller without ring closure. Although it has been suggested that circularization may play a critical role for structural stability and in its absence the β-propeller structures may be inherently unstable or prone for misassembly (46Paoli M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 103-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 47Fulop V. Jones D.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), our structure provides an exception to this presumption. Moreover, the arc-shaped appearance of ParC-CTD indicates that the packing angle between the adjacent blades contributes significantly to the overall structural curvature. Another prominent feature of ParC-CTD resides in the complex topology of its propeller blades (Fig. 1B). This novel folding pattern was first observed in the GyrA-CTD β-pinwheel, and an unusual type of four-stranded repeating unit that conforms to the Greek key connectivity is defined by Corbett et al. (30Corbett K.D. Shultzaberger R.K. Berger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) to highlight the overall pinwheel topology. However, although subdividing GyrA-CTD into Greek key modules is useful for illustrating the repeating units in the primary sequence level, it is clear that each module does not correspond to a single β-sheet as in other β-propeller structures. Such a depiction consequently emphasizes the differences and underscores the high degree of structural similarity between GyrA-CTD β-pinwheel and other β-propeller structures. To be consistent with the nomenclature used to describe the canonical β-propeller structures, we feel that a single β-sheet in GyrA-CTD and ParC-CTD should be used to define a propeller blade. We suggest that the type of β-sheets observed in GyrA-CTD and ParC-CTD can be referred to as hairpin-invaded β-propeller blades. As shown in Fig. 1B, with the exception of those involved in Velcro topology, the canonical β-propeller blade is comprised of a continuous string of residues that form a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with a simple up-down-up-down topology (45Jawad Z.

Studies of Tpl2 knock-out mice reveal a clear defect in tumor necrosis factor-α production, although very little detail is known about its regulation and the signaling events involved. In the present study we demonstrated that phosphorylation of Cot was required for its maximal activity as phosphatase treatment of Cot decreased its kinase activity. The Cot sequence contains a conserved threonine at position 290 in the activation loop of the kinase domain. We found that mutation of this residue to alanine eliminated its ability to activate MEK/ERK and NF-κB pathways, whereas a phosphomimetic mutation to aspartic acid could rescue the ability to activate MEK. Thr-290 was also required for robust autophosphorylation of Cot. Antibody generated to phospho-Thr-290-Cot recognized both wild-type and kinase-dead Cot, suggesting that phosphorylation of Thr-290 did not occur through autophosphorylation but via another kinase. We showed that Cot was constitutively phosphorylated at Thr-290 in transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells as well as human monocytes as this residue was phosphorylated in unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells to the same degree. Treatment with herbimycin A inhibited Cot activity in the MEK/ERK pathway but did not inhibit phosphorylation at Thr-290. Together these results showed that phosphorylation of Cot at Thr-290 is necessary but not sufficient for full kinase activity in the MEK/ERK pathway.

Human kinase suppressor of Ras 2 (hKSR-2) negatively regulates Cot in the NF-κB and MEK/ERK pathways by direct binding (11Channavajhala P.L. Wu L. Cuozzo J.W. Hall J.P. Liu W. Lin L.L. Zhang Y. J.

Many serine/threonine kinases contain activating phosphorylation sites in the activation loop of the kinase domain, which lies between the conserved DFG and APE motifs. The MAP3Ks MEK kinase 1, Ssk2, and TAK1 are all activated by phosphorylation of conserved residues in this area. To investigate more fully the extent to which phosphorylation may regulate the activity of Cot, we analyzed mutants of a residue in the activation loop, Thr-290. This threonine corresponds to a conserved phosphorylation site in the activation loop of several MAP3Ks and therefore may be important for Cot regulation or activation. In this report we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Thr-290 is necessary but not sufficient for Cot kinase activity. Phosphatase Assay—λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) was incubated with Cot-(30–398) with a N-terminal His tag in the buffer provided (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35) for 1 h at 30 °C. The phosphatase reaction was stopped by addition of a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) (14Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem.

Samples were diluted in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP) and incubated for 0.5 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HEK-293T cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant Cot constructs at 10 μg/1000 μl of calcium phosphate solution (Profection mammalian transfection systems, Promega). Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and lysed on ice for 15 min in a non-ionic detergent buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using either anti-FLAG agarose-conjugated beads for 2 h or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by recovery on γ-Pro Bind Sepharose for 1 h (Amersham Biosciences). FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted from the beads by competition with FLAG peptide. The antibodies used were: anti-FLAG M2 and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MEK1/2, anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221), anti-ERK1/2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-Cot (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Myc monoclonal 9E10 (Upstate Biotechnologies). In Vitro Phosphorylation—Immunoprecipitated and peptide-eluted or recombinant proteins expressed with glutathione S-transferase tag were incubated in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm ATP) for 30 min at room temperature. For radiolabeled assays 1 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP was added to each. Generation of Mutants—Cot constructs were generated by PCR mutagenesis. Either an N-terminal FLAG tag or a C-terminal Myc tag was added using the following PCR primers: 5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG-3′ (FLAG primer) and 5′-CAGATCTTCTTCAGAAATAAGTTTTTGTTC-3′ (Myc primer). Threonine 290 mutants were generated using the following primers: 5′-CTCCGAGGAGCAGAGATTTACATGAGCCCA-3′ (Thr to Ala), 5′-CTCCGAGGAGACGACATTTACATGAGCCCA-3′ (Thr to Asp), and 5′-CTCCGAGGAGAAGACATTTACATGAGCCCA-3′ (Thr to Glu). All mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture—HEK-293T cell lines were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were passaged every 2–3 days as required to maintain log phase growth for all experiments. Cells were treated after transfection with 1 μg/ml herbimycin A for 3 h, 1 μm staurosporine for 1 h, or 0.4 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 5 min before harvest and lysis in SDS buffer. Luciferase Assay—The assay was carried out using the Promega dual luciferase reporter assay kit (catalog no. E1960). Cells were transfected as described with NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-TK, a Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid to normalize the experimental results. Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection in 1× passive lysis buffer. 20 μl of cell lysate was transferred to a 96-well plate designed especially for the luciferase assay (Thermo Lab Systems). The Fluoroscan Ascent FL luminometer (Thermo Lab Systems) was programmed to perform a 2-s premeasurement followed by a 10-s measurement of luciferase activity. Samples were analyzed three times in duplicates. Generation of Thr-290 Antibody—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated by ResGen/Invitrogen using the peptide PKDLRGpTEIYMSPE where pT is phosphothreonine. Antibodies were affinity-purified/cross-absorbed against unphosphorylated peptide. Isolation and Culture of Human Monocytes—Primary human monocytes were purified from human whole blood buffy coat (Pennsylvania Plasma). Red blood cells were removed with a Ficoll gradient and RosetteSep antibody mixture (Stem Cell Technologies). Enriched monocytes were washed, analyzed for purity, and plated in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum at a concentration of 2 million cells/ml. After resting 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cells were treated with 10 ng/μl LPS (Sigma) for 15–45 min. LPS Treatment of Human Whole Blood—Human whole blood was collected in heparinized tubes and incubated at 37 °C with rocking for 1.5 h. Blood, 1.5 ml/sample, was then aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes. LPS was added to a concentration of 10 ng/ml, and the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated amount of time. After the incubations, the blood was transferred into 15-ml conical tubes, and 13 ml of ice-cold isotonic lysis buffer (155 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc) was added. The tubes were incubated on ice for 30 min, and total leukocytes were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. The pelleted cells were washed twice by resuspension in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was lysed in 100 μl of1× sample buffer (Invitrogen) and sonicated briefly. The samples (20 μl each) were then loaded onto gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with antibodies as mentioned. Phosphorylation Is Necessary for Cot Kinase Activity—To determine whether Cot activity is dependent on phosphorylation, we treated overexpressed and purified Cot with phosphatase and evaluated its activity in an in vitro kinase assay using unactive (unphosphorylated) MEK as the substrate. We used a truncated form of Cot, Cot-(30–398), since this construct has robust activity in vitro (19Gandara M.L. Lopez P. Hernando R. Castano J.G. Alemany S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7377-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Treatment with λ-phosphatase significantly reduced the kinase activity of Cot-(30–398) (Fig. 1A). These results were also seen with full-length Cot (Fig. 1B), supporting the conclusion that phosphorylation is necessary for maximal kinase activity. Tpl2/Cot Contains a Conserved Threonine at Position 290— Alignment of the Cot activation loop sequence with that of other MAP3Ks suggests that phosphorylation of a threonine residue at position 290 (Thr-290) may be required for Cot activity. Cot Thr-290 aligns with Thr-575 on MEK kinase 1, Ser-192 on TAK1 (20Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and Thr-1460 on Ssk2 (Fig. 2). Mutagenesis studies have shown that phosphorylation of each of these residues is essential for activity of their respective kinases (14Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 20Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The alignment of Cot with these kinases suggests that phosphorylation of residue Thr-290 may be similarly important in the activation of Cot. Mutation of Threonine 290 to Alanine Abolishes Kinase Activity—To test whether Thr-290 is important for kinase activity, we mutated Thr-290 to Ala as well as Glu and Asp, both of which can mimic phosphorylated threonine. We then measured the activity of these proteins in the MEK/ERK pathway. Wild-type Cot, a kinase-dead Cot K167R (21Patriotis C. Makris A. Chernoff J. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9755-9759Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the three Thr-290 mutants were FLAG-tagged and transfected into HEK-293T cells along with a mock-transfected control. Fig. 3A shows the activity of each construct as measured by Western blot analysis of endogenous phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK. Wild-type Cot drives the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, but the substitution of threonine 290 with alanine effectively eliminates most of the MEK phosphorylation as does the mutation of threonine 290 to glutamic acid. The threonine to aspartic acid mutation partially rescues kinase activity as measured by MEK phosphorylation, and there is nearly complete recovery of phospho-ERK. These results confirm the importance of Thr-290 for kinase activity and suggest that a negative charge in this position, as provided by the T290D mutation, is necessary for activity. Negative charge would also be provided by phosphorylation at this site. To demonstrate that the various mutants did not lose activity due to a structural change we evaluated the ability of the constructs to bind hKSR-2. hKSR-2 interacts with Tpl2/Cot and attenuates Cot-mediated ERK and NF-κB activation (11Channavajhala P.L. Wu L. Cuozzo J.W. Hall J.P. Liu W. Lin L.L. Zhang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47089-47097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We co-transfected each of the Myc-tagged Cot constructs into HEK-293T cells with FLAG-hKSR-2 (data not shown). All five mutants were able to associate with hKSR-2, suggesting that the point mutations at Thr-290 did not result in a global structural change of the Cot protein and that the loss of activity of the Cot mutants was due to loss of function normally conferred by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Cot Thr-290 Is Required for Autophosphorylation—FLAG-tagged Cot, kinase-dead Cot K167R, and the three Thr-290 mutants were transfected into HEK-293T cells. Immunoprecipitated, eluted Cot proteins were used in an in vitro kinase assay using MEK as a substrate. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting. As seen in the cascade activity assay only wild-type Cot was active against MEK (Fig. 4A). To evaluate the ability of the mutants to autophosphorylate, eluted Cot samples were assayed in an in vitro kinase assay using [γ-33P]ATP. Wild-type Cot showed significant incorporation of 33P, while, as expected, the kinase-dead Cot was not able to autophosphorylate. The Cot T290D mutant retained about 15% (by densitometry of bands) of the autophosphorylation activity by mimicking the phosphorylated state, whereas the autophosphorylation of the T290A and T290E mutants was not far above background (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that not only is Thr-290 phosphorylation required for robust autophosphorylation of Cot but also that autophosphorylation can occur at a site distinct from Thr-290 as the T290D mutant incorporated 33P. Thr-290 Is Necessary for Activation of the NF-κB Pathway in Vitro—Overexpressed Cot will activate the MEK/ERK pathway and the NF-κB kinase cascade (22Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We evaluated the activity of these mutant constructs in the NF-κB pathway by luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 5). In each test performed, only wild-type Cot activated the NF-κB pathway, indicating strongly that Thr-290 phosphorylation is required for kinase activity. Phosphospecific Cot Thr-290 Antibody Recognizes Wild-type and Kinase-dead Cot—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated using the phospho-Thr-290-specific peptide PKDLRGpTEIYMSPE where pT is phosphothreonine. To test the antibody for specificity against phospho-Thr-290, we transfected HEK-293T cells with FLAG-tagged full-length Cot, kinase-dead Cot K167R, and Cot T290A. Immunoprecipitated and eluted recombinant proteins were evaluated by Western blot. The anti-phospho-Thr-290 recognized wild-type and kinase-dead Cot (K167R) but not the T290A mutant, indicating that the antibody was specific for wild-type Cot (Fig. 6A). Phosphospecificity was demonstrated by the addition of a peptide corresponding to the sequence surrounding threonine 290, either unphosphorylated as a control or phosphorylated to block antibody binding. The antibody only recognized wild-type Cot when used with the unphosphorylated peptide. Phosphorylated peptide completely blocked antibody signal, and T290A mutant was not recognized over background, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody. We investigated the K167R phosphorylation and the specificity of the anti-phospho-Thr-290 antibody further on whole cell lysates from HEK-293T cells transfected with wild-type full-length Cot, Cot K167R, Cot T290A, Cot T290D, and Cot T290E. Lysates were rapidly lysed and boiled to prevent further modification. Anti-phospho-Thr-290 recognized both full-length and kinase-dead Cot. As expected, the antibody did not recognize Cot Thr-290 mutants, confirming the specificity of the antibody (Fig. 6B). As observed with the isolated protein (Fig. 6A), K167R mutant was phosphorylated to the same degree as wild type, suggesting that these proteins are phosphorylated at Thr-290 by another kinase rather than through autophosphorylation. This represents the first identified case in which this conserved residue is phosphorylated by a means other than autophosphorylation. Thr-290 Is Constitutively Phosphorylated in Transfected HEK-293T Cells—The phosphorylation of kinase-dead Cot at Thr-290 suggests that another kinase may be upstream of Cot activation as this mutant cannot autophosphorylate. Herbimycin A is an irreversible inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, and it has been found to block LPS activation of ERK in macrophages (23Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work by another group has demonstrated that preincubation of RAW264.7 cells with herbimycin A prevents the activation of Tpl2 by LPS or Taxol (24Caivano M. Rodriguez C. Cohen P. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52124-52130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether treatment with herbimycin A would reduce phosphorylation at threonine 290 as this drug may inhibit a putative kinase upstream of Cot. After transfection of wild-type Cot and kinase-dead Cot into HEK-293T cells, cells were then treated with herbimycin A or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a phorbol ester activator of the MEK/ERK pathway via C-Raf (24Caivano M. Rodriguez C. Cohen P. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52124-52130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Neither compound inhibited the phosphorylation of Thr-290. However, herbimycin A did inhibit Cot-induced MEK phosphorylation (Fig. 7A), indicating the existence of a herbimycin A-sensitive activator of the Cot/MEK/ERK pathway. We then repeated this experiment with the addition of staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of most kinases. Staurosporine treatment also did not reduce the phosphorylation at Thr-290 nor did it reduce MEK phosphorylation in cells with wild-type Cot (Fig. 7B). In a control experiment, staurosporine inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced phosphorylation of MEK, indicating that it did inhibit activation of the MEK/ERK pathway via Ras/Raf. Therefore, while Thr-290 phosphorylation was resistant to both staurosporine and herbimycin A treatment, Cot activity in the MEK/ERK pathway was inhibited by herbimycin A. Thr-290 Is Constitutively Phosphorylated in Human Monocytes—Cot kinase is constitutively active when overexpressed in HEK-293T cells and consequently activates the MEK/ERK pathway. However, in monocytes and macrophages, activation of this pathway requires extracellular stimulation. LPS stimulation of mouse macrophages results in Tpl2 (mouse homolog of Cot)-dependent MEK1 phosphorylation, and Tpl2–/– macrophages are defective in LPS-stimulated activation of MEK1 and ERK1/2 (4Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Additionally we have observed that LPS activates Cot in primary human monocytes. Cot immunoprecipitated from untreated human monocytes will not phosphorylate MEK in vitro, whereas Cot immunoprecipitated from LPS-treated monocytes phosphorylates MEK (data not shown). In these cells, LPS may be inducing downstream phosphorylation of Cot and thus increasing its kinase activity. To determine whether phosphorylation of Cot threonine 290 increases in response to LPS treatment, we prepared primary monocytes from human whole blood and treated the cells with LPS. As expected, LPS treatment activated Cot phosphorylation of MEK (Fig. 8A). In contrast, we observed no increase in phospho-Cot-Thr-290 in response to LPS; phosphorylation was observed on both LPS-treated and untreated samples. We explored this further by examining both the MEK/ERK and p38 pathways in a time course of LPS treatment using total leukocytes from human whole blood (Fig. 8B). Human whole blood was treated with LPS, and samples were removed at 20-min intervals. Cot activity was measured by phosphorylation of p38 and MEK, which showed response to LPS treatment with peak times of 20 min and 1 h, respectively. The phosphorylation of Cot Thr-290, however, was steady throughout, and quantitation of bands correlated with that of the loading control (total MEK). We conclude from these data that, while necessary for kinase activity, threonine 290 phosphorylation of Cot is constitutive in human monocytes. Inflammation is a key process in the host defense system. LPS, the predominant endotoxin produced by Gram-negative bacteria, activates cells involved in innate immunity, such as T cells and macrophages, resulting in the production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. However, excessive production of TNF-α can lead to neurodegenerative disorders and sepsis (25Waage A. Halstensen A. Shalaby R. Brandtzaeg P. Kierulf P. Espevik T. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 26Waage A. Brandtzaeg P. Halstensen A. Kierulf P. Espevik T. J. Exp.

Gut. 1993; 34: 1705-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and rheumatoid arthritis (33Feldman M. Taylor P. Paleolog E. Brennan F.M. Maini R.N.

To date, anti-TNF-α therapy has been successful in treating rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis (35Raza A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 36Bondeson J. Maini R.N. Int. J. Clin. Pract. 2001; 55: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mizutani H. Ohmoto Y. Mizutani T. Murata M. Shimizu M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1997; 14: 145-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Components of the TNF-α production signaling pathway are potential targets for further development of therapeutic agents. Analyses of Tpl2–/– mice have revealed that Tpl2/Cot acts downstream of LPS signaling and mediates TNF-α production (4Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Thus, Cot has emerged as an interesting target for anti-inflammatory drugs for therapy of human autoimmune diseases. The mechanism of Cot activation by LPS, which presumably occurs via the LPS receptor Toll-like receptor 4, is still largely unknown. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Cot at Thr-290 is critical for kinase activity. We first demonstrated that the overall phosphorylation state of Cot is important for kinase activity. Dephosphorylation of Cot with λ-phosphatase significantly decreases kinase activity, although some residual kinase activity remains. In a similar experiment Caivano et al. (24Caivano M. Rodriguez C. Cohen P. Alemany S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52124-52130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were unable to remove any phosphate from Cot using various protein phosphatases 1 or 2A or protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, although they did not use λ-phosphatase. We observed the same result with these phosphatases as well as calf intestinal phosphatase (data not shown). It may be that λ-phosphatase has only limited access to phosphorylated residues on Cot, and thus λ-phosphatase is only partially effective in removing phosphates from this kinase. Similar results have been shown for other MAP3Ks, which only show a partial reduction of activity after dephosphorylation (14Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, the observed reduction of kinase activity suggests that the phosphorylation state is a key component of Cot activity. We showed that mutation of threonine 290 to alanine (T290A) eliminated kinase activity in vitro and in the MEK/ERK and NF-κB pathways when overexpressed in HEK-293T cells. The phosphomimetic mutation of Thr-290 to aspartic acid (T290D) rescued a portion of the kinase activity in HEK-293T cells and the ability to autophosphorylate in vitro. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation of this residue is necessary for full activity. The residual activity retained by the T290D construct seen in HEK-293T cells was not measurable in the NFκB pathway. This discrepancy could perhaps be explained by a difference in assay sensitivity, accessibility of substrate, or a threshold effect requiring more Tpl2 activity for NF-κB activation than MEK activation. Nevertheless the fact that Thr-290 mutants lost their kinase activity suggests that phosphorylation at Thr-290 is essential for Cot kinase activity. One of our most significant findings was that kinase-dead Cot K167R is phosphorylated at Thr-290. We conclude from this observation that another kinase must phosphorylate Cot at this site. This finding represents the first case in which a MAP3K is phosphorylated at this conserved residue in the activation loop via another kinase. This situation is in contrast to that of the other MAP3Ks for which phosphorylation at this residue is required for kinase activity. For MEK kinase 1, TAK1, and Ssk2, phosphorylation at this residue occurs via autophosphorylation either intra- or intermolecularly (13Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation at Thr-290 appears to be constitutive in monocytes and total blood leukocytes, perhaps occurring concomitantly with translation. The fact that endogenous Cot from human monocytes and whole blood leukocytes is constitutively phosphorylated even in unstimulated cells strongly suggests that phosphorylation at Thr-290 precedes other regulatory events. Constitutive phosphorylation of a site critical for activity has been demonstrated in the case of protein kinase C (38Cenni V. Doppler H. Sonnenburg E.D. Maraldi N. Newton A.C. Toker A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and B-Raf (39Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation event occurs during translation of these proteins. While A-Raf and Raf-1 require interaction with Ras-GTP and subsequent phosphorylation at two distinct sites for full activity (40Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4378-4383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), B-Raf is constitutively phosphorylated at one of the two critical sites and has a phosphomimetic amino acid substituted at the other. In the case of protein kinase C, PDK-1 phosphorylation of the activation loop is required for protein kinase C to autophosphorylate. In all but the novel protein kinase Cs, this phosphorylation is constitutive (38Cenni V. Doppler H. Sonnenburg E.D. Maraldi N. Newton A.C. Toker A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A kinase upstream of Cot is suggested by our results using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Neither herbimycin A nor staurosporine inhibited Cot in an in vitro assay measuring MEK phosphorylation directly (data not shown). However, treatment of cells with herbimycin A abolished Cot activity in the MEK/ERK pathway. Staurosporine did not affect the activity of Cot in this pathway. These results indicate the existence of a kinase upstream of Cot that is staurosporine-insensitive but is inactivated in the presence of herbimycin A. We have begun to elucidate the mechanisms by which Cot activation occurs by identifying Thr-290 as being a critical residue in the activation of Cot. Herbimycin A inhibited activation of the MEK/ERK pathway by Cot, while Thr-290 phosphorylation of Cot was unaffected. It is therefore clear that Thr-290 phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for kinase activity in this pathway. It is obvious from the drug sensitivity of this pathway that there are additional upstream phosphorylation events required for Cot activity. In contrast to the constitutive phosphorylation of Thr-290, these events may be regulated in response to extracellular stimuli such as LPS. We identified several other phosphorylated residues of Cot and are currently investigating their potential role in Cot activation. Regulation of Cot is of great interest to the signaling field since the Cot/MEK/ERK pathway potentially plays a role in the etiology of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Our results represent a new insight into the phosphorylation events that activate this kinase. We thank the members of the Lin laboratory for helpful discussion and comments on the manuscript. We especially thank Feng Yu for help with the preparation of primary human monocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1990009045,"Proteasome-dependent processing of the endoplasmic reticulum localized transcription factor Spt23p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae generates its transcriptionally competent form and requires the WW domain containing Rsp5p ubiquitin ligase. Although previous studies documented an Rsp5p-Spt23p association in cells, very little is known about the nature of this interaction. We report here the identification of an imperfect type I WW domain-binding site (LPKY) within the carboxyl-terminal region of Spt23p that is required for Rsp5p binding in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of this motif abrogates Rsp5p-induced ubiquitination of Spt23p in vitro and reduces ubiquitination of the Spt23p precursor in yeast. In addition, the Spt23pΔLPKY mutant is inefficiently processed and is defective at up-regulating target gene (OLE1) expression in cells. Deletion of the corresponding LPKY site within Mga2p, an Spt23p homologue, also abrogates Rsp5p binding and Rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination in vitro as well as Rsp5p binding and Mga2p polyubiquitination in cells. However, the Mga2pΔLPKY mutant undergoes efficient proteasome-dependent processing. These experiments indicate that the LPKY motif of Spt23p is required for Rsp5p binding, Rsp5-induced ubiquitination, proteasome-dependent processing, and its OLE1 inducing function. They also suggest that the LPKY motif of Mga2p is required for Rsp5p binding and ubiquitination, and Rsp5p regulates Mga2p function by a mechanism that is independent of providing the partial degradation signal. Proteasome-dependent processing of the endoplasmic reticulum localized transcription factor Spt23p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae generates its transcriptionally competent form and requires the WW domain containing Rsp5p ubiquitin ligase. Although previous studies documented an Rsp5p-Spt23p association in cells, very little is known about the nature of this interaction. We report here the identification of an imperfect type I WW domain-binding site (LPKY) within the carboxyl-terminal region of Spt23p that is required for Rsp5p binding in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of this motif abrogates Rsp5p-induced ubiquitination of Spt23p in vitro and reduces ubiquitination of the Spt23p precursor in yeast. In addition, the Spt23pΔLPKY mutant is inefficiently processed and is defective at up-regulating target gene (OLE1) expression in cells. Deletion of the corresponding LPKY site within Mga2p, an Spt23p homologue, also abrogates Rsp5p binding and Rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination in vitro as well as Rsp5p binding and Mga2p polyubiquitination in cells. However, the Mga2pΔLPKY mutant undergoes efficient proteasome-dependent processing. These experiments indicate that the LPKY motif of Spt23p is required for Rsp5p binding, Rsp5-induced ubiquitination, proteasome-dependent processing, and its OLE1 inducing function. They also suggest that the LPKY motif of Mga2p is required for Rsp5p binding and ubiquitination, and Rsp5p regulates Mga2p function by a mechanism that is independent of providing the partial degradation signal. Regulated ubiquitin proteasome-dependent processing is an uncommon event where the proteasome promotes limited rather than complete degradation of substrates. The best studied examples of proteins that undergo this process are the NF-κB precursors p105 and p100. Limited proteasome-dependent degradation of p105 (encoded by NF-κB1) generates p50, whereas partial proteolysis of p100 (encoded by NF-κB2) gives rise to p52 (1Palombella V.J. Rando O.J.

Similar to the complete degradation process, incomplete proteolysis of p105 and p100 by the proteasome requires ubiquitin modification, and both proteins are substrates of the SCFβTrCP E3 ligase (5Heissmeyer V.

The highly stable structures present within the sd1 and sd2 regions of the Rel homology domain in NFKB1 suppress destruction of amino-terminal sequences (8Lin L. Kobayashi M. J. Biol.

The glycine-rich region located carboxyl-terminal to the Rel homology domain is also necessary for limited proteolysis (4Heusch M. Lin L. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although the precise role that the glycine-rich domain plays in this process remains unclear. After proteolysis, p50 and p52 dimerize with p65, forming the NF-κB transcriptional regulatory complex (reviewed in Ref. 14Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar). This complex is maintained in a latent state in the cytoplasm via an interaction with inhibitor proteins termed IκBs. Nuclear mobilization of the NF-κB complex occurs by signal-induced ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of IκBs.Two homologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factors, Spt23p and Mga2p, also undergo limited proteasome-dependent degradation, and interestingly, they share many structural domains with p105 and p100 (15Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Spt23p and Mga2p harbor ankyrin repeats as well as a Rel homology domain (also termed a Ig-like/plexins/transcription factor (IPT) 1The abbreviations used are: IPT, Ig-like/plexins/transcription factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: IPT, Ig-like/plexins/transcription factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin ligase; HA, hemagglutinin. dimerization domain). One major difference between the yeast and NF-κB proteins is that Spt23p and Mga2p contain a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain and are expressed as 120-kDa ER-anchored proteins (termed p120) (15Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These proteins form homodimers at the ER membrane, followed by proteasome-dependent processing of one of the monomers (16Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The processing events generate Spt23p and Mga2p polypeptides that migrate at ∼90 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (termed p90) (15Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the processed products remain tethered to the ER membrane via an interaction with the unprocessed monomer, and release of the processed products from the ER also appears to be dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (16Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 17Shcherbik N. Zoladek T. Nickels J.T. Haines D.S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For Spt23p, it has been shown that monoubiquitination of Spt23p90 provides the signal for its mobilization to the nucleus by the Cdc48pNpl4p/Ufd1p segregase-chaperone complex (16Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In contrast, Mga2p90 release from the ER has been linked to Mga2p120 polyubiquitination and Cdc48pNpl4p/Ufd1p-mediated separation of polyubiquitinated Mga2p120 from unmodified Mga2p90 (17Shcherbik N. Zoladek T. Nickels J.T. Haines D.S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This presumably leads to degradation of Mga2p120 by the proteasome and nuclear translocation of Mga2p90 (17Shcherbik N. Zoladek T. Nickels J.T. Haines D.S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, once liberated from the membrane, p90 polypeptides of Spt23p and Mga2p migrate to the nucleus where they up-regulate the expression of the essential yeast gene OLE1 (encodes Δ9 fatty acid desaturase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of oleic acid) (15Hoppe T.

Haines D.S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The Rsp5p ubiquitin ligase is required for the OLE1 inducing function of Spt23p and Mga2p. Similar to spt23Δ/mga2Δ cells, the proliferation deficiency of rsp5Δ cells is rescued (at least in part) by supplementation of growth medium with oleic acid or transformation with spt23 or mga2 alleles lacking the transmembrane domain (15Hoppe T.

Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rsp5p is a member of the highly conserved Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases, and these proteins harbor a Ca2+/phospholipid-binding (C2) domain, multiple protein-interacting modules termed WW domains, and a homologous E6-AP carboxyl terminus domain (reviewed in Ref. 19Ingham R.J. Gish G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1972-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rsp5p has also been implicated in inducing the complete degradation of numerous proteins, including plasma membrane-localized permeases and transporters (20Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Rsp5p recognition sequences on many of these proteins have yet to be defined, and it still remains possible that their differential turnover in rsp5 mutant cells is an indirect result of losing Rsp5p function.Although Rsp5p is dispensable for Mga2p processing and may activate its function by promoting release of the processed product from the ER (17Shcherbik N. Zoladek T. Nickels J.T. Haines D.S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the ligase is required for proteasome-dependent processing of Sp23p (15Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Rsp5p-induced processing of Spt23p requires WW domain 3 and the homologous E6-AP carboxyl terminus domain but not the C2 domain of the ligase (15Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Rsp5p has also been shown to interact with Spt23p and Mga2p in cells as determined by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analyses, perhaps pointing to a direct association between Rsp5p and these membrane-bound transcription factors (15Hoppe T.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1041-1048PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little is currently known about the nature of the Rsp5p-Sp23p or Rsp5p-Mga2p interactions. The goal of this study was to define the Rsp5-binding domains within Spt23p and Mga2p and determine the consequence of deleting these regions on their ubiquitination, processing, and OLE1 inducing function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Plasmids, and Antibodies—Yeast techniques and manipulations were performed according to standards protocols. Preparation of oleic acid containing media and plates as well as genotypes of rsp5Δ, spt23Δ, mga2Δ, and appropriate isogenic yeast strains have been described by us previously (17Shcherbik N. Zoladek T. Nickels J.T. Haines D.S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive proteasome deficient cim3-1 strain (MATa ura3-52 leu2Δ his3Δ200 cim3-1) was a kind gift from Charles Mann (Service de Biochimie et de Genetique Moleculaire, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). The yeast expression construct for Myc-tagged Mga2p that is under control of its native promoter, pYEplac181MycMGA2, was kindly provided by Stefan Jentsch (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Plasmids pQE30-His6RSP5WW1/2/3, pYes-HARSP5, pYes-FLAGMGA2HA, pYes-FLAGMGA2, pYes-FLAGmga2Δipt, pYEplac181-Mycmga2Δipt, pYes-FLAGSPT23HA, pYes-FLAGSPT23, and pESC-FLAGSPT23 have been described previously (17Shcherbik N.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1041-1048PubMed Google Scholar). spt23Δlpky and mga2Δlpky mutant constructs (i.e. pYes-FLAGspt23pΔlpky, pYes-FLAGspt23pΔipt, pYes-FLAGmga2pΔlpky, pYes-FLAGspt23HApΔlpky, pYes-FLAGmga2HApΔlpky, and pYEplac181-Mycmga2Δlpky) were generated by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis procedure (21Shcherbik N. Kumar S. Haines D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1041-1048PubMed Google Scholar) using the appropriate wild-type versions of the constructs as templates (sequences of all primers used for mutagenesis are available upon request). The anti-FLAG antibody M5, anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Oncogene Research Products), anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemical), and anti-ubiquitin antibody P4D1 (Santa Cruz) were purchased from the indicated sources.In Vitro Binding Assay—In vitro binding assays were performed as described previously (17Shcherbik N. Zoladek T. Nickels J.T. Haines D.S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1227-1233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, a His6-tagged Rsp5p polypeptide containing only the WW domains of the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli XL-2 blue cells upon isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 6 h. The cells were lysed in 8 m urea containing buffer B, pH 8.0, and proteins captured on Ni2+-agarose beads (Qiagen). The beads were washed sequentially in 8 m urea containing buffer C, pH 6.3, and buffer D, pH 5.9, and the recombinant Rsp5p protein was renatured gradually in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl). For binding reactions, 100 μl of beads were mixed with 35S-labeled proteins generated in reticulocytes (performed with a TnT-coupled reticulocyte kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions) and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. The protein complexes were washed sequentially with 10, 25, and 50 mm imidazole-containing binding buffer and eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and signal was visualized by fluorography.Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Yeast cell pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm dl-α-glycerophosphate, 30 mm Na3P2O7, and 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (all at a final concentration of 1 mm) aprotinin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Acid washed glass beads (Sigma) were added to the cell suspension, and the samples were vortexed for 30 min at 4 °C. After clarification by centrifugation, supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For Western blotting, 5–50 μg of protein extract was resolved on 6–8% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitations, 1 mg of protein lysates prepared in RIPA buffer were diluted in an equal volume of 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitors. The protein extracts were first preclarified with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated with appropriate antibodies for 2.5 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Protein G-Sepharose was added, and the incubations were continued for an additional 2 h. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with RIPA buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—FLAGSpt23p and FLAGMga2p were translated in the presence of [35S]-methionine in a wheat germ extract coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (TnT; Promega). 15 μl of the translation reaction was used for each ubiquitination reaction. Ubiquitination reactions contained the following in a total volume of 120 μl: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 125 μm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma), 20 ng of purified human E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, and 10 ng of purified yeast Ubc1p. Purified Rsp5p (50 ng) or buffer control was added to initiate the reactions, and the reactions were incubated for 40 min at room temperature. The reactions were then placed on ice and diluted to a total volume of 250 μl with buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. 2 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was added along with protein G-agarose, and the reactions were rotated at 4° for 1 h. The agarose beads were collected and washed with buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to the washed beads. The beads were heated at 90° for 5 min, and the supernatants were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were exposed to film, and the proteins were detected by autoradiography.Northern Blotting—RNA isolations and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (21Shcherbik N. Kumar S. Haines D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1041-1048PubMed Google Scholar) using 32P-radiolabeled OLE1 or U2 cDNA (used as a loading control) probes.RESULTSThe LPKY Motif of Spt23p Is Required for Rsp5p Binding in Vitro and in Vivo—It has previously been documented that Rsp5p interacts with Spt23p via the WW domains of the ligase (15Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 21Shcherbik N. Kumar S. Haines D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1041-1048PubMed Google Scholar). The WW domains of Rsp5p have been classified as Group I WW domains based on their direct binding preference for proline-containing sequences (22Chang A. Cheang S. Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20562-20571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Typically, Group I WW domains bind PPXY sequences, although it has been shown that the first proline position can be replaced by other amino acids such as serine or leucine (22Chang A. Cheang S. Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20562-20571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There is only one putative Group I WW domain-binding site located within Spt23p and this imperfect site (LPKY) is present carboxyl-terminal to the processing termination site of Spt23p (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this motif is required for Rsp5p binding, we performed in vitro association assays with a recombinant Rsp5p polypeptide containing only the WW domains of the protein and in vitro translated full-length Spt23p or a Spt23p mutant lacking these four amino acids. As shown in Fig. 1B, we detected an interaction between the WW domains of Rsp5p and full-length Spt23p. However, only background binding was observed between the WW domain containing Rsp5p polypeptide and Spt23pΔLPKY, indicating that the LPKY motif mediates an interaction with the substrate binding domain of the ligase. To determine whether elimination of the LPKY motif abrogates an interaction between Rsp5p and Spt23p in cells, we co-expressed epitope tagged versions of Rsp5p and Spt23p (either full-length or the ΔLPKY mutant). Immunoprecipitations were performed with an antibody recognizing the amino-terminal FLAG tag on Spt23. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with an antibody recognizing amino-terminal HA-tagged Rsp5p. Fig. 1C shows the presence of Rsp5p in immunoprecipitations derived from cells expressing Rsp5p and Spt23p. Rsp5p was not detected in immunoprecipitations from cells extracts harboring Rsp5p and Spt23pΔLPKY or in any of the control immunoprecipitations. These results show that the LPKY motif of Spt23p is required for Rsp5p binding in vitro and in yeast, and considering the nature of the domains required for an interaction (i.e. type I WW domains and the LPKY motif), we conclude that the Rsp5p-Spt23p interaction is direct.Deletion of the LPKY Motif Abrogates Rsp5p-induced Spt23p Ubiquitination in Vitro and Ubiquitination in Cells—Our next aim was to determine whether deletion of the LPKY motif abrogates Rsp5p-dependent Spt23p ubiquitination in vitro. In vitro ubiquitin conjugation reactions with Spt23p and Spt23pΔLPKY (translated in wheat germ extracts) were carried out in the presence of purified E1 and E2 enzymes in either the presence or the absence of recombinant Rsp5p. A recombinant catalytically inactivate Rsp5p mutant harboring an alanine substitution at the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue was also included as a control for this experiment. As shown in Fig. 2A, a marked increase in the amount of high molecular weight conjugates and a corresponding decrease in the level of unmodified Spt23p120 was observed in reactions containing purified Rsp5p. This Rsp5p-induced modification was not observed in reactions containing Spt23pΔLPKY or in control reactions with Spt23p and the ligase-deficient Rsp5p mutant. These results provide strong evidence for a direct physical and functional interaction between Spt23p and Rsp5p and suggest that this association is mediated by a single imperfect group I WW domain-binding motif that is located within the carboxyl terminus of the protein.Fig. 2Amino acids LPKY of Spt23p are required for ubiquitination. A, in vitro ubiquitination reactions were performed with the indicated 35S-labeled Spt23p proteins (generated in wheat germ extracts) and purified recombinant E1, E2, and E3 enzymes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After termination of the ubiquitination reactions, Spt23p proteins were immunopurified, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to fluorography. B, yeast were transformed with vectors containing galactose-inducible SPT23 or spt23Δlpky. The cells were grown in glucose media and placed in galactose medium overnight. The extracts were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were performed with an isotype control (C) or an antibody recognizing carboxyl-terminal HA-tagged Spt23p (S). Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with antibody recognizing ubiquitin (Ub) or HA-tagged Spt23p.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ascertain that deletion of the WW domain-binding site affects Spt23p ubiquitination in cells, yeast were transformed with SPT23 or spt23pΔlpky expression constructs. Spt23p proteins were immunopurified from cell extracts using an antibody recognizing a carboxyl-terminal HA epitope tag (this will be present only within unprocessed Spt23p120), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then probed with anti-ubiquitin or anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2B (top panel), Spt23pΔLPKY is poorly ubiquitinated in vivo when compared with full-length Spt23p. Low amounts of ubiquitinated Spt23pΔLPKY could not be explained by decreased expression or inefficient immunoprecipitation because equivalent amounts of total Spt23p120 and Spt23p120ΔLPKY were present in the immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). These results suggest that deletion of the Rsp5p-binding LPKY motif abrogates Spt23p ubiquitination in cells and is consistent with the idea that this domain mediates a functional interaction with the ligase in vivo.Deletion of the LPKY Motif Abrogates Spt23p Processing and Its OLE1 Inducing Function—To determine whether the identified Rsp5p-binding site is required for Spt23p processing, spt23Δ cells were transformed with SPT23, spt23Δlpky or spt23Δipt expression constructs. The spt23Δipt construct was included as a control for this experiment because previous studies have documented a requirement for the IPT dimerization domain in Spt23p processing (16Rape M. Hoppe T. Gorr I. Kalocay M. Richly H. Jentsch S. Cell. 2001; 107: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, we could not detect Spt23p90 in cells harboring the IPT domain mutant, whereas only a very small amount of the processed product was detected in cells expressing Spt23pΔLPKY. Considering the reduced amount of Spt23p90 present in cells harboring spt23Δlpky, we reasoned that the encoded mutant is deficient at inducing target gene expression. To test this, we measured the amount of OLE1 transcripts (a Spt23p target gene) in cells expressing Spt23p, Spt23pΔLPKY, and Spt23pΔIPT. Fig. 3B shows dramatically lower amounts of OLE1 RNA in cells expressing Spt23pΔLPKY or Spt23pΔIPT when compared with cells expressing full-length Spt23p. These results suggest that the LPKY motif is required for proteasome-dependent processing and generation of its transcriptionally active form.Fig. 3Consequences of deleting amino acids LPKY on Spt23p processing and its OLE1 inducing functions. A, Western blotting was performing using extracts prepared from spt23Δ cells harboring the indicated galactose-inducible Spt23p expression constructs. The antibody used for this blot recognizes the amino-terminal FLAG tag on Spt23p proteins and will detect the unprocessed p120 and processed p90 polypeptides.

Both proteins harbor the same domain organization, and they play overlapping roles in inducing OLE1 gene expression (18Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J.

Surprisingly, the organism does not appear to have a RecBCD enzyme, an enzyme that is critical for double-strand break repair in many other bacteria. The D. radiodurans genome does encode a protein whose closest characterized homologues are RecD subunits of RecBCD enzymes in other bacteria. We have purified this novel D. radiodurans RecD protein and characterized its biochemical activities. The D. radiodurans RecD protein is a DNA helicase that unwinds short (20 base pairs) DNA duplexes with either a 5′-single-stranded tail or a forked end, but not blunt-ended or 3′-tailed duplexes. Duplexes with 10–12 nucleotide (nt) 5′-tails are good unwinding substrates and are bound tightly, while DNA with shorter tails (4–8 nt) are poor unwinding substrates and are bound much less tightly. The RecD protein is much less efficient at unwinding slightly longer substrates (52 or 76 base pairs, with 12 nt 5′-tails). Unwinding of the longer substrates is stimulated somewhat (4–5-fold) by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein from D. radiodurans. These results show that the D. radiodurans RecD protein is a DNA helicase with 5′-3′ polarity and low processivity.

Double-strand DNA (dsDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DrSSB, D. radiodurans single-stranded DNA-binding protein; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazine bis-(2-ethanesulfonic acid); TLC, thin layer chromatography; nt, nucleotide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TBE, Tris borate/EDTA. breaks in bacterial cells are generally thought to be repaired by homologous recombination, in which the broken chromosome is reattached to a homologous chromosome, or to a partially replicated chromosome. This process, understood in greatest detail from studies in Escherichia coli, depends critically on the RecA and RecBCD enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 1Kuzminov A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 751-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The RecBCD helicase/nuclease binds to a double-stranded DNA end and initially degrades the DNA using its exonuclease activity. The nuclease activity is modified when the enzyme encounters a Chi sequence (5′-GCTGGTGG in E. coli) so that it produces a 3′-terminated single-stranded DNA end. RecBCD then loads RecA protein onto this 3′-terminated strand, and RecA can carry out a strand invasion of the homologous duplex to initiate the recombination reaction. The results from numerous genome sequencing projects as well as from biochemical studies show that many bacteria have an enzyme homologous to the RecBCD enzyme of E. coli. These enzymes consist of three protein subunits encoded by recB, recC, and recD genes. Some bacteria have a two-subunit helicase/nuclease enzyme (called e.g. AddAB in Bacillus subtilis) that appears to function in a largely similar reaction path, using the cognate RecA protein and organism-specific Chi-sequence (3Chedin F. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One subunit (AddA) is similar to RecB of E. coli and other bacteria, while the other subunit (AddB) is not similar to either RecC or RecD. A surprising exception is the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. This organism is remarkably resistant to ionizing radiation and other DNA-damaging agents. Its DNA can suffer many double-strand breaks upon irradiation with x-rays or γ-rays, and the organism has the remarkable ability to reassemble its genome and survive in conditions where other bacteria (e.g. E. coli) are killed very quickly (4Minton K.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Battista J.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 6Battista J.R. Earl A.M. Park M.J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 362-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The enzymatic basis for the radiation resistance is not well understood. The complete D. radiodurans genome has been sequenced, and orthologues of many familiar DNA repair proteins are readily identifiable (7White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Moffat K.S. Qin H. Jiang L. Pamphile W. Crosby M. Shen M. Vamathevan J.J. Lam P. McDonald L. Utterback T. Zalewski C. Makarova K.S.

For example, a D. radiodurans recA gene is found, and the RecA protein has been characterized biochemically (8Gutman P.D. Carroll J.D. Masters C.I. Minton K.W. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Kim J.I. Sharma A.K. Abbott S.N. Wood E.A. Dwyer D.W. Jambura A. Minton K.W. Inman R.B. Daly M.J. Cox M.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the D. radiodurans genome apparently has neither recB nor recC genes, nor are there addAB-like genes (7White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Moffat K.S. Qin H. Jiang L. Pamphile W. Crosby M. Shen M. Vamathevan J.J. Lam P.

Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Thus it is not clear how the organism is able to withstand such a high level of double-strand DNA breaks, without a RecBCD-like enzyme. The D. radiodurans genome does have a predicted open reading frame that would encode a protein whose closest characterized homologues are other bacterial RecD proteins (7White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Moffat K.S. Qin H. Jiang L. Pamphile W. Crosby M. Shen M. Vamathevan J.J. Lam P. McDonald L.

Science. 1999; 286: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The gene was thus annotated as the D. radiodurans recD gene. Based on amino acid sequence analysis, as reported in the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) data base (Refs. 10Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2772) Google Scholar and 11Tatusov R.L. Fedorova N.D. Jackson J.D. Jacobs A.R. Kiryutin B. Koonin E.V. Krylov D.M. Mazumder R. Mekhedov S.L.

BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (3444) Google Scholar; see www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/new), this putative D. radiodurans RecD protein was included in a RecD protein family (COG0507). Many other members of this family are clearly RecD subunits of a RecBCD enzyme. However, the predicted D. radiodurans RecD protein is most similar to a subgroup of this family, which includes predicted proteins in genomes of several other Gram-positive bacteria, including B. subtilis, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and several Chlamydia species (Fig. 1). Interestingly, B. subtilis, L. lactis, and several other bacteria in this subgroup have the two-subunit AddAB-like enzyme (which lacks a RecD-like subunit), while the Chlamydia genomes have two so-called recD genes (12Stephens R.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar): one encodes a likely subunit of the Chlamydial RecBCD enzyme whereas the second Chlamydial RecD-like protein groups with the D. radiodurans RecD protein. Because of these considerations, the two subgroups are listed as separate families in the TIGR Protein Families data base (Ref. 15Haft D.H. Selengut J.D. White O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar; see www.tigr.org/TIGRFAMs/). The RecD subunits are grouped in the TIGR01447 family, while the RecD-like proteins from organisms that do not have RecB and RecC, including D. radiodurans, are grouped in the TIGR01448 family. The function of the putative D. radiodurans RecD protein and its close relatives is unknown, because the only known function of RecD in other bacteria is as a subunit of a RecBCD enzyme. The greatest amino acid sequence similarity between D. radiodurans RecD and the other RecD family members is in regions that are similar to the Superfamily I helicases, of which RecD and RecB are considered members (16Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 17Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Indeed, the RecD protein from E. coli is both a DNA-dependent ATPase (18Chen H.-W. Ruan B. Yu M. Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10072-10079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and a DNA helicase that moves with 5′-3′ polarity on single-stranded DNA (19Dillingham M.S. Spies M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The helicase superfamily is defined by seven conserved helicase motifs, and these are the sequences that align most strongly among the RecD family members (Fig. 1). The D. radiodurans-type RecD proteins are larger than the RecD subunit proteins (715–865 and 493–721 amino acids residues, respectively). The additional amino acids are found in the long N-terminal region (∼360–380 residues in the D. radiodurans-like RecDs) that precedes the first helicase motif (the “Walker A” ATP-binding motif, Ref. 20Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). These N-terminal regions are less conserved among the RecD family members and do not contain sequences found in other helicases. The RecD-like proteins in D. radiodurans and other bacteria may serve a novel function in these organisms. We have cloned, expressed, and purified the novel RecD protein from D. radiodurans as a first step toward learning about its biological function and whether it plays a role in the remarkable resistance to DNA damage of this organism. The purified protein is a DNA helicase that readily unwinds short (20 bp) double-stranded DNA substrates having either a 5′-single-stranded terminal extension or a fork of single-stranded DNA at the end. The protein is much less efficient at unwinding slightly longer duplexes (52 or 76 bp), suggesting that it has low processivity. Materials—Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen and were purified from denaturing polyacrylamide gels using a MERmaid kit (BIO101 Corp.). Purified D. radiodurans SSB (DrSSB) protein (22Eggington J.M. Haruta N. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. BMC Microbiol. 2004; 4: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Professor Mike Cox, University of Wisconsin. E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein was purchased from US Biochemicals Corp. or was purified as in Ref. 21Korangy F. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3088-3095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. D. radiodurans recD Gene Cloning—D. radiodurans strain R1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. D. radiodurans genomic DNA was isolated as described (23Lennon E. Minton K.W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2955-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 2192-bp fragment that includes the recD coding region (locus DR1902, GenBank™ accession number AE002029.1) was amplified from the genomic DNA by PCR using as primers: (upstream) 5′-CGC GGA ATT CAT ATG TCT GCT GCC CTG CC and (downstream) 5′-AGT GGG ATC CCT GAC AGA ACT CTT AAG GCG TCT TAA TG. The amplified DNA product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated to the plasmid pTZ19R (24Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes, to produce pDr-recD.ptz. The complete sequence of the D. radiodurans DNA insert, determined at the DNA sequencing facility in the Center for Biosystems Research, University of Maryland, was identical to that found in GenBank™. D. radiodurans RecD Protein Expression—We first transferred the cloned recD gene to the plasmid pET-15b (Novagen Corp.) for protein expression with an N-terminal His tag. A soluble protein of about the expected size (78.6 kDa) was seen in cell extracts analyzed by SDS-PAGE when expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (data not shown). However, the N-terminal His-tagged RecD protein had low affinity for a nickel-containing resin and could not be purified under native conditions by this method. We then transferred the recD gene to pET-21a (Novagen Corp.) for expression with a C-terminal His tag. Two primers were designed to amplify a ∼1500-base pair fragment from the 3′-end of the recD gene in pDr-recD.ptz. The upstream primer (5′-GAC AAG CTC TGG CAG GCC CGC GG) included the SacII site within the recD gene and the downstream primer (5′-CTT GGA TCC TCG AGA TGC GCC CTG ATT CTT TCC) introduced new XhoI and BamHI sites after the last codon of the RecD coding region, and replaced the natural stop codon. The PCR product was digested with SacII and BamHI and the 1535 base pair fragment was ligated to pDr-recD.ptz cut with the same enzymes, to replace the native SacII-BamHI fragment. The modified recD gene was excised from this new plasmid by cleavage with NdeI and XhoI, and ligated to pET-21a cut with the same enzymes, to make pDr-recD-21. This plasmid encodes the D. radiodurans RecD protein with the peptide Leu-Glu-His-His-His-His-His-His appended to its C terminus. The complete sequence of the recD gene insert in pDr-recD-21 was verified. D. radiodurans RecD Protein Purification—The C-terminal His-tagged RecD protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pDr-recD-21. Cells were grown in 2 liters of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with vigorous shaking, until the OD600 = 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to 0.5 mm final concentration, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h and then harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets (4 g) were stored at –80 °C overnight and then thawed on ice and suspended in 50 ml of native binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (600 μl of 1 m stock) and 300 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture for polyhistidine-tagged proteins (Sigma, Inc.) were added to the cell suspension. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The crude cell extract was applied to a 10-ml Ni2+-NTA column (ProBond resin, Invitrogen Corp.) in native binding buffer. The column was washed with 30 ml of native binding buffer, 100 ml of native wash buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 500 mm NaCl) containing 60 mm imidazole, and the RecD protein was eluted in a 140-ml gradient of 60–400 mm imidazole in native wash buffer, followed by 10 ml of native wash buffer with 500 mm imidazole. The fractions containing RecD protein, based on SDS-PAGE, were collected and dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The dialyzed pool was applied to a 5-ml ssDNA cellulose column (Sigma) in Buffer A. The column was washed with ten volumes of Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl, followed by 30 ml each of Buffer A with 0.6 m NaCl, 1 m NaCl, and 1.5 m NaCl. The bulk of the RecD eluted in the 1.0 m and 1.5 m NaCl washes. The fractions containing RecD were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer A containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon), and then dialyzed against Buffer A containing 50% glycerol. The resulting protein solution (> 90% pure) was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. The purified protein retained its activity for at least 2 years under this storage condition. The RecD concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm, using ϵ280 = 52,060 m–1 cm–1, calculated for His-tagged RecD using the program ProtParam (ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). The concentrated RecD stock was diluted in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.14 mg/ml BSA, and 10% glycerol and kept on ice, for all enzymatic assays described below. ATP Hydrolysis Assays—ATP hydrolysis was measured by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine (PEI)-cellulose plates (J. T. Baker) as described (18Chen H.-W. Ruan B. Yu M. Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10072-10079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (20 μl of total volume) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm (nt residues) DNA or no DNA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol), and 0.2 nm RecD enzyme. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C and 0.5-μl aliquots were spotted on the TLC plates. The plates were developed and analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) as described (18Chen H.-W. Ruan B. Yu M. Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol.

These oligonucleotides can be annealed in pairs to form DNA duplexes with various end structures (Table I). One oligonucleotide of each double-stranded molecule was labeled at its 5′-end with [32P] as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.60Google Scholar). The labeled oligomers were purified using a QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen Corp.), and their concentrations were determined from scintillation counting of samples removed before and after the purification procedure. The two oligomers (20 μm each) were mixed in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm magnesium acetate, heated to 95 °C, and then cooled slowly to room temperature to allow them to anneal.Table IOligodeoxyribonucleotidesNameLengthHelicase substrate sequenceSubstrate structures5′-3′I32GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACATCCATCGACATI + II20 bp, 12 nt 3′-tailII20GTCGATGTGCATACTACGGCII + III20 bp, blunt endsIII20GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACIII + IV20 bp, 12 nt 5′-tailIV32TACAGCTACCTAGTCGATGTGCATACTACGGCI + IV20 bp, 12 nt forked endV28GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACTAGGTAGCV + IV28 bp, 4 nt 5′-tailVI26TACCTAGTCGATGTGCATACTACGGCVI + III20 bp, 6 nt 5′-tailVII28GCTACCTAGTCGATGTGCATACTACGGCVII + III20 bp, 8 nt 5′-tailVIII30CAGCTACCTAGTCGATGTGCATACTACGGCVIII + III20 bp, 10 nt 5′-tailIX52ACTGCGATACGTCATGGCATTCGAATCGCTGAGCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACIX + X52 bp, 12 nt 5′-tailX64TACAGCTACCTAGTCGATGTGCATACTACGGCTCAGCGATTCGAATGCCATGACGTATCGCAGTXI76ATGCCAGTGATCTCAGGCTATGACACTGCGATACGTCATGGCATTCGAATCGCTGAGCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACXI + XII76 bp, 12 nt 5′-tailXII88TACAGCTACCTAGTCGATGTGCATACTACGGCTCAGCGATTCGAATGCCATGACGTATCGCAGTGTCATAGCCTGAGATCACTGGCATHairpin oligonucleotidesT-GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGAC20 bp, 12 nt 5′-tailXIII55TT-CGGCATCATACGTGTAGCTGATCCATCGACAT-5′ATCCATCGACATT-GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGAC20 bp, 12 nt forked endXIV67TT-CGGCATCATACGTGTAGCTGATCCATCGACAT-5′T-GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGAC20 bp, 6 nt 5′-tailXV49TT-CGGCATCATACGTGTAGCTGATCCAT-5′ Open table in a new tab Most unwinding reaction mixtures contained 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 nm duplex substrate. Reactions at pH other than 7.5 were done as described in the figure legends. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, a 5-μl aliquot was taken (0 time point), and the reactions were started by adding RecD enzyme. Aliquots (5 μl) were quenched with 1.5 μl of 4× quenching buffer (40% glycerol, 2.4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 0.12% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 15 nm unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the labeled strand in the double-stranded substrate) and kept on ice. The quenched samples were run on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (29:1, acrylamide/bis-acrylamide) in 1× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 1.98 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 150 volts constant power. The gels were then dried and analyzed using the Storm PhosphorImager. The percent DNA unwound was determined by quantitating the relative amount of 32P-labeled ds and ssDNA in each lane, and then calculated as % unwound = ss/(ss + ds), where ss and ds are the integrated amounts of radioactivity in the ss and ds bands in that lane. The background of ssDNA present in the zero time point (usually <5% of the total DNA) was subtracted out. DNA unwinding rates were calculated from the slope of the initial, nearly linear, part of the reaction time course. Reannealing of the single-stranded products was found to be insignificant at the DNA concentration in the reactions (1 nm) and could be ignored when analyzing the unwinding reactions. DNA Binding Measurements—The hairpin oligonucleotides used in these experiments are listed in Table I. These molecules have 20 bp of double-stranded DNA, a three-nucleotide loop, and either a 6-nt or 12-nt 5′-single-stranded tail, or a 12-nt forked end. These constructs were used to avoid the presence of any single-stranded DNA in mixtures of separate, complementary, oligonucleotides. The hairpin oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [32P] as above. Most binding mixtures contained, in 5 μl, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 nm [5′-32P]hairpin DNA and 1.25 μl of appropriately diluted RecD. The mixtures were kept on ice for 30 min before 1.5 μl of 30% glycerol was added. The samples were then loaded quickly onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1, acrylamide/bis-acrylamide) in 1× TBE buffer. The gels were chilled in a cold room for 30 min and then pre-run at 10 mA current before use. High voltage (∼500 volts) was applied after the samples were loaded to run the gels for a short time (15∼20 min) in the cold room. The gels were dried and analyzed using the Storm PhosphorImager. ATP Hydrolysis by D. radiodurans RecD—We first tested the purified RecD protein for ATP hydrolysis activity. The protein exhibits efficient ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of a single-stranded DNA oligomer, with no detectable activity in the absence of DNA (Fig. 2). A low level of ATP hydrolysis was detected with linear dsDNA, and even less with circular dsDNA. The latter ATPase activity may result from a small amount of linear DNA in the circular plasmid preparation. DNA Unwinding Activity—We then tested for DNA unwinding activity using substrates shown in Table I. RecD unwound a 20-bp duplex with a 12-nt 5′-single-stranded extension (oligonucleotides I + II; see Table I), and the same duplex with a forked end (I + IV: 12-nt non-complementary extensions on both the 3′- and 5′-ends) (Fig. 3). There was no detectable unwinding of a 20-bp duplex with blunt ends nor of the duplex with the 3′-single-stranded tail (Fig. 3). Thus the enzyme requires a DNA duplex with a 5′-single-stranded extension for helicase activity. While the forked substrate is unwound more rapidly than the tailed substrate, the enzyme does not require the fork, in contrast to some other helicases (26Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). There was no unwinding in the absence of either ATP or magnesium ion (data not shown). The RecD protein was in excess over the DNA in the experiment shown in Fig. 3, but unwinding of the 5′-tailed and forked substrates was efficient even when the DNA was in 10–1000-fold excess over the protein (Fig. 4, A and B). The fact that a substantial fraction of the DNA was unwound under these conditions shows that the enzyme acts catalytically, with a single enzyme molecule unwinding several DNA molecules (20–100, depending on the RecD concentration and the type of DNA substrate). The initial rates of the reactions, determined from the slopes of the linear part of the time courses, were 0.10 (±0.025) DNA molecules unwound/RecD/sec, or 2 (±0.5) bp/RecD/sec, for the 5′-tailed substrate (Fig. 4A), and 0.8 (±0.1) DNA molecules unwound/RecD/sec, or 16 (±2) bp/RecD/sec, for the forked substrate (Fig. 4B). We tested next whether the enzyme can unwind duplex substrates with 5′-terminal extensions shorter than 12 nt. We detected no unwinding of a 28-bp duplex with a 4-nucleotide 5′-single-stranded tail (oligomers IV + V, Table I), with 1 nm DNA and 10 nm RecD (data not shown). Twenty-base pair duplexes with 6- or 8-nucleotide 5′-tails (III + VI or VII, respectively) were very poor substrates under conditions where the substrates with a 10- or 12-nt overhang were unwound efficiently (Fig. 5). Greater unwinding of the 8-nt tailed substrate, and slight unwinding of the 6-nt tailed substrate, could be detected at higher enzyme concentration (10 nm; data not shown). These results suggest that the enzyme requires at least 10 nt of single-stranded DNA for tight binding to the DNA substrates. DNA Binding Measurements—We measured binding of RecD to DNA molecules with various end structures directly in a gel shift assay (Fig. 6), using hairpin oligonucleotides (Table I). The hairpin with the 12-nt forked end was bound tightly and two shifted complexes were observed. We presume that these complexes are DNA molecules with RecD bound to one or both ss tails. The enzyme bound less tightly to the 5′-tailed DNA than to the fork (Fig. 6B). The hairpin with the 6-nt extension was bound weakest of all, with a large excess of protein required before a significant amount of the DNA was shifted in the gel. Weak binding to this hairpin DNA is consistent with the fact that the duplex with the 6-nt tail is a very poor unwinding substrate (Fig. 5). This hairpin (at 20 nm) also did not inhibit the unwinding reaction of RecD (0.1 nm) with the 5′-tailed 20-bp substrate (1 nm substrate; data not shown). Interestingly, two shifted bands appeared at the high protein concentrations used for the 6-nt tailed hairpin. The slower mobility complex could result from additional enzyme molecules binding to the DNA (perhaps to the loop or to the double-stranded region in the hairpin), or from dimerization/oligomerization of the protein on the DNA. We do not know whether DNA unwinding requires the combined action of more than one RecD monomer on the DNA substrate, although the fact that the 5′-tailed substrate is unwound efficiently but only a single complex is observed in the binding experiment with the tailed hairpin (Fig. 6) suggests that the RecD enzyme may unwind these molecules as a monomer. Some Superfamily I helicases unwind DNA as dimers (27Cheng W. Hsieh J. Brendza K.M. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 327-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J.

https://openalex.org/W2064490102,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is involved in the pathogenesis of KS, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. K-bZIP, the protein encoded by the open reading frame K8 of KSHV, is a member of the basic region-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. We studied the mechanisms that underlie KSHV-induced oncogenesis by investigating whether K-bZIP perturbs signaling through transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), which inhibits proliferation of a wide range of cell types. K-bZIP repressed TGF-beta-induced, Smad-mediated transcriptional activity and antagonized the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. Since both K-bZIP and Smad are known to interact with CREB-binding protein (CBP), the effect of CBP on inhibition of Smad-mediated transcriptional activation by K-bZIP was examined. K-bZIP mutants, which lacked the CBP-binding site, could not repress TGF-beta-induced or Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Overexpression of CBP restored K-bZIP-induced inhibition of Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Competitive interaction studies showed that K-bZIP inhibited the interaction of Smad3 with CBP. These results suggest that K-bZIP, through its binding to CBP, disrupts TGF-beta signaling by interfering with the recruitment of CBP into transcription initiation complexes on TGF-beta-responsive elements. We propose a possibility that K-bZIP may contribute to oncogenesis through its ability to promote cell survival by repressing TGF-beta signaling."

Here we show that Ha-ras greatly stimulates spontaneous metastatic activity of transformed cells through the Ras/RalGDS/RalA intracellular signaling pathway. Introduction of RalA alone leads to a drastic increase of metastatic activity of transformed cells. We demonstrate that metastatic ability of cells could be dramatically enhanced by RalA stimulation or, conversely, hampered by RalA suppression. Furthermore, we found that during in vivo selection cells acquire high metastatic properties as a result of endogenous RalA activation. The ability of RalA to induce metastasis was demonstrated in spontaneously transformed as well as in virus transformed fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2013909472,"P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a sialomucin expressed on leukocytes, is a major ligand for P-selectin and mediates leukocyte rolling on the endothelium. Here we show that human PSGL-1 interacts with CCL27 (CTACK/ILC/ESkine), a skin-associated chemokine that attracts skin-homing T lymphocytes. A recombinant soluble form of PSGL-1 (rPSGL-Ig) preferentially bound CCL27 among several chemokines tested. This interaction was abrogated by arylsulfatase treatment of rPSGL-Ig, suggesting that sulfated tyrosines play a critical role. In contrast, removal of either N-glycans or O-glycans by glycosidase treatment of rPSGL-Ig did not affect the interaction. The binding of CCL27 to a recombinant PSGL-1 synthesized in the presence of a sulfation inhibitor was lower than that produced in normal medium. Moreover, mutation of the tyrosines at the amino terminus of PSGL-1 to phenylalanine abolished the binding, further supporting the role of sulfated tyrosines in the CCL27-PSGL-1 interaction. Functionally, rPSGL-Ig reduced the chemotaxis of L1.2 cells expressing CCR10, the receptor for CCL27. In addition, the expression of human PSGL-1 on CCR10-expressing L1.2 cells resulted in reduced chemotaxis to CCL27. These findings suggest a role for PSGL-1 in regulating chemokine-mediated responses, in addition to its role as a selectin ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2097846969,"The gene for the proapoptotic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-homologous protein/growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (CHOP/GADD153) is induced by various cellular stresses. Previously, we described that inhibition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in MT58 cells, which contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT), results in apoptosis preceded by the induction of CHOP. Here we report that prevention of CHOP induction, by expression of antisense CHOP, delays the PC depletion-induced apoptotic process. By mutational analysis of the conserved region in the promoter of the CHOP gene, we provide evidence that the C/EBP-ATF composite site, but not the ER stress-responsive element or the activator protein-1 site, is required for the increased expression of CHOP during PC depletion. Inhibition of PC synthesis in MT58 cells also led to an increase in phosphorylation of the stress-related transcription factor ATF2 and the stress kinase JNK after 8 and 16 h, respectively. In contrast, no phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was observed in MT58 cultured at the nonpermissive temperature. Treatment of MT58 cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 could rescue the cells from apoptosis but did not inhibit the phosphorylation of ATF2 or the induction of CHOP. Taken together, our results suggest that increased expression of CHOP during PC depletion depends on a C/EBP-ATF element in its promoter and might be mediated by binding of ATF2 to this element."
https://openalex.org/W1972729228,"The expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is generally associated with a less invasive and aggressive phenotype in breast carcinoma. In an attempt to understand the role of ERα in regulating breast cancer cells invasiveness, we have demonstrated that cell adhesion on fibronectin (Fn) and type IV Collagen (Col) induces ERα-mediated transcription and reduces cell migration in MCF-7 and in MDA-MB-231 cell lines expressing ERα. Analysis of deleted mutants of ERα indicates that the transcriptional activation function (AF)-1 is required for ERα-mediated transcription as well as for the inhibition of cell migration induced by cell adhesion on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In addition, the nuclear localization signal region and some serine residues in the AF-1 of the ERα are both required for the regulation of cell invasiveness as we have observed in HeLa cells. It is worth noting that c-Src activation is coincident with adhesion of cells to ECM proteins and that the inhibition of c-Src activity by PP2 or the expression of a dominant-negative c-Src abolishes ERα-mediated transcription and partially reverts the inhibition of cell invasiveness in ERα-positive cancer cells. These findings address the integrated role of ECM proteins and ERα in influencing breast cancer cell motility through a mechanism that involves c-Src and seems not to be related to a specific cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1990104653,"The degradation of elaidic acid (9-trans-octadecenoic acid), oleic acid, and stearic acid by rat mitochondria was studied to determine whether the presence of a trans double bond in place of a cis double bond or no double bond affects β-oxidation. Rat mitochondria from liver or heart effectively degraded the coenzyme A derivatives of all three fatty acids. However, with elaidoyl-CoA as a substrate, a major metabolite accumulated in the mitochondrial matrix. This metabolite was isolated and identified as 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA. In contrast, little or none of the corresponding metabolites were detected with oleoyl-CoA or stearoyl-CoA as substrates. A kinetic study of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase revealed that 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA is a poorer substrate of LCAD than is 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, while both unsaturated acyl-CoAs are poor substrates of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase when compared with myristoyl-CoA. Tetradecenoic acid and tetradecenoylcarnitine were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry, respectively, when rat liver mitochondria were incubated with elaidoyl-CoA but not when oleoyl-CoA was the substrate. These observations support the conclusion that 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix, because it is less efficiently dehydrogenated by LCAD than is its cis isomer and that the accumulation of this β-oxidation intermediate facilitates its hydrolysis and conversion to 5-trans-tetradecenoylcarnitine thereby permitting a partially degraded fatty acid to escape from mitochondria. Analysis of this compromised but functional process provides insight into the operation of β-oxidation in intact mitochondria.

Analysis of this compromised but functional process provides insight into the operation of β-oxidation in intact mitochondria. Unsaturated fatty acids with trans double bonds, also referred to as trans fatty acids, are part of the human diet, because they are present in dairy products, meat of ruminants, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (1Craig-Schmidt M.C. Sébédio J.L. Christie W.W. Trans Fatty Acids in Human Nutrition. The Oily Press, Dundee, Scotland1998: 59-113Google Scholar). Clinical studies have prompted the idea that consumption of trans fatty acids has an adverse effect on human health because of an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (2Aro A. Sébédio J.L. Christie W.W. Trans Fatty Acids in Human Nutrition. The Oily Press, Dundee, Scotland1998: 235-260Google Scholar). We have extended our study of the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids to include unsaturated fatty acids with trans double bonds because of an interest in understanding the consequences of trans fatty acid consumption and to fully explore the molecular mechanisms of double bond metabolism during β-oxidation. Elaidic acid, 9-trans-octadecenoic acid, was chosen as a substrate because it contains only one double bond and because it is the geometric isomer of oleic acid whose degradation by β-oxidation has been studied in detail (3Ren Y. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that elaidic acid is partially converted to 5-trans-tetradecenoic acid when it serves as a substrate in the perfused rat heart (4Willebrands A.F. van der Veen K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 116: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). That observation is surprising, because mitochondrial β-oxidation is thought to go to completion without the accumulation of significant amounts of intermediates (5Liang X. Le W. Zhang D. Schulz H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 279-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unusual leakage of an intermediate during the β-oxidation of a trans fatty acid and the potential for gaining a better understanding of how β-oxidation is coordinated in intact mitochondria have prompted this investigation.

Synthesis of Substrates—2-trans-Tetradecenoic acid was synthesized by reacting malonic acid with n-dodecanal as described in principle by Linestead et al. (10Linestead R.P. Noble E.G. Boorman E.J. J. Chem. Soc. 1931; : 740-751Google Scholar). 5-cis-Tetradecenoyl-CoA, 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA, and 2-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA were synthesized from 5-cis-tetradecenoic acid, 5-trans-tetradecenoic acid, and 2-trans-tetradecenoic acid, respectively, by the mixed anhydride method as described by Fong and Schulz (11Fong J.C.

Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All products were purified by HPLC. The pH values of the acyl-CoA solutions were adjusted to ∼3–4, and the concentrations of thioester solutions were determined by the method of Ellman (13Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) after cleaving the thioester bond with hydroxylamine at pH 7 (11Fong J.C. Schulz H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Isolation of Mitochondria from Rat Liver and Respiration Measurements—Rat liver mitochondria were isolated as described by Nedergaard and Cannon (14Nedergaard M.M. Cannon B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 69: 390-398Google Scholar) from male Sprague-Dawley rats (240–260 g) kept on a standard chow and then fasted for 24 h before the isolation of mitochondria. For respiration measurements, 1.5 mg of rat liver mitochondria were incubated in 1.9 ml of incubation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm KPi, 0.1 m KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml), and 0.5 mm l-malate. l-Carnitine (1 mm) was added to the mixture, and, after preincubation for 2 min, respiration was initiated by the addition of 15 μm of the indicated fatty acyl-CoA and 1 mm ADP to achieve state 3 respiration. Rates of respiration were measured polarographically with a Clark oxygen electrode attached to a YS-oxygraph. Analysis of Acyl-CoAs Present in the Mitochondrial Matrix—When fatty acyl-CoAs were analyzed that are present in the mitochondrial matrix, the incubation mixture used for respiration measurements was scaled up to 20 ml. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 ml of methanol at the indicated time. After addition of 15 nmol of pentadecanoyl-CoA as internal standard, the suspension was centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was diluted 5-fold before it was passed slowly through a C18 Sep-Pak column. The bound CoA derivatives were eluted with 2.5 ml of methanol. The extraction process was repeated, and 1 ml of 50 mm ammonium phosphate (pH 5.5) was added to the combined methanolic extracts. After removal of methanol under N2 or reduced pressure, samples were applied to a μBondapak C18 reverse-phase column (30 cm × 3.9 mm) attached to a Waters gradient HPLC system. The absorbance of the effluent was monitored at 254 nm. Separation was achieved by linearly increasing the acetonitrile/H2O (9:1, v/v) content of the 50 mm ammonium phosphate elution buffer (pH 5.5) from 20% to 80% in 30 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Metabolites were quantified by integrating areas under the peaks by use of the Millennium software from Waters Corp. and by using the determined recovery (∼35%) of the internal standard to calculate concentrations of acyl-CoAs. To identify the major metabolite of elaidoyl-CoA, the appropriate HPLC fractions were collected and freed of acetonitrile by evaporation under reduced pressure. The resultant aqueous solution was mixed with an equal volume of 4 n KOH and kept at room temperature for 1 h to hydrolyze the thioester bond. The mixture was adjusted pH to 1 with concentrated H2SO4 and extracted three times with ether. The combined extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. After removal of ether by evaporation under a stream of N2, the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of boron trichloride in methanol (12% w/w) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (100 μl). After this mixture was heated at 60 °C for 10 min, 1 ml of H2O was added to terminate the reaction. The mixture was extracted three times with 1 ml of hexane each. The combined hexane extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under N2, and the residue was subjected to GC-MS analysis. For the spectrophotometric identification of the major metabolite of elaidoyl-CoA, the HPLC-purified compound, presumably 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA, was sequentially reacted in phosphate buffer (pH 8) with 0.1 unit of acyl-CoA oxidase, 8 milliunits of enoyl-CoA isomerase, and 4 milliunits of dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Absorbance spectra were recorded between 200 and 400 nm to follow the progress of the reactions and to document the final UV absorbances. Identification of 5-trans-Tetradecenoic Acid and 5-trans-Tetradecenoyl-l-carnitine after Incubation of Rat Liver Mitochondria with Elaidoyl-CoA—For identification of 5-trans-tetradecenoic acid, the incubation mixture used for respiration measurements with rat liver mitochondria was scaled up to 20 ml. After incubation for 5 min with elaidoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, or stearoyl-CoA and ADP, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml of 1.2 n HCl. Twenty micrograms of pentadecanoic acid were added as an internal standard. Ether of the highest purity was used to extract free fatty acids. The ether extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. The sample was dissolved in CH2Cl2 and directly analyzed by GC-MS, or was analyzed after conversion of acids to methyl esters by treatment with boron trichloride in methanol. Aliquots of 1 μl of the fatty acid methyl esters were injected at 250 °C into a GC/MS instrument (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) consisting of a gas chromatograph (model GC-17A) interphased with a mass spectrometer (QP-5000) and equipped with a capillary column (30 m, inner diameter: 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm; EC-5, Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL). The oven temperature was raised from 100 to 230 °C at 5 °C/min, to 300 °C at 20 °C/min and then held constant for 6 min. The mass spectrometer served as a detector and was operated at 280 °C. For the identification of 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-l-carnitine, the incubation mixture used to measure respiration was scaled up to 10 ml. After incubation for 5 min with ADP and 15 μm elaidoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, or stearoyl-CoA, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of 1.2 n HCl and 2.5 μl of 2 mm myristoyl-l-carnitine in CH3OH/H2O (3:1, v/v) as internal standard. After keeping the mixture for 5 min at 4 °C, the pH was adjusted to ∼5, and the incubation was continued for another 5 min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 17,500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected for acylcarnitine measurements. Acylcarnitines were analyzed as butyl esters by stable isotope dilution electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry using a modification of the method of Rashed et al. (15Rashed M.S. Bucknall M.P. Little D. Awad A. Jacob M. Alamoudi M. Alwattar M. Ozand P.T. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 1129-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Deuterium-labeled acylcarnitines (0.2 pmol of C4-C14 and 0.4 pmol of C16-C18) were added as internal standards to 15 μl of neutralized extract and centrifuged. The supernatant was dried under a stream of nitrogen then butylated by reacting it with 0.1 ml of 3 n HCl in butanol at 55 °C for 15 min. The sample was dried under a stream of nitrogen and dissolved in 0.15 ml of acetonitrile/water (4:1, v/v). 20 μl was used for flow injection analysis by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Data were acquired by precursor ion scanning of the common product ion at m/z 85 for labeled and unlabeled acylcarnitines. The concentrations of acylcarnitines were calculated from the peak intensities of unlabeled acylcarnitines relative to labeled internal standards. Expression and Purification of Rat Long Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase—A cDNA insert corresponding to the mature form of rat LCAD and its expression vector were prepared by PCR as described (16Vockley R.R.J.

Escherichia coli strain XL1-Bla transformed with this plasmid was grown in LB media at 30 °C in the presence of ampicillin to an absorbance of about 1.0 at 600 nm and then induced in the presence of 0.6 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 6 h. Cell were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 8000 × g, and pellets were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 10% glycerol, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 1 mm FAD (buffer A). The suspension was sonicated 10 times for 20 s each at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 40 cm) that had been equilibrated overnight with buffer A. After washing the column with buffer A, the column was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 300 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions were assayed for long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated in an Amicon concentrator with a YM-10 membrane, and dialyzed against 50 mm KPi (pH 7.6) containing 10% glycerol, 0.3 mm EDTA, and 1 μm FAD (buffer B). The sample was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 × 25 cm), equilibrated with buffer B, and eluted with a linear gradient from 50 to 400 mm KPi (pH 7.6) in buffer B. Active fractions were identified, collected, and concentrated. After overnight dialysis against 10 mm KPi (pH 8.0), 0.3 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol (buffer C), the sample was applied to a Blue Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer C. The column was developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.6 m KCl in buffer C. Active fractions were combined, concentrated, and dialyzed against 10 mm KPi (pH 7.5), 0.3 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol (buffer D). The sample was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (0.5 × 5 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer D. The column was developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m KPi in buffer D. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to 0.6 ml, diluted with glycerol to ∼1 ml, and stored at –80 °C. Partial Purification of Mitochondrial Thioesterase and CPT II from Rat Liver—For the partial purification of thioesterase, rat liver mitochondria were purified by gradient density centrifugation in a self-generated gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep). Equal volumes of iodixanol (50%, w/v) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Mops-NaOH (pH 7.4) and a suspension of heavy mitochondria were mixed (final iodixanol concentration = 25%; ρ = 1.150 g/ml) and then transferred to 10-ml tubes and centrifuged at 180,000 gav for 3 h in a T865-1 fixed angle rotor at 4 °C using the slow acceleration and braking modes. Fractions were collected from the bottom after slowly inserting a thin glass tube through the bottom of the tube. Catalase and malate dehydrogenase were assayed as marker enzymes for mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. Fractions containing most mitochondria were combined and diluted 2-fold with MST isolation buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm EDTA) before they were harvested by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 20 min. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended, dialyzed against MST isolation buffer for at least 4–6 h, and then sonicated 6 times for 20 s each at intervals of 30 s to keep the temperature of the suspension at 4 °C. The suspension of sonicated mitochondria was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the resultant supernatant was brought to 70% saturation with ammonium sulfate. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, dissolved in 3 ml of 20 mm KPi (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 30 mm NaCl, and applied to a Sephacryl S-200HR column (2.5 × 40 cm). After elution with the same buffer, active fractions were identified, pooled, concentrated to 0.6 ml, and stored at –80 °C. For the purification of CPT II, mitochondria (1.3 mg/ml) in 20 mm KPi (pH 7.4) containing 1 m KCl (buffer A) were treated with 0.2% CHAPS for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant suspension was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied to an Octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (1 × 4 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.2% CHAPS. CPT II was eluted with buffer A containing 1% CHAPS, and active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at –80 °C. Enzyme and Protein Assays—Thioesterase and CPT II activities were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the release of coenzyme A from acyl-CoAs with Ellman's reagent (13Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) at 412 nm. A typical thioesterase assay mixture contained 0.175 m KPi (pH 8), 0.2 mm 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), and 20 μm acyl-CoA. The CPT II assay mixture contained 115 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.11 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 1.1 mm l-carnitine, and 35 μm acyl-CoA. An extinction coefficient of 13,600 m–1cm–1 was used to calculate rates. The need to correct rates was most pronounced when partially purified enzyme was used, which generally contained proteins that have sulfhydryl groups. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was assayed spectrophotometrically at 600 nm with phenazine methosulfate as the primary electron acceptor and dichlorophenolindophenol as the final electron acceptor (17Davidson B. Schulz H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) were determined for LCAD and VLCAD with tetradecanoyl-CoA, 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, and 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA as substrates by the fluorometric assay method with 1 mm electron transferring flavoprotein as electron acceptor as detailed by Mohsen and Vockley (18Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting using the Sigma plot program. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate to product per minute. Protein concentrations were determined by the dye-binding assay as described by Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Respiration Rates of Rat Mitochondria with cis and trans Monounsaturated Fatty Acyl-CoAs as Substrates—The perfused rat heart has been reported to produce 5-trans-tetradecenoic acid from elaidic acid, which appears to be a sufficient energy source for sustaining the heartbeat (4Willebrands A.F. van der Veen K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 116: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In an effort to compare the effectiveness of elaidic acid with oleic acid and stearic acid as substrates of mitochondrial β-oxidation, we measured respiration rates of coupled rat liver and heart mitochondria with several fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates. As shown in Fig. 1, stearoyl-CoA and elaidoyl-CoA supported equal rates of respiration in rat liver mitochondria, whereas oleoyl-CoA sustained a rate that was ∼50% higher than the rates observed with the other two substrates. Rates obtained with myristoyl-CoA, 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA, and 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA were higher than the rates supported by any of the three longer chain acyl-CoAs. In agreement with a previous report (20Lawson L.D. Kummerow F.A. Lipids. 1979; 14: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), elaidoyl-CoA was degraded in rat heart mitochondria at a rate that was 50 and 33% lower than rates observed with oleoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA, respectively (results not shown). These data indicate that elaidic acid is an adequate substrate of β-oxidation in both rat liver and heart mitochondria. Detection and Identification of 5-trans-Tetradecenoyl-CoA in Rat Mitochondria Incubated with Elaidoyl-CoA—In an effort to detect possible differences between the β-oxidation of elaidoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA, coupled rat liver mitochondria were incubated with either elaidoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, or stearoyl-CoA at state three respiration and fatty acyl-CoAs were analyzed by HPLC. Because no CoA was added to the incubation mixture, fatty acyl-CoAs other than the substrate were overwhelmingly, if not completely, present in the mitochondrial matrix. Shown in Fig. 2 are HPLC chromatograms of fatty acyl-CoAs that were isolated from rat liver mitochondria after incubation with stearoyl-CoA (Fig. 2A), oleoyl-CoA (Fig. 2B), or elaidoyl-CoA (Fig. 2C) for 5 min. One major peak in each chromatogram corresponds to the fatty acyl-CoA that served as substrate. A second peak marked “IS” is due to pentadecanoyl-CoA that was added as an internal standard after the incubation was completed to facilitate the quantification of metabolites. However, in Fig. 2C, a third prominent peak is visible, which, based on its elution time, was tentatively identified as 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA (tΔ5C14). After further purification by HPLC, this material was hydrolyzed and converted to its methyl ester. Analysis of the methyl ester by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry proved this material to be a homogeneous compound with a molecular ion at m/z of 258 as expected of methyl tetradecenoate upon chemical ionization in the presence of ammonia (data not shown). The material presumed to be 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA had a UV spectrum with an absorbance maximum around 260 nm that is typical of an acyl-CoA (see spectrum 1 in Fig. 3). Upon treatment with acyl-CoA oxidase, spectrum 1 changed to spectrum 2. The observed increase in the absorbance around 260 nm agrees with the expected conversion of 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA to 2,5-trans-tetradecadienoyl-CoA. Treatment of the latter compound with enoyl-CoA isomerase yielded spectrum 3 that is characteristic of 3,5-dienoyl-CoAs. Finally, when the compound, presumed to be 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA, was incubated with dienoyl-CoA isomerase, spectrum 3 changed to spectrum 4 with absorbance maxima at 260 and 300 nm, which is characteristic of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA. Taken together, the data demonstrate that 5-tetradecenoyl-CoA accumulated in the matrix of mitochondria that oxidized elaidoyl-CoA. Because the intermediate most likely retained the original trans double bond, it was assumed to be 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA. The amount of this metabolite after 1 to 2 min of incubation was 0.88 ± 0.22 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein. When oleoyl-CoA served as a substrate, a metabolite with chromatographic behavior identical to that of authentic 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA was observed (see Fig. 2B). However, the putative cis metabolite was present at a level 10-times lower than the trans compound (Fig. 2, compare B and C), and therefore no attempt was made to further identify it. Altogether, it is very likely that the metabolite of oleoyl-CoA was 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA. Tetradecanoyl-CoA (myristoyl-CoA), the corresponding metabolite of stearoyl-CoA, was not detected and therefore did not accumulate at a level that was higher than the background noise.Fig. 3Structure proof of 5-tetradecenoyl-CoA by analyzing its enzymatic conversions spectrophotometrically. 5-Tetradecenoyl-CoA (spectrum 1) was dehydrogenated by acyl-CoA oxidase to 2,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (spectrum 2), which was isomerized by enoyl-CoA isomerase to 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (spectrum 3), which was converted to 2,4-tetradecadienoyl-CoA (spectrum 4) by dienoyl-CoA isomerase.

We hypothesized that 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA may be a relatively poor substrate of LCAD and/or VLCAD, both of which dehydrogenate long-chain acyl-CoAs. This prediction is supported by the data shown in Table I. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of LCAD was 4-times lower with 5-trans-tetradecenoyl-CoA as substrate than with 5-cis-tetradecenoyl-CoA or tetradecanoyl-CoA (myristoyl-CoA). This lower catalytic efficiency is due to a 4-fold higher Km for 5-trans-tertatedecenoyl-CoA as compared with the Km values for the other two substrates. In contrast VLCAD acted equally well on the cis and trans isomers of 5-tetradecenoyl-CoA, which, however, were poorer substrates of this enzyme than was tetradecanoyl-CoA. The latter observation agrees with a previous report showing that saturated acyl-CoAs are better substrates of VLCAD than the corresponding unsaturated substrates with 4,5- or 5,6-double bonds (21Le W.

However, the precise role of the HFE protein is still undefined. Here, to obtain new insight, we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of HFE gene and defined the functional organization of the HFE promoter. Both in vitro transcription and reporter gene assay in transient transfection evidenced a high liver expression of the HFE mRNA. The 5' end analysis of mRNA showed two major initiation sites localized at -265 and -195 directed by TATA-like sequences and a window of initiation within the -120 to -10 GC-rich region upstream of the first coding nucleotide. Positive cis-regulating elements were characterized within the -1057/-8 region, and a negative one extending upstream (-1485/-1057) was identified. DNase I footprinting analysis and gel shift assay revealed several protein binding sites, and subsequent functional analysis evidenced transactivation of HFE by liver-enriched C/EBPalpha, erythropoietic-specific GATA-1, and ubiquitous Sp1 transcription factors. These data bring some evidence of a role of HFE in the liver and a coregulation with erythropoiesis as other genes involved in iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2134640360,"In the present study, we aimed to clarify the capacity of human cord blood- and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells to generate gastrointestinal epithelial cells in clinical and experimental transplantation settings. First, in a clinical transplantation setting, gastrointestinal tissues derived from female pediatric or juvenile recipients of allogeneic sex-mismatched bone marrow and cord blood transplantation were examined for the presence of donor-derived epithelial cells. Gastrointestinal specimens of allogeneic recipients included Y chromosome+ cytokeratin+ epithelial cells at a frequency of 0.4-1.9%. To further determine the capacity of purified human progenitor cells, human cord blood- or bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells were transplanted into newborn NOD/SCID/beta2-microglobulin(null) mice as an experimental transplantation assay. When gastrointestinal tissues derived from recipient mice were subjected to FISH and immunofluorescence analyses, human epithelial cells were identified at a frequency of 0.24-0.58% at 3 months posttransplantation. Finally, double FISH analyses using species-specific probes revealed that human chromosome+ epithelial cells did not possess any murine chromosomes, indicating that donor-derived epithelial cells were not generated only by cell fusion. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that purified human cord blood and bone marrow CD34+ progenitor cells can generate gastrointestinal epithelial cells across allogeneic and xenogeneic histocompatibility barriers."

However, except for proteinases, only few of its target genes have been reported. In the present report, we identified bax as a Pea3 up-regulated gene. We provide evidence of this regulation by using Pea3 overexpression and Pea3 silencing in a mammary cell line. Both Pea3 and Erm, another member of the PEA3 group, are able to transactivate bax promoter fragments. Although the minimal Pea3-regulated bax promoter does not contain an Ets-binding site, two functional upstream stimulatory factor-regulated E boxes are present. We further demonstrate the ability of Pea3 and USF-1 to cooperate for the transactivation of the bax promoter, mutation of the E boxes dramatically reducing the Pea3 transactivation potential. Although Pea3 did not directly bind to the minimal bax promoter, we provide evidence that USF-1 could form a ternary complex with Pea3 and DNA. Taken together, our results suggest that Pea3 may regulate bax transcription via the interaction with USF-1 but without binding to DNA.

Pea3 ectopic overexpression in nonmetastatic human breast cancer cells increased their invasiveness and their metastatic potential in nude mice (25Kaya M. Yoshida K. Higashino F. Mitaka T. Ishii S. Fujinaga K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 221-227PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data confirmed the role of Pea3 in breast cancer tumorigenesis and suggest that Pea3 is a marker of tumor aggressiveness rather than a prognostic factor (26Bieche I. Tozlu S. Girault I.

Here we report the regulation of the murine bax gene by the PEA3 group members in normal mammary cells. In these cells, overexpression of Erm and Pea3 results in elevated bax mRNA and protein levels, which can be down-regulated by Pea3 silencing. We found that Pea3 regulates the minimal bax promoter, not by binding to a consensual Ets-binding site but via the interaction with USF-1, which binds to the functional E boxes of the promoter. DNA Array Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from control or PEA3 group members overexpressing TAC-2.1 cells, described previously in Chotteau-Lelievre et al. (15Chotteau-Lelievre A. Montesano R. Soriano J. Soulie P. Desbiens X. de Launoit Y. Dev. Biol. 2003; 259: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 5 μg of RNA was used to convert total RNA into 32P-labeled first strand cDNA using [32P]ATP and the gene-specific CDS primer mix for the Atlas array (Clontech) following the manufacturer's recommendation. The labeled cDNA was purified using a Nucleospin Column (Clontech). A set of Mouse Atlas Array (Clontech) was used for hybridization with the labeled probes using Express Hyb solution at 68 °C for 16 h. The arrays were exposed to a PhosphorImager and analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).

Plasmids and Antibodies—The coding sequences for erm, er81, and pea3 were amplified with oligonucleotides containing NotI sites by a high fidelity DNA polymerase (Pfu DNA Polymerase, Promega). The NotI-digested PCR-derived fragments were then cloned in the NotI-linearized pTRACER plasmid vector (Invitrogen), and recombinant pTRACER constructs were sequenced. These vectors were referred to as pTRACER-erm, pTRACER-er81, and pTRACER-pea3, respectively. The full-length promoter construct of the murine bax gene as well as its deletion and Sp1 site mutants and the empty luciferase reporter vector were obtained from Prof. T. Sakai (44Igata E. Inoue T.

The oligonucleotide sequence of pea3 used for the small RNA interference was 5′-GCAGGAAGGGATTGGAGCT-3′ and was cloned in the pSUPER expression vector (OligoEngine) by following the procedure described by Brummelkamp et al. (48Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). This vector was referred to as pSUPER-pea3. A control vector, pSUPER-gfp, was constructed using a 19-nucleotide sequence of the gfp-coding sequence (5′-GCTGACCCTGAAGTTCATC-3′) and was served as a nonsilencing control. The anti-Pea3 (sc113), anti-Bax (sc7480), anti-Pim-1 (sc13513), and anti-USF-1 (sc229) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Cell Transfections and Reporter Assays—TAC-2.1 cells were seeded at 70% confluence in 12-well plates and transfected with polyethyleneimine (10 μm, Euromedex). Each well was transfected for 6 h by using a mixture of 500 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), 500 ng of DNA (including 150 ng of expression vector(s), 50 ng of luciferase reporter vector, 25 ng of the pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega), and if necessary, salmon sperm DNA), and 2 μl of polyethyleneimine. Cells lysates were prepared 24 h later for the luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase (Galactolight, Tropix Inc.) activities following the manufacturer's instructions and using a Lumat 9507 Luminometer (Berthold). The measured luciferase activity was corrected by using co-transfected pSV-β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations of the E box-binding sites were performed on PMBaxSp1dl using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). 10 ng of PMBaxSp1dl was combined with complementary mutant oligonucleotide primers (0.3 μm), 1 μm dNTP and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows (sense strand): E box m1, 5′-TTGCGGGGCACCCAATTGAGGGCCGCACGT-3′; E box m2, 5′-GTCCACGATCAGTCAATTGACCGTGGTGCGCC-3′; and E box m1/2, 5′-TTGCGGGGCACCCAATTGAGGGCCGCACGTCCACGATCAGTCAATTGACCGTGGTGCGCC-3′ (the underlined letters represent the bases that were mutated in the E box-binding sequence). The reaction mixture was temperature-cycled in a MasterCycler (Eppendorf) to amplify the mutant constructs. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 10 min for 12 cycles. Mutation 3 on PMBaxSacII was performed on PMBaxSacII first mutated on the first and second E boxes by using the following oligonucleotide primer 5′-GAGCGATGATGATCAATTGACTAGTCCTGCGGGC-3′. Nuclear Protein Extracts—Cells were harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in an hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Pelleted cells were resuspended in an hypertonic buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 3 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and placed on ice for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The annealed double strand oligonucleotide derived from the bax minimal promoter (bax wt) was 5′ end-labeled by [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). Binding of the protein to DNA sequences was achieved in a 20-μl mixture containing 2× buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 20% glycerol (v/v)), 1.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12 μg of nuclear cell extract, and 60,000 cpm of the labeled probe. For competition assays, unlabeled oligonucleotide was added at 400-fold molar excess. Supershift assays were performed by adding anti-Pea3, anti-Pim-1, or anti-USF-1 antibody to the mixture. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, samples were loaded onto a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA running buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) overnight at –80 °C. The following oligonucleotides were used as probes or competitors (sense strand): bax wt, 5′-CACCCACGTGAGGGCCGCACGTCCACGATCAGTCACGTGACCGT-3′; nonspecific, 5′-GGGCGCACCCGGCGAGAGGCAGCGGCAGTG-3′; and bax mt, 5′-TTGCGGGGCACCCAATTGAGGGCCGCACGTCCACGATCAGTCAATTGACCGTGGTGCGCC-3′. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in a 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin buffer. After scraping, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of whole cell extracts were separated in denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (N+ Hybond, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, and 3% bovine serum albumin, the membrane was probed with the primary and the secondary antibodies. The enzymatic activity was detected using a chemiluminescent-enhanced kit (Pierce). Equal transfer of proteins from the gel was controlled by Ponceau (Sigma) staining of the membrane and by using an anti-Actin antibody. Bax Expression Is Up-regulated in Mammary Cells That Overexpress PEA3 Subfamily Members—In order to identify new PEA3 subfamily target genes, we have compared the PEA3 subfamily overexpressing cells (15Chotteau-Lelievre A. Montesano R. Soriano J. Soulie P. Desbiens X. de Launoit Y. Dev. Biol. 2003; 259: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and mock-transfected cells by different technical approaches, including a DNA macro-array analysis (Atlas™ Mouse cDNA Expression Arrays, Clontech). The fold increase used as cut-off was 2-fold. Fifteen genes/588 genes on the membrane were fished out, and among them, bax was up-regulated (data not shown). This preliminary result was then confirmed by Northern blot (data not shown) and semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1a). For this purpose, we used stably Erm- and Pea3-overexpressing mammary cells (described previously in Ref. 15Chotteau-Lelievre A. Montesano R. Soriano J. Soulie P. Desbiens X. de Launoit Y. Dev. Biol. 2003; 259: 241-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the same mammary cells transiently transfected with expression vectors for Erm and Pea3 versus the corresponding empty vector. As shown in Fig. 1a, bax mRNA expression level is increased in the cells that transiently overexpress Erm and Pea3 (left panel). By quantification and normalization using the control cyclophilin expression, we showed that bax expression is increased by at least 2-fold. The stably overexpressing cells present a similar increase (Fig. 1a, right panel). Bax protein products were evaluated by Western blot analysis on protein extracts from the modified cells described previously. Fig. 1b depicts the elevated level of the 21-kDa Bax protein in the transiently Erm- and Pea3-overexpressing mammary cells, when compared with the control cells (left panel). The same modulation was observed in the stably overexpressing cells (Fig. 1b, right panel). Regulation by Pea3 of the endogenous bax expression was confirmed by using RNA interference. TAC-2.1 cells were transfected with the pSUPER-pea3 expression vector, which allows the expression of pea3-RNAi oligonucleotides. More than 70% of the cells are transfected by the vectors in these experiments (data not shown). The levels of pea3 mRNA (Fig. 2a) and Pea3 protein product (Fig. 2c) were shown to be reduced in the pea3-RNAi-expressing cells when compared with the control cells. Most interestingly, the levels of the bax messenger (Fig. 2b) and protein (Fig. 2d) were reduced in TAC-2.1 cells in which Pea3 expression was down-regulated, when compared with the control cells. These results indicate that the murine bax gene is a target of the PEA3 group transcription factors.Fig. 1Bax expression in Pea3- or Erm-overexpressing mammary cells.a, semi-quantitative RT-PCR.

Previous reports have demonstrated that a 16-kDa subunit (16K) of vacuolar H+-ATPase via one of its transmembrane domains, TMD4, strongly associates with β1 integrin, affecting β1 integrin N-linked glycosylation and inhibiting its function as a matrix adhesion receptor. Because of this dramatic inhibition of β1 integrin-mediated HEK-293 cell motility by 16K expression, we investigated the mechanism by which 16 kDa was having this effect. Using HT1080 cells whose α5β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin has been extensively studied, the expression of 16 kDa also resulted in reduced cell spreading on fibronectin-coated substrates. A pulse-chase study of β1 integrin biosynthesis indicated that 16K expression down-regulated the level of the 110-kDa biosynthetic form of β1 integrin (premature form) and, consequently, the level of the 130-kDa form of β1 integrin (mature form). Further experiments showed that the normal levels of association between the premature β1 integrin form and calnexin were significantly decreased by the expression of either 16 kDa or TMD4. Expression of 16 kDa also resulted in a Triton X-100-insoluble aggregation of an unusual 87-kDa form of β1 integrin. Interestingly, both Western blotting and a pulse-chase experiment showed co-immunoprecipitation of calnexin and 16K. These results indicate that 16K expression inhibits β1 integrin surface expression and spreading on matrix by a novel mechanism that results in reduced levels of functional β1 integrin.

V-ATPase is ubiquitously expressed in the various intracellular compartments and is responsible for their acidification (1Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Forgac M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 16-kDa subunit (16K) of the V0 domain is a highly hydrophobic protein, consisting of four transmembrane segments, and it forms a homohexamer that functions as the transmembrane proton channel. The 16K can associate with other proteins through interactions with its fourth transmembrane segment, TMD4. For example, the papillomavirus E5 oncogene product associates with the TMD4 of 16K, decoupling 16 kDa from the ATPase V1 and resulting in an elevated pH in the Golgi and facilitation of the oncogenic transformation process. In addition, the complex between bovine papillomavirus E5 and the 16K can associate with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, leading to a ligand-independent activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling (3Goldstein D.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1467-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The TMD4 of 16 kDa has also been shown to mediate an association between 16K and β1 integrin (10Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23119-23127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that the 16K expression in HEK-293 cells caused altered N-linked glycosylation of β1 integrin, resulting in a significant inhibition of cell migration toward laminin and fibronectin (10Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23119-23127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48451-48457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Since altered expression of N-linked glycans on the α5β1 integrin has been shown to significantly affect the binding of cell surface α5β1 to fibronectin, it was reasonable to hypothesize that the expression of 16 kDa had specific effects on the glycosylation of β1 integrin, thereby inhibiting its adhesive functions that regulate migration on extracellular matrix. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of how the 16K expression levels affect the expression and/or the maturation and glycosylation of β1 integrin during the biosynthesis of the α5β1 dimer to ultimately inhibit β1 integrin-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin. The results showed that expression of the 16 kDa in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells down-regulates surface expression of α5β1 integrin dimers, thereby causing reduced cell spreading on fibronectin-coated surfaces. The loss of cell surface α5β1 expression was subsequently shown to result from a Triton X-100-insoluble aggregation of β1 integrin subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum. Initial results suggested that the 16K expression suppressed the maturation of β1 integrin from its premature form that expressed only high-mannose and not complex glycans. Pulse-chase experiments then showed that premature (110 kDa) β1 integrin levels in 16K-transfected cells were greatly decreased and that this decrease occurred during the first 15 min of β1 integrin biosynthesis. Further experiments using antibodies against calnexin, calreticulin, and BiP showed that calnexin, but not calreticulin or BiP, associated with the premature β1 integrin. When 16K was expressed, the normal association between the premature β1 integrin and calnexin was almost completely abolished. The expression of the TMD4 alone caused the same level of inhibition on β1 integrin association with calnexin. Surprisingly, both 16K and TMD4 were themselves co-immunoprecipitated with calnexin. An examination of the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of cells transfected with 16K revealed a new form of β1 with a molecular mass of ∼87 kDa. The unusually rapid kinetics of the decrease of the premature (110 kDa) β1 integrin and the appearance of a Triton X-100-insoluble 87-kDa form of β1 suggest that the decrease of the 110-kDa form was not due primarily to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) but to an induction of the Triton X-100-insoluble form of β1. These results suggested a unique mechanism for the regulation of the cell surface expression of β1 integrin by expression of the V-ATPase 16-kDa subunit. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Materials—HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Unless otherwise described, all of the transfections were done transiently using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) in 100-mm dishes. Cells were harvested typically between 24 and 48 h after transfection and used for further experiments. Rat monoclonal antibodies against human α5 and β1 integrins, mAb16 and mAb13, respectively, were gifts from Dr. Steven Akiyama (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). The anti-T7 and HSV-tagged antibodies were purchased from Novagen. Antibodies against calnexin, calreticulin, and BiP were purchased from Stressgen. Agarose-conjugated l-phytohemagglutinin, ConA, Sambucus nigra agglutinin, and Datura stramonium agglutinin lectins were obtained from Vector Laboratories, whereas MG132, an inhibitor of proteasome activity, was from Biomol. PNGase F was obtained from Sigma, and streptavidin-HRP was from Rockland. NHS-LC-Biotin was purchased from Pierce. Anti-ERK2 antibody, anti-actin antibody, Protein G Plus-agarose, and all of the secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 594 and phalloidin-FITC were all purchased from Molecular Probes. Mammalian expression plasmids, pXJ40-KKO-16K (HSV-tagged 16K), pXJ40-KKO-TMD4 (HSV-tagged TMD4; formerly named α4), and pXJ41-β1-T7 (T7-tagged bovine β1 integrin), were obtained as described previously (11Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48451-48457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer consisting of 2% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and 0.1% SDS. Typically, 100 μg of total protein was used for immunoprecipitation and lectin precipitation. Proteins were resolved with SDS-PAGE utilizing 8% gels under non-reducing conditions unless otherwise indicated, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin, and probed with antibodies. Following incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies or streptavidin-HRP, proteins were detected by the ECL reagent (Pierce). Densitometry of the blots was performed using a Bio-Rad Fluor S imager. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—Cell surfaces were labeled with NHS-LC-biotin as described previously (12Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS in culture dishes. 1 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin in PBS (1 ml) was added to the cells and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. Cells were then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were done as described above with the exception that streptavidin-HRP was directly added with no primary antibody. Radiolabeling and Autoradiography—Cells were preincubated with Met/Cys-free DMEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min followed by labeling with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine in 3 ml of DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine but containing 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 15 min. After removing the radioactive medium, regular growth medium was added and the cells were incubated for various times. Labeled cells were then lysed in lysis buffer, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either mAb13 or anti-T7 antibody at 4 °C overnight. For an experiment with MG132, 50 μm final concentration of MG132 in Me2SO was added to the cells during both pulse and chase periods. Real-time PCR Analysis—Cells were transfected with pXJ41-β1-T7 alone (5 μg) or with pXJ41-β1-T7 plus pXJ40-KKO-16K (5 μg of each) and cultured for 24 h. The RNeasy kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate total RNA. Reverse transcription was done using Superscript III (Stratagene) and random primers using the manufacturer's protocol. Bio-Rad iCycler and iCycler software were used for real-time PCR reactions and data analysis. Primers were designed using Primer3 software. Sequences of primers used in the experiment were as follows: human α5 integrin (forward, 5′-CACTGGCCATGATGAGTTTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGATGGCCACATCATTGTAG-3′); human β1 integrin (forward, 5′-ATCCCAGAGGCTCCAAAGAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCCCTGATCTTAATCGCAAA-3′); human 16K (forward, 5′-AGTCCATCATCCCAGTGGTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGCTGGAGGAAGCTCT TGT-3′); and human GAPDH (forward, 5′-CAATGACCCCTTCATTGACC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AATCCCATCAC CATCTTCCA-3′). Real-time PCR was performed using the iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The PCR conditions were 1 cycle at 95 °C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 30 s, 95 °C for 1 min, and 55 °C for 1 min, terminating with 80 cycles at 55 °C for 10 s for melting curve analysis. Standard curves for human α5 and β1 integrin primer characterization were generated by a serial dilution of cDNA obtained from the reverse transcriptase reaction, whereas pXJ40-KKO and pT3-GAPDH were used for standard curve generation for 16K and GAPDH, respectively. Fluorescent Staining—Chamberslides (Falcon) were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Transiently transfected cells were harvested by trypsinization and incubated in suspension in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. Approximately 104 cells were added to each well and allowed to spread on fibronectincoated surfaces for 30 min. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated with anti-HSV tag antibody (1:10000) and mAb13 (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS, the primary antibodies were detected by incubation with either rhodamine-anti-mouse IgG conjugate or rhodamine-anti-rat IgG (1:250) at 37 °C for 30 min. For actin staining, phalloidin-FITC (1:250) was used. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted and images were obtained using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica). Expression of the V-ATPase 16K in HEK-293 cells inhibited significantly β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin and laminin (11Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48451-48457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of 16K appeared to have an inhibitory effect on the complex N-linked glycosylation of β1 integrin, suggesting that the inhibition of matrix adhesion may have resulted from altered glycosylation of β1 integrin. To test this hypothesis in detail, we used HT1080 cells to examine the effects of 16K expression on β1 integrin-fibronectin interactions as well as the biosynthesis of β1. The predominant β1 integrin expressed in HT1080 cells is α5β1 integrin (12Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar), and these cells have been used to investigate the effects of altered N-linked glycosylation on α5β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin (12Guo H.B. Lee I. Kamar M. Akiyama S.K. Pierce M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6837-6845PubMed Google Scholar, 13Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18011-18018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 16K Expression Delays Cell Spreading and Reduces Cell Surface Expression of α5β1 Integrin—First, we confirmed that 16K expression affected α5β1 integrin-mediated HT1080 cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin. HT1080 cells were transiently transfected with 16K tagged with the HSV epitope, harvested, preincubated in suspension in serum-free DMEM for 1 h, added to fibronectin-coated chamber slides, and allowed to spread for 30 min. Phalloidin-FITC was used to visualize the actin cytoskeleton of the cells, and anti-HSV was used to detect 16K expression. The results (Fig. 1) showed that cells transfected with vector alone (Mock) showed extensive spreading on the fibronectin substrate. By contrast, cells transfected with 16K-HSV were attached to the substrate but were rounded in appearance due to the inhibition of spreading. Experiments were then performed to examine the effects of 16K expression on β1 integrin cell surface expression using cell surface biotinylation. The results showed a gradual decrease of α5β1 integrin expression on the cell surface as the amount of 16K plasmid used for transfection was increased. Cell surface expression of both the epidermal growth factor receptor and N-cadherin showed no significant decrease after transfection with 16K plasmid (15 μg), demonstrating a specific inhibitory effect on α5β1 integrin (Fig. 2).Fig. 216K expression down-regulates surface expression of α5β1 integrin in HT1080. Decreased surface expression of α5 β1 integrin by 16K expression is shown. Cells were transiently transfected with increasing amount of 16K expression plasmid. After 24 h, cell surface proteins were labeled using NHS-LC-biotin and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 2% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-human β1 integrin, mAb13, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The lower panel shows little effect on the levels of surface expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor on cells transfected with vector alone or 15 μg 16K-HSV. Levels of cell surface N-cadherin were slightly increased when 16K was overexpressed.

Typically, β1 integrin is first expressed as the so-called “premature form” (110 kDa), which dimerizes with α subunits and is transported to the Golgi complex where it then matures into the 130-kDa form that expresses complex N-linked glycans (7Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sheppard D. Cohen D.S. Wang A. Busk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17409-17414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Koistinen P. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24835-24841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The premature and mature forms can also be distinguished on Western blots by the binding of specific lectins. ConA, which binds high-mannose, hybrid, and diantennary glycans, binds both the premature and mature forms of β1, whereas l-phytohemagglutinin and S. nigra agglutinin, which recognize β(1, 6)-branched and α(2, 6)-sialylated glycans, respectively, bind only to the mature β1 form. When T7-tagged bovine β1 integrin (β1-T7) was expressed in HT1080 cells, both the mature and premature forms of the T7-tagged integrin were detected by Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 3A). The relatively higher levels of the premature form were probably due to limiting levels of integrin α subunits to allow dimerization with β1, which is a requirement for Golgi processing and complex N-linked glycosylation. Fig. 3A also showed that only the mature (130 kDa) form of β1 was precipitated with a mAb16 against human α5 integrin and the lectin-recognizing complex N-linked glycan modifications, l-phytohemagglutinin and S. nigra agglutinin, but the premature (110 kDa) form was precipitated only by ConA. Premature Forms of β1 Integrin Were Down-regulated by 16K Expression—When HSV-tagged 16K (16K-HSV) was co-transfected with β1-T7, the expression of the mature β1 form was preferentially decreased. Immunoprecipitation of the lysate of cells transfected with β1 integrin or β1 integrin plus 16K with the antibody specific for the α5 subunit (mAb16) revealed that the mature β1 integrin co-immunoprecipitated with α5 integrin was significantly decreased after 16K expression (Fig. 3B). To determine whether increased 16K expression suppressed the expression of the premature form as well, the amount of 16K plasmid used for transfections was increased successively while keeping the amount of β1-T7 plasmid constant. The results showed that the levels of the premature β1 form were greatly decreased after 16K expression. The levels of α5 integrin and β-actin, however, showed no significant decrease as the expression of 16K increased, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect on β1 expression was specific (Fig. 3C). When cell lysates from cells co-transfected with β1 integrin and 16K-HSV were immunoprecipitated with anti-HSV antibody, β1 co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-HSV tag antibody, again demonstrating that 16K associated with β1 integrin. After SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, the β1 that co-immunoprecipitated with 16K migrated similarly to β1 integrin treated with Endo H (data not shown). Normally, the premature β1 integrin form does not persist for more than 2 h before complete α5/β1 dimerization and maturation into the mature 130-kDa form (Fig. 4A). To determine whether 16K expression had similar effects on the endogenous β1 integrin expression and maturation as it had on overexpressed β1, we studied the biosynthesis of the endogenous β1 using metabolic labeling and an anti-β1 integrin antibody. A pulse-chase experiment with cells transfected with 16K plasmid (10 μg) revealed that there was a significant decrease in endogenous premature β1 integrin levels as well, resulting in an overall lower level of α5β1 integrin after 2 h of chase (Fig. 4A). To determine the point when the decrease of exogenously expressed β1 integrin began, we performed another pulse-chase study with β1-T7- and 16K-HSV-co-transfected cells. In these cells, premature β1 integrin levels were already down-regulated by ∼80% at the 0-min chase time (Fig. 4B). In cells transfected with β1-T7 alone, there was no significant change of premature β1 integrin level during the 15-min pulse and chase, suggesting that the majority of the premature β1 decrease caused by 16K expression occurred during the 15-min pulse labeling (Fig. 4B). Because the ERAD serves as a central pathway for discarding misfolded or incompletely assembled subunits of oligomeric complexes (16Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 17Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 18McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we tested whether the decrease of β1 integrin levels is due to degradation by the conventional proteasome-dependent ERAD pathway using a proteasome-specific inhibitor, MG132. The result showed that the decrease of β1 integrin levels is not mediated by the ERAD pathway (Fig. 4B), although the presence of MG132 (during both pulse and chase) resulted in a slightly increased level of premature β1 integrin. Both this result and the unusually rapid kinetics of the decrease of premature β1 integrin levels (within 15 min) suggested that the decreased β1 integrin level was probably due to degradation by a different mechanism. The Decreased Premature β1 Integrin Levels Resulting from 16K Expression Were Not Due to Transcriptional Down-regulation—Because lowered premature β1 integrin levels after 16K expression may be caused by a decrease in the transcription of β1 integrin, we studied whether 16K expression could alter transcription of either α5 or β1 integrin using real-time PCR analysis. There was no significant difference in the transcription levels of either α5 or β1 integrin (Fig. 5), indicating that the decrease in premature β1 integrin levels following expression of 16K was not due to transcriptional down-regulation of β1 integrin. Expression of either 16K or the TMD4 of 16K Inhibited Association of the Premature β1 Integrin with Calnexin—During the biosynthesis of glycoproteins in the ER, protein folding and oligomeric assembly was mediated by various ER-resident lectin and non-lectin chaperones including calnexin, calreticulin, and BiP (18McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 19Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Both integrin α and β1 premature forms associate with calnexin, which is known to result in a dramatically increased ER resident time of unpaired integrin subunits (21Hotchin N.A. Gandarillas A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Lenter M. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12263-12268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of β1 integrin with these chaperones was studied to examine whether 16K expression alters chaperone interactions during folding of premature β1 integrin in the ER. Interestingly, co-transfection of β1 integrin and 16K caused a marked decrease in the association of the premature β1 integrin with calnexin, but there was no association with calreticulin or BiP either before or after expression of 16K (Fig. 6A). Because of the endogenous function of 16K as a component of V-ATPase, we hypothesized that an intracellular pH change resulting from increased expression of the proton channel might be responsible for the effects on the decreased association between calnexin and the premature β1. Therefore, as one way to test this hypothesis, since TMD4 serves as the domain of 16 kDa that binds β1 integrin (10Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23119-23127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48451-48457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we expressed the HSV-tagged TMD4 of 16 kDa (11Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48451-48457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to determine whether TMD4 alone could functionally replace the 16K and exert the same level of inhibition on calnexin association with premature β1 subunits. The expression of TMD4 alone was sufficient to induce all of the effects of 16K expression on β1 integrin reported above, including inhibition of premature β1 subunit association with calnexin (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, neither 16K expression nor TMD4 expression showed an effect on α5 integrin association with calnexin, demonstrating the specificity of its interaction with the β1 subunit. Calnexin Interacts with 16K or TMD4 —A possible explanation for the inhibition of interaction between the premature β1 subunit and calnexin by 16K was that calnexin could also associate with 16K. The results of experiments to test this possibility showed, surprisingly, that both 16K and TMD4 were co-immunoprecipitated with calnexin (Fig. 6B), demonstrating an association between 16K and calnexin. This result was obtained both by immunoprecipitation of lysates of cells overexpressing 16K with anti-calnexin antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-HSV tag antibody and by anti-HSV tag antibody immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting with anti-calnexin antibody (Fig. 7A). To further confirm this interaction, a pulse-chase study with both 16K-HSV- and TMD4-HSV-expressing cells was perform"
https://openalex.org/W2013206077,"Mxi1 belongs to the Myc/Max/Mad network of proteins that have been implicated in the control of multiple aspects of cellular behavior. Previously, we had reported that the mouse mxi1 gene gives rise to two distinct transcript forms that can encode proteins with dramatically different functional abilities. The Mxi1-SR protein (here termed Mxi1-SRβ) can interact with Sin3/histone deacetylase and function as a potent transcriptional repressor and growth suppressor, while the Mxi1-WR protein lacks these activities. Here, we describe a new mxi1-derived transcript form (termed mxi1-SRα) whose expression is governed by its own promoter, resulting in a spatiotemporally distinct expression profile from that of the highly related mxi1-SRβ form. Moreover, the Mxi1-SRα protein product, with its unique Sin3 interacting domain, has a greater affinity than its Mxi1-SRβ counterpart for the Sin3 adapter proteins as well as an enhanced potential for transcriptional repression in transient reporter assays. Our identification of this novel Mxi1 isoform that results from alternative 5′ exon usage adds an additional layer of complexity to the Mad/Mxi1 family. In addition, our findings warrant re-evaluation of mxi1 expression patterns on the cellular level and its status in human cancer samples, with a renewed focus on the distinct isoforms."
