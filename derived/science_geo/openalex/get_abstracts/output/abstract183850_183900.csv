The amino acid sequence has seven repeats with an apolipoprotein lipid-binding motif, which are predicted to form amphiphilic helices. We have investigated the interaction of α-synuclein with lipid vesicles of different sizes and properties by monitoring the effects on the conformation of the protein and the kinetics of fibrillation. The nature of the interaction of α-synuclein with vesicles was highly dependent on the phospholipid composition, the ratio of α-synuclein to phospholipid, and the size of the vesicles. The strongest interactions were between α-synuclein and vesicles composed of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-RAC-(1-glycerol)/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and involved formation of helical structure in α-synuclein. A strong correlation was observed between the induction of α-helix in α-synuclein and the inhibition of fibril formation. Thus, helical, membrane-bound α-synuclein is unlikely to contribute to aggregation and fibrillation. Given that a significant fraction of α-synuclein is membrane-bound in dopaminergic neurons, this observation has significant physiological significance.

It is also an intrinsically unfolded, or natively unfolded, protein, meaning that in the purified form at neutral pH it lacks an ordered secondary or tertiary structure. α-Synuclein is also the major fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (3Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the distribution of α-synuclein within neurons, and the formation of Lewy bodies, is not well understood. Recent studies have shown that α-synuclein is associated with membranous compartments in cultured cells and brain tissue (4George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F.

Although most of α-synuclein is found in the free cytosolic fraction in the cell, membrane-bound α-synuclein has been suggested to play an important role in fibril formation (10Lee H.J. Choi C. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 671-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that differential affinity for specific phospholipids is responsible for the protein location and perhaps fibril formation. The N-terminal region (approximately residues 1–95) of α-synuclein contains six 11-amino acid imperfect repeats with a highly conservative hexamer motif (KTKEGV), resulting in a variation in hydrophobicity with a strictly conserved periodicity of 11. Such a periodicity is characteristic of the amphipathic lipid-binding α-helical domains of apolipoproteins (11Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), which have been extensively studied and assigned to subclasses according to their unique structural and functional properties (12Segrest J.P.

The existing literature on the nature of the interactions of α-synuclein with membranes is somewhat contradictory. Previous reports have indicated that α-synuclein interacts with certain phospholipids, which may transform it into a helical conformation (8Jo E. McLaurin J. Yip C.M. St. George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34328-34334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar,9Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). It has been reported that small oligomeric forms of α-synuclein preferentially associated with lipid droplets and cell membranes (15Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6344-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and that α-synuclein binds preferentially to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs)1containing acidic phospholipids (with the induction of a helical circular dichroism (CD) signal), but not to vesicles with a net neutral charge (9Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). In contrast, strong binding of α-synuclein to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with either anionic or zwitterionic headgroups has also been reported (16Narayanan V. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9927-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Membranes have been reported to accelerate the fibrillation of α-synuclein (10Lee H.J. Choi C. Lee S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 671-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and a recent report suggests that α-synuclein aggregation may occur on membrane surfaces (15Cole N.B. Murphy D.D. Grider T. Rueter S. Brasaemle D. Nussbaum R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6344-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and that membranes preferentially induce α-synuclein oligomers. However, it has also been reported that α-synuclein binds tightly to neutral and anionic membranes and that membranes inhibit fibrillation (16Narayanan V. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9927-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that the fibril formation of α-synuclein is mediated by a critical partially folded intermediate (17Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Here we report that acidic phospholipids induced the partially folded conformation upon binding to phospholipid vesicles at relatively low lipid concentrations, but an α-helix-rich structure was induced at higher concentrations of lipid. Of particular importance is the observation that the partially folded structure led to fibril formation, whereas the α-helical structure inhibited fibril formation. Recombinant α-synuclein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (17Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Thioflavin T (ThT) was obtained from Sigma. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (PA), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-RAC-(1-glycerol) (PG), dissolved in chloroform, were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Sonicated SUVs of PA/PC (molar ratio 1:1), PG/PC (molar ratio 1:1), and PC were prepared as described previously (9Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). LUVs of PA/PC, PG/PC (molar ratios 1:1), and PC were prepared by 10 cycles of freeze-thaw and extruded through a 0.1-ॖm polycarbonate membrane. α-Synuclein was added to solutions of the vesicles immediately before CD or kinetics measurements for preparations of non-intravesicular protein and mixed with phospholipid before preparation of SUVs or LUVs to obtain intravesicular protein. Vesicles with intravesicular protein contained α-synuclein both in the lumen of the vesicles as well as in the bulk solution (see Fig. 1). Far-UV CD spectra were obtained with an AVIV 60DS spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ) in a 0.1-cm path length cell. The concentration of protein was kept at 14 ॖm, with the mass ratio of protein to phospholipid varying from 5:1 to 1:10. The final spectra were obtained by calculating the mean of five individual scans and subtracting the background with samples consisting of buffer and vesicles without protein. The percentage of α-helix was determined as described previously (18Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Aliquots (5 ॖl) of incubation solution were transferred to freshly cleaved mica. Samples adsorbed on to mica were washed with water to remove unbound protein and dried with a stream of dry N2. AFM images were obtained with an Autoprobe CP Multiple AFM (Park Scientific) in tapping mode. Measurements were carried out using silicon cantilevers with a spring constant of 50 newton/m (Park Scientific) and a resonance frequency of 290–350 kHz. A filtered protein sample (0.22 ॖm) was treated with 0.001m NaOH for 15 min, then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm to remove any preformed aggregates. Freshly prepared stock solutions with concentrations less than 1.0 mg/ml were used within 1 day. Fibril growth experiments involved incubating 0.5 mg/ml purified protein and SUVs or LUVs with varying ratios of α-synuclein to phospholipid in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 0.1m NaCl, containing 20 ॖm ThT at 37 °C with agitation. Fluorescence intensities were recorded in situ at intervals of 30 min using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent, Thermo-Labsystems) with excitation at 450 nm and emission at 485 nm. The sigmoidal kinetics curves for fibril formation were analyzed as described previously (19Nielsen L. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8397-8409Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In control experiments we have shown that the presence of ThT (up to at least 20 ॖm) has no effect on the kinetics of α-synuclein fibrillation. Preparations of SUVs are relatively homogeneous, with a more curved (smaller radius) surface compared with LUVs, and the SUVs are of similar size to synaptic vesicles. The far-UV CD spectrum of α-synuclein at pH 7.5 is typical of an unfolded protein and has a significant negative molar ellipticity at 198 nm. When α-synuclein was mixed with PA/PC (1:1) vesicles at a mass ration of 5:1 (protein to PA/PC), the CD spectrum showed a decrease in molar ellipticity at 198 nm, indicating an increase in secondary structure (Table I). When the phospholipid mass ratio was increased to 1:1 α-synuclein/(PA/PC) the CD spectra displayed significant negative molar ellipticity (−12.4 × 103 degree·cm2·dmol−1) at 222 nm, and a large positive molar ellipticity at 195 nm (Fig.2), indicating formation of substantial α-helix (Table I). When the PA/PC content was increased to 1:5 (α-synuclein/lipid), lipid binding was accompanied by a further increase in helical structure from 32 to 737 as the mass ratio of lipid increased from 1:1 to 1:5.Table Iα-Helical content of α-synuclein bound to PA/PC vesicles, and its correlation with fibrillationVesicle sizeProtein:lipid (mass ratio)Intravesicular proteinα-Helical contentLag time7hSUV5:1−94.5 ± 0.7+296.8 ± 0.81:1−3212.2 ± 1.6+5818.5 ± 1.91:5−73∞+84∞LUV5:1−88.8 ± 0.6+87.5 ± 0.91:1−1717.3 ± 1.5+17.719.3 ± 2.11:5−61.229.2 ± 3.8+69.539.8 ± 4.5Helix content was measured using circular dichroism, at pH 7.5, with varying ratios of protein to lipid. The protein concentration was 14 ॖm. The lag time for fibril formation is shown and was estimated from fits to fibrillation kinetics as monitored by ThT. Longer lag times correspond to inhibition of the first stage of fibrillation. In the absence of vesicles, the lag time was 14 h.

The lag time for fibril formation is shown and was estimated from fits to fibrillation kinetics as monitored by ThT. Longer lag times correspond to inhibition of the first stage of fibrillation. In the absence of vesicles, the lag time was 14 h. Fig. 2 shows that helix was induced on binding to the acidic phospholipid vesicles regardless of vesicle size (SUVs or LUVs). However, the amount of helix induced was less for LUVs than for the corresponding SUVs (Table I). Negatively stained preparations examined by EM indicated that the large unilamellar vesicles had sizes from 60 to 200 nm (average 120 nm) (data not shown), and SUVs had diameters of 20–25 nm (9Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Experiments with LUVs of PA/PC show that α-helical structure is also induced in α-synuclein (Fig. 2); the helix content increased only to 617 at a protein/lipid ratio of 1:5 (Table I), demonstrating that the protein preferentially binds to vesicles of smaller diameter (20–25 nm) as opposed to larger (120 nm) vesicles. The contact area (ratio of surface area to volume for small vesicles is larger than that for large vesicles, which may contribute to the increase in helical content (see model in Fig. 1). An alternative explanation for the increased binding to the smaller vesicles is that the α-helical conformation of α-synuclein is better accommodated on more tightly curved surfaces than less curved surfaces. This possibility is supported by the results with intravesicular α-synuclein (see below). For example, the increased spacing of the phospholipid headgroups in the SUVs may more easily accommodate insertion of helices. To determine whether there were differences in the interaction of α-synuclein with lipids between the inside and outside of the vesicle, we prepared small (SUVs) and larger vesicles (LUVs) with protein trapped inside the vesicles. Although it is hard to estimate the encapsulation efficiencies of α-synuclein in lipid vesicles without separating free α-synuclein from bound protein, it is well known that the encapsulation efficiencies of LUVs are higher than those of SUVs. We used CD to examine the conformational changes, with the results shown in Fig. 2, while the α-helix content is given in TableI. There was consistently more helix induced with the vesicles containing intravesicular α-synuclein, but the effect with LUVs was smaller. Thus, the helix content increased from 73 to 847 for SUVs, and from 61 to 707 for LUVs, when the protein was present inside the vesicle lumen. At low protein to lipid ratios the amount of helix was more than doubled with the SUVs, consistent with greater induction of helix to the more curved interior surface. To determine whether the tendency to induce α-helix is a general property of phospholipids with acidic head groups, PG/PC, PS/PC, and PC alone were also prepared and CD spectra were collected. An equivalent phenomenon was observed when negatively charged PA/PC was replaced by negatively charged PG/PC or PS/PC (data not shown) to form SUVs or LUVs. However, binding to neutral lipid vesicles of PC only slightly decreased the ellipticity at 198 nm (Fig. 4), and no helical structure was observed. α-Synuclein was incubated with small and large PA/PC vesicles with various concentrations of protein and lipid. These studies involved incubation of vesicles at 37 °C for 3 days. EM images demonstrated that the basic structure of the vesicles did not change (Fig. 3). Fig. 4A shows the effect on the kinetics of α-synuclein fibrillation monitored by ThT fluorescence of the addition of 0.5 mg/ml α-synuclein to the vesicles, together with a control solution in which α-synuclein was added to the buffer in the absence of vesicles. ThT is a fluorescence dye that binds to amyloid fibrils leading to a large increase in the fluorescence intensity. The fibrillation of α-synuclein was shown by the increase in ThT signal and then verified by EM and AFM images. We found that the fibrillation of α-synuclein was affected by PA/PC vesicles in a concentration and size dependent fashion. With moderate concentrations of PA/PC, which induced a partially folded α-synuclein intermediate, as evidenced by the CD spectra (Fig. 2), the rate of fibril formation of α-synuclein was accelerated, regardless of vesicle size (Fig. 5). EM and AFM images show the size and shape of fibrils formed in the presence of PA/PC (Fig. 6); the fibrils had a typical height of 7.6 nm and 28-nm periodic left-handed twisted structure. This morphology is very similar to that of fibrils grown in lipid-free solution, indicating a similar fibrillation pathway as in the absence of lipid.Figure 6The morphology of α-synuclein fibrils grown in the presence of vesicles is similar to that of fibrils grown in the absence of lipid.Left panel, EM image of fibrils; right panel, AFM image of an individual α-synuclein fibril in the presence of PA/PC SUVs at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Increasing the relative PA/PC concentration in the incubation solution led to a decrease in rate of fibril formation, as shown by the increased lag time (Fig. 5). Under these conditions, CD spectra also showed a change in secondary structure from partially unfolded intermediate to mostly helical structure. There was no significant difference in the kinetics of fibrillation between SUVs containing intravesicular protein or non-intravesicular protein. When the mass ratio of protein to lipid was increased from 5:1 to 1:5, the helical structure content increased from 7–8 to 60–707 for LUV-bound α-synuclein. Concurrently, the lag time for fibrillation increased from 8.8 ± 0.6 h to 29.2 ± 3.8 h for non-intravesicular LUVs and from 7.5 ± 0.9 to 39.8 ± 4.5 h for intravesicular protein in the LUVs, correlating well with the increased helix content (Table I). For the SUV-bound α-synuclein, the helix content increased to 70–807, and fibril formation was completely inhibited (Fig. 5, A andB). No fibrils were formed under these conditions in 4 weeks. In control experiments with no lipid, fibrils formed in 14 h. Similar results were obtained with vesicles of PG/PC and PS/PC (data not shown). PC vesicles, with their neutral head groups, were examined to address the possible effects of charge and crowding on protein association and fibrillation. PC vesicles had no effect on the fibrillation of α-synuclein when the protein to lipid radio was increased up to 1:10, as shown in Fig. 4B. This demonstrates that fibril formation was inhibited by the α-helical conformation and not by the presence of the vesicles themselves. Our previous results demonstrated that fibril formation of α-synuclein was initiated by a conformational change from the natively unfolded structure to a partially folded, औ-sheet-containing conformation (17Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). The current investigation focused on fibril formation by membrane-associated α-synuclein. We used circular dichroism to estimate the secondary structure and thioflavin T assays to monitor the fibril formation, and the results were compared with lipid-free protein. The local concentration of protein is significantly increased upon binding to the lipid vesicles (20Walde P. Ichikawa S. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 18: 143-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effects of the vesicles on α-synuclein fibrillation were very dependent on the ratio of lipid to protein (under all conditions there was a molar excess of lipid). For example, at low mass ratios of PA/PC vesicles to α-synuclein, there was a substantial increase in rate of fibrillation, as manifested by the decrease in lag time from 14 ± 2 h for lipid-free protein to 4.5 ± 0.7 h for lipid-bound (SUVs) α-synuclein. This acceleration of fibrillation coincided with a change in the secondary structure of α-synuclein from natively unfolded to that of the partially folded intermediate. We attribute this increase in fibrillation rate to the formation of the partially folded intermediate conformation. In contrast, when the lipid content increased, the α-synuclein conformation changed to 60–857 α-helix for both SUVs and LUVs of PA/PC (and PG/PC and PS/PC). Since no fibrils were formed under these conditions, we conclude that the helical conformation prevents formation of fibrils. This observation may be of major physiological significance; if under normal conditions α-synuclein is predominantly bound to membranes in dopaminergic neurons, this would minimize its chances of aggregation. On the other hand, factors leading to significant reduction in the membrane-bound form of α-synuclein could result in pathological effects emanating from the aggregation of α-synuclein. The effect of the vesicles on the fibrillation rate depends on the vesicle size. In the case of SUVs, regardless of whether or not the protein was in the vesicle core (lumen), fibril formation is inhibited completely if the helix content is above 707. However, with LUV-bound α-synuclein the rate of fibrillation was decreased, but not totally inhibited, with 60 to 707 α-synuclein in a helical conformation. The most likely explanation is that less α-synuclein is bound to the LUVs, compared with the SUVs (at the same lipid/protein mass ratios), and thus some α-synuclein is not bound to the vesicles and is present in the partial folded conformation and goes on to form fibrils. This may be a reflection of the increased lipid cooperativity of LUVs compared with SUVs. On the other hand, with intravesicular protein, α-synuclein can become locally concentrated within a single vesicle and form fibrils in the core (lumen). We have demonstrated that fibrillar α-synuclein will disrupt lipid membranes in a short time. 2M. Zhu, J. Li, and A. Fink, manuscript in preparation. Agitation in the presence of a Teflon bead led to further destruction of the membrane. Thus the initially formed fibrils in the vesicle core can serve as seeds for further fibrillation after they are released to the solution outside the vesicles. This is confirmed by the observation of shorter lag times for intravesicular protein in LUVs as opposed to intravesicular protein in SUVs (Fig. 5). We have previously shown that formation of the α-synuclein partially folded intermediate leads to fibrillation, presumably due to self-association driven by regions of exposed hydrophobic residues (17Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar,21Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L.

Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). However, when α-synuclein is in its helical conformation it preferentially binds to lipid. Thus, exposure of α-synuclein to lipid vesicles leads to preferential binding to the membrane and induction of helix, probably simultaneously, and prevention of protein self-association. Therefore, the protein-lipid interaction induces and stabilizes the helical structure and thus prevents aggregation. Molecular crowding has been shown to dramatically stimulate the fibrillation of α-synuclein (24Uversky V.N. Cooper M. Bower K.S. Li J. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that there may be some crowding effects on α-synuclein fibrillation at high lipid vesicle concentrations. To determine whether this was a contributing factor, we used PC vesicles, which have been reported not to bind α-synuclein (9Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). These vesicles had minimal effect on the conformation of α-synuclein, presumably reflecting minimal binding to the vesicles containing neutral head groups and no evidence for helix formation was observed. The lag times for fibrillation, estimated from kinetics curves shown in Fig. 5, increase slightly from 14 ± 2 h to 15 ± 2 (5:1), 17 ± 2 (1:1), and 19 ± 2 (1:5) h in a lipid concentration-dependent fashion. This slight inhibition of fibrillation is probably due to some interaction with the vesicles. The complete inhibition of fibril formation by PA/PC SUV-bound α-synuclein thus results from the high helical structure and not molecular crowding. This is also verified by the observation that LUVs with the same amount of lipid, and thus the same crowding conditions, result in only moderate fibril inhibition. We therefore conclude that the α-helical conformation of α-synuclein does not fibrillate. This is also in agreement with investigations of the effect of the osmolyte trimethylamineN-oxide, which show that high concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide induce a helical conformation in α-synuclein, and a corresponding lack of fibrillation (21Uversky V.N.

https://openalex.org/W2142440154,"Claudins are a family of integral membrane proteins of the tight junction that are thought to participate in the permeation of solutes across epithelia via the paracellular pathway. Claudin-8 is expressed in the distal renal tubule, which has a characteristically low passive permeability to monovalent cations. To test the hypothesis that claudin-8 plays a role in forming a tight paracellular barrier to cations, stably transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney II cell lines with inducible expression of claudin-8 were generated. Induction of claudin-8 expression was associated with down-regulation of endogenous claudin-2 protein. Other tight junction proteins were expressed and targeted normally, and the number of junctional strands was minimally altered. By Ussing chamber and radiotracer flux studies, claudin-8 expression was found to reduce paracellular permeability to monovalent inorganic and organic cations and to divalent cations but not to anions or neutral solutes. The size selectivity, charge dependence, and activation energy of paracellular cation permeation were all unchanged. These observations are consistent with a model in which claudin-2 encodes a highly cation-permeable channel, whereas claudin-8 acts primarily as a cation barrier. When exogenous claudin-8 is expressed, it replaces endogenous claudin-2, inserting in its place into existing tight junction strands, thereby reducing the apparent number of functional cation pores.

The corrected figure is shown below: Full-Text PDF Open Access Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transepithelial resistance doxycycline Vectorial transport across epithelia can occur via the transcellular or paracellular route. The molecular basis of transcellular transport, mediated by proteins that catalyze transmembrane movement of solutes and water at the apical and basolateral surfaces, is well understood. By contrast, little is known about the mechanisms of paracellular transport. The tight junction, which is the most apical of the intercellular junctional complexes at the lateral membrane, is generally believed to be the rate-limiting step in paracellular transport. The tight junction is composed of a complex of multiple proteins, many of uncertain function (1Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fanning A.S. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these proteins are cytoplasmic in location, and several are associated with the cytoskeleton via the perijunctional actin ring. In recent years, a number of integral membrane proteins associated with the tight junction have been identified, including occludin (3Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Integral membrane proteins are of particular interest because, by definition, their extracellular domains must protrude into the lateral intercellular space and, therefore, may potentially have direct contact with solutes as they permeate through the paracellular pathway. Claudins are the most heterogeneous of these integral membrane proteins and consist of a family of at least 20 homologous isoforms (9Tsukita S. Furuse M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Moreover, each isoform clearly exhibits a tissue-specific and segment-specific pattern of distribution in epithelia such as those of the gastrointestinal tract (10Rahner C. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and renal tubule (11Yu A. Enck A. J. Am. Soc.

Claudins are therefore leading candidates for the molecular determinants responsible for the variety of different paracellular permeability properties found in different epithelia. Several recent reports provide convincing evidence that claudins regulate paracellular permeability. Human mutations in claudin-16 cause failure of paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations in the thick ascending limb of the renal tubule, leading to familial hypercalciuric hypomagnesemia (14Simon D.B. Lu Y. Choate K.A. Velazquez H. Al-Sabban E. Praga M. Casari G. Bettinelli A. Colussi G. Rodriguez-Soriano J. McCredie D. Milford D. Sanjad S. Lifton R.P. Science. 1999; 285: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), and a preliminary report suggests that knockout mice lacking claudin-16 may have a similar phenotype (15Lu Y. Choate K.A. Wang T. Lifton R.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12 (abstr.): 756Google Scholar). Both claudin-1-deficient mice (16Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) and transgenic mice overexpressing claudin-6 (17Turksen K. Troy T.C. Development. 2002; 129: 1775-1784PubMed Google Scholar) exhibit abnormally high epidermal permeability to water. Overexpression of claudins 1, 4, and 15 in MDCK1 cells all increase transepithelial resistance (TER) (18Inai T. Kobayashi J. Shibata Y. Eur. J.

Van Itallie C.M. McCrea H.J. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of claudin-2 markedly decreases TER (22Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) by selectively increasing permeability to cations (23Amasheh S. Meiri N. Gitter A.H. Schoneberg T. Mankertz J. Schulzke J.D. Fromm M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4969-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Anderson and co-workers (20Van Itallie C. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 21Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C.M. McCrea H.J. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) elegantly show that, although overexpression of claudin-4 reduces paracellular monovalent cation permeability, this can be abolished by altering the net charge at the first extracellular loop by site-directed mutagenesis. Similarly, although claudin-15 alone does not alter the relative preference of the paracellular pathway between Na+ and Cl−, mutating anionic extracellular residues to cationic ones makes the paracellular pathway more anion-selective (21Colegio O.R. Van Itallie C.M. McCrea H.J. Rahner C. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Thus, the contention that claudins have a direct role in regulating the magnitude and nature of paracellular permeability is now irrefutable. However, the plethora of published claudin overexpression and gene ablation experiments has uncovered a fundamental paradox. Claudin overexpression can be associated with both an increase (17Turksen K. Troy T.C. Development. 2002; 129: 1775-1784PubMed Google Scholar, 22Furuse M. Furuse K. Sasaki H. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) in paracellular permeability; similarly, knockout or inactivating mutations of claudin genes can cause either an increase (16Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar) or a decrease (14Simon D.B. Lu Y.

Nephrol. 2001; 12 (abstr.): 756Google Scholar) in paracellular permeability. Thus, in the absence of suitable models to explain such contradictory observations, attempts to infer the permeability properties of specific claudin isoforms remain problematic. A possible solution emerges if one views each tight junction strand as a continuous string of protein molecules (such as claudins, occludin, or other proteins) arrayed side-by-side, rather like beads on a necklace, so as to form an uninterrupted seal (9Tsukita S. Furuse M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In such a model, claudins would play a bipartite role, acting as a barrier by sealing the gaps between protein particles, and simultaneously providing a channel through that barrier from the apical compartment to the lateral intercellular space. This may explain why the complete loss of a claudin isoform can have diametrically opposite consequences. In the absence of any changes in other tight junction proteins, gaps would appear in the continuous seal, and the paracellular route would become more permeable. Conversely, when other components of the tight junction become up-regulated and fill in for the absent claudins, the paracellular route may become less permeable. Similar considerations may govern the consequences of overexpression experiments. The resulting phenotype is complex and dependent on the properties both of the heterologously expressed claudin and of endogenous tight junction proteins. In this manuscript, we describe a new tissue culture model with overexpression of claudin-8. We chose to study claudin-8 because previous in situ hybridization (11Yu A. Enck A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12 (abstr.): 45Google Scholar) and immunohistochemical studies (12Kiuchi-Saishin Y. Gotoh S. Furuse M. Takasuga A. Tano Y. Tsukita S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 875-886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that it is expressed primarily in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron. In these segments of the renal tubule, the paracellular barrier is particularly tight to monovalent cations and protects transtubular gradients up to 1000:1 for H+, 20:1 for K+, and 1:3 for Na+. We therefore tested the hypothesis that claudin-8 plays a role in impeding paracellular cation permeation. We show that the combination of careful biochemical, histological, and physiological studies constitute a powerful tool to interpret the phenotype of such overexpression experiments. We propose potential models to explain the findings of such studies and show data that indicate that claudin-8 acts as a nonspecific cation barrier. A 675-bp DNA fragment containing the mouse claudin-8 coding sequence except for the initiation codon was amplified by PCR from a cDNA clone (IMAGE ID: 162549) and inserted into a FLAG epitope tag shuttle vector based on pcDNA3 (24Dowland L.K. Luyckx V.A. Enck A.H. Leclercq B. Yu A.S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37765-37773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) so that the claudin-8 N terminus was fused in-frame with a sequence encoding MDYKDDDDKGS (the FLAG octapeptide tag is underlined followed by a glycine-serine linker encoding BamHI restriction site). The entire coding region was then excised and cloned into the retroviral Tet response vector, pRevTRE (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to obtain the plasmid, pRev-mCLDN8-NFL. Plasmid DNA was transfected by lipofection into the packaging cell line, PT67, a polyclonal culture of stable transfectants selected using hygromycin, and virus-containing supernatant collected from the growth medium. MDCK II TetOff cells expressing the tetracycline-regulated transactivator from a cytomegalovirus promoter (Clontech) were infected with viral supernatant in the presence of Polybrene. Stable transfectants were selected by growth in 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin. Clonal cell lines were isolated using plastic cloning rings and three clones (2, 4, and 9) with strong induction of claudin-8 expression (see “Results”) used for further studies. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 57 fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml G418, 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin, and 20 ng/ml doxycycline (Dox+). To induce claudin-8 expression, doxycycline was omitted from the culture medium starting from the day of plating (Dox−). Studies were generally performed after 4–6 days except where otherwise indicated. To detect tight junction protein expression by immunoblotting, cultured cells were first homogenized and fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g as described previously (24Dowland L.K. Luyckx V.A. Enck A.H. Leclercq B. Yu A.S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37765-37773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). No claudin-8 was ever detectable in the soluble fraction (100,000 × g supernatant). The total amount of protein isolated from plates of confluent Dox+ and Dox− cells was similar, and the fractional yield of membrane protein (100,000 × g pellet) was roughly 157 in both. Aliquots of 25 ॖg of membrane protein were then electrophoresed on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western blots were performed using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Claudin-8 transgene expression was detected with the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a 1:400 dilution. Antibodies to ZO1, occludin, and claudins 1–4 were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA and used at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Rabbit anti-Coxsackie- and adenovirus-associated receptor antiserum (a kind gift of Dr. Christopher Cohen, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA) was used at 1:5000 dilution. Western blots were digitized with a flatbed optical scanner. Gray scale values were logarithmically transformed to obtain uncalibrated optical density estimates, and individual bands were quantitated using NIH Image 1.61 software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ nih-image). To determine the localization of claudin-8 protein expression, cell lines grown on 12-mm Transwell-Clear polyester filters (1-cm2 growth area, 0.4-ॖm pore size; Corning Costar, Acton, MA) were fixed with 47 paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 15 min, then indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed either with the M2 mouse antibody at 1:400 dilution or (for the double labeling study shown in Fig. 1C) with a rabbit anti-claudin-8 antibody (933) at 1:100 dilution, all in the presence of 0.37 Triton X-100 using protocols described previously (24Dowland L.K. Luyckx V.A. Enck A.H. Leclercq B. Yu A.S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37765-37773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody 933 was raised against the claudin-8 C-terminal peptide, CQRSFHAEKRSPSIYSKSQYV (25Morita K. Furuse M. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Images were acquired at the University of Southern California Center for Liver Diseases using a Nikon PCM confocal microscopy system with argon and helium-neon lasers. Freeze fracture with or without immunolabeling was performed essentially as described previously (19McCarthy K.M. Francis S.A. McCormack J.M. Lai J. Rogers R.A. Skare I.B. Lynch R.D. Schneeberger E.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3387-3398PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers were fixed either in 27 glutaraldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min (no immunolabeling) or in 17 paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 15 min (for immunolabeling). They were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the filter, and infiltrated with 257 glycerol in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 60 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen slush, and freeze-fractured at −115 °C in a Balzers 400 freeze-fracture unit (Lichtenstein). Processing of the replicas for strand morphometry and immunolabeling was as described (26McCarthy K.M. Skare I.B. Stankewich M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2287-2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the replicas were examined with a Philips 301 electron microscope. The number of parallel strands in the tight junctions was quantified as described previously (26McCarthy K.M. Skare I.B. Stankewich M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2287-2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the frequency distribution of strand number was non-Gaussian, the difference in the median number of strands in Dox+ and Dox− cells was assessed for statistical significance using the Wilcoxon ranked sum test. Immunolabeling of SDS-treated replicas was performed with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (1:100) followed by goat anti-mouse gold (1:100). Cells were plated at confluent density (2 × 105 cells/cm2) onto Transwell filters loaded in 12-well plates. The resistance across each filter in culture media was measured at room temperature by immersing into the well chopstick-style Ag/AgCl electrodes attached to a Millicell-ERS voltohmeter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). TER was calculated by subtracting the resistance determined in blank filters from the resistance measured in filters with monolayers. Cells were plated at confluent density on 1 cm2 Snapwell polyester filters (Corning Costar) and grown for the indicated number of days. The filter rings were then detached and mounted in Ussing chambers that were incubated in Ringer solution (150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C and continuously bubbled with 957 O2, 57 CO2. The fluid volume on each side of the filter was 4 ml. Voltage-sensing electrodes consisting of Ag/AgCl pellets and current-passing electrodes of silver wire were connected by agar bridges containing 3m KCl and interfaced via head-stage amplifiers to a microcomputer-controlled voltage/current clamp (DM-MC6 and VCC-MC6, respectively; Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Voltage-sensing electrodes were matched to within 1 mV asymmetry and corrected by an offset-removal circuit. The voltage between the two compartments (values reported are referenced to the apical side) was monitored and recorded at 5-s intervals, whereas the current was continuously clamped to zero. This was done to minimize current-induced local changes of salt concentration in the unstirred layers, which can generate spontaneous potentials due to the transport-number effect (27Wedner H.J. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1969; 1: 92-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The voltage was first measured with blank filters in each combination of buffers to be used for the experiments. The values obtained, which were generally less than 1 mV in magnitude, represent the difference in junction potentials between the two voltage-sensing bridges summed with any potential that might exist across the filter membrane. These were subtracted from all subsequent measurements with filters containing attached cell monolayers to determine transepithelial voltage (Vt). The total resistance between apical and basal compartments was determined in Ringer at the start and at intervals throughout the experiment from the voltage evoked by a 5-ॖA bipolar current pulse. The background resistance determined with blank filters (62.0 ± 1.0 ohm, n = 6), representing the sum of the resistances of the filter, of the fluid in the chambers and of the current-passing electrodes and bridges was subtracted from the total resistance measured with filters containing attached cell monolayers to determine the TER and hence conductance (TER−1). TER was found to be maintained within 57 of its base-line value for at least 2 h, whereas the duration of an experiment was typically about 60–90 min. Dilution and biionic potentials were determined by replacing the solution of one compartment, generally the basal side to minimize flow disruption of the integrity of the monolayer, while keeping the other side bathed in Ringer. In selected cases the solution in the apical compartment was replaced instead of the basal side and showed identical results (see for example Fig. 5B). For 2:1 NaCl dilution potentials, the 150 mm NaCl in Ringer was replaced with 75 mm NaCl, and the osmolality was maintained with mannitol. For biionic potentials, 150 mm NaCl was replaced with 150 mm chloride salt of the indicated alkali metal or organic cation. Organic cations that were obtained as free amine compounds were titrated to neutrality with HCl to form the chloride salt. All organic cations used had a pKa greater than 9.0; therefore, they were all assumed to be completely protonated at pH 7.4. In biionic potential experiments using near-impermeant organic cations, contamination of the solution with residual traces of Na+could lead to a significant overestimation of the permeability (28Dwyer T.M. Adams D.J. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1980; 75: 469-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To exclude this, multiple washes with Na+-free, organic cation-containing buffer were performed. A “bracketed” protocol was used in which each measurement in asymmetrical salt solutions was both preceded and followed by measurements in symmetrical Ringer to control for any time-dependent variation in the properties of the monolayer and for “memory” effects on the liquid junction potential (29Barry P.H. Diamond J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1970; 3: 93-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transmonolayer [3H]mannitol, [4C]urea, and [45]Ca tracer flux studies were performed by a modification of the method described by McCarthy et al.(19McCarthy K.M. Francis S.A. McCormack J.M. Lai J. Rogers R.A. Skare I.B. Lynch R.D. Schneeberger E.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3387-3398PubMed Google Scholar). Studies were performed in 12-well plates of Transwell filters in culture medium that already contained 1.8 mmCa2+. For mannitol and urea assays, 1 mmunlabeled substrate was also added to the medium in both compartments. Flux studies were initiated by adding 1–4 ॖCi/ml of the appropriate radioisotope (specific activity, 1–2 Ci/mol) to one side (cis compartment) followed by incubation at 37 °C. At 30-min intervals, 100 ॖl of medium was collected from thetrans compartment for liquid scintillation counting and replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium at 37 °C. Tracer accumulation for all three solutes was found to be linear from 30 to 60 min, and this was used to determine the flux rate and, hence, total permeability, PTot. To correct for the effect of the filter membrane and adjacent unstirred layers, the tracer permeability across blank filters, PBlank, was determined concurrently. Transepithelial permeability,PTE, was then calculated from the following equation.PTE=[(1/PTot)−(1/PBlank)]−1Equation 1 Data are presented as the means ± S.E., where n indicates the number of monolayers from a single experiment. Differences between groups were assessed for statistical significance using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Nonlinear regression analyses were performed by the Levenberg-Marquardt method using GraphPad Prism 3 software. All results shown are representative of at least three separate experiments unless otherwise indicated. The relative ionic permeabilities of the monolayers were calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. This is justified because the equation was shown to fit our data well (see “Results” and Fig. 5). The individual permeabilities to Na+(PNa) and Cl−(PCl) in symmetrical 150 mm NaCl were deduced from the method of Kimizuka and Koketsu (30Kimizuka H. Koketsu K. J. Theor. Biol. 1964; 6: 290-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using the following equations,PNa=G·(RT/F2)/(a(1+औ))Equation 2 PCl=PNa·औEquation 3 where G is the conductance per unit surface area,a is the NaCl activity, and औ is the ratio of the permeability of Cl− to that of Na+ as determined by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. All calculations used activities rather than concentrations. The mean activity coefficient of each monovalent cation-halide salt was assumed to be the same as that of NaCl, and the anion and cation in each case were assumed to have the same activity coefficient (Guggenheim assumption). To investigate the role of claudin-8 in paracellular permeability, we first generated cell lines overexpressing the claudin-8 protein. We first ascertained by low stringency Northern blot analysis that the canine renal tubule epithelial cell line, MDCK II, does not express claudin-8 endogenously (data not shown). We then generated by retroviral transduction three MDCK II clonal cell lines with stable heterologous expression of N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged claudin-8 under the control of the TetOff system. Claudin-8 expression was induced in these cells by omitting doxycycline from the medium (Dox−) and suppressed by adding doxycycline (Dox+). By Western blotting and by immunohistochemistry using the FLAG antibody, claudin-8 protein was found to be expressed in Dox− cells but was completely undetectable in Dox+ cells (Fig. 1,A and B). By immunohistochemistry, claudin-8 in confluent Dox− cell monolayers was expressed at the apical end of the lateral cell membrane, where the tight junction is located, and colocalized with the tight junction scaffolding protein, ZO1 (Fig.1C). On electron microscopic examination of freeze fracture images, the number of tight junction strands appeared similar (Fig.2, A and B). Careful quantitative morphometry (Fig. 2C) revealed a small but statistically significant increase in strand number (median 4 in Dox− cells, 3 in Dox+, p < 0.0001). Tight junction morphology was mostly normal, although we observed"

In mitochondria from these transgenic mice, cyclosporin A-inhibited pore opening was delayed by creatine or cyclocreatine but not by β-guanidinopropionic acid. This observation correlated with the ability of these substrates to stimulate state 3 respiration in the presence of extramitochondrial ATP. The dependence of transition pore opening on calcium and magnesium concentration was studied in the presence and absence of creatine. If mitochondrial creatine kinase activity decreased (i.e. by omitting magnesium from the medium), protection of permeability transition pore opening by creatine or cyclocreatine was no longer seen. Likewise, when creatine kinase was added externally to liver mitochondria from wild-type mice that do not express mitochondrial creatine kinase in liver, no protective effect on pore opening by creatine and its analog was observed. All these findings indicate that mitochondrial creatine kinase activity located within the intermembrane and intercristae space, in conjunction with its tight functional coupling to oxidative phosphorylation, via the adenine nucleotide translocase, can modulate mitochondrial permeability transition in the presence of creatine. These results are of relevance for the design of creatine analogs for cell protection as potential adjuvant therapeutic tools against neurodegenerative diseases.

The findings of distinct subcellular localizations of creatine kinases have led to the formulation of the PCr circuit concept, proposing that sites of energy production (mitochondria and glycolysis) are tightly linked via Cr/PCr shuttling to sites of energy consumption (various cellular ATPases) (1Bessman S.P.

ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria reacts with creatine (Cr) to produce PCr, a reaction mediated by mitochondrial CK (mtCK) located in the intermembrane and intercristae space. Phosphocreatine then diffuses to the cytosol to locally regenerate ATP via cytosolic CK from ADP. Cr produced during this reaction is shuttled back to the mitochondria for recharging it to PCr. This energy shuttling system is particularly efficient in tissues with a very high and fluctuating energy demand like skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as in brain and neural tissues (7Wallimann T. Hemmer W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 133: 193-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the generally accepted temporal energy buffering function, PCr also provides a means to spatially buffer energy reserves (3Wallimann T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 42-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This holds especially true for highly polar cells like spermatozoa where the diffusion of ADP is the limiting factor (8Kaldis P. Kamp G. Piendl T. Wallimann T. Advances in Developmental Biology. JAI Press Inc., New York1997: 275-312Google Scholar). Studies with cultured rat hippocampal neurons have shown recently that creatine protects against glutamate and β-amyloid toxicity (9Brewer G.J. Wallimann T.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1968-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), as well as against energetic insults in striatal neurons (10Brustovetsky N. Brustovetsky T. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similarly, creatine and in some cases the related analog cyclocreatine (CyCr) exert protective effects in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, like Huntington's disease (11Matthews R.T. Yang L. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Rosen B.R. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Beal M.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 156-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (12Klivenyi P. Ferrante R.J. Matthews R.T. Bogdanov M.B. Klein A.M. Andreassen O.A. Mueller G. Wermer M. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Beal M.F. Nat.

Neurol. 1999; 157: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Likewise, Cr pretreatment of cultured myotubes from dystrophic mdx mice enhanced myotube formation and survival (14Pulido S.M. Passaquin A.C. Leijendekker W.J. Challet C. Wallimann T. Ruegg U.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that Cr reduces muscle necrosis and protects mitochondrial function in vivo in mdx mice (15Passaquin A.C. Renard M. Kay L. Challet C. Mokhtarian A. Wallimann T. Ruegg U.T. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2002; 12: 174-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Treatment of patients with Cr or Cr analogs has, therefore, been proposed as a possible adjuvant therapy for such diseases (16Tarnopolsky M.A. Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 561-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The protection observed with Cr in these cell and animal models may be explained partially by its function as a cellular energy buffer and transport system via the PCr shuttle as outlined above. An additional potential mechanism of Cr protection may be linked to direct effects on mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) (17O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Dolder M. Koretsky A.P. Brdiczka D. Wallimann T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which has been suggested to be a causative event in different in vivo and in vitro models of cell death (18Pastorino J.G.

In an attempt to define the role of mitochondrial creatine kinase on MPT, we have shown in an earlier study that isolated liver mitochondria from transgenic mice containing mtCK did not respond by MPT pore opening upon treatment with Ca2+ plus atractyloside if Cr or CyCr were present in the medium (17O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Dolder M. Koretsky A.P. Brdiczka D. Wallimann T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the absence of Cr and CyCr, however, MPT pore opening could be fully induced by Ca2+plus atractyloside. On the other hand, in liver mitochondria from control mice without mtCK, pore opening induced by Ca2+plus atractyloside was independent on the presence or absence of Cr or CyCr. In the present study we investigated these effects in more detail, asking the question of whether inhibition of MPT pore opening by CK substrates depends on mtCK activity and whether the tight functional coupling between the CK reaction and oxidative phosphorylation, demonstrated recently to take place in situ(25Kay L. Nicolay K. Wieringa B. Saks V. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6937-6944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), would lead to cycling of mitochondrial adenine nucleotides, thus resulting in net production of phosphorylated CK substrates. Our results indicate that substrate channeling between mtCK and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) takes place in a tight functionally coupled microcompartment that seems absolutely required for protection of MPT pore opening by creatine. Transgenic mice expressing the ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase isoform in their liver mitochondria (transgenic liver-mtCK mice) were kindly provided by Dr. Alan P. Koretsky (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Mice were killed, and the liver was quickly removed and placed in ice-cold isolation buffer for mitochondria (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Livers were homogenized, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through two layers of nylon gauze and centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was washed twice with isolation buffer (without EDTA and bovine serum albumin), centrifuged, and kept on ice. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured with a Cyclobios oxygraph (Anton Paar, Innsbruck, Austria) at 25 °C. The standard medium (2 ml) consisted of 10 mm Tris/Mops, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm phosphate/Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA/Tris, 2 μm rotenone, and 50 μm Ap5A. State 4 respiration was stimulated by addition of 5 mm succinate/Tris. Creatine kinase substrates (Cr, CyCr, and GPA) were present at 10 mmconcentration, and state 3 respiration was induced by adding 1 mm ATP. Mitochondrial protein concentration in all assays was 0.5 mg/ml. Deviations from these conditions are specified in the figure legends. Mitochondrial MPT pore opening was measured by the convenient swelling assay and carried out in a UV4 UV/Vis spectrometer (Unicam) connected to a computer. Swelling curves were recorded at 540 nm, and data points were acquired every 1/8 s using Vision© software (version 3.10, Unicam Ltd.). Cuvettes containing the mitochondrial suspension were thermostated to 25 °C. Incubation conditions and induction of MPT are indicated in the legends to the figures. Mitochondria were incubated under different conditions (see legend to Fig. 4) in the presence of32Pi. Reactions were stopped after defined time intervals by addition of 1% (final concentration) SDS and centrifuged, and the supernatants were applied to Silica Gel 60 thin layer plates (Merck). Running solvent was a mixture of isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and 25% ammonia (6:1:3, by volume). Thin layer plates were air-dried, exposed to a Kodak storage phosphorscreen SO230, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Storm 820, Amersham Biosciences). The position of PCr in thin layer chromatograms was identified in control experiments using recombinant brain-type BB-CK incubated in the presence of radioactive [14C]creatine and cold ATP. Mouse liver mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated in standard medium at pH 7.4 with 5 mm glutamate and 2.5 mm malate and without rotenone. Specified amounts of recombinant brain-type BB-CK or ubiquitous human mtCK (prepared as described elsewhere (26Eder M. Schlattner U. Becker A. Wallimann T. Kabsch W. Fritz-Wolf K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2258-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Eder M. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Proteins. 2000; 39: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) were added. After a 5-min incubation, an aliquot of the suspension was removed (to measure total CK activity). The rest was centrifuged (5 min at 7000 × g) to separate mitochondria. CK activity was measured separately in the supernatants and mitochondrial pellets by a coupled enzymatic assay (28Wallimann T. Turner D.C. Eppenberger H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 75: 297-317Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mitochondrial adenine nucleotide content was measured by reversed phase chromatography of acid extracts according to Kay et al.(25Kay L. Nicolay K. Wieringa B. Saks V. Wallimann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6937-6944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To correlate the effects of the different creatine kinase substrates on MPT pore opening with their ability to stimulate oxidative phosphorylation, we first measured stimulation of state 3 respiration by ATP and CK substrates in mitochondria oxidizing succinate. The data of these experiments are summarized in TableI. In mtCK containing mitochondria from transgenic mice, substantial stimulation (about 3-fold over state 4) was observed only with Cr and CyCr (both 10 mm), but not with GPA, in the presence of externally added ATP, due to endogenous production of ADP by mitochondrial CK. The absence of a detectable stimulation with 10 mm GPA agrees with the inability of mitochondrial CK to phosphorylate this creatine analog (29Clark J.F. Khuchua Z. Kuznetsov A.V. Vassil'eva E. Boehm E. Radda G.K. Saks V. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Boehm E.A. Radda G.K. Tomlin H. Clark J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). No Cr- or CyCr-stimulated respiration was seen with mitochondria from control mice, which do not express mtCK in liver (17O'Gorman E. Beutner G. Dolder M. Koretsky A.P. Brdiczka D. Wallimann T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These data confirm earlier findings with the same substrates given to heart mitochondria (30Boehm E.A. Radda G.K. Tomlin H. Clark J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In general, with respect to creatine-stimulated respiration, mitochondria from transgenic liver-mtCK mice are behaving comparably to mtCK containing heart mitochondria (see also Ref. 17O'Gorman E.

Next, we measured, in transgenic mtCK-liver mitochondria, the opening of the permeability transition pore induced by Ca2+ in the presence of CK substrates, but in the complete absence of external adenine nucleotides, and under different of conditions. To avoid any effects caused by adenylate kinase activity, the specific adenylate kinase inhibitor Ap5A was included in the medium in all experiments. In the experiments shown in Fig.1A, mitochondria were energized with glutamate and malate in the absence of rotenone. Due to the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ (but no EGTA) in the medium, a rather high (120 μm) Ca2+ pulse had to be administered to overcome MPT inhibition by magnesium. As shown in Fig. 1A, Cr and CyCr effectively inhibited pore opening within the time frame of the experiment. In the absence of CK substrates or with GPA present, MPT pore opening occurred in a significant fraction of the mitochondrial population. These effects of CK substrates were independent, at least qualitatively, on how the MPT was triggered and of the respiratory substrates used as documented in Fig. 1, B and C. In the experiments shown in Fig.1B, mitochondria were again energized with complex I substrates (glutamate and malate), but exposed to only 40 μm Ca2+ (which did not open the MPT per se). Subsequent depolarization with 0.2 μm FCCP led to rapid swelling of the mitochondria, both in the absence and presence of CK substrates. Swelling was again sensitive to CsA, as well as to 50 μm ubiquinone 0, a novel and general MPT inhibitor (not shown) (31Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), indicating opening of the MPT pore. Remarkably, however, Cr and CyCr exerted MPT protection in a significant subpopulation of mitochondria even in the absence of external adenine nucleotides and under these very strongly pore-promoting conditions (absence of EGTA, high phosphate, depolarization of mitochondria by FCCP, and presence of complex I substrates). Again, GPA did not protect mitochondria from MPT pore opening. Fig. 1C shows the same set of experiments but with succinate-energized mitochondria in the presence of rotenone. Here, the same qualitative conclusions can be drawn as from the data presented in Fig. 1, A and B. In accordance with the finding of Fontaine et al. (32Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), conditions are more restrictive for MPT pore opening with complex II-linked substrates due to decreased electron flux through complex I, a general property of the MPT. With succinate as the electron donor, Cr and CyCr, but not GPA, fully protected from MPT pore opening. Next we analyzed MPT protection by creatine at different calcium concentrations. In the experiments displayed in Fig. 1D, the Mg2+ concentration was reduced to 0.5 mm to compare better the effect of Cr as a function of the calcium load. Under these conditions, 30 μm Ca2+ did not open the MPT pore if Cr was present. Pore opening was, however, observed at higher Ca2+ concentrations (90 and 150 μm, solid curves in Fig. 1D). Nevertheless, Cr still inhibited significant fractions of mitochondria when compared with conditions without Cr but equal Ca2+concentrations (dashed curves in Fig. 1D). Based on these observations and the data presented in Table I, we suggested that the protective effect on MPT pore opening seen with Cr and CyCr as compared with GPA could be related to the kinetic properties of these substrates, i.e. their rate of phosphorylation by mtCK. In contrast to GPA, Cr and CyCr are rapidly converted by mtCK via ATP to their respective phosphorylated compounds, PCr and CyPCr (30Boehm E.A. Radda G.K. Tomlin H. Clark J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1274: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). If substrate phosphorylation by mtCK (with internally available ATP) were responsible for the observed effects, protection of MPT by Cr and CyCr should have been abolished under conditions where CK is inactive as an enzyme. As there is no absolutely specific CK inhibitor available, we omitted Mg2+ instead, which is an essential cofactor for the CK reaction (33Gross M. Wallimann T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13933-13940Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), from the medium. With no Mg2+ present, creatine-stimulated respiration with ATP was almost completely absent as shown in Fig.2A (compare slopes atarrow in trace a with that of trace b). Importantly, in the absence of exogenous Mg2+, state 3 respiration was still observed after addition of ADP (disodium salt, Fig. 2A, trace a) indicating that sufficient matrix Mg2+ is available for phosphorylation of ADP by F0F1-ATP synthase, but this Mg2+ is not accessible to mtCK located in the intermembrane space. As shown in Fig. 2B, in the absence of Mg2+, mitochondrial swelling induced by 20 μmCa2+ and 0.2 μm FCCP occurred to the same extent regardless of whether CK substrates were present or not, in contrast to what was observed in the presence of Mg2+ (see the corresponding traces in Fig. 1B). MPT pore opening, however, was still fully blocked by 1 μm CsA, even in the absence of Mg2+. In a further set of experiments, we analyzed the effect of Mg2+ and Cr on MPT in more detail by varying the concentrations of these substrates and measuring mtCK activity under identical conditions. Representative swelling measurements at two different Mg2+ concentrations with (solid curves) and without (dashed curves) Cr are displayed in Fig. 3A. From such curves we determined the absorption difference (ΔA540) before and 4 min after triggering the MPT with 120 μmCa2+ (same conditions as in the experiments of Fig.1A). The ΔA540 values were used to calculate the fraction of swollen mitochondria with reference to the ΔA540 measured with 5 μm of the channel-forming peptide alamethicin, which resulted in (not MPT-caused) swelling of 100% of the mitochondria (not shown). As shown in Fig.3C, the fraction of swollen mitochondria, i.e.the fraction having undergone a permeability transition, decreased at increasing Mg2+ concentrations, also in the absence of Cr (open circles in Fig. 3C). This was to be expected, as the MPT is regulated by an external inhibitory Me2+-binding site (34Bernardi P. Veronese P. Petronilli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1005-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the presence of 10 mm Cr, an additional protection starting at around 0.5 mm Mg2+ is observed (closed circlesin Fig. 3C). At this Mg2+ concentration, mtCK activity, as measured in the pH-stat in the forward reaction with ATP plus Cr, was at about 70% of the maximum value (open triangles in Fig. 3C). Therefore, MPT protection by Cr shows up at relatively high Mg2+ concentrations only (>0.5 mm) with corresponding high mtCK activities. A similar analysis carried out by variation of the Cr concentration at constant [Mg2+] (2 mm) revealed that MPT protection by Cr is clearly a function of mtCK activity (Fig. 3, B andD). These data are in strong support of the idea that the rate of phosphorylation of CK substrates by active mtCK is related to their effect on MPT. Phosphorylation of these CK substrates occurs in microcompartments formed by mtCK and ANT (see below) (35Saks V.A. Veksler V.I. Kuznetsov A.V. Kay L. Sikk P. Tiivel T. Tranqui L. Olivares J. Winkler K. Wiedemann F. Kunz W.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 81-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because we did not add external adenine nucleotides, phosphorylation must occur via internally available ATP inside mitochondria, suggesting continuous cycling of internal ADP and ATP between matrix and intermembrane space mediated by ANT, if Cr or CyCr are present. As a consequence, if Cr is present, we should expect a net production of PCr even in the absence of exogenously added adenine nucleotides. This is indeed the case as shown in Fig. 4A. Mitochondria were incubated in the presence of 32Pi, Mg2+, and 10 mm creatine. Only with energized mitochondria and fully active mtCK, as well as with a working oxidative phosphorylation system, we could observe a generation of PCr (Fig. 4,lane a). These are exactly the conditions used in the swelling experiments where MPT protection by Cr was observed (Fig. 1). With de-energized mitochondria (Fig. 4, no substrate, lane b), blocked ANT (20 μm atractyloside,lane d), or blocked F0F1-ATP synthase (1 μm oligomycin, lane e), no PCr was produced. Note in lane c (absence of Mg2+), some PCr is still generated due to residual Mg2+ (probably bound to mtCK). Fig. 4B shows a time course experiment of net PCr production by energized mitochondria in the presence of external Cr plus Mg2+, but no adenine nucleotides. The measured adenine nucleotide content is 0.11 ± 0.01 nmol per 25 μg of isolated mitochondria from transgenic liver-mtCK mice. After a 40-min incubation of succinate-energized mitochondria, 2.85 nmol of PCr were produced by 25 μg of mitochondria (Fig. 4B). Recalling that one ATP is consumed for every molecule of PCr produced, we can estimate that this is over 25 times more than the measured adenine nucleotide content. This quantitative consideration is a strong argument for internal nucleotide cycling. Mitochondrial CK forms a microcompartment with ANT at the contact sites (together with outer membrane porin), as well as along the cristae (with ANT only (36Wegmann G. Huber R. Zanolla E. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. Differentiation. 1991; 46: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Schlattner U. Forstner M. Eder M. Stachowiak O. Fritz-Wolf K. Wallimann T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 184: 125-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). This compartmentation allows efficient transphosphorylation of ATP to PCr and export of the latter to the cytosol at peripheral contact sites. The reaction product ADP is fed back via ANT to the matrix for rephosphorylation resulting in an overall lowering of the apparent Km values of ADP for oxidative phosphorylation (38Saks V.A. Kuznetsov A.V. Khuchua Z.A. Vasilyeva E.V. Belikova J.O. Kesvatera T. Tiivel T. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 625-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that microcompartmentation of mtCK and ANT is also responsible for the observed MPT inhibition by Cr and CyCr (48Brustovetsky N. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we measured MPT pore opening in liver mitochondria from control mice lacking mtCK but with exogenously added recombinant human brain-type dimeric CK (BB-CK). Under the conditions used, especially at pH 7.4, this cytosolic isoform does not bind to mitochondrial outer membranes (Fig. 5A). The amount of BB-CK enzyme activity added in these experiments was equivalent to that found (based on mtCK activity) within the mitochondria of transgenic liver-mtCK mice. Under these conditions, no protection of MPT pore opening of control mitochondria with externally added CK by any of the CK substrates was seen, even in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig.5B, shown only for Cr). By contrast, with"

We show here that DLP1, the human homolog of the yeast DNM1and VPS1 genes, plays an important role in peroxisome division in human cells. Disruption of DLP1 function by either RNA interference or overexpressing dominant negativeDLP1 mutants causes a dramatic reduction in peroxisome abundance, although overexpression of functional DLP1 has no effect on peroxisome abundance. Overexpression of PEX11 induces peroxisome division in a multistep process involving elongation of preexisting peroxisomes followed by their division. We find that DLP1 is dispensable for the first phase of this process but essential for the second. Furthermore, we show that DLP1 associates with peroxisomes and that PEX11 overexpression recruits DLP1 to peroxisome membranes. However, we were unable to detect physical interaction between PEX11 and DLP1, and the stoichiometry of PEX11 and peroxisome-associated DLP1 was far less than 1:1. Based on these and other aspects, we propose that DLP1 performs an essential but transient role in peroxisome division and that PEX11 promotes peroxisome division by recruiting DLP1 to peroxisome membranes through an indirect mechanism.

In the case of peroxisomes, little is known about how cells control these competing processes. Peroxisome destruction appears to occur by a specialized form of autophagy (pexophagy) which requires most APG/CVTgenes. In addition to the APG/CVT genes that are involved in general autophagy, some specific factors are required for pexophagy (1Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 303-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Peroxisome formation appears to be even more complex. Many lines of evidence suggest that peroxisomes are formed mainly from preexisting peroxisomes, either by budding or fission, and this may be the predominant mechanism for peroxisome formation (2Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 3Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PEX11 proteins may play a positive role in the division process. In human cells, PEX11-mediated peroxisome division involves three steps: first, the import of PEX11 into the peroxisome membrane; second, the elongation of peroxisomes and the segregation of PEX11 proteins away from other peroxisomal membrane proteins, forming PEX11-enriched patches; and third, the division of elongated peroxisome tubules into multiple, small peroxisome vesicles (12Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol.

However, the biochemical activities of PEX11 proteins remain obscure, and there is as yet no mechanistic model for PEX11-induced peroxisome division. There may also be species-specific differences in PEX11 function because mammalian cells express at least three distinct PEX11 genes, whereasSaccharomyces cerevisiae has a single PEX11 gene (18Li X. Baumgart E. Dong G.X. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Valle D. Smith K.D. Gould S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8226-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently, Hoepfner et al. (19Hoepfner D. van den Berg M. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) reported that the yeast dynamin-related GTPase, Vps1p, is also involved in peroxisome division. Yeast vps1 null mutants contain only one or two large peroxisomes and cannot increase peroxisome abundance under conditions that normally induce PEX11 expression and promote peroxisome division (19Hoepfner D. van den Berg M. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To test whether a similar process exists in mammalian cells and to determine further whether this is related to PEX11-mediated peroxisome division, we studied the role of human DLP1 in peroxisome biogenesis. DLP1 is the human gene most similar to two of three dynamin-like proteins found in yeast, Vps1p and Dnm1p. DLP1 is also known to regulate the dynamics of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (20Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4403-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We report here that a reduction in DLP1 activity inhibits peroxisome division and reduces peroxisome abundance. Furthermore, we provide evidence that PEX11 overexpression recruits DLP1 to peroxisomes, providing a potential mechanism for PEX11-induced peroxisome division.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have been described. The plasmids expressing COOH-terminal 3×HA-tagged PEX11α, PEX11औ, PEX11γ, and PMP34 were created by inserting above four full-length genes into a modified pcDNA3-3×HA vector (4South S.T. Sacksteder K.A. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1345-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3-PMP34VSVG was cloned by inserting full-lengthPMP34 gene upstream (in-frame with) of a VSVG epitope in a modified pcDNA3-VSVG vector (4South S.T. Sacksteder K.A. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1345-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The human DLP1 gene was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR against the total RNA of human fibroblasts with a primer (DLP1-RT: 5′-CCACATGAGCAGATTCATACC-3′) designed according to the 3′-untranslated region of human DLP1 cDNA for reverse transcription and two DLP1-specific primers (DLP1-5′, 5′-CCCCTCGAGGGAGGCGCTAATTCCTGTCATAAAC-3′, and DLP1-3′, 5′-CACCGCGGCCGCTCACCAAAGATGAGTCTCCCGG-3′) for PCR. The resulting PCR products were then digested with XhoI-NotI and cloned downstream of (in-frame with) a c-myc epitope in a modified pcDNA3-Nmyc vector. Plasmids from various colonies were sequenced, and three isoforms of DLP1 (DLP1 aform, b form, and c form, see Fig. 9) have been identified in fibroblasts. The full-length DLP1 gene was cloned by inserting the deleted nucleotides into the DLP1cby PCR. The dominant negative forms of DLP1(DLP1S39N and DLP1T59A) were created by PCR site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides DLP1-5′ and DLP1S39N-3′, 5′-GAAGCAGGTCCCTCCCCACCAGGCTTTCTAGCACTGAGTTCTTTC-3′, and DLP1-5′ and DLP1T59A-3′, 5′-GAGAGGTCTCCGGGCGACAATTCC-3′, respectively. The resulting PCR fragments were then digested withXhoI-PpuMI and XhoI-BsaI, respectively, and used to replace their corresponding sequence in pcDNA3- NmycDLP1. Two affinity-purified rabbit anti-DLP1 peptide antibodies anti-DLP1MID and anti-DLP1N were provided by Dr. McNiven (Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN) (20Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Antiserum against the COOH-terminal 16 amino acids of DLP1 (anti-DLP1C) was generated by injecting rabbits with ovalbumin (Pierce) coupled peptide NH2-CKQGASQIIAEIRETHLW-COOH. Sheep antibodies against PMP70 and rabbit antibodies against PEX13 have been described (4South S.T. Sacksteder K.A. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1345-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies to the c-myc epitope were obtained from the tissue culture supernatant of the hybridoma 1–9E10 (24Evan G.E. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to the c-myc epitope and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies coupled to agarose beads were obtained from the Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Secondary antibodies specific for sheep, rabbit, and mouse antibodies were obtained from commercial sources. An immortalized wild type human skin fibroblast GM5756-Ti and the wild type and PEX11औ-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (14Li X. Baumgart E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Valle D. Gould S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4358-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were cultured under standard conditions (25Slawecki M. Dodt G. Steinberg S. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All transfections were performed by electroporation (26Chang C.C. Lee W.H. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in 37 formaldehyde in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.1 (DPBS, Invitrogen), for 20 min and then permeabilized in 25 ॖg/ml digitonin in DPBS for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min, washed extensively in DPBS, incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 10 min, washed extensively in DPBS, and mounted on slides. Peroxisome abundance in fibroblasts was determined as described previously (17Li X. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To knock down the expression of DLP1 in fibroblasts by RNA interference, two pairs of DLP1gene-specific 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) (sense strand: DLP1·siRNA1, 5′-UAGCUGCGGTGAACCCGUGdTdT-3′; and DLP1·siRNA2, 5′-CCAACCACAGGCAACUGGAdTdT-3′) and one pair of controlPXR2 siRNA (sense strand: PXR2·siRNA, 5′-GCAGGGAAAAGGCUCUAGGdTdT-3′) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) and annealed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. 50 ॖl of 20 ॖm siRNA duplexes was then transfected into fibroblasts from one confluent T-75 flask by electroporation (26Chang C.C. Lee W.H. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the DLP1 protein level and peroxisome morphology and abundance were analyzed at various time points by immunoblot and indirect immunofluorescence, respectively. To examine the peroxisome proliferating activity of PEX11औ in siRNA duplex-treated cells, fibroblasts were first transfected withDLP1 or PXR2 siRNA duplexes and cultured for 24 h, then transfected with PEX11औ expression vector pcDNA3-PEX11औmyc together with another dose of siRNA duplexes. Cells were then cultured for an additional 48 h before analyzing the peroxisome abundance and morphology. To study the association of DLP1 with peroxisomes, fibroblasts expressing the COOH-terminal 3×HA-tagged or VSVG-tagged PMP34 in combination with mycDLP1aT59A were harvested by scraping in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by passing through a 22-gauge syringe needle five times. Lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 15 min to pellet large organelles. The resulting supernatant was diluted in TBS buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture). Immunoprecipitation was initiated by adding 15 ॖl of a 507 slurry of anti-HA monoclonal antibodies coupled to agarose beads into 500 ॖl of the above supernatant together with 17 bovine serum albumin. The mixture was then incubated with mixing at 4 °C for 2 h, and anti-HA beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation, washed five times with 1 ml of TBS, and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. The supernatant and corresponding immunoprecipitate sample were then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with anti-myc polyclonal antibodies. To study the possible interaction between PEX11 proteins as well as that between PEX11 and DLP1, fibroblasts expressing the appropriate proteins were lysed by incubation with mixing in TBS buffer plus 17 Triton X-100 or 0.27 digitonin at 4 °C for 1 h. Lysates were then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min to pellet cellular membranes. The resulting supernatant was diluted into TBS buffer with detergent and 17 bovine serum albumin. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by adding either 15 ॖl of a 507 slurry of anti-HA beads or 20 ॖl of a 507 slurry of protein A-agarose (Sigma) plus 10 ॖl of 200 ॖg/ml anti-myc polyclonal antibodies and incubating with mixing at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then pelleted, washed extensively 3 × 1 ml with TBS buffer with detergent, 3 × 1 ml with high salt TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 350 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture with detergent), and 3 × 1 ml with TBS buffer. The beads were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer, separated together with corresponding supernatant by SDS-PAGE, and probed with either anti-myc polyclonal antibodies or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies. To study the association of DLP1 with peroxisomes, fibroblasts expressing PMP34myc or PEX11औmyc were harvested by trypsin digestion, washed with PBS buffer once and with homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) once. Then the cells were resuspended in 1.2 ml of homogenization buffer with Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture and homogenized by five passes through a precision ball-bearing homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged for 30 s at 1,500 × g to yield a postnuclear supernatant. The resulting postnuclear supernatant was loaded on top of 10.0 ml of linear 15–427 nycodenz gradient with a cushion of 1.5 ml of maxidenz and centrifuged at 4 °C for 25 min at 137,500 × g. 0.75-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for catalase activity and succinate dehydrogenase activity as described (27Mihalik S.J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1992; 357: 239-244Google Scholar). Yeast strains used in this study were based on S. cerevisiae strain BY4733 (MATa, his3Δ200, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, trp1Δ63, ura3Δ0). The strain XLY1 (pex11Δ) was generated as described previously (17Li X. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The XLY3 strain (vps1Δ) was generated by one-step PCR-mediated disruption of the VPS1gene in BY4733 using HIS3 as the selectable maker (28Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). The strain XLY4 (pex11Δ, vps1Δ) was generated from XLY1 by one-step PCR-mediated disruption of the VPS1 gene usingHIS3 as the selectable maker. Plasmid transformations were performed using the LiOAc procedure (29Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). All strain were cultured in minimal S medium (0.177 yeast nitrogen base w/o ammonium sulfate (Sigma), 0.57 ammonium sulfate) with 27 glucose, 17 galactose, or 0.27 oleic acid or 0.027 Tween 40 as carbon source. Media were supplemented with amino acids, uracil, and adenine as required (29Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). The observation that yeast Vps1p participates in peroxisome membrane division suggested that the human ortholog of Vps1p could have a similar role. However, the human DLP1 gene product, which is the human protein that shows the greatest sequence similarity withS. cerevisiae Vps1p, shares even greater similarity withS. cerevisiae Dnm1p, a yeast protein that regulates mitochondrial division and endosome dynamics but has no discernible role in peroxisome division (19Hoepfner D. van den Berg M. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 30Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human DLP1 has been shown previously to regulate mitochondrion division and endoplasmic reticulum dynamics (20Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4403-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), indicating that it might share more functional similarity with Dnm1p than with Vps1p. Therefore, it was essential to empirically determine whether human DLP1 has a role in peroxisome biogenesis. We first attempted to reduce DLP1 mRNA and DLP1 protein levels using small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for theDLP1 message. Two pairs of DLP1 siRNA duplexes (DLP1· siRNA1 and DLP1·siRNA2) and a control siRNA of a nonperoxisomal gene PXR2 (PXR2·siRNA) were designed according to Elbashir et al. (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). After annealing, they were transfected into an immortalized human skin fibroblast cell line (5756-Ti) by electroporation. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C and processed for immunoblot and indirect immunofluorescence analyses at various times after transfection. DLP1 is known to have multiple isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing of the initial DLP1 transcript (20Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 33Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our immunoblot analysis indicated that at least two different isoforms were present in fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). The immunoblot results also confirmed that both DLP1·siRNA duplexes were able to reduce DLP1 protein level, and the maximal reduction (to 30–407 of normal level) was reached by day 4 after transfection (Fig. 1A). Control PXR2·siRNA, on the other hand, had no effect on the DLP1 protein level (Fig. 1A). Given that the transfection efficiency is typically about 80–907 for the siRNA duplex in these cells, DLP1 protein levels are likely to be even lower than 307 of normal level in those cells that took up the siRNA to DLP1. As expected, peroxisome abundance in untransfected cells (141 ± 46 pps) was similar to that of cells transfected with the control siRNA (138 ± 46 pps) (Fig.1B). However, cells transfected with the DLP1·siRNA contained fewer peroxisomes (58 ± 23 pps). Furthermore, the morphology of peroxisomes in these cells was quite atypical, with peroxisomes in these cells having a long, tubular morphology (Fig. 1,E and F) compared with the small, punctuate morphology of normal peroxisomes (Fig. 1, C andD). Control experiments with antibodies to the peroxisomal matrix enzyme catalase indicated that peroxisomal protein import was unaffected even in the cells with the most severe reductions of peroxisome abundance (data not shown). As an independent test of DLP1 involvement in peroxisome division, we expressed wild type and dominant negative DLP1 mutants in human fibroblasts and assessed their effects on peroxisome abundance. DLP1 shares a high degree of sequence similarity with dynamin, especially in the amino-terminal tripartite GTP binding motif. Previous studies have identified two dominant negative dynamin genetic mutants that exhibit reduced GTP binding affinity (S45N) and reduced GTP hydrolysis activity (T65A), respectively (32Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We therefore generated the corresponding mutations in the DLP1 cDNA (S39N and T59A, respectively). Amino-terminally myc-tagged forms of wild type DLP1a (one of several DLP1 isoforms generated by alternative splicing (20Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 33Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) and each of these single substitution mutants of DLP1a were transfected into human fibroblasts. Four days after transfection each cell population was processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for the myc epitope tag and PMP70, an integral peroxisomal membrane protein marker. Peroxisome abundance in cells expressing wild type DLP1a (123 ± 46 pps) was similar to that in untransfected cells (141 ± 46 pps) (Fig. 2A, compare first two bars, p = 0.194, Student's ttest), and the overexpressed, myc-tagged form of DLP1a appeared to be largely cytosolic (Fig. 2, B and C). On the other hand, the peroxisome abundance was reduced (71 ± 37 pps) (Fig.2A, p < 0.001, Student's ttest) in cells expressing the DLP1aS39N mutant, which has a reduced affinity for GTP (32Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Similar to the DLP1 RNA interference cells, some of the DLP1aS39N-expressing cells have only a couple of giant, reticular peroxisomes (Fig. 2, D and E). This DLP1a mutant appeared to be primarily cytosolic like wild type protein (Fig. 2D). Overexpression of the DLP1aT59A mutant also reduced peroxisome abundance in these cells (83 ± 26 pps) (Fig.2A, p = 0.011, Student's ttest). However, this DLP1 mutant appeared to be associated principally with small punctuate structures, few if any of which appeared to be peroxisomes (Fig. 2, F and G). Previous studies of dynamin and DLP1 have indicated that these large GTPases may act as “pinchases,” promoting vesicle budding and organelle fission by contracting membrane tubules (34Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35McNiven M.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 151-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). If applied to peroxisome division, this model would predict that DLP1 physically associates with peroxisomes during their division. To test for DLP1 association of peroxisomes, we generated rabbit antibodies (DLP1C) against the COOH-terminal 16 amino acids of DLP1 and used them for immunofluorescence analysis. Under normal conditions, the endogenous DLP1 proteins localize in small cytoplasmic vesicles in fibroblasts (Fig. 3, B andE). Although the majority of DLP1-positive vesicles were nonperoxisomal, a small subpopulation of DLP1-positive vesicles also overlapped with the peroxisomal membrane marker protein PMP70 (Fig.3C, indicated by arrowheads). To examine the association of DLP1 with peroxisomes during the division process, we took advantage of the fact that overexpression of PEX11 proteins induces peroxisome division. We overexpressed myc-tagged PEX11औ protein in fibroblasts and then used antibodies specific for DLP1 (DLP1C) and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to detect DLP1 localization. We also used the antibodies to PMP70 and the myc epitope to label peroxisomes. Under these conditions, more DLP1 was colocalized with peroxisomes, and some DLP1 signals were aligned along the elongated peroxisome tubules prior to their division (Fig.3F, indicated by arrowheads). Given that PEX11-mediated peroxisome division appears to involve multiple stages, particularly peroxisome elongation and subsequent division (12Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29607-29614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 17Li X. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), these observations suggest that DLP1 associates with peroxisomes prior to or during the division process. However, this interaction is likely to be transient because the majority of DLP1 does not overlap with peroxisomes. We next asked whether we could collect biochemical evidence for peroxisome-associated DLP1. We transfected 5756-Ti cells with a plasmid designed to express mycDLP1T59A, a dominant ne"

To define the set of insulin-regulated genes in human skeletal muscle, we analyzed the global changes in mRNA levels during a 3-h hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp in vastus lateralis muscle of six healthy subjects.

To perform these actions insulin modifies the activity and the subcellular location of key regulatory enzymes and proteins, often by affecting their phosphorylation state (1Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin also controls the amount of numerous proteins, in part by acting at the level of mRNA translation and mainly at the level of their gene expression (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Over the past 15 years, the regulation of gene expression by insulin has been recognized as a major effect of the hormone, and about 150 insulin-regulated genes have been reported (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). However, the identification of insulin-regulated genes has been mostly performed in cell culture experiments and using animal models (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Little is known about the transcriptional changes induced in vivo by insulin in human tissues, particularly in skeletal muscle, the main site of insulin-dependent glucose disposal and the major site of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although it has been demonstrated that insulin can modulate the mRNA levels of some important genes in human skeletal muscle, such as hexokinase II, Glut4, p85α phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or lipoprotein lipase (3Pendergrass M. Koval J. Vogt C. Yki-Jarvinen H. Iozzo P. Pipek R. Ardehali H. Printz R. Granner D. DeFronzo R.A. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Andersen P.H.

Vidal H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), most of these studies were focused on a small number of selected genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism (5Laville M. Auboeuf D. Khalfallah Y. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Ducluzeau P.H. Perretti N. Laville M. Andreelli F. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1134-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and did not give a global view of insulin action on gene expression. It is likely that insulin coordinates a complex program of transcriptional changes in target tissues, which represents the molecular basis of its action. Hence, the characterization of this global pattern of modifications in skeletal muscle is an important step for a better understanding of the mechanism of action of insulin and of its defects in situations of insulin resistance. The development of microarray technology offers powerful tools for characterizing such large scale changes in transcript levels. Recently, this methodology was applied to investigate the effects of intensive insulin treatment for 10 days on the mRNA profile in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients (7Sreekumar R. Halvatsiotis P. Schimke J.C. Nair K.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays allowing the analysis of 6800 mRNAs, the expression of about 100 genes was found to be modified during insulin therapy (7Sreekumar R. Halvatsiotis P. Schimke J.C. Nair K.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). With a similar methodology, it was also demonstrated that 3 days of insulin treatment induced changes in the abundance of about 100 mRNAs in streptozotocin diabetic mice, suggesting a coordinated regulation of gene expression by insulin in skeletal muscle (8Yechoor V.K. Patti M.E Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, it was difficult to conclude on the direct role of insulin on gene expression in these two studies because the observed modifications could be the consequences of the metabolic changes that occurred during the treatment with insulin. To determine the global transcriptional modifications directly produced by insulin in human skeletal muscle, we used cDNA microarrays (9Clement K. Viguerie N. Diehn M. Alizadeh A. Barbe P. Thalamas C. Storey J.D. Brown P.O. Barsh G.S. Langin D. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) to analyze the changes in the mRNA levels of 29,308 genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs)1 induced by 3 h of euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in the vastus lateralis muscle of healthy lean subjects. It is well accepted that the hyperinsulinemic clamp method allows the individual effect of insulin to be studied, and the short duration of the insulin infusion was chosen to limit possible secondary effects due to metabolic modifications. Rapid changes in the mRNA levels of candidate genes have been previously reported in human skeletal muscle during similar euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp conditions (5Laville M. Auboeuf D. Khalfallah Y. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Ducluzeau P.H. Perretti N. Laville M. Andreelli F. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1134-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We report here that insulin directly modulates the mRNA levels of about 800 genes in human muscle. Most of them are novel targets of the hormone and belong to functional classes that can account for most of the biological and metabolic effects of insulin in human skeletal muscle. Twelve lean healthy Caucasian volunteers (4 men and 9 women) with a mean (±S.E.) age of 32 ± 4 years and a body mass index of 22.2 ± 0.6 kg/m2 participated in the study. None had a familial or personal history of diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, or hypertension, and they were not taking medication except for oral contraceptives. They were on their usual diet before the study, and none was engaged in heavy exercise. All subjects gave written consent after being informed of the nature, purpose, and possible risks of the study. The experimental protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Hospices Civils de Lyon (France). All studies were performed in the postabsorptive state after an overnight fast. The volunteers were submitted to a 3-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with an insulin infusion rate of 2 milliunits·min−1·kg−1, as described previously (5Laville M. Auboeuf D. Khalfallah Y. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Percutaneous biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle was obtained with a Weil Blakesley plier before and after 3 h of insulin infusion (5Laville M. Auboeuf D. Khalfallah Y. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Average muscle samples of 63 ± 4 mg (wet weight) were obtained, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until total RNA preparation. Frozen tissue samples were crushed in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was extracted with the guanidinium thiocyanate method (5Laville M. Auboeuf D. Khalfallah Y. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). RNA concentrations and integrity were assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France). The mean yield of total RNA was 0.28 ± 2 μg/mg of muscle (wet weight) and was not different for the biopsies taken before and after the clamp. RNA preparations from 6 subjects (2 men, 4 women) were amplified using the MessageAmp antisense RNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) in order to generate probe for hybridization to the cDNA microarrays. Briefly, the procedure consists of reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA with a oligo(dT) primer bearing a T7 promoter sequence followed byin vitro transcription of the resulting DNA with T7 RNA polymerase to generate antisense RNA copies of each mRNA (10Wang E. Miller L.D. Ohnmacht G.A. Liu E.T. Marincola F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 16: 457-459Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar). This amplification procedure, now largely accepted, has been validated before, and it has been demonstrated that it does not distort the relative abundance of individual mRNAs within an RNA population (10Wang E. Miller L.D. Ohnmacht G.A. Liu E.T. Marincola F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 16: 457-459Crossref Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 11Baugh L.R. Hill A. Brown E.L. Hunter C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2-9Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Ten μg of antisense RNA from basal and insulin-treated conditions of each of the six subjects were labeled with cyanine (Cy) 3 or Cy5 dyes during a random-primed reverse transcription reaction using the CyScribe First-Strand cDNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). They were hybridized overnight at 65 °C to the cDNA microarray according to the protocol recommended by the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility (www.microarray.org/sfgf/jsp/home.jsp). The cDNA microarrays consisted of PCR-amplified cDNAs printed on glass slides with 42,557 spots representing 29,308 UniGene clusters. The six slides were scanned with a GenePix 4000A microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), and the images were analyzed using Genepix pro 3 software. Data files were entered into the Stanford Microarray Data base (genome-www5.stanford.edu/MicroArray/SMD). A uniform scale factor was applied to normalized signal intensities between Cy5 and Cy3. Flagged spots and spots with an average intensity below 2.5-fold above the background were not retained for further analysis. The log2(Cy5/Cy3) ratio of the other spots was calculated for each slide. To compare the results from the different subjects, data from each slide were normalized in log space to have a mean of 0 and a S.D. of 1 by using the Cluster program (46Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13235) Google Scholar). Only cDNAs with recorded data on the six slides were then selected for further analysis. At this stage, 16,140 spots were recovered. Genes with significant changes in mRNA levels in response to insulin were identified using the Significant Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) procedure (12Tusher G.V. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9775) Google Scholar), a validated statistical technique for identifying differentially expressed genes across high density microarrays. This procedure provides a list of “significant” genes and an estimate of the false discovery rate, which represents the percentage of genes that could be identified by chance (9Clement K. Viguerie N. Diehn M. Alizadeh A. Barbe P. Thalamas C. Storey J.D. Brown P.O. Barsh G.S. Langin D. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12Tusher G.V. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9775) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNAs were first synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA in the presence of 100 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen) using both random hexamers and oligo(dT) primers (Promega, Charbonnières, France). The real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 5 μl of a 60-fold dilution of the RT reaction and 15 μl of reaction buffer from the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green kit (Roche Diagnostics) with 3 mm MgCl2 and the specific forward and reverse primers (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The list of the primers is available in Table I. After amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed to verify the specificity of the reaction. For quantification, a standard curve was systematically generated with six different amounts (150–30,000 molecules/tube) of purified target cDNA cloned in the pGEM plasmid (Promega). The analysis was performed using the LightCycler software (Roche Diagnostics).Table ISequences of the primers used for mRNA quantitation by real-time RT-PCRTranscript nameUniGene clusterSense primerAntisense primerPPP2R3AHs.28219ACGCTTGTTGCAGAGGAATCTCCAAATTCAGAGGGAGAGGPDE4DHs.172081GACCTCTCTCCAAAGTCTATGTGGATGGTTGGTTGCACATGGCREBBPHs.23592GCCGTTTACCATGAGATCCCAAACGCCTTGTCCAGCATCRYBPHs.7910TCTGAAAGATCCTCCTAGTGCTGTGATAATGACGGTGACGNR5A2Hs.183123CCAGGAGTAGTATCTTCTTCGTACCACTTGTCGGTAAATGFACL2Hs.154890CCATTTGAACAGGTCAAAGGCAGGTCATCTATCTGCGACCTFAT/CD36Hs.75614TGATGATGAACAGCAGCAACATAGACTGTGTTGTCCTCAGCGHK2Hs.198427ATCCCTGAGGACGACATCATGCGATGTCGATGTGGCGCATCTCPIK3R1Hs.6241TGACGCTTTCAAACGCTATCCAGAGAGTACTCTTGCATTC Open table in a new tab To investigate the effect of insulin on gene expression, healthy lean volunteers were submitted to a 3-h euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to achieve supra-physiological plasma insulin concentrations (5Laville M. Auboeuf D. Khalfallah Y. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Ducluzeau P.H. Perretti N. Laville M. Andreelli F. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1134-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Insulinemia increased from 41 ± 3 pm in the basal state to 858 ± 52 pm during the last hour of the clamp. Plasma free fatty acid concentration decreased from 463 ± 64 to 34 ± 4 mm. The glycemia was clamped at 4.6 ± 0.1 mm. The rate of glucose infusion required to maintain euglycemia during the last hour of the clamp was 11.1 ± 0.6 mg·kg−1·min−1, indicating a normal effect of insulin on whole body glucose disposal rate (5Laville M. Auboeuf D. Khalfallah Y. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Ducluzeau P.H. Perretti N. Laville M. Andreelli F. Vega N. Riou J.P. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1134-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Glucose oxidation rate, as determined by indirect calorimetry, rose from 1.3 ± 0.2 mg·kg−1·min−1 before insulin infusion to 3.5 ± 0.2 mg·kg−1·min−1 at the end of the clamp (p < 0.001). Glucose storage, estimated from the non-oxidative glucose disposal rate, was 7.6 ± 0.6 mg·kg−1·min−1 during the last hour of insulin infusion. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken before and at the end of the hyperinsulinemic clamp, and total RNA was prepared from each tissue samples. For cost issue, the cDNA microarray experiments were performed with the RNA preparations from 6 subjects (2 men and 4 women) of the 12 involved in the study. Their characteristics and their metabolic responses during the clamp did not differ from the data of the whole group (data not shown). The cDNA microarrays used in the present work allowed analysis of the changes in mRNA levels of 29,308 genes and ESTs. The SAM procedure (9Clement K. Viguerie N. Diehn M. Alizadeh A. Barbe P.

A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9775) Google Scholar) was performed on 16,140 spots for which signals were recovered in the six experiments. With an estimated false discovery rate of 4%, we found 1,065 cDNAs that were differentially regulated by insulin. As shown in the supplemental table, this procedure selected cDNAs for which the log2(Cy5/Cy3) ratio changed in the same direction on the six slides. This indicated that the corresponding genes were modulated by insulin in the same way in the six subjects. Because of replications of some cDNAs on the microarray, the 1065 cDNAs corresponded to 762 different genes (a list is available in the supplemental table). Of these 762 genes, 478 were up-regulated, and 284 were down-regulated during the 3 h of the hyperinsulinemic clamp. Fig.1 shows that the majority (n = 322) of the up-regulated genes displayed a more than 2-fold change in mRNA levels, as estimated by the mean Cy5 on Cy3 intensity ratio of the 6 experiments. Only 13 increased 4-fold or more. Among the down-regulated genes, 104 displayed a 2-fold or more decrease in expression level. To test the validity of the microarray experiments and the SAM procedure, the changes in mRNA levels of 9 genes were quantified using real-time RT-PCR in muscles of the whole group of subjects who underwent the 3-h hyperinsulinemic clamp. These genes displayed wide differences in their response to insulin on the microarray (from −1.95 to 5.04-fold change) and belong to the 3 main functional categories that were defined to classify the insulin-regulated genes (see “Functional Classification of the Regulated Genes”). As shown in Table II, the changes measured by real-time RT-PCR confirmed the microarray data for all genes except one. The down-regulation of the nuclear receptor NR5A2 observed by microarray was not reproduced by RT-PCR (Table II). However, it should be mentioned that the absolute mRNA level of NR5A2 (about 0.05 amol·μg−1 total RNA) was closed to the lower limit of the RT-PCR assay.Table IIComparison of microarray results with quantitative RT-PCRTranscript nameUniGene cluster-Fold changescDNA microarraysRT-PCRPPP2R3AHs.282192.271.47 ± 0.072-ap < 0.005, using pairedt test.PDE4DHs.1720812.041.58 ± 0.082-ap < 0.005, using pairedt test.CREBBPHs.23592−1.83−1.24 ± 0.072-bp < 0.05, using paired ttest.RYBPHs.79101.581.62 ± 0.082-ap < 0.005, using pairedt test.NR5A2Hs.183123−1.951.62 ± 0.16FACL2Hs.1548904.111.59 ± 0.092-bp < 0.05, using paired ttest.FAT/CD36Hs.756145.041.82 ± 0.162-ap < 0.005, using pairedt test.HK2Hs.1984273.022.92 ± 0.372-ap < 0.005, using pairedt test.PIK3R1Hs.62411.81.97 ± 0.112-ap < 0.005, using pairedt test.The -fold changes in mRNA levels of 10 selected genes were determined by real-time RT-PCR using a LightCycler on total RNA preparations from 12 subjects.

We further verified that the procedures used in the microarray experiment did not select only genes with high expression in muscle. Using the Stanford Online Universal Resource for Clones and ESTs (SOURCE at source.stanford.edu) and the published reconstruction of the human skeletal muscle transcriptional profile (13Pietu G. Mariage-Samson R. Fayein N.A. Matingou C. Eveno E. Houlgatte R. Decraene C. Vandenbrouck Y. Tahi F. Devignes M.D. Wirkner U. Ansorge W. Cox D. Nagase T. Nomura N. Auffray C.

Danieli G.A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we found that 32 of the 762 insulin-regulated genes have been reported to be more expressed in the muscle than in other tissues, with only 6 belonging to the 400 genes considered as highly expressed in skeletal muscle (13Pietu G. Mariage-Samson R. Fayein N.A. Matingou C. Eveno E. Houlgatte R. Decraene C. Vandenbrouck Y. Tahi F. Devignes M.D. Wirkner U. Ansorge W. Cox D. Nagase T. Nomura N. Auffray C.

Conversely, about 150 genes, mostly ESTs with unknown functions, had never been found to be expressed in the skeletal muscle. This suggested that the procedures used in the study did not select genes according to their mRNA expression levels and, thus, allowed to analyze the effect of insulin on the global muscle transcriptome. However, because the analysis was performed in tissue biopsies, it could not be exclude that regulation of gene expression in other cell types than in muscle cells might have contributed to the detected changes. Of the 762 genes that showed a regulation during the hyperinsulinemic clamp, 627 have a known chromosomal location in the data bases (see the supplemental table). No gene was found on chromosome Y due to the fact that women participated in the study and the procedure to select the regulated genes excluded those that did not give a signal in the six experiments. Analysis of the chromosomal location revealed that the insulin-regulated genes are widely distributed among the chromosomes and the number of genes on each chromosome is grossly proportional to the length of the chromosome (e.g. 56 genes located on chromosome 1 and 10 on chromosome 21). It could be noted that 6 regions (5q31, 6p21.3, 12q24, 16p13.3, 17p13.1, and 22q13.2) are characterized by the co-localization of five or more regulated genes. None of these loci has been reported to be linked with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes in genetic studies. However, four of these loci (5q31, 6p21.3, 12q24, 17p13.1) have been linked to physical performance and health-related fitness phenotypes (16Rankinen T. Perusse L. Rauramaa R. Rivera M.A. Wolfarth B. Bouchard C. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 2002; 34: 1219-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Gene ontology annotations, SOURCE and PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were used to assign the regulated genes into functional categories (see the supplemental table for a complete list of the genes and their classification). Of the 762 genes found to be regulated by insulin, 353 (163 up and 190 down) corresponded to ESTs or hypothetical proteins. Among them, 16.5% displayed a more than 2.5-fold increased expression during the clamp and 20.2% displayed a more than 2-fold decreased, suggesting that a number of new insulin-regulated genes will probably emerge from the completion of the genome annotation. Of the 409 genes with known functions, the majority corresponded to genes coding for proteins involved either in the transcriptional and translational regulation (29%), intermediary and energy metabolisms (14%), or in intracellular signaling (12%). Other functional categories consisted of genes involved in cytoskeleton and vesicle traffic (9%), receptors, carriers, and transporters (8%), components of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathways (7%), and the immune response (5.5%). In addition, 63 genes (42 up, 21 down) did not correspond to one of these major categories. Figs. 2 and3 are schematic representations of these main metabolic and functional pathways with indications of the number of up- and down-regulated genes. The different functional groups are discussed in more details below.Figure 3Schematic representations of the effects of insulin on gene expression in skeletal muscle. The main functional categories of the regulated mRNAs are shown. The number of up-regulated genes is indicated with white boxes, and the number of down-regulated genes is indicated with gray boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One of the most remarkable biological effects of insulin is its profound impact on the turnover of cellular proteins mainly through an increase of gene transcription and a stimulation of mRNA translation (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It is, thus, not surprising that the majority of the genes found to be regulated during an acute insulin infusion codes for transcription factors (such as basic transcription factor 3, general transcription factor 2A, polymerase II transcription cofactor 4) and for proteins involved in RNA transport, processing, and translation (splicing factors 1 and 10, karyopherins 1 and 3, eukaryotic translation initiation factors 2 and 3, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1). In addition, the mRNA expression of 14 ribosomal proteins, including 4 of the mitochondria, is markedly induced during the hyperinsulinemic clamp. Insulin also affects the expression of 20 genes coding for chaperones, heat-shock proteins, or enzymes involved in post-translational modifications, hence contributing to the complete process of protein synthesis that generally includes proper protein folding and a number of post-translational modifications. In skeletal muscle, insulin increases the uptake of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids and directs their metabolic fates into specific pathways. The storage of glucose into glycogen and fatty acid into triglycerides is enhanced by insulin, whereas amino acids are mostly used for protein synthesis. Insulin also increases energy metabolism and ATP synthesis mainly by stimulating glucose oxidation, whereas fatty acid oxidation is almost completely inhibited (17Kelley D.E Reilly J.P. Veneman T. Mandarino L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E923-E929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed changes in the gene expression pattern during the hyperinsulinemic clamp are in agreement with these metabolic effects. Hexokinase II catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate after its entry into the muscle cells. Changes in the level and the activity of this key enzyme of glucose metabolism would markedly affect both the glycolytic and the glyconeogenic fluxes. Up-regulation of hexokinase II expression by insulin has been previously reported in human muscle (3Pendergrass M. Koval J. Vogt C. Yki-Jarvinen H. Iozzo P. Pipek R. Ardehali H. Printz R. Granner D.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1134-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition to hexokinase II, the increased expression of glycogenin and the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PPP1G) is in agreement with the stimulation by insulin of glycogen synthesis. Glycogenin is a self-glucosylating protein involved in the initiation of glycogen synthesis (18Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and protein phosphatase 1G is one of the regulatory enzymes controlling glycogen synthase activity (19Lawrence Jr., J.C.

This molecule, secreted in large quantities, interferes with complement function. As a result of natural selection, SIC shows a high degree of variation. Here we provide a plausible explanation for this variation and the fact that strains of the M1 serotype are the most frequent cause of severe invasive S. pyogenes infections. Thus, protein SIC was found to inactivate human neutrophil α-defensin and LL-37, two major antibacterial peptides involved in bacterial clearance. This inactivation protectedS. pyogenes against the antibacterial effect of the peptides. Moreover, SIC isolated from S. pyogenes of the M1 serotype was more powerful in this respect than SIC variants from strains of M serotypes 12 and 55, serotypes rarely connected with invasive infections.

Todd Hewitt broth phosphate-buffered saline colony forming units PBS Tween enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polyvinylidene difluoride Streptococcus pyogenes is one of the most common and important human bacterial pathogens. It causes relatively mild infections such as pharyngitis (strep throat) and impetigo but also serious clinical conditions like rheumatic fever, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, necrotizing fasciitis, septicemia, and a toxic-shock syndrome (1Bisno A.L. Stevens D.L. New Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 2Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). Increases in the number of life-threatening systemic S. pyogenes infections have been reported world-wide since the late 1980s and have attracted considerable attention and concern (3Nowak R. Science. 1994; 264: 1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Stevens D.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 2000; 51: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Based on the highly polymorphic M protein, a surface protein of S. pyogenes (for references see Ref. 5Fischetti V.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), isolates are divided into more than 100 serological subtypes, and systemic infections are most frequently caused by organisms of the M1 serotype (6Musser J.M. Krause R.M. Krause R.M. Emerging Infections. Academic Press, New York1998: 185-218Google Scholar). Protein SIC was originally isolated from the growth medium of an M1 strain (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). All strains of the M1 serotype secrete SIC and so do M57 organisms, whereas strains of 53 other serotypes were found to lack thesic gene (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has identified distantly related sic variants also in M12 and M55 strains (8Hartas J. Sriprakash K.S. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). SIC stands for streptococcal inhibitor ofcomplement, as the protein incorporates into the membrane attack complex of complement and inhibits complement-mediated lysis of sensitized erythrocytes (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This inhibition of membrane attack complex was recently shown to be the result of SIC preventing uptake of C567 onto cell membranes (9Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Willers C. Wurzner R. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Immunology. 2001; 103: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A remarkable property of SIC was reported by Stockbauer et al. (10Stockbauer K.E. Grigsby D. Pan X. Fu Y.X. Mejia L.M. Cravioto A. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3128-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). They found that the sequences of a large number of sic genes from different strains of the M1 serotype showed a unique degree of variation, which is in striking contrast to the lack of M1 protein variation. Moreover, in a mouse model of infection, Hoe et al. (11Hoe N.P. Nakashima K. Lukomski S. Grigsby D. Liu M. Kordari P. Dou S.J. Pan X. Vuopio-Varkila J. Salmelinna S. McGeer A. Low D.E. Schwartz B. Schuchat A. Naidich S. De Lorenzo D. Fu Y.X. Musser J.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) discovered that SIC variants arise rapidly on mucosal surfaces by natural selection. They also reported that the inhibition of complement-mediated lysis by SIC was not affected in the new SIC variants arising from natural selection, suggesting that complement inhibition is not the only function of SIC. Complement belongs to the innate immune system, and antibacterial peptides represent another important part of this defense system. These peptides, originally described in silk worms (12Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), play important roles in the clearance of bacteria at biological boundaries susceptible for infection (for references see reviews in Refs. 13Boman H.G. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 14Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 15Schröder J.-M.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the starting point for this investigation was the hypothesis that SIC, secreted in substantial amounts by S. pyogenes (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), could interfere with the activity of antibacterial peptides. Such a mechanism could help explain the variation of SIC and the high frequency of S. pyogenesinfections caused by strains of the M1 serotype. TheS. pyogenes strains AP1 (40/58) of serotype M1 and AP12 (1/71) of serotype M12 were from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Streptococci, Prague, Czech Republic. The S. pyogenes strain W38 (GT 71–154) of serotype M55 was from the late Dr. L. W. Wannamaker, and the S. pyogenes strains U15 and U17 of serotype M1 were kindly provided by Dr. Stig Holm, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden. Bacteria were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (TH1; Difco) at 37 °C. Protein SIC was purified from the S. pyogenes strains AP1, U15, U17, AP12, and W38 as described (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) by precipitation of the culture medium with 307 ammonium sulfate, followed by ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing protein SIC were combined, dialyzed against 2 mmNH4HCO3 and freeze-dried. For the antimicrobial assay (see below) protein SIC was dissolved in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm glucose. PCR was used to amplify the sicgenes from the S. pyogenes strains U15, U17, AP12, and W38. For serotype M1 strains (U15 and U17), primers were constructed corresponding to the nucleotide sequence starting 72 base pairs upstream (ACCTTTACTAATAATCGTCTTTGTTTTATAATGA) and 179 base pairs downstream (ATCTTTCTCGGACTCAGATAGTCCATAGC) of the coding sequence forsic in the AP1 strain (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For serotype M12 (AP12) and M55 (W38) strains, a forward primer (CATTAACGAAATAATTTATTAAGGAGAG) corresponding to a region upstream of the coding sequence ofsic from AP1 and a reverse primer (CCAATGATAGTCACCAGCAATTCAGG) corresponding to a region downstream of the coding sequence of the distantly related sic from M12 and 55 strains (8Hartas J. Sriprakash K.S. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The PCR products were purified with a High Pure PCR purification kit (Roche Applied Science) and used as templates in sequencing reactions using an ABI PRISM®BigDyeTM dideoxy terminator kit (BigDye terminator version 3.0 cycle sequencing Ready Reaction, Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant M1 protein was prepared as described previously (17Åkesson P. Schmidt K.-H. Cooney J. Björck L. Biochem.

The peptide GCP28, GCPRDIPTNSPELEETLTHTITKLNAEN, based on a sequence in human kininogen has been described previously (18Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W.

Mouse monoclonal α-defensin antibodies were from Bachem AG, and rabbit polyclonal LL-37 antibodies were from Innovagen AB. Antiserum against protein SIC was raised in rabbits. Protein SIC was labeled with 125I using the chloramine T method (19Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar). To inactivate the gene encoding protein SIC, AP1 bacteria were subjected to an allelic replacement mutagenesis strategy. A fragment of the up-stream sph and of the down-stream IS1562 was amplified from AP1 by PCR as described (20Rasmussen M. Müller H.-P. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides hybridizing with nucleotides 486–512 and 1559–1533 in (21Gomi H. Hozumi T. Hattori S. Tagawa C. Kishimoto F. Björck L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4046-4052PubMed Google Scholar) and 516–539 and 1614–1641 in (22Berge A. Rasmussen M. Björck L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3449-3453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides had sites for restriction enzymes that were used to clone the sph product into multiple cloning site I of plasmid pFW13 (23Podbielski A. Spellerberg B. Woischnik M. Pohl B. Lüttiken R. Gene. 1996; 177: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and the IS1562 product into multiple cloning site II to generate pFW13sic−. 20 ॖg of pFW13sic− was electroporated as described (24Hanski E. Fogg G. Tovi A. Okada N. Burstein I. Caparon M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 253: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) into AP1 bacteria. Recombinants were selected on plates containing 150 ॖg/ml kanamycin. One transformant (SIC−) was obtained, and growth media from this strain was incubated with 67 trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g (4 °C for 20 min). Precipitated material was analyzed for SIC content using polyclonal anti-SIC antibodies in Western blot experiments. Total RNA from the AP1 and SIC− strains was isolated at early logarithmic (A620 0.3), late logarithmic (A620 0.6), or early stationary phase (A620 0.8) as described previously (20Rasmussen M. Müller H.-P. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15336-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed as described (20Rasmussen M.

Female NMRI mice weighing ∼25 g were injected subcutaneously with 104 mutant or wild-type bacteria in 100 ॖl of PBS followed by 900 ॖl of air. Mice were observed for 10 days. Statistical analysis of survival time was performed with the Wilcoxin rank sum test. AP1 bacteria were grown to mid-log phase in TH broth, washed, and diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm glucose. 50 ॖl of bacteria (2 × 106 colony forming units (cfu)/ml) were incubated together with α-defensin or LL-37 at various concentrations for 2 h at 37 °C. In subsequent experiments, bacteria were incubated with α-defensin or LL-37 at a concentration of 448 nm together with different concentrations of protein SIC or M1 protein and the reactions were carried out for 2 h (α-defensin) or 1 h (LL-37). To quantitate the bactericidal activity serial dilutions of the incubation mixtures were plated on TH agar, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the number of cfus were determined. AP1 and SIC− bacteria were grown to stationary phase in TH broth. 200 ॖl of TH was inoculated with 5 ॖl of the bacterial suspension in 96-well plates (Falcon) at 37 °C. At early logarithmic phase various amounts of LL-37 was added, and growth was followed by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm (using a BioRad 550 microplate reader). The amount of protein SIC in the growth medium was estimated by ELISA (see below). Peptides were applied to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) using a Milliblot-D system (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in TBS (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 mNaCl) containing 37 bovine serum albumin, incubated with125I-labeled protein SIC for 3 h, and washed with TBS containing 0.057 Tween 20. Autoradiography was carried out using Kodak x-Omat AR films and regular intensifying screens. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using a polyacrylamide concentration of 107 or 127 and 3.37 cross-linking. Samples were boiled for 3 min in sample buffer containing 27 SDS and 57 2-mercaptoethanol. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or subjected to Western blot analysis. Separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using a trans-blot semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with PBS containing 0.057 Tween 20 (PBST) and 57 dry milk powder (blocking buffer), incubated with antibodies against protein SIC (1:1000) in blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with PBST, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG (1:3000) for 30 min at 37 °C. The membranes were washed, and detection of bound antibodies was performed using the chemiluminescence method. Indirect ELISA was performed by coating microtiter plates (Maxisorb, NUNC) overnight with protein SIC or M1 protein at a concentration of 2.9 nm. The plates were washed in PBST, blocked in PBST containing 27 bovine serum albumin for 30 min and incubated with 58 nm α-defensin or LL-37 for 1 h. Bound antibacterial peptides were detected with specific antibodies against α-defensin (1:2000) or LL-37 (1:5000), and binding was visualized by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse or rabbit IgG (1:3000). All incubations were performed at 37 °C for 1 h followed by a washing step. Substrate solution, 0.17 (w/v) diammonium-2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonate, 0.0127 (v/v) H2O2 in 100 mmNaH2PO4, pH 4.5, was added, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was determined after 5 min. To determine the concentration of SIC in growth medium plates coated with AP1 or SIC− growth medium were incubated with antibodies against protein SIC (1:1000) followed by a secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (1:3000). Visualization of binding was detected as above, and absorbance was determined after 15 min. Two major and well characterized human antibacterial peptides, α-defensin (HNP-1) and LL-37, were used in this investigation. These peptides have broad antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. α-defensin (HNP-1) is found in the azurophilic granules of human neutrophils, but analogues to neutrophil α-defensins are produced also by intestinal Paneth cells (26Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 27Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Pesendorfer P. Tanabe H. Wilson C.L. Hagen S.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5219-5228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). LL-37 is produced by neutrophils and epithelial cells. α-defensin and LL-37 are both found in extracellular fluids, including wound fluid, and the two peptides act synergistically on target bacteria (28Nagaoka I. Hirota S. Yomogida S. Ohwada A. Hirata M. Inflamm. Res. 2000; 49: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). InS. pyogenes, the sic gene is part of the so-called mga regulon, and like the other genes of this regulon sic is expressed at an early growth phase (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), suggesting that SIC will be secreted as soon as S. pyogenesbacteria carrying the sic gene start to grow on an epithelial surface. To investigate whether α-defensin and LL-37 have affinity for SIC, these peptides and a control peptide (GCP28) based on a sequence in H-kininogen (18Herwald H. Hasan A.A.K. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14634-14642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were applied to Immobilon filters that were probed with 125I-labeled SIC (if not indicated otherwise SIC is from the M1 strain AP1). Fig.1A shows that SIC interacts with the antibacterial peptides, an observation that was confirmed also by experiments where SIC and M1 protein were applied to plastic wells, followed by the addition of α-defensin or LL-37 and antibodies to the peptides. M1 protein was chosen as a control. It was isolated from the same strain of S. pyogenes (AP1) as SIC (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and although the protein is predominantly associated with the cell wall, it is also released from the bacterial surface by proteolytic cleavage (29Berge A. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9862-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In the experiments summarized in Fig. 1B, α-defensin and LL-37 showed affinity for SIC, whereas the interaction with M1 protein was at background level. Next we investigated the antibacterial effect of α-defensin and LL-37 on the AP1 strain. In these experiments the bacteria were washed and resuspended in buffer prior to the addition of the peptides to exclude that SIC was present during the incubation period. As shown in theleft panel of Fig. 2, the peptides killed the bacteria. The concentration required for 1007 killing was ∼0.4 ॖm for both peptides. The inhibitory effect of SIC was then tested at a bactericidal concentration (0.448 ॖm) of the peptides and the results (see right panel, Fig. 2) show that SIC blocks the antibacterial activity of α-defensin and LL-37. The inhibition curves indicate that SIC is about 10 times more efficient in blocking LL-37 than α-defensin. M1 protein was also tested (at a maximum of 0.72 ॖm) but showed no inhibitory activity. When grown to stationary phase, the growth medium of S. pyogenes of the M1 serotype contains large quantities (10–15 ॖg/ml) of protein SIC (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To inactivate the gene encoding protein SIC, AP1 bacteria were subjected to an allelic replacement mutagenesis strategy. One mutant, SIC−, was obtained, and it secreted minute amounts of protein SIC to the growth medium as compared with wild-type AP1 bacteria (Fig.3A). The expression ofsic from the AP1 and SIC− strains was investigated at different stages of growth using Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression of sic reaches its maximum at late logarithmic growth phase, and no expression was detected at early stationary phase. The same filter was hybridized with a 16 S probe, showing that the same amount of RNA was applied to each well (data not shown). In experiments where the bacteria were washed before the addition of the antibacterial peptide LL-37, the mutant strain SIC− was found to be as sensitive to LL-37 as the wild-type strain AP1 (see Fig. 2, left panel). In a series of experiments we then investigated whether SIC produced by growing M1 bacteria could protect the organisms against LL-37 (these experiments required substantial amounts of antibacterial peptide, and only LL-37 was tested). The wild-type AP1 strain and the mutant strain SIC− were grown to early logarithmic growth phase where the concentration of SIC produced by AP1 bacteria was 0.85 ॖg/ml growth medium as determined by ELISA (Fig. 3C). The secretion of protein SIC by the mutant SIC− was below the detection level (Fig. 3C). At this point different amounts of LL-37 were added. As shown in Fig. 3D, SIC−bacteria were more sensitive to LL-37 as compared with the SIC-producing strain AP1. The concentration of LL-37 required to kill 507 of SIC− bacteria in these experiments was 22.3 ॖm, while at this concentration only 207 of the wild-type bacteria were killed. Lower concentrations of LL-37 killed 207 of SIC− bacteria, but the AP1 strain was unaffected. The amount of protein SIC produced was determined at different time points during growth. While the concentration of SIC produced by AP1 bacteria in this experimental system, reached its maximum (4.75 ॖg/ml) at early stationary phase (6 h), the amount of protein SIC in the growth medium of the mutant strain SIC− was below the level of detection (Fig. 3C). The results suggest that SIC secretion provides protection against antibacterial peptides already at an initial stage of infection. As mentioned, SIC variants are produced by S. pyogenesstrains of M serotypes 1, 12, 55, and 57 (7, 8). Using the same isolation protocol as for SIC from M1 bacteria (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), SIC was purified from the growth medium of M12 and M55 organisms. Analogous to the M1 strain (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the M12 and M55 strains produced 10–15 ॖg of SIC/ml of growth medium when grown to stationary phase. Protein SIC was also purified from two additional strains of the M1 serotype, U15 and U17. The purified variants shown in Fig.4A were tested for their ability to interfere with the antibacterial activity of α-defensin and LL-37. As shown in Fig. 4B, all SIC variants, but not M1 protein, blocked the activity of the peptides. The inhibition curves show that SICM1 is 5–100 times more potent in this respect than the protein SIC variants from the M12 and M55 strains. To investigate a possible molecular basis for this difference in inhibitory activity, sequencing of the genes encoding the SIC variants was performed. As mentioned, there is a high degree of variation among sicgenes from different strains of the M1 serotype (10Stockbauer K.E. Grigsby D. Pan X. Fu Y.X. Mejia L.M. Cravioto A. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3128-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and nearly 300 alleles are known. The amino acid sequences derived from the obtainedsic sequences were compared with that of protein SIC from the M1 strain AP1 (GenBankTM accession number X92968(7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)). A deletion of a region of 29 amino acid residues in SIC from U15 and some shorter insertions and single amino acid substitutions were observed within the M1 variants (Fig.5A). However, thesic genes of the M12 and M55 strains are clearly more different, as compared with the sic genes of the M1 strains (not shown). The sequence of SICM12 was found to be identical to a recently published sequence (GenBank accession number AJ300679 (30Brandt C.M. Allerberger F. Spellerberg B. Holland R. Lutticken R. Haase G. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)), and as demonstrated in Fig. 5B a high degree of homology was found when the derived amino acid sequence of SICM55 was compared with that of SICM12. Analysis of the amino acid composition of the SIC variants revealed differences in charged residues, where the M1 variants have a higher negative net charge compared with SICM12 and SICM55. This could explain the reduced capacity of SICM12 and SICM55 in blocking the activity of α-defensin and LL-37. It is noteworthy that the four SIC-producing M serotypes (1, 12, 55, and 57) are all known to be associated with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, suggesting a role for SIC in this condition (7Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Hartas J. Sriprakash K.S. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fact that M1 strains dominate in cases of invasive disease (6Musser J.M. Krause R.M. Krause R.M. Emerging Infections. Academic Press, New York1998: 185-218Google Scholar) and that SICM1 is the most potent inhibitor of α-defensin and LL-37, support the notion that the interference of SIC with antibacterial peptides could facilitate S. pyogenes invasion through mucosal and skin barriers.Figure 5Structure of the investigated SIC variants.A, insertions, deletions, and amino acid substitutions in the SICM1U15 and SICM1U17 amino acid sequences are shown as compared with the SICM1AP1 sequence (GenBank accession numberX92968 (7Åkesson P.

The demonstration that SIC not only interferes with complement function but also inactivates antibacterial peptides further underlines the significance of the innate immune system. The data of the present study also emphasize the highly complex molecular interplay between S. pyogenes and its human host. Although pathogenicity and virulence are polygenic properties, the results indicate that SIC could represent an important virulence determinant. A previous investigation (31Lukomski S. Hoe N.P. Abdi I. Rurangirwa J. Kordari P. Liu M. Dou S.J. Adams G.G. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) showed that an isogenic M1 mutant strain in which the sic gene had been inactivated, was significantly less efficient in colonizing the throat of mice as compared with the wild-type strain. Here we find, using a mouse model of subcutaneous infection, that the mutant strain SIC− is significantly attenuated in virulence compared with the wild-type AP1 strain (Table I). Combined these data suggest that SIC promotes early stages of infection by inactivating antibacterial peptides. The results of the present work may also explain the unique variability of the sic gene and the fact that the M1 serotype is the serotype most frequently connected with invasive S. pyogenes infection.Table ISubcutaneous challenge of mice with S. pyogenes strains AP1 and SIC−StrainDead animalsTime to death1-aTime to death was significantly longer in mice injected with SIC− as compared to AP1 using the Wilcoxin rank sum test (p < 0.05).SurvivorshAP15/757, 60, 60, 70, 962/7SIC−2/7140, 2205/7NMRI mice were injected subcutaneously with 104 AP1 or SIC− bacteria, and mice were followed for 10 days.1-a Time to death was significantly longer in mice injected with SIC− as compared to AP1 using the Wilcoxin rank sum test (p < 0.05).

Ingbritt Gustafsson and Ulla Johannesson are acknowledged for excellent technical assistance. In relation to the present work it is noteworthy that protein SIC also inhibits the antibacterial activities of lysozyme and secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor, proteins that are part of the mucosal innate immune system. These data were reported by Fernie- King et al. (32Fernie-King B.A. Seilly D.J. Davies A. Lachmann P.J. Infect.

Because inosine is treated as guanosine by the translational machinery, this A-to-I editing could lead to functional alterations of the affected genes. For instance, A-to-I RNA editing results in the expression of editing isoforms of glutamate receptor (GluR) ion channel subunits (4Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H.

Editing of the so-called “Q/R” site of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid GluR-B subunit dramatically decreases the Ca2+ permeability of the channel (7Köhler M. Burnashev N.

Substantial reduction in G-protein coupling efficiency is noted with A-to-I editing of 5-HT2CR RNA at five positions (A to E sites) located in the intracellular II loop region (6Burns C.M. Chu H.

Editing of its own intron sequence by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) 2 creates an alternative splice acceptor site leading to synthesis of a truncated translation product, which may be a negative feedback mechanism to regulate the activity of ADAR2 (11Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 339: 75-80Crossref Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In all these examples, a dsRNA structure formed between the exonic sequences containing an editing site(s) and downstream or upstream intronic sequences has been proven to be essential for editing (4Higuchi M.

Systematic search with a recently devised method for cloning of inosine-containing RNAs has led to identification of more than two dozen editing sites occurring in the intron and 3′-untranslated regions of new target genes. A-to-I RNA editing of these non-coding regions may affect the splicing rate, the translation efficacy, or stability of the edited mRNAs (13Morse D.P. Aruscavage P.J. Bass B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7906-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intronic and untranslated region sequences subjected to A-to-I RNA editing often contain common repetitive elements such as Alu and LINE1 repeats forming a long dsRNA structure, raising the possibility that A-to-I RNA editing may be involved in a mechanism regulating the very abundant repetitive sequences in mammalian genomes (2Bass B.L.

Finally, A-to-I RNA editing of dsRNAs derived from transgenes appears to prevent silencing of the transgenes regulated by RNA interference, revealing the potential intersection of the two mechanisms, RNA editing and RNA interference both evolved to deal with dsRNA (14Knight S.W.

Flies with a null mutation of dADAR, although viable, display defective locomotion and behavior accompanied by various neurological and anatomical changes in the brain. This phenotype is most likely because of the lack of editing in the transcripts of several known target genes such as cacCa2+ channel and para Na+ channel (25Palladino M.J. Keegan L.P.

Chimeric mouse embryos derived fromADAR1+/− ES cells die at the midgestation stage with a phenotype indicative of dyserythropoietic defects (29Wang Q. Khillan J. Gadue P. Nishikura K.

It has not yet been ruled out that antisense effects generated by transcripts derived from the ADAR1-targeted allele may contribute to the observed embryonic lethal phenotype (29Wang Q. Khillan J.

For instance, ADAR2 edits almost exclusively the D site of 5-HT2CR and the Q/R site of GluR-B RNA, whereas ADAR1 barely edits these sites. However, ADAR1 selectively edits the A and B sites of 5-HT2CR RNA and the intronic hot spot (+60 site) of GluR-B RNA. The result of in vitro editing studies indicate a significant difference among ADAR gene family members in their interaction with substrate RNA. Specific structural features of the dsRNA binding domains and their N-terminal regions may form the molecular basis of this editing site selectivity. There are only two dsRNA binding motif repeats in the RNA binding domain of ADAR2 and ADAR3, in contrast to three dsRNA binding motifs in ADAR1. ADAR2 lacks a part of the N terminus region of ADAR1, just upstream of its RNA binding domain, where ADAR1 contains two repeats of a Z-DNA binding motif (32Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.-G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). ADAR3 has a unique N-terminal region containing the arginine-rich R domain (21Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Higuchi M. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol.

RNA. 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the deaminase domains and relatively divergent C-terminal regions of ADAR gene family members may also contribute to the difference observed in their RNA editing site selectivity as indicated by the studies of domain exchange between ADAR1 and ADAR2 (21Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Higuchi M. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31795-31798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 33Wong S.K. Sato S. Lazinski D.W.

A longstanding question with regard to the enzymatic activities of ADARs is whether they act as monomeric or oligomeric forms and whether oligomerization plays a role in the site-selective editing mechanism. The catalytic domain of ADAR is very similar to that of the cytidine deaminase gene family (1Gerber A.P. Keller W. Trends Biochem.

It is possible that the RNA editing site selectivity observed with ADAR1 and ADAR2 is dependent on their state of oligomerization. Curiously, the third member of the ADAR gene family, ADAR3, is incapable of editing all known sites of GluR-B and 5-HT2CR RNAs. The lack of enzymatic activity may be related to its oligomerization state. In the present studies, we have investigated whether ADAR gene family members undergo oligomerization. In addition, we have examined the possible formation of heteromeric oligomers among different ADAR gene family members. The following oligonucleotides used for construction of 6His-tagged ADAR baculovirus constructs were synthesized at the University of Pennsylvania, Cancer Center Nucleic Acid Facility. All ADAR oligonucleotides correspond to the human sequence. The nucleotide positions indicated in parentheses are relative to the initiation codon ATG of ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3 (GenBankTM accession numbers U10439, U76420, and AF034837, respectively), in which A was assigned as position +1.

A 6His epitope tag sequence was introduced into the N termini of the existing FLAG epitope-tagged expression constructs, pBac-F-ADAR1, pBac-F-ADAR2a, and pBac-F-ADAR3 (20Lai F. Chen C.-X. Carter K.C.

Different regions of human ADAR1 (amino acids 2–72), ADAR2a (amino acids 2–35), or ADAR3 (amino acids 2–100) were prepared by PCR amplification of human ADAR1 (15Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), ADAR2a (20Lai F. Chen C.-X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell.

RNA. 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) using a set of oligonucleotide primers designed to create NotI and BamHI restriction sites. Not-H-ADAR1UP and H-ADAR1DW primers were used for PCR amplification of the ADAR1 sequence, Not-H-ADAR2UP and H-ADAR2DW primers for ADAR2a, and Bam-H-ADAR3UP and H-ADAR3DW primers for ADAR3. Restriction sitesAflII, StuI, and NotI were utilized for ligation of the PCR products at their 3′ ends into pBac-F-ADAR1, pBac-F-ADAR2a, and pBac-F-ADAR3, respectively. The resultant constructs, termed pBac-H-ADAR1, pBac-H-ADAR2a, and pBac-H-ADAR3, contain a Kozak sequence that is strongly preferred by baculovirus for protein translation initiation at the N terminus region (39Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). The region amplified by PCR was confirmed by sequencing. Baculovirus expression constructs were then transformed in DH10Bac for transposition into the bacmid and subjected to blue/white screening for identification of recombinant baculoviruses. Sf9 cells were grown to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml and infected with either a single or a combination of two ADAR recombinant viruses (1:1 ratio) at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20. At 48 h post-infection, ∼1 × 109 cells were collected. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. HeLa cell extract was prepared as described previously (40Wagner R.W. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mouse brain nuclear extract was prepared by the Dignam method (41Dignam J.D. Lebovits R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with a minor modification as follows. Fresh mouse brains were minced using a pair of scissors, and further homogenized by a motor-driven Potter homogenizer in 3 times the packed cell volume of phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was suspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and kept on ice for 20 min. Cells were lysed by 10–20 strokes with a glass Dounce homogenizer followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min in a Type 65 Ti Beckman rotor. The nuclear pellet was suspended in 3 pellet volumes of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 257 glycerol, 1.0 mm DTT, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After five gentle strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer, the protein extract was cleared of debris by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min. All column chromatography procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Total cell extract was prepared from Sf9 cells infected with a single or combination of two recombinant baculoviruses (38Lai F. Drakas R. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17098-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The cell extract, dialyzed against buffer A (0.05 mTris, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm DTT, 207 glycerol, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.057 Nonidet P-40) was first passed through a 1.0-ml (1.0 × 1.3 cm) anti-FLAG M2-monoclonal antibody (mAb)-agarose gel (Sigma) affinity column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mmऔ-mercaptoethanol instead of 1 mm DTT. After washing the column with 10 ml each of buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.75 m NaCl, and again 0.15 m NaCl, the complex was eluted with 5 ml of buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl and 200 ॖg/ml FLAG peptide. The pooled peak fractions were dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 mNaCl, 207 glycerol, 0.057 Nonidet P-40, 1 mmऔ-mercaptoethanol) and then applied to a TALON metal resin (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) affinity column. Following extensive washing with buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole, proteins were eluted with 150 mm imidazole. The yield of recombinant proteins during the sequential affinity chromatography was followed by Western blotting analysis using an anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) or anti-6His 6XHN mAb (BD Biosciences). The purity of recombinant proteins purified by the first (“1× purified”) and second (“2× purified”) affinity column chromatography were determined by electrophoresis on a 107 SDS-PAGE gel followed by silver staining. In some experiments, the ADAR complex purified on a M2 mAb-agarose column was treated with RNases prior to its application to the TALON affinity column. The recombinant ADAR proteins (1× purified) were treated with single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) specific RNases A (0.5 units/ml) and T1 (10 unit/ml) obtained from Roche Diagnostics or with dsRNA-specific RNase V1 (1 unit/ml) obtained from Pierce. RNase-digested ADAR proteins were dialyzed against buffer B, and then subjected to TALON affinity column chromatography. The RNase digestion conditions were tested separately with uniformly [α-32P]ATP-labeled c-myc antisense ssRNA or dsRNA (40Wagner R.W. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), confirming their complete digestion with the relevant RNase(s). Purified ADAR proteins (1 ॖg) or crude nuclear extract (2 mg) was applied to a 24-ml (1 × 30 cm) column of Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) for size exclusion chromatography. The buffer system used was 0.05 m Tris (pH 7.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 207 glycerol, and 0.17 Nonidet P-40. Purified recombinant ADAR proteins were concentrated to 100 ॖl using Centricon (Amicon) before applying to the column. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The molecular weight of ADAR (monomer or oligomer) was estimated by comparison with molecular weight standards obtained from Sigma; bovine thyroglobulin (669,000), horse spleen apoferritin (443,000), sweet potato औ-amylase (200,000), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), and bovine carbonic anhydrase (29,000). The peak for the ADAR complex was confirmed by Western blotting analysis, and the peak position of the marker proteins was determined by measuring the optical absorption at 280 nm. Editing of a synthetic 5-HT2C RNA C5 was assayed in vitro as described previously (22Chen C-X. Cho D-S.C. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. RNA. 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), using 1× or 2× purified recombinant homodimer complexes as well as 2× purified heterodimer complexes consisting of one wild-type and another non-functional mutant ADAR monomer. The standard editing reaction contained 20 fmol of a synthetic C5 RNA substrate, 10 ng of recombinant ADAR proteins, 0.02 m Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 107 glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 250 units/ml RNasin (Promega). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for various times. Quantitation of editing efficiency at five sites of 5-HT2CR RNA was carried out by dideoxyoligonucleotide/primer extension assay as described previously (10Wang Q. Chen C-X. Cho D-S.C. O'Brien P. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1290-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Chen C-X. Cho D-S.C. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. RNA. 2000; 6: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The ratio of the edited and unedited RNAs was estimated by quantifying the radioactivity of the primer-extended products with a phosphorimaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were fractionated on an SDS-87 polyacrylamide gel and transferred to ImmobilonTM-P nylon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were blocked in a buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline and 37 nonfat dry milk. MAbs 15.8.6, 1.3.1, and 3.591 for detection of native and recombinant ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3 proteins, respectively (22Chen C-X. Cho D-S.C. Wang Q. Lai F. Carter K.C. Nishikura K.

ADAR-specific protein bands were detected by peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies directed against mouse immunoglobulins (Kirkegaard and Perry Lab., Gaithersburg, MD) and chemiluminescense staining using RenaissanceTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

https://openalex.org/W2320950260,"CC139 fibroblasts are one of several model systems in which the Raf→MEK→ERK1/2 pathway can inhibit apoptosis independently of the PI3K pathway; however, the precise mechanism for this protective effect is not known. Serum withdrawal from CC139 fibroblasts resulted in the rapid onset of apoptosis, which was prevented by actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Serum withdrawal promoted the rapid, de novo accumulation of BimEL, a proapoptotic ‘BH3-only’ member of the Bcl-2 protein family. BimEL expression was an early event, occurring several hours prior to caspase activation. In contrast to studies in neurons, activation of the JNK→c-Jun pathway was neither necessary nor sufficient to induce BimEL expression. Selective inhibition of either the ERK pathway (with U0126) or the PI3K pathway (with LY294002) caused an increase in the expression of BimEL. Furthermore, selective activation of the ERK1/2 pathway by ΔRaf-1:ER* substantially reduced BimEL expression, abolished conformational changes in Bax and blocked the appearance of apoptotic cells. The ability of ΔRaf-1:ER* to repress BimEL expression required the ERK pathway but was independent of the PI3K→PDK→PKB pathway. Thus, serum withdrawal-induced expression of BimEL occurs independently of the JNK→c-Jun pathway and can be repressed by the ERK pathway independently of the PI3K pathway. This may contribute to Raf- and Ras-induced cell survival at low serum concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2027929872,"The novel mitogen/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase 5/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-5 (MEK5/ERK5) pathway has been implicated in the regulation of cellular proliferation. MEK5 expression has been detected in prostate cancer cells, although the significance of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway in human prostate cancer has not been tested. We examined MEK5 expression in 127 cases of prostate cancer and 20 cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) by immunohistochemistry and compared the results to clinical parameters. We demonstrated that MEK5 expression is increased in prostate cancer as compared to benign prostatic tissue. Strong MEK5 expression correlates with the presence of bony metastases and less favourable disease-specific survival. Furthermore, among the patients with high Gleason score of 8-10, MEK5 overexpression has an additional prognostic value in survival. MEK5 transfection experiments confirm its ability to induce proliferation (P < 0.0001), motility (P = 0.0001) and invasion in prostate cancer cells (P = 0.0001). MEK5 expression drastically increased MMP-9, but not MMP-2 mRNA expression. Luciferase report assays suggest that the -670/MMP-9 promoter is upregulated by MEK5 and electromobility shift assay further suggests the involvement of activator protein-I (AP-1), but not the NF-kappa B, binding site in the MMP-9 promoter. Using an AP-1 luciferase construct, activation of MEK5 was confirmed to enhance AP-1 activities up to twofold. Taken together, our results establish MEK5 as a key signalling molecule associated with prostate carcinogenesis. As the MEK5/ERK5 interaction is highly specific, it represents a potential target of therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1995278959,"The hepatitis C virus nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein is a pleiotropic phosphoprotein that has been shown to associate with a wide variety of cellular signaling proteins. Of particular interest is the observation that a highly conserved C-terminal Class II polyproline motif within NS5A mediated association with the Src homology 3 domains of members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases and the mitogenic adaptor protein Grb2 (A. Macdonald, K. Crowder, A. Street, C. McCormick, and M. Harris, submitted for publication). In this study, we analyzed the consequences of NS5A expression on mitogenic signaling pathways within a variety of cell lines. Utilizing a transient luciferase reporter system, we observed that NS5A inhibited the activity of the mitogenic and stress-activated transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP1). This inhibition was dependent upon a Class II polyproline motif within NS5A. Using a combination of dominant active and negative mutants of components of the MAPK signaling pathways, selective inhibitors, together with immunoblotting with phospho-specific and phosphorylation-independent antibodies, we determined the signaling pathways targeted by NS5A to inhibit AP1. These studies demonstrated that in both stable NS5A-expressing cells and Huh-7-derived cells harboring subgenomic hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicons, this inhibition was mediated through the ERK signaling pathway. Importantly, a comparable inhibition of AP1 reporter activity was observed in hepatocyte-derived cell lines transduced with a baculovirus vector driving expression of full-length HCV polyprotein. In conclusion, these data strongly suggest a role for the NS5A protein in the perturbation of mitogenic signaling pathways in HCV-infected hepatocytes."

Specifically, the mevalonate-independent “2-C-methyl-d- erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)1 pathway” (Fig.1a), which leads to the universal isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) (Fig. 1a, 4) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (Fig. 1a, 5) via 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (Fig.1a, 2) and (E)-1-hydroxy-2-methyl-but-2-enyl 4-diphosphate (Fig.1a, 3) has attracted considerable interest (6Jomaa H.

Evidence has been accumulated for its presence in many pathogenic microorganisms including the malaria parasitePlasmodium spp. that harbor the MEP pathway in their apicoplast compartments (14Vial H.J.

As the pathway is not present in man where IPP and DMAPP are exclusively synthesized via mevalonate (Fig.1a, 6), all enzymes of the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway represent promising targets for the development of novel drugs. The first compound unique to the mevalonate-independent MEP pathway (Fig. 1a, 2) is synthesized from 1-d-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (Fig.1a, 1) by IspC (15Takahashi S. Kuzuyama T. Watanabe H. Seto H.

The aldehyde intermediate can be chemically synthesized and converted either into the substrate, 1-d-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate, or the product, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate, by IspC and nicotinamide nucleotides depending on the reaction conditions, which demonstrates not only full reversibility of the reaction but also that 2-C-methyl-d-erythrose 4-phosphate is a true intermediate (19Hoeffler J.-F.

Thus, fosmidomycin and its derivative, FR-900098 (Fig. 1c, 10), have also been shown to cure mice infected by Plasmodium vinckei (6Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C.

The three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme without ligands and with NADPH and phosphate has been determined (27Reuter K. Sanderbrand S. Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Steinbrecher I. Beck E. Hintz M.

Here, we present the crystal structure ofE. coli IspC in complex with the nanomolar inhibitor fosmidomycin at 2.5 Å resolution and discuss its implication for the reaction mechanism and the design of drugs. TheispC gene of E. coli was cloned and overexpressed, and the corresponding gene product was purified as described previously (29Hecht S. Wungsintaweekul J. Rohdich F. Kis K. Radykewicz T. Schuhr C.A. Eisenreich W. Richter G. Bacher A. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 7770-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For crystallization, the protein was dialyzed against 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, with 2 mm dithioerythritol and 0.02% (m/v) NaN3 and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. 15 μl of the protein solution were mixed with 15 μl of the buffer solution containing 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 and 100 mm sodium acetate, 110 mm Hepes, 100 mm glycine, 100 mmguanidinium chloride, 10 mm EDTA, 12 mmdithiothreitol, pH 5.8, and equilibrated over 900 μl of the same buffer without EDTA in Linbro plates at 21 °C. The protein had a strong tendency to precipitate irreversibly. Diffraction quality crystals appeared rather irregularly after about 1 week and grew to a final size of about 0.45 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3. Data sets of the substrate-free crystals and the complexes were measured at 100 K using an Oxford cryo stream. Prior to flash freezing or soaking, the crystals were gradually transferred in about ten steps into a buffer solution containing the mother liquor without EDTA supplemented with 30% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400 during a time period of about 30 min. For soaking, either 5 mm MnCl2 (data set MN) or 5 mm MnCl2 together with 2 mmfosmidomycin (data set MNFOS) were added to the cryo solution. Crystals were soaked for 2 h. Fosmidomycin was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). X-ray diffraction data were collected on a MarResearch imaging plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. Diffraction data were evaluated with the HKL suite (30Otwinowski Z. Minow W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and CCP4 program suite (31Collaborative Computational Project No. 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and rigid body refinement with crystallography NMR software were in the range of 43–47%. Models were refined by iterative rounds of model building, simulated annealing, least squares, and B-factor refinement. Finally, water molecules were picked with crystallography NMR software or manually. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied throughout the refinement. Initially the maximum likelihood target using amplitudes was applied, but in the final round the residual target was used because it was found to result in lowerRfree values. The structures display good stereochemical parameters as estimated by the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot (35Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar) showed only 0.0% (apo), 1.3% (MN) or 0.8% (MNFOS) in the generously allowed region and 0.3% (apo) and 0.0% (MN and MNFOS) in the disallowed regions. Figures were prepared with BOBSCRIPT (36Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1795) Google Scholar). The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1ONN, 1ONO, and 1ONP. Recombinant 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate synthase (EC1.1.1.267) of E. coli has been crystallized in a monoclinic crystal form of space group P2(1) that is unrelated to that previously described (27Reuter K.

Biochem. 2002; 131: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The asymmetric unit contains a dimer that also represents the solution state of the enzyme (Fig.2). The crystals showed unisotropic diffraction of x-ray to between 2.8 and 2.3 Å resolution and a rather high mosaicity of about ∼1°. Based on the mergingR-factor of the data and I/ς(I) criteria for the outermost shell, useful data were included to a limiting resolution of 2.6 Å for the apo data set and 2.5 Å for the complex data sets with Mn2+ (MN) and Mn2+/fosmidomycin (MNFOS), respectively (TableI). The known crystal structure ofE. coli IspC (27Reuter K. Sanderbrand S. Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Steinbrecher I. Beck E. Hintz M. Klebe G. Stubbs M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5378-5384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) provided the starting model for the Patterson search. The resulting models were refined with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints until the crystallographicR-factors converged (Table I). The relatively high finalRwork and Rfree can be explained by the unisotropic diffraction and the high mosaicity. Nevertheless, the electron density was of high quality, and the Mn2+/fosmidomycin moieties were excellently defined by simulated annealing omit maps (Fig. 3). Inclusion of non-crystallographic symmetry improved refinement behavior significantly, which indicates that both monomers are also rather similar with respect to their domain arrangement.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsCategoryAPOMNMNFOSData collection Space group P2(1) Cell constants (a, b, c in Å/β in °)90.4, 53.4, 107.5/92.991.4, 52.3, 108.3/92.590.8, 52.3, 107.6/92.1 Limiting resolution (Å) (last shell)2.6 (2.60–2.70)2.5 (2.50–2.59)2.5 (2.50–2.59) Reflections31,99735,37834,930 Rmerge1-aRmerge = Σhkl[Σi ‖Ii − <I>‖)/ΣiI].

The contour level is 3.5 ς.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The model for the apo form contains residues 1–397 excluding the active site loop, which is completely disordered (residues Arg-208 to Gly-215). In the presence of Mn2+/fosmidomycin, significant additional electron density is present for this loop that can be fitted as shown in Fig. 4. However, it appears that the catalytic loop remains partially disordered, especially for Ser-213 and Met-214, which are not defined by electron density, and it very likely adopts more than one conformation. Interestingly, Met-214 represents a strictly conserved residue. This can be explained if it is assumed that complete ordering of the catalytic loop requires the presence of both NADPH and the substrate 1-d-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate. IspC forms an elongated homodimer of about 96 × 60 Å with a pronounced cleft-like structure in each monomer that is covered by a flexible active site loop (Fig. 2). Each monomer can be subdivided into basically three domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1–149) is a member of the classical dinucleotide binding fold and serves as an anchor for NADPH. A central catalytic domain (residues 150 to 285) harbors both the binding site for the divalent metal ion (Mg2+, Mn2+, or Co2+), the phosphate binding site of the substrate, and the catalytic loop. The C-terminal all-α-helical domain (residues 312 to 398) is connected to the catalytic domain by a linker region that spans the entire monomer. The C-terminal domain appears to have a structural role in supporting the catalytic domain. The catalytic domain can even be subdivided into the part harboring the substrate binding site and that harboring the active site loop. IspC was crystallized in the absence of divalent metal ions, NADP(H) and substrate, or the inhibitor fosmidomycin. The NADPH binding site is blocked by the C terminus of a neighboring molecule in the crystal as found previously for an orthorhombic crystal form (27Reuter K. Sanderbrand S. Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Steinbrecher I. Beck E. Hintz M. Klebe G. Stubbs M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5378-5384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The active site is well accessible in our crystals, and soaking with either Mn2+ or Mn2+ and fosmidomycin resulted in the corresponding electron densities (Fig. 3). Mn2+ is bound to a cluster of the carbonic acids, Asp-150, Glu-152, and Glu-231, as suggested previously (27Reuter K. Sanderbrand S. Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Steinbrecher I. Beck E. Hintz M. Klebe G. Stubbs M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5378-5384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All residues form monodentate ligands, and a regular octahedral coordination sphere is completed by three water molecules. Upon the addition of fosmidomycin, two water molecules are replaced by its (N-formyl-N-hydroxy)amino head group. The geometry of the latter was modeled similar to that observed for the inhibitor 2-((formyl(hydroxy)amino)methyl)-4-methylpentanoic acid complexed to zinc in the matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 (37Rowsell S. Hawtin P. Minshull C.A. Jepson H. Brockbank S.M.V. Barratt D.G. Slater A.M. McPheat W.L. Waterson D. Henney A.M. Pauptit R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). TheN-formyl oxygen is found in the trans position to Glu-231, whereas the N-hydroxyl oxygen is located trans to Asp-150 (Fig. 4). The phosphonate moiety is anchored by numerous hydrogen bonds to Ser-186, Ser-222, Asn-227, and Lys-228. The conformation of the connecting linker that consists of three methylene groups appears clearly defined by electron density. Hydrophobic contacts of the latter do not seem to contribute to the high affinity of the inhibitor, as none is present with the rigid part of the binding site or apparently formed with the partially ordered catalytic loop. Trp-212 from the flexible catalytic loop is in direct vicinity to the bound inhibitor, although not well ordered. Replacement of His-257 by glutamine was found to have a drastic effect on the enzyme activity (38Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Takagi M. Seto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19928-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thekcat/Km decreased 27,000-fold, and the Km value for NADPH increased by approximately one order of magnitude, although it is quite far away from the NADPH binding site. The mutation of His-153 that is actually closer to the NADPH binding site does not have a comparable effect. This observation may be explained by an interaction between the His-257 site and the nicotinamide moiety that is mediated by the catalytic loop. It appears likely that His-257 and Trp-212 form a stacking interaction supported by Pro-274 in the presence of NADPH that is a prerequisite for completely ordering the active site architecture. Replacement of the formyl-hydrogen of fosmidomycin by a methyl group yields the inhibitor FR-900098 (Fig. 1c, 10) (39Okuhara M. Kuroda Y. Goto T. Okamoto M. Terano H. Kohsaka M. Aoki H. Imanaka H. J. Antibiot. 1980; 33: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with increased affinity (6Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Türbachova I. Eberl M. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). This methyl group is predicted to contact the side chain of Trp-212 of the catalytic loop. A corresponding methyl group is present in the substrate 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate, which supports the view that fosmidomycin actually binds substrate-like and does not represent an analogue of the proposed intermediate 2-C-methyl-erythrose 4-phosphate as postulated previously (27Reuter K. Sanderbrand S. Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Steinbrecher I. Beck E. Hintz M. Klebe G. Stubbs M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5378-5384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The present model immediately reveals potential interaction sites for specific inhibitors. The pronounced cavity behind the bound fosmidomycin (Fig. 4) can be utilized for stacking interactions with His-257. It should be noted that this cavity is mainly formed by two sequence stretches, His-251 to Ser-258 (His-Pro-Gln-Ser-Leu-Ile-His-Ser) and Pro274 to Arg-277 (Pro-Asp-Met-Arg), which represent highly conserved residues in all available IspC sequences. It additionally harbors the His-251 three water molecules that may be replaced by hydrophilic groups. These are found next to the carbonyl of His-251 and Ile-256, respectively. Substitution at the 3 and 5 positions of the five-member skeleton appear especially suited to include these contacts. Previous structural studies on IspC revealed its principal domain organization (27Reuter K. Sanderbrand S. Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Steinbrecher I. Beck E. Hintz M. Klebe G. Stubbs M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5378-5384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the binding site for NADPH and indicated a phosphate binding site (28Yajima S. Nonaka T. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Ohsawa K. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, no information was available on the binding site for divalent metal ions and the substrate DXP, and no model could be derived for the course of the reaction. The complex of IspC with Mn2+ and fosmidomycin now provides a model for the binding mode of the substrate. DXP can be fitted nicely onto fosmidomycin (Fig.5a). During the reaction, the C-4 atom migrates to the C-2 carbon atom, which is partially positively charged because of the polarizing effect of the divalent metal ion. The C-3 hydroxyl is likewise fixed by coordination to the metal ion. This first step is similar to that catalyzed by acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of branched amino acids. There, a carbonyl group is also further polarized by a Mg2+ ion, inducing a partial positive charge on the carbon atom (reviewed in Ref. 40Dumas R. Biuo V. Halgand F. Douce R. Duggleby R.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). From stereochemical considerations is has been deduced that the migrating group and the reducing cofactors are located on opposite faces of the planes defined by the metal coordinated α-hydroxycarbonyl substructures (20Arigoni D. Giner J.-L. Sagner S. Wungsintaweekul J. Zenk M.H. Kis K. Bacher A. Eisenreich W. Chem. Comm. 1999; : 1027-1028Google Scholar). A binding mode of the intermediate 2-C-methyl-erythrose 4-phosphate (8Rohmer M. Knani M. Simonin P. Sutter B. Sahm H. Biochem.

Über die frühen Stufen der Biosynthese von Isoprenoiden in Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis. Eidgenossiche Technische Hochschule Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland1994Google Scholar) is not compatible with the stereochemistry of the reduction reaction, as it would result in a hydride transfer to the Hsi position at C-1 of the product from Hsi at C-4 of the cofactor and not to Hre as observed (20Arigoni D. Giner J.-L. Sagner S. Wungsintaweekul J. Zenk M.H. Kis K. Bacher A. Eisenreich W. Chem. Comm. 1999; : 1027-1028Google Scholar, 21Radykewicz T. Rohdich F. Wungsintaweekul J. Herz S. Kis K.

Lett. 1999; 1: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulate that the putative intermediate does not relax to an extended substrate-like conformation. It is reasonable to assume that the phosphate group of the substrate remains essentially anchored in the phosphate binding site during the reaction. Notably, 1-d-deoxyxylulose does not act as a substrate for the enzyme (19Hoeffler J.-F. Tritsch D. Grosdemange-Billiard C. Rohmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4446-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, migration of the C-4 atom to the C-2 carbonyl during isomerization will likely require a movement of C-2 toward the phosphate binding site. If it is additionally assumed that the oxygen ligands remain bound to the divalent metal ion throughout the reaction, a binding mode of the intermediate as illustrated in Fig. 5b can be modeled. The NADP-bound IspC model (28Yajima S. Nonaka T. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Ohsawa K. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) can be superimposed onto our fosmidomycin complex with only minor differences. This allows modeling of NADPH in a substrate complex (Figs. 2 and 5b). It should be particularly noted that the resulting geometry of the reaction intermediate not only brings the aldehyde group of the intermediate in close proximity (∼ 3.2 Å) to the C-4 position of the NADPH nicotinamide moiety, but also results in the observed hydride transfer to the Hre position at C-1 of the product. The methyl group at C-2 is predicted to remain exposed to Trp-212 of the catalytic loop. It has been shown that this methyl group is essential for the affinity of the aldehyde intermediate to the enzyme as d-erythrose 4-phosphate binds significantly weaker (19Hoeffler J.-F. Tritsch D. Grosdemange-Billiard C. Rohmer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4446-4457Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The hydride transfer may occur very rapidly, perhaps concomitantly with the isomerization reaction, which is compatible with the fact that the putative intermediate cannot be isolated or trapped. The presence of NADPH during the reaction is assured by an ordered sequential binding starting with NADPH as demonstrated by kinetic studies (23Koppisch A.T. Fox D.T. Blagg B.S.J. Poulter D.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The finding that the reversible isomerization step requires the presence of NADP+/NADPH indicates that it helps to define the precise active site geometry, presumably by interacting with the flexible active site loop. The strictly conserved residues Trp-212 and Met-214 represent ideal candidates for a stacking interaction or a hydrophobic contact with the nicotinamide moiety of NADPH. We therefore conclude that the catalytic loop and the nicotinamide moiety of NADPH are simultaneously required for their correct positioning at the active site. A recent NMR study demonstrated the proximity of a methionine and an isoleucine residue to the nicotinamide ring portion of NADPH (41Pellecchia M. Meininger D. Dong Q. Chang E. Jack R. Sem D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Potential candidates at the active site are Met-214 or Met-276 and Ile-13 or Ile-218, respectively, which all represent almost strictly conserved residues. In summary, we could demonstrate the binding mode of fosmidomycin to IspC, which must, for stereochemical reasons, be different from that of the aldehyde intermediate, 2-C-methyl-erythrose 4-phosphate, as proposed previously. The detailed knowledge of the interaction mode of fosmidomycin as a promising drug against malaria and lead compound may contribute to the development of more potent inhibitors of this key enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2783761121,"We have demonstrated that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is constitutively activated in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and human pancreatic cancer cell lines but not in normal pancreatic tissues or in immortalized, nontumorigenic pancreatic epithelial cells, suggesting that NF-κB plays a critical role in the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To elucidate the role of constitutive NF-κB activity in human pancreatic cancer cells, we generated pancreatic tumor cell lines that express a phosphorylation defective IκBα (S32, 36A) (IκBαM) that blocks NF-κB activity. In this study, we showed that inhibiting constitutive NF-κB activity by expressing IκBαM suppressed the tumorigenicity of a nonmetastatic human pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1, in an orthotopic nude mouse model. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PANC-1-derived tumors expressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and induced angiogenesis. Inhibiting NF-κB signaling by expressing IκBαM significantly reduced expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. The cytokine-induced expression of VEGF and Interleukin-8 in PANC-1 cells is also decreased. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of NF-κB signaling can suppress tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer cells and that the NF-κB signaling pathway is a potential target for anticancer agents."

Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The glycerol 3-phosphate pathway is present in all tissues, whereas the monoacylglycerol pathway is restricted to the enterocytes of the small intestine (1Bell R.M. Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The monoacylglycerol pathway is believed to be critical for the packaging of dietary fat into chylomicron lipoprotein particles (2Levy E. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 70: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Acyl coenzyme A:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) (2-acylglycerolO-acyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.22) is the enzyme that initiates the monoacylglycerol pathway (3Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 169-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For insoluble dietary fat such as TAG to be absorbed by the small intestine, dietary fat molecules must first be digested by pancreatic lipase into soluble free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol (4Lykidis A. Mougios V. Arzoglou P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These products are quickly absorbed into enterocytes. Within minutes of their appearance in the lumen of the small intestine, MGAT uses these molecules as substrates to form diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG is further acylated by acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) to re-form TAG. The newly formed TAG molecules are then packaged with other complex lipids such as cholesterol ester, phospholipids, and small amounts of protein to form round lipoprotein particles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons, 90% of which are comprised of TAG, are quickly secreted into the lymph where they serve as a source of energy (3Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 169-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 5Brindley D.N. Hubscher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Similar to other neutral lipid synthesis proteins, MGAT is an intrinsic membrane protein that to date has not been purified to homogeneity from any source. The molecular identity of the gene encoding the intestinal MGAT has been elusive. The first cDNA clone shown to encode MGAT enzyme activity, designated MGAT1, was identified by Yen et al. (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, MGAT1 is expressed in stomach, kidney, white adipose, and brown adipose tissues but not in the small intestine. Hence MGAT1 cannot account for the high intestinal MGAT enzyme activity that is important for the physiology of fat absorption (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).In the current study, we have identified a novel cDNA, designated MGAT3, whose gene product fulfills the criteria as the MGAT responsible for the absorption of dietary fat. The RNA expression profile of human MGAT3 is highly restricted to gastrointestinal tract. Specifically MGAT3 transcripts are found at steady state in the ileum at levels ∼45,000 times greater than those observed in the majority of the other tissues analyzed. When recombinant MGAT3 is expressed in baculovirus it produces robust MGAT enzyme activity. Importantly recombinant MGAT3 appears to possess superior substrate specificity for the acylation of 2-monoacylglycerol over other stereoisomers, a requirement that must be fulfilled by the authentic intestinal MGAT.RESULTSFig. 1A shows the comparison of human MGAT3 with its homologues. It bears 49% identity, 60% similarity to DGAT2; 44% identity, 51% similarity to MGAT1; and 46% identity, 55% similarity to MGAT2, respectively. Hence MGAT3 is a novel member of the DGAT2 gene family. The cDNA of MGAT3 encodes a 341-amino acid protein. Hydrophobicity analysis suggests that the predicted MGAT3 protein contains up to five potential transmembrane domains but does not contain a classic signal sequence at its NH2 terminus (Fig. 1B).To facilitate the detection of the recombinant human MGAT3 protein, a copy of FLAG epitope was fused in-frame at its NH2terminus. Upon the infection by recombinant MGAT3 virus, Sf9 cell membrane extracts produced a band of ∼36 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as detected by anti-FLAG IgG immunoblots (Fig.2A, lane 2). The size of the protein is in agreement with the predicted mass. This ∼36-kDa band is missing in wild type virus and is different from that obtained with recombinant FLAG-tagged human DGAT2 (lanes 1and 3). To assess MGAT3 subcellular localization, FLAG epitope-tagged MGAT3 was expressed in COS-7 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FLAG IgG demonstrates a reticular staining pattern in the transfected cells (Fig. 2B). This staining pattern was indistinguishable from that of calnexin, a known ER protein (data not shown). Hence we conclude that recombinant MGAT3 is localized to the ER.Figure 2Expression and characterization of recombinant human MGAT3. A, immunoblot with anti-FLAG IgG. Sf9 cells were infected with either wild type baculovirus or MGAT3 or DGAT2 recombinant viruses, respectively, and aliquots of membrane extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, immunofluorescence microscopy of FLAG-MGAT3 expressed in COS-7 cells.

The TLC chromatogram shows that upon the addition of exogenous 2-monooleoylglycerol as a substrate, recombinant MGAT3 membranes produced two bands corresponding to 1,2- and 1,3-DAGs, respectively (Fig. 2C, lane 5). These DAG products were missing from membrane extracts of wild type or DGAT2 virus-infected cells (lanes 4 and 6). Interestingly both MGAT3 and DGAT2 membranes produced a TAG band (lanes 5 and6), although wild type virus failed to produce detectable TAG (lane 4), indicating that the bands are due to the expression of recombinant protein. A possible explanation is that insect cell membrane possess endogenous MGAT activity, and its DAG product can be used by recombinant DGAT2 as a substrate to form TAG. This rationale argues that human MGAT3 also possesses DGAT activity. To test this possibility, exogenous DAG was added directly as a substrate. Indeed, similar to DGAT2, MGAT3 membranes were able to acylate DAG to form TAG (lanes 8 and 9). To calculate the enzymatic activity quantitatively, labeled DAG and TAG bands were cut from the TLC chromatogram and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. The specific activities of MGAT3 were ∼22.8 nmol/min/mg for DAG and ∼9.3 nmol/min/mg for TAG synthesis. The specific activities for the wild type virus were ∼0.5 nmol/min/mg for DAG and ∼0.2 nmol/min/mg for TAG, respectively. These results establish that the MGAT3 cDNA encodes a membrane protein that contains dual MGAT and DGAT activities.To assess MAG stereoisomer specificity,sn-1-monooleoylglycerol (1-MAG),sn-2-monooleoylglycerol (2-MAG), andsn-3-monopalmitoylglycerol (3-MAG) were assayed (Fig.2D). The results indicate that MGAT3 prefers 2-MAG as the substrate (compare lane 5 with lanes 2 and8) to synthesize DAG. Interestingly, regardless of which type of MAGs were used, the amount of TAG synthesized did not change. It is possible that the background MGAT activity of endogenous insect cell membrane does not possess stereospecificity for MAG. When the background level of DAG is produced, it is used by DGAT activity encoded by MGAT3 to form TAG. To test this possibility directly, DGAT2 membrane was assayed in parallel (lanes 3, 6, and9). Indeed recombinant DGAT2 membranes were able to synthesize TAG using three different MAG stereoisomers.To assess the substrate optimum for acyl-CoAs, different acyl-CoAs were assayed for their ability to acylate radioactivesn-2-[3H]monooleoylglycerol. As shown in Fig.2E, palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0) and oleoyl-CoA (C18:1) are the best substrates for MGAT3.Quantitative TaqMan PCR was used to demonstrate that MGAT3 is selectively expressed in the digestive system (Fig.3). The tissue with the highest expression steady state RNA level is ileum whose relative expression level was found to be ∼45,000 times greater than that observed in the majority of the other tissues analyzed. The tissues with the next highest expression levels make up the remaining portions of the lower gastrointestinal tract, i.e. jejunum, duodenum, colon, cecum, and the rectum. Transcripts are notably missing from the stomach and the esophagus and trachea. The only other non-gastrointestinal related tissue to show appreciable expression is the liver. These data provide further evidence that MGAT3 is the elusive MGAT gene whose expression accounts for the high level of intestinal MGAT enzyme activity.DISCUSSIONIn the current study, we report the cloning and characterization of a new human MGAT cDNA, a novel member of the DGAT2 gene family. During the revision of this manuscript, another MGAT cDNA, designated MGAT2, was reported by Cao et al. (18Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 7, 10.1074/jbc.M300139200)Google Scholar). We compared sequences of the current cDNA with human MGAT2 and found that they are distinct (Fig. 1A). Hence we designate our cDNA as MGAT3.Similar to MGAT1 and -2, the recombinant human MGAT3 is capable of catalyzing MGAT enzyme reaction. Importantly MGAT3 is distinct from the other two MGAT enzymes in the following three aspects. 1) Enzymatically MGAT3 has a superior stereoselectivity in using MAG that contains an acyl-moiety at the sn-2 position; neither MGAT1 nor MGAT2 possess such stereoselectivity (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 7, 10.1074/jbc.M300139200)Google Scholar). 2) The best acyl donors for MGAT3 are palmitoyl- and oleoyl-, the two most abundant species of fatty acids found in the small intestine; the best acyl donor for MGAT1 is arachidonoyl-, which is low in abundance in the intestine (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 3) The expression of human MGAT3 is restricted to gastrointestinal tract with its highest expression in the ileum; the expression of MGAT1 is not found in the small intestine but in the stomach (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the MGAT2 expression is not restricted to the small intestine but is also found in kidney and stomach. In the intestine, the major digestive products of TAG produced by pancreatic lipase are 2-MAG (4Lykidis A. Mougios V. Arzoglou P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the long chain fatty acids palmitate and oleate (5Brindley D.N. Hubscher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Brindley D.N. Hubscher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 125: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hence the superior MGAT3 substrate selectivity for these types of fatty acids and its high level of expression in the small intestine would allow it to fulfill the physiological function of synthesizing TAG from the large quantities of free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol absorbed in the intestine. These properties of MGAT3 allow us to propose that it is indeed another elusive intestinal MGAT that is essential for intestinal fat absorption.From detergent-solubilized rat intestinal microsomes, Lehrner and Kuksis (10Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported the purification of MGAT and DGAT activities in a protein complex. In retrospect, the co-purification of these two enzyme activities could be explained by the fact that both MGAT2 and MGAT3 appear to encode dual MGAT/DGAT activities. The expression of MGAT2 and MGAT3 in the intestine and their MGAT/DGAT dual function also explain why DGAT1 knockout mice have an alternative TAG synthesis mechanism to support the fat absorption and chylomicron formation (11Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 12Buhman K.K. Smith S.J.

Melia A.T. Eggers H. Joly R. Patel I.H. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995; 35: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Lucas K.H. Kaplan-Machlis B. Ann. Pharmacother. 2001; 35: 314-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for Orlistat, which is to inhibit pancreatic lipase, leads to the undesirable side effect of fecal leakage (15Kolanowski J. Drug Saf. 1999; 20: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An alternative approach may be to allow for the digestion of fat to fatty acids in the gut but block the uptake or the packaging of fatty acids into chylomicron particles. Inasmuch as intestinal MGAT is a critical enzyme for this pathway, MGAT2 and MGAT3 appear to be attractive therapeutic targets for the obesity treatment. The conceivable liability of inhibiting intestinal MGAT is the potential side effects associated with the accumulation of FFA and 2-MAG in the enterocytes. The molecular identification of MGAT2 and MGAT3 will facilitate the evaluation of this potential therapeutic approach.

For insoluble dietary fat such as TAG to be absorbed by the small intestine, dietary fat molecules must first be digested by pancreatic lipase into soluble free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol (4Lykidis A.

Within minutes of their appearance in the lumen of the small intestine, MGAT uses these molecules as substrates to form diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG is further acylated by acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) to re-form TAG. The newly formed TAG molecules are then packaged with other complex lipids such as cholesterol ester, phospholipids, and small amounts of protein to form round lipoprotein particles called chylomicrons. Chylomicrons, 90% of which are comprised of TAG, are quickly secreted into the lymph where they serve as a source of energy (3Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 169-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 5Brindley D.N. Hubscher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similar to other neutral lipid synthesis proteins, MGAT is an intrinsic membrane protein that to date has not been purified to homogeneity from any source. The molecular identity of the gene encoding the intestinal MGAT has been elusive. The first cDNA clone shown to encode MGAT enzyme activity, designated MGAT1, was identified by Yen et al. (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, MGAT1 is expressed in stomach, kidney, white adipose, and brown adipose tissues but not in the small intestine. Hence MGAT1 cannot account for the high intestinal MGAT enzyme activity that is important for the physiology of fat absorption (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have identified a novel cDNA, designated MGAT3, whose gene product fulfills the criteria as the MGAT responsible for the absorption of dietary fat. The RNA expression profile of human MGAT3 is highly restricted to gastrointestinal tract. Specifically MGAT3 transcripts are found at steady state in the ileum at levels ∼45,000 times greater than those observed in the majority of the other tissues analyzed. When recombinant MGAT3 is expressed in baculovirus it produces robust MGAT enzyme activity. Importantly recombinant MGAT3 appears to possess superior substrate specificity for the acylation of 2-monoacylglycerol over other stereoisomers, a requirement that must be fulfilled by the authentic intestinal MGAT. RESULTSFig. 1A shows the comparison of human MGAT3 with its homologues. It bears 49% identity, 60% similarity to DGAT2; 44% identity, 51% similarity to MGAT1; and 46% identity, 55% similarity to MGAT2, respectively. Hence MGAT3 is a novel member of the DGAT2 gene family. The cDNA of MGAT3 encodes a 341-amino acid protein. Hydrophobicity analysis suggests that the predicted MGAT3 protein contains up to five potential transmembrane domains but does not contain a classic signal sequence at its NH2 terminus (Fig. 1B).To facilitate the detection of the recombinant human MGAT3 protein, a copy of FLAG epitope was fused in-frame at its NH2terminus. Upon the infection by recombinant MGAT3 virus, Sf9 cell membrane extracts produced a band of ∼36 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as detected by anti-FLAG IgG immunoblots (Fig.2A, lane 2). The size of the protein is in agreement with the predicted mass. This ∼36-kDa band is missing in wild type virus and is different from that obtained with recombinant FLAG-tagged human DGAT2 (lanes 1and 3). To assess MGAT3 subcellular localization, FLAG epitope-tagged MGAT3 was expressed in COS-7 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-FLAG IgG demonstrates a reticular staining pattern in the transfected cells (Fig. 2B). This staining pattern was indistinguishable from that of calnexin, a known ER protein (data not shown). Hence we conclude that recombinant MGAT3 is localized to the ER.Aliquots of Sf9 cell membrane extracts were used to conduct MGAT assays using radioactive [14C]oleoyl-CoA as the tracer. The TLC chromatogram shows that upon the addition of exogenous 2-monooleoylglycerol as a substrate, recombinant MGAT3 membranes produced two bands corresponding to 1,2- and 1,3-DAGs, respectively (Fig. 2C, lane 5). These DAG products were missing from membrane extracts of wild type or DGAT2 virus-infected cells (lanes 4 and 6). Interestingly both MGAT3 and DGAT2 membranes produced a TAG band (lanes 5 and6), although wild type virus failed to produce detectable TAG (lane 4), indicating that the bands are due to the expression of recombinant protein. A possible explanation is that insect cell membrane possess endogenous MGAT activity, and its DAG product can be used by recombinant DGAT2 as a substrate to form TAG. This rationale argues that human MGAT3 also possesses DGAT activity. To test this possibility, exogenous DAG was added directly as a substrate. Indeed, similar to DGAT2, MGAT3 membranes were able to acylate DAG to form TAG (lanes 8 and 9). To calculate the enzymatic activity quantitatively, labeled DAG and TAG bands were cut from the TLC chromatogram and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. The specific activities of MGAT3 were ∼22.8 nmol/min/mg for DAG and ∼9.3 nmol/min/mg for TAG synthesis. The specific activities for the wild type virus were ∼0.5 nmol/min/mg for DAG and ∼0.2 nmol/min/mg for TAG, respectively. These results establish that the MGAT3 cDNA encodes a membrane protein that contains dual MGAT and DGAT activities.To assess MAG stereoisomer specificity,sn-1-monooleoylglycerol (1-MAG),sn-2-monooleoylglycerol (2-MAG), andsn-3-monopalmitoylglycerol (3-MAG) were assayed (Fig.2D). The results indicate that MGAT3 prefers 2-MAG as the substrate (compare lane 5 with lanes 2 and8) to synthesize DAG. Interestingly, regardless of which type of MAGs were used, the amount of TAG synthesized did not change. It is possible that the background MGAT activity of endogenous insect cell membrane does not possess stereospecificity for MAG. When the background level of DAG is produced, it is used by DGAT activity encoded by MGAT3 to form TAG. To test this possibility directly, DGAT2 membrane was assayed in parallel (lanes 3, 6, and9). Indeed recombinant DGAT2 membranes were able to synthesize TAG using three different MAG stereoisomers.To assess the substrate optimum for acyl-CoAs, different acyl-CoAs were assayed for their ability to acylate radioactivesn-2-[3H]monooleoylglycerol. As shown in Fig.2E, palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0) and oleoyl-CoA (C18:1) are the best substrates for MGAT3.Quantitative TaqMan PCR was used to demonstrate that MGAT3 is selectively expressed in the digestive system (Fig.3). The tissue with the highest expression steady state RNA level is ileum whose relative expression level was found to be ∼45,000 times greater than that observed in the majority of the other tissues analyzed. The tissues with the next highest expression levels make up the remaining portions of the lower gastrointestinal tract, i.e. jejunum, duodenum, colon, cecum, and the rectum. Transcripts are notably missing from the stomach and the esophagus and trachea. The only other non-gastrointestinal related tissue to show appreciable expression is the liver. These data provide further evidence that MGAT3 is the elusive MGAT gene whose expression accounts for the high level of intestinal MGAT enzyme activity. Fig. 1A shows the comparison of human MGAT3 with its homologues. It bears 49% identity, 60% similarity to DGAT2; 44% identity, 51% similarity to MGAT1; and 46% identity, 55% similarity to MGAT2, respectively. Hence MGAT3 is a novel member of the DGAT2 gene family.

DISCUSSIONIn the current study, we report the cloning and characterization of a new human MGAT cDNA, a novel member of the DGAT2 gene family. During the revision of this manuscript, another MGAT cDNA, designated MGAT2, was reported by Cao et al. (18Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 7, 10.1074/jbc.M300139200)Google Scholar). We compared sequences of the current cDNA with human MGAT2 and found that they are distinct (Fig. 1A). Hence we designate our cDNA as MGAT3.Similar to MGAT1 and -2, the recombinant human MGAT3 is capable of catalyzing MGAT enzyme reaction. Importantly MGAT3 is distinct from the other two MGAT enzymes in the following three aspects. 1) Enzymatically MGAT3 has a superior stereoselectivity in using MAG that contains an acyl-moiety at the sn-2 position; neither MGAT1 nor MGAT2 possess such stereoselectivity (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 7, 10.1074/jbc.M300139200)Google Scholar). 2) The best acyl donors for MGAT3 are palmitoyl- and oleoyl-, the two most abundant species of fatty acids found in the small intestine; the best acyl donor for MGAT1 is arachidonoyl-, which is low in abundance in the intestine (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). 3) The expression of human MGAT3 is restricted to gastrointestinal tract with its highest expression in the ileum; the expression of MGAT1 is not found in the small intestine but in the stomach (6Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the MGAT2 expression is not restricted to the small intestine but is also found in kidney and stomach. In the intestine, the major digestive products of TAG produced by pancreatic lipase are 2-MAG (4Lykidis A. Mougios V. Arzoglou P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 892-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and the long chain fatty acids palmitate and oleate (5Brindley D.N. Hubscher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 106: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Brindley D.N. Hubscher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 125: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hence the superior MGAT3 substrate selectivity for these types of fatty acids and its high level of expression in the small intestine would allow it to fulfill the physiological function of synthesizing TAG from the large quantities of free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol absorbed in the intestine. These properties of MGAT3 allow us to propose that it is indeed another elusive intestinal MGAT that is essential for intestinal fat absorption.From detergent-solubilized rat intestinal microsomes, Lehrner and Kuksis (10Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported the purification of MGAT and DGAT activities in a protein complex. In retrospect, the co-purification of these two enzyme activities could be explained by the fact that both MGAT2 and MGAT3 appear to encode dual MGAT/DGAT activities. The expression of MGAT2 and MGAT3 in the intestine and their MGAT/DGAT dual function also explain why DGAT1 knockout mice have an alternative TAG synthesis mechanism to support the fat absorption and chylomicron formation (11Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 12Buhman K.K. Smith S.J.

Melia A.T. Eggers H. Joly R. Patel I.H. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995; 35: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Lucas K.H. Kaplan-Machlis B. Ann. Pharmacother. 2001; 35: 314-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism for Orlistat, which is to inhibit pancreatic lipase, leads to the undesirable side effect of fecal leakage (15Kolanowski J. Drug Saf. 1999; 20: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An alternative approach may be to allow for the digestion of fat to fatty acids in the gut but block the uptake or the packaging of fatty acids into chylomicron particles. Inasmuch as intestinal MGAT is a critical enzyme for this pathway, MGAT2 and MGAT3 appear to be attractive therapeutic targets for the obesity treatment. The conceivable liability of inhibiting intestinal MGAT is the potential side effects associated with the accumulation of FFA and 2-MAG in the enterocytes. The molecular identification of MGAT2 and MGAT3 will facilitate the evaluation of this potential therapeutic approach. In the current study, we report the cloning and characterization of a new human MGAT cDNA, a novel member of the DGAT2 gene family.

Using intrinsically IP3R-deficient cells as the host cells for receptor expression, we determined that six of the mutants, those lacking residues 1–223, 651–1130, 1267–2110, 1845–2042, 1845–2216, and 2610–2748, did not exhibit any measurable Ca2+ release activity, whereas the mutants lacking residues 1131–1379 and 2736–2749 retained the activity. Limited trypsin digestion showed that not only the IP3-gated Ca2+-permeable mutants lacking residues 1131–1379 and 2736–2749, but also two nonfunctional mutants lacking residues 1–223 and 651–1130, retained the normal folding structure of at least the C-terminal channel-forming domain. These results indicate that two regions of IP3R1, viz. residues 1–223 and 651–1130, are critical for IP3-induced gating. We also identified a highly conserved cysteine residue at position 2613, which is located within the C-terminal tail, as being essential for channel opening. Based on these results, we propose a novel five-domain structure model in which both N-terminal and internal coupling domains transduce ligand-binding signals to the C-terminal tail, which acts as a gatekeeper that triggers opening of the activation gate of IP3R1 following IP3 binding.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar). IP3 mediates the release of Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites such as the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to the IP3 receptor (IP3R)/Ca2+ release channel. IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) regulates numerous physiological processes, including fertilization, cell proliferation, development, muscle contraction, secretion, learning, and memory. In this signal transduction pathway, the IP3R works as a switch that converts the information carried by extracellular stimuli into intracellular Ca2+ signals.IP3-gated intracellular Ca2+ release channels are composed of four IP3R subunits (2Maeda N. Kawasaki T. Nakade S. Yokota N. Taguchi T. Kasai M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1109-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least three types of IP3Rs (IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3) (3Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J.

An ion conduction pore has been proposed to be located in the hydrophobic segment between the fifth and sixth transmembrane regions (10Michikawa T. Hamanaka H. Otsu H. Yamamoto A. Miyawaki A.

The primary sequence of the transmembrane domain adjacent to the pore-forming segment is highly homologous to that of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), another type of intracellular Ca2+ release channel, suggesting that these two channels might share a common structure for the conduction of Ca2+ ions.Each IP3R subunit has a single high affinity IP3-binding site (2Maeda N. Kawasaki T. Nakade S. Yokota N. Taguchi T. Kasai M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1109-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IP3-binding core, a minimum essential region for specific IP3 binding (12Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), resides among residues 226–578 of mouse IP3R1 (2749 amino acids) (13Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), and it contains 11 essential basic amino acids for IP3 binding (14Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 225 residues, which are close to the IP3-binding core, have been thought to function as a suppressor for IP3 binding because their deletion from the N-terminal 734-amino acid region results in significant enhancement of IP3-binding activity (12Yoshikawa F.

IICR is a positively cooperative process (16Meyer T. Wensel T. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Hirota J. Michikawa T. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T.

Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1999; 23: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), i.e. the binding of at least two IP3 molecules to a single tetrameric IP3R channel is required for channel opening. IP3 binding elicits a large conformational change in the N-terminal cytoplasmic portion of the IP3R (19Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal cytoplasmic region following the transmembrane domain is thought to be involved in the IP3-induced gating of the receptor because monoclonal antibody (mAb) 18A10, whose epitope is located in the C-terminal portion of mouse IP3R1 (13Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 20Maeda N. Niinobe M. Nakahira K. Mikoshiba K. J.

J. 1991; 277: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), has an inhibitory effect on IICR, without causing any decrease in the affinity of the receptor for IP3 (21Nakade S. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Controlled trypsinization induces fragmentation of mouse IP3R1 into five major fragments, and all four N-terminal cytoplasmic fragments, which contain the IP3-binding core, are associated directly or indirectly with the remaining C-terminal fragment, which contains the channel domain (22Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The trypsinized IP3R retains significant IICR activity, indicating that intramolecular interaction within a subunit and/or intermolecular interaction between neighboring subunits could effect functional coupling between IP3 binding and channel opening (22Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the sites of the interfaces between the cytoplasmic fragments and the channel domain and the molecular mechanism of their coupling remain to be elucidated.IICR has been shown to occur in a quantal manner in permeabilized cells and isolated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (23Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Meyer T. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The addition of submaximal concentrations of IP3 in the presence of Ca2+ pump inhibitors leads to the partial release of sequestered Ca2+, and the amount of released Ca2+ varies with the concentration of IP3 (24Meyer T. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the Ca2+ release terminates abruptly, because it can be reinitiated by an additional increment in IP3concentration (24Meyer T. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3841-3845Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the rapid termination of Ca2+ release is not due to ordinary inactivation or desensitization of the receptor. Purified IP3Rs reconstituted into lipid vesicles reveal a quantal Ca2+ flux (17Hirota J. Michikawa T. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Okura I. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19046-19051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1992; 356: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), indicating that the quantal release of Ca2+ is an intrinsic property of the IP3R. Similar behavior was observed for the RyR, which mediates Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores (26Györke S. Fill M. Science. 1993; 260: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but has not been observed for other ligand-gated ion channels on the plasma membrane, suggesting that the quantal release is a fundamental and unique property of the intracellular Ca2+ release channels.To understand the molecular basis of the ligand-induced gating of the IP3R, we analyzed a series of internal deletion mutants and site-directed mutants of mouse IP3R1 expressed in intrinsically IP3R-deficient R23-11 cells (27Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We found that at least two regions and a cysteine residue are essential for IP3-dependent gating of IP3R1. These findings provide us with new insight into the gating mechanism of the IP3R.DISCUSSIONMost cells, including mammalian cultured cells, express two or all three types of the IP3R (4Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Sugiyama T. Yoneshima H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Furuichi T. Saruta T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14700-14704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 40De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Henning R.H. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Gijsens A. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, measurement of the actual channel activities of recombinant IP3Rs in most cells is difficult because of the background activities of the endogenous IP3Rs. In this study, we used R23-11 cells, which intrinsically lack all of the three IP3Rs (27Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), as the host cells to exclude the background effects of the endogenous IP3Rs. Under the conditions used, neither IP3-binding activity nor IP3-elicited Ca2+ release activity was detected in membrane fractions prepared from R23-11 cells (Fig. 3A). Wild-type IP3R1 expressed in KMN13 cells revealed affinity for IP3 (Kd = 20 ± 5 nm) (Table I) similar to that of native (31Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and recombinant (6Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1997; 322: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) mouse IP3R1 and mediated Ca2+ release from microsomal vesicles in an IP3-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Wild-type IP3R1 expressed in KMN13 cells revealed quantal Ca2+ release (Fig. 3B), which is thought to be an intrinsic property of native IP3Rs (17Hirota J. Michikawa T. Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Okura I. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19046-19051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1992; 356: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), suggesting that recombinant IP3R1 in R23-11 cells functions properly. Using this system, we determined that six of the mutants investigated in this study, those lacking residues 1–223, 651–1130, 1267–2110, 1845–2042, 1845–2216, and 2610–2748, did not exhibit any measurable Ca2+ release activity, whereas the mutants lacking residues 1131–1379 and 2736–2749 retained the activity. [3H]IP3 binding analysis showed that all of these nonfunctional mutants except D1–223 possessed lower IP3-binding affinity (Table I). However, 98.57 of the receptors of even the lowest affinity mutant, D651–1130, whoseKd is 150 nm (Table I), would have been occupied when 10 ॖm IP3 was applied. Therefore, the decrease in IP3-binding affinity is unlikely to be the primary cause of the loss of function of these mutants. The limited trypsin digestion of the crude membrane fractions prepared from the mutant-expressing cells showed that not only the IP3-gated Ca2+-permeable mutants, D1131–1379 and D2736–2749, but two nonfunctional mutants, D1–223 and D651–1130, generated fragments IV and V (Fig. 4). All of these mutants except D1131–1379 exhibited trypsin sensitivity similar to that of wild-type IP3R1, indicating that these mutants retain a normal folding structure in at least the C-terminal channel-forming domain. Immunocytochemical staining suggested that all of the mutants were localized on the Ca2+ stores of the cells (data not shown). Hence, we concluded that at least two regions, viz. regions 1–223 and 651–1130, are required for the IP3-dependent gating of IP3R1.The Critical Region 1–223 Is Known as a Suppressor of IP3 BindingDeletion of the residues on the N-terminal side of the IP3-binding core has a complicated effect on the IP3-binding activity (12Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A short deletion of the N-terminal 31 residues from the N-terminal 734-amino acid region results in a significant reduction in binding activity even though the mutant includes the entire IP3-binding core sequence. Such effects are also found in serial N-terminal deletions up to 215 residues. However, the binding activity recovers when deleted up to the first 220, 223, or 225 amino acids. The mutant lacking the first 223 amino acids shows >10-fold higher affinity for IP3 than does the parental N-terminal 734-amino acid region. Based on these results, Yoshikawa et al. (41Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 328-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) proposed that the first ∼225 N-terminal amino acids function as a suppressor of IP3 binding. In this study, we found that D1–223 had 10-fold higher affinity for IP3 than did wild-type IP3R1 (Table I). In addition, we found that the IP3 binding of D1–223 was positively cooperative (TableI), indicating that the intersubunit interaction may be elicited (or modified) in the tetrameric complex composed of D1–223. Limited trypsin digestion showed that the mutant is likely to retain the normal folding structure of the C-terminal channel-forming domain (Fig.4D). Surprisingly, D1–223 did not exhibit any measurable Ca2+ release activity (Fig. 3A). These data therefore clearly indicate that residues 1–223 are required for the functional coupling between IP3 binding and channel opening.Homer (42Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K.

Homer forms an adaptor complex that couples between group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and IP3Rs, and it has recently been reported to be capable of associating with RyR1 and up-regulating its Ca2+ release activity (44Feng W.

The Homer-binding motif (PPXXFR) is present in residues 49–54 (PPKKFR) of mouse IP3R1 (42Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Calmodulin interacts with residues 49–81 and 106–128 in a Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent manner (43Sienaert I. Nadif Kasri N. Vanlingen S. Parys J.B. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These binding proteins within the critical region 1–223 may modulate the gating of IP3R1.The Critical Region 651–1130 Is Close to the IP3-binding CoreIn region 651–1130 of IP3R1, the alternative splicing site (between amino acids 917 and 918) referred to as SIII is present (45Nucifora Jr., F.C. Li S.H. Danoff S. Ullrich A. Ross C.A. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the functional significance of the SIII segment (nine residues) has not yet been elucidated. There are three possible Ca2+-binding sites within regions 660–745, 741–849, and 994–1059 (46Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that region 651–1130 is involved in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of IP3R function. Recently, Bosanac et al. (14Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) unveiled the three-dimensional structure of the IP3-binding domain (residues 224–604) that covers the IP3-binding core (residues 226–578) of IP3R1 in the presence of IP3. The IP3-binding domain forms an asymmetric boomerang-like structure that consists of an N-terminal औ-trefoil domain (residues 224–436) and a C-terminal α-helical domain (residues 437–604) containing three armadillo repeat-like folds. IP3 fits into a cleft formed by these two arms of the boomerang. Our data described here suggest that region 651–1130, which immediately follows the IP3-binding core, is essential for IP3-induced gating of the channel. What kind of roles does this region have? It is known that other proteins containing armadillo repeats such as औ-catenin (47Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and importins (48Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) have >10 repeats. Based on the analysis of the amino acid sequence of IP3R1, Bosanac et al. (14Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) suggested that, in IP3R1, the armadillo repeat-like folds extend to the C-terminal region of the IP3-binding core. It is predicted that many α-helical domains are formed over the entire region 651–1130 (14Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and deletion of residues 1131–1379 did not abolish the IP3-dependent Ca2+ release activity (Fig. 3A). We therefore speculate that the armadillo repeat-like fold-containing α-helical domain, which is essential for IP3-induced gating, is formed within residues 440–1130. This region might constitute part of the bridge that connects the IP3-dependent conformational change in the IP3R with channel opening.Recently, Hamada et al. (49Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) showed that the purified IP3R from mouse cerebellum contains two distinctive structures: a windmill-like structure and a square-shaped structure. Ca2+ reversibly promotes transition from the square- to the windmill-shaped structure, with relocation of the four peripheral IP3-binding domains. This observation predicts the presence of a hinge region that changes its conformation drastically following Ca2+ binding to the receptor. Hamada et al. (49Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) examined the Ca2+-dependent structural change of the purified IP3R by limited protease digestion analysis. The results show that a 38-kDa fragment detected using anti-IP3R1 mAb 4C11 is specifically generated by cleavage in a solution containing CaCl2, but not in an EDTA-containing solution. The epitope of antibody 4C11 was mapped within residues 679–727 in IP3R1 (13Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar); and therefore, region 651–1130 found in this study is a strong candidate for the hinge region. The presence of Ca2+-binding sites within this region (46Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) also supports this hypothesis.Nonfunctional Mutants D1267–2110, D1845–2042, and D1845–2216Because the nonfunctional mutants D1267–2110, D1845–2042, and D1845–2216 do not have cleavage sites between tryptic fragments IV and V (Arg1931, Arg1923, or Lys1924) (22Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we could not evaluate the folding structure of the C-terminal channel-forming domain of these mutants. Therefore, we did not determine whether the deleted regions include critical regions for activation gating or whether the deletions simply distort the structure of the receptor. Notably, the deleted regions in these mutants include (or are close to) the Ca2+ sensor region found in IP3R1 (50Miyakawa T. Mizushima A. Hirose K. Yamazawa T. Bezprozvanny I. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ is a co-agonist for the IP3R (51Finch E.A. Turner T.J. Goldin S.M. Science. 1991; 252: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar); and thus, the IP3- and Ca2+-binding signals must be combined on the IP3R. More detailed analysis of the regions deleted in these mutants may help us to better understand the molecular mechanism of gating, in particular, the Ca2+-dependent processes during channel opening.Region 2610–2748 May Be Required for the Correct Folding of IP3R1The C-terminal region following the sixth transmembrane region may play some part in channel gating of the IP3R because mAbs that recognize this region have been reported to either inhibit (21Nakade S. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or enhance (52Fadool D.A. Ache B.W. Neuron. 1992; 9: 907-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) IICR. In addition, it has been suggested that the C terminus is involved in subunit assembly of the IP3R channel complex (6Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y. Yoshikawa S. Nakagawa T. Saitoh T. Mikoshiba K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been shown that, although a truncation mutant of IP3R1 that lacks all of the transmembrane regions and the succeeding C terminus (amino acids 2218–2749) is present as a monomer, a deletion mutant that lacks only the transmembrane regions (amino acids 2112–2605) forms dimers (6Miyawaki A.

A. 1991; 88: 4911-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting that the C-terminal 144 amino acids (positions 2606–2749) are involved in the intersubunit interaction of IP3R1. Facilitation of multimer formation of mutant IP3Rs with two or more transmembrane regions is observed if the mutants are fused to the C-terminal 145 residues (9Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol.

These proteins, including the small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1), utilize a conjugation system that is similar to ubiquitination (14Hay R.T. Trends Biochem.

For example, SUMO-1 conjugation of RanGAP1 is necessary for its localization to the nuclear pore complex (22Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

On the other hand, as a common partner for TGF-β signaling, Smad4 does not appear to be regulated directly by TGF-β receptors or any other factors. Thus, given the key role of Smad4 in TGF-β responses, it is important to study the regulation of Smad4 by other cellular pathways. In this study, we elucidate the involvement of the SUMO-1 conjugation pathway in regulating Smad4 activity. Smad4 is modified by SUMO-1 in vivo. SUMO-1 modification greatly enhances TGF-β signaling. Thus, we propose that posttranslational modification of Smad4 by SUMO-1 conjugation provides a unique mechanism to modulate the biological activity of Smad4.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Cell Lines, and Transfections—Mammalian expression plasmids for epitope (HA or FLAG)-tagged Smad and Gal4-Smad proteins were described previously (28Feng X.-H.

Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). pJG4-5-Ubc9 was obtained by releasing the Ubc9 cDNA insert from pXF2F-Ubc9 using EcoRI and SalI and subcloning it in EcoRI-XhoI sites of pJG4-5. Plasmids were transformed into yeast EGY48 using Alkali cation (BIO 101, Inc.), and protein-protein interactions were assessed by scoring β-galactosidase activity as reporter.Immunoprecipitation, Ni-NTA Precipitation, and Western Blot—For Ni-NTA precipitation, HeLa cells were transfected with His-tagged Smad4 and FLAG-tagged SUMO-1. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were sonicated in guanidine lysis buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m NaPO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8). His-tagged Smad4 was immobilized on Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) and eluted in elution buffer (200 mm imidazole, 5% SDS, 0.15 m Tris, pH 6.7, 30% glycerol, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol). Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-His or anti-Smad4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for Smad4 and anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-SUMO-1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for SUMO-conjugated Smad4 protein. Antibody-bound proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce).Immunoprecipitations using anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody essentially were carried out as described (28Feng X.-H. Zhang Y.

Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To detect sumoylation of endogenous Smad4, cells were subjected to lysis in a buffer containing FLAG lysis buffer (31Feng X.-H. Liang Y.-Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% SDS and 20 mm isopeptidase inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide. Cell lysates then were diluted with the same buffer without SDS to achieve an SDS concentration of 0.5%. Immunoprecipitation of Smad4 was performed using anti-Smad4 antibody (B8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described (31Feng X.-H. Liang Y.-Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Gel Shift Assays—Gel shift assays using nuclear extract were performed as described previously (28Feng X.-H. Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 29Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A 10-μl reaction contained nuclear extract, as specified in the text, in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). The reaction was incubated with 100,000 dpm of 32P-labeled probe at room temperature for 30 min. A DNA probe containing the Mix.2 activin-responsive element (32Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) was used. DNA-protein complexes were separated in a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (Tris borate/EDTA) buffer and visualized by autoradiography.Transcription Reporter Assays—Plasmid SBE-luc, which contains the luciferase gene under control of the Smad-binding elements (SBE) (35), was used to measure TGF-β- and Smad-induced transcription. Transfections, TGF-β treatment, and reporter assays were carried out as described (29Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 31Feng X.-H. Liang Y.-Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Generally, exponentially grown cells at 25–30% confluency were transfected with expression plasmids for Smads and/or reporter plasmids. 40–45 h after transfection, cells were treated with 200 pm TGF-β for 12 h. Cells then were harvested for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All assays were done in triplicate, and all values were normalized for transfection efficiency against β-galactosidase activity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of Ubc9 as a Candidate Smad4-interacting Protein—To search for regulators of Smad4, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using Smad4 as bait. A cDNA library derived from human ovarian epithelial HeLa cells was screened. Results showed three clones isolated in the screen were identical to Ubc9. Ubc9 is an E2 conjugating enzyme required for covalent modification of the SUMO proteins (19Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).We next analyzed whether Ubc9 could interact with various Smads. In a two-hybrid analysis, two R-Smads, i.e. Smad1 (bone morphogenetic protein-specific) and Smad3 (TGF-β/activin-specific), were included for their interactions with Ubc9. Smad4 exhibited a strong interaction with Ubc9, whereas Smad1 or Smad3 was unable to interact with Ubc9 in yeast cells (Fig. 1A). Thus, analysis of the results showed a specific interaction of Ubc9 with Smad4.Smad4 has two conserved domains, MH1 at the amino terminus and MH2 at the carboxyl terminus, which are linked by a divergent linker region (Fig. 1C). To map the Ubc9-interacting domain of Smad4, we created a series of Smad4 deletion mutants. Deletions of the MH2 domain or of MH2 together with the linker region did not alter the ability of Smad4 to bind to Ubc9, whereas deletion of the MH1 domain and part of the linker region completely abolished the interaction between Smad4 and Ubc9 (Fig. 1B). Further deletion analysis narrowed the Ubc9-interacting domain of Smad4 down to the region of amino acids 2–186 (Fig. 1B).Smad4 Is Sumoylated at Two Evolutionarily Conserved Lysine Residues, Lys-113 and Lys-159 —Because Ubc9 is the E2 enzyme for sumoylation, we sought to determine whether Smad4 is a substrate for the SUMO-1 conjugation. We first tested Smad4-SUMO conjugation in transfected cells. Extracts from HeLa cells that were transfected with expression plasmids for His-tagged Smad4 and FLAG-tagged SUMO-1 were subjected to precipitation with Ni-NTA-agarose beads in a lysis buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl. The precipitates then were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to SUMO-1. Two protein bands in the range of 80 to 100 kDa were detected by anti-SUMO antibody in Ni-NTA precipitates only when Smad4 and SUMO-1 were cotransfected (Fig. 2A, top). To verify whether these bands represent SUMO modification on Smad4, we stripped the same membrane and reblotted it with Smad4 antibody. Two Smad4-SUMO conjugates in addition to free Smad4 were detected (Fig. 2A, bottom). Because SUMO-1 often migrates at 20 kDa, the 80–100-kDa bands represent the addition of one to two SUMO-1 molecules to Smad4. Furthermore, an estimated 30% of Smad4 was sumoylated under these conditions.Fig. 2Smad4 is sumoylated on two evolutionarily conserved lysine residues.A, Smad4 is sumoylated. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids for His-tagged Smad4. His-tagged proteins were pulled down using Ni-NTA-agarose beads. Sumoylation was determined first with anti-SUMO antibody (αSUMO, top). The same Western blot was stripped and then reblotted with anti-Smad4 antibody (αSmad4, bottom). IB, immunoblotting. B, Smad4 sumoylation site is located in its amino-terminal 186 amino acids. Open arrowheads, free Smad4; filled arrowheads, Smad4-SUMO conjugates; NS, a nonspecific band. Smad3, not sumoylated, also is indicated. C, Smad4 mutants carrying individual point mutation on a specific Lys residue were tested for their sumoylation. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids for His-tagged Smad4 mutants, which were retrieved using Ni-NTA-agarose beads. Sumoylated Smad4 was determined with anti-FLAG Western blotting (top) or anti-His antibody Western blotting (bottom) on two separate blots. WT, wild type. D, Smad4 is sumoylated on Lys-113 and Lys-159. Analysis is as described for C.

Two conserved Lys residues are marked in bold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SUMO-1 is attached to the lysine residues of target proteins. We next mapped the lysine residues of Smad4 that were modified by SUMO-1. Deletion analysis of Smad4 showed that sumoylation could be observed on the amino acid 2–186 fragment that spanned both the MH1 domain (amino acids 2–154) and part of the linker region (amino acids 154–184) but not on the amino acid 184–552 fragment containing the linker MH2 domain, indicating that sumoylation sites were located in the first 186 amino acids (Fig. 2B), which coincides with the Ubc9-interacting region on Smad4 (Fig. 1B).In the amino acid 2–186 region of Smad4, the sequence around Lys-159 (amino acids 157–161, MVKDE) matched perfectly with the consensus sumoylation motif (ψKXE, where “ψ” represents a hydrophobic amino acid and “X” represents any amino acid). We created a mutant named Smad4 (K159R), in which Lys-159 was changed into a similarly charged Arg residue. Our data showed that Smad4 (K159R) only abolished the slower migrating SUMO-1-conjugated form, suggesting that Lys-159 represents only one of the SUMO-1 modification sites on Smad4 (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, another consensus sumoylation motif at Lys-122 (amino acids 120–124, DLKCD) was not sumoylated, as the K122R mutant behaved like wild-type Smad4 (Fig. 2C). To identify the other site, we mutated each individual Lys residue in the MH1 domain and analyzed the sumoylation profile of these mutants (data not shown). We found that only mutation at Lys-113 affected the modification of Smad4. Also noteworthy is that Smad4 (K113R) abolished only the faster migrating form (Fig. 2D). Simultaneous mutation at both sites, as in Smad4 (K113R/K159R), completely prevented the sumoylation of Smad4 (Fig. 2D).Smad4 is an evolutionarily conserved common Smad partner for TGF-β signaling. A comparison of the sumoylation sites of human Smad4 with the same region from other organisms revealed that the positions of the two sumoylated lysines are highly conserved (Fig. 2E). The two conserved lysine residues are absent from other members of the Smad family, i.e. R-Smads and inhibitory Smads (data not shown). This suggests that sumoylation of Smad4 is specific and remains highly conserved throughout evolution.SUMO-1 Modification of Endogenous Smad4 —We next examined endogenous Smad4-SUMO conjugation in vivo. Epithelial HeLa, HM3, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were lysed in a buffer containing SDS and isopeptidase inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide. The cytosols were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Smad4 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to SUMO-1 or Smad4. Results showed that two bands of 80–100 kDa representing Smad4-SUMO conjugates were detected by anti-SUMO-1 or anti-Smad4 antibody in anti-Smad4 immuno-precipitates from HeLa cells (Fig. 3, left). In contrast, control antibody (IgG) did not retrieve Smad4 or sumoylated Smad4 proteins. The estimated amount of sumoylated Smad4 occupied about 20% of total Smad4 level. Transfection of SUMO-1 increased the level of sumoylated Smad4, reaching ∼40% of the sumoylated form (Fig. 3, left, lane 1). The same two endogenous Smad4-SUMO conjugates also were observed in HM3 and Chinese hamster ovary cells (Fig. 3, right) and in HaCaT cells (data not shown). Thus, our data suggest that Smad4 is sumoylated in vivo under physiological conditions.Fig. 3Smad4 is sumoylated under physiological conditions. Endogenous Smad4 is sumoylated. Cytosols from HeLa, which were transfected with FLAG-SUMO or an empty vector, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were incubated with anti-Smad4 antibody, control IgG conjugated to protein A/G beads, or just protein A/G beads and were analyzed for sumoylation with anti-SUMO antibody (top) or anti-Smad4 antibody (bottom).

In RI-14 mink epithelial cells, TGF-β induced endogenous Smad2-Smad4 interaction (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 3). Expression of SUMO-1 did not alter the TGF-β-induced Smad complex formation (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 1 and 3). We also tested the ability of the Smad4 (K113R/K159R) mutant to form a complex with Smad2. The results showed that in 293 cells, TGF-β (activated TGF-β receptor type I) induced Smad2 interaction with either wild-type Smad4 or mutant Smad4 with no detectable differences (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Mutation in the sumoylation sites has no effect on the formation of a Smad activator complex.A, formation of an endogenous Smad2-Smad4 complex. RI-14 cells (a TGF-β type I receptor-expressing clone of highly transfectable Mv1Lu-L17 cells) were transfected with SUMO (lanes 2 and 4) with 60% transfection efficiency and treated with TGF-β (lanes 3 and 4). A Smad2-Smad4 complex was detected by anti-Smad4 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-Smad2 Western blot. Expression levels of Smad2 and Smad4 also are shown. B, Smad4 (K113R/K159R) retains the ability to interact with Smad2. Experimentation and analysis were done in 293 cells. W, wild-type Smad4; M, K113R/K159R mutant of Smad4; act. TβRI, constitutive active TGF-β type I receptor. C, assembly of the ARF. SW480.7 cells were transfected with indicated plasmids for FAST, Smad2, Smad4, activated TGF-β type I receptor, and SUMO.

ARF, free DNA, and nonspecific bands are marked. m, Smad4 (K113R/K159R) mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then investigated whether SUMO-1 or K113R/K159R mutation could influence the formation of a Smad activator complex on the TGF-β-responsive promoter. In the activin-responsive Mix.2 promoter, Smad4 is essential in the assembly of activin-responsive factor (ARF) complex, which also contains Smad2 and the forkhead protein FAST1 (32Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). To examine ARF formation, we used SW480.7 cells, which lack expression of endogenous Smad4. As shown in Fig. 4C, in the absence of FAST1 or Smad2/4, no ARF was formed (lanes 1–4). TGF-β receptor activation stimulated the formation of ARF (Fig. 4C, lane 8). Mutation of K113R/K159R did not affect the ability of Smad4 to form ARF complex (Fig. 4C, lane 10). Furthermore, SUMO-1 expression in SW480.7 cells did not produce any effects on the formation of ARF complex (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 11 and 12 and lanes 13 and 14).Stimulation of TGF-β Signaling Activity by SUMO through Smad4 Stabilization—To investigate the functional consequence of Smad4 sumoylation in TGF-β signaling, we tested whether overexpression of SUMO-1 and Ubc9 exerted any stimulatory or inhibitory effects on TGF-β-induced transcription. To avoid any interference of other DNA-binding cofactors, we examined the TGF-β-dependent induction by utilizing SBE-luc, a Smad-responsive synthetic reporter gene that depends solely on Smad activation. SBE-luc contains four copies of SBE linked to a luciferase reporter gene (35). TGF-β normally induced a 5–10-fold increase in the SBE-luc reporter gene activity in RI-14 cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, cotransfection of SUMO-1 increased the reporter gene activity in response to TGF-β. Additionally, the combination of SUMO-1 and Ubc9 was the most potent in stimulating SBE reporter activity. Even in the presence of overexpressed Smad3 and Smad4, SUMO-1 and Ubc9 exerted additional activation on the SBE reporter response (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Activation of TGF-β signaling by Smad4 sumoylation.A, SUMO/Ubc9 activates SBE-luc activity. Mink lung epithelial RI-14 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. TGF-β treatment and the luciferase reporter assay are described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, stimulatory effect of SUMO requires Smad4. The assay was performed as described for panel A except that Smad4-deficient SW480.7 cells were used. C, dosage-dependent effect of SUMO on Smad4 stability. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of His-tagged wild-type (WT) Smad4 or K113R/K159R mutant, together with increasing the amount (μg) of FLAG-SUMO-1 cDNA. Ni-NTA precipitation (Ni-NTA ppt) and Western blotting were as described for Fig. 2. An asterisk indicates a nonspecific band. D, ubiquitination of Smad4 and its KR mutant. HeLa cells were transfected both with His-tagged wild-type Smad4 or Smad4 (K113R/K159R) and with HA-ubiquitin.

https://openalex.org/W2068046759,"A loss of functional androgen receptor and an enhanced expression of growth factor receptors and associated ligands are causal genetic events in prostate cancer (PCA) progression. These genetic alterations lead to an epigenetic mechanism where a feedback autocrine loop between membrane receptor and ligand (e.g. EGFR-TGFalpha) results in a constitutive activation of MAPK-Elk1-AP1-mediated mitogenic signaling in human PCA at an advanced and androgen-independent stage. We rationalized that inhibiting these epigenetic events could be useful in controlling advanced PCA growth. Recently, we found that grape seed extract (GSE), a dietary supplement rich in flavonoid procyanidins, inhibits advanced and androgen-independent human PCA DU145 cell growth in culture and nude mice. Here, we performed detailed mechanistic studies to define the effect of GSE on EGFR-Shc-MAPK-Elk1-AP1-mediated mitogenic signaling in DU145 cells. Pretreatment of serum-starved cells with GSE resulted in 70% to almost complete inhibition of EGF-induced EGFR activation and 50% to complete inhibition of Shc activation, which corroborated with a comparable decrease in EGF-induced Shc binding to EGFR. Conversely, EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited only by lower doses of GSE; in fact, higher doses showed an increase. Additional studies showed that GSE alone causes a dose- and time-dependent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in starved DU145 cells that is inhibited by an MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Independent of this increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, GSE showed a strong inhibition of ERK1/2 kinase activity to Elk1 in both cellular and cell-free systems. GSE treatment of cells also inhibited both EGF-induced and constitutively active Elk1 phosphorylation and AP1 activation. GSE treatment also showed DNA synthesis inhibition in starved and EGF-stimulated cells as well as loss of cell viability and apoptotic death that was further increased by adding MEK1 inhibitor. Since GSE strongly induced apoptosis independent of its affect on an increase in phospho-ERK1/2, we hypothesized that apoptotic effect of GSE could be by other mechanism(s) including its effect on stress-associated MAPK, the JNK. Indeed, GSE-treated cells showed a strong and sustained increase in phospho-JNK1/JNK2 levels, JNK activity and phospho-cJun levels. An inhibition of GSE-induced JNK activation by a novel JNK inhibitor SP600125 resulted in a significant reversal of GSE-induced apoptotic death suggesting the involvement of JNK activation by GSE in its apoptosis response. Together, these results suggest that anticancer effects of GSE in PCA be mediated via impairment of EGFR-ERK1/2-Elk1-AP1-mediated mitogenic signaling and activation of JNK causing growth inhibition and apoptosis, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1997124286,"Voltage-gated K+(Kv) 2.1 is the dominant Kv channel that controls membrane repolarization in rat islet औ-cells and downstream insulin exocytosis. We recently showed that exocytotic SNARE protein SNAP-25 directly binds and modulates rat islet औ-cell Kv 2.1 channel protein at the cytoplasmic N terminus. We now show that SNARE protein syntaxin 1A (Syn-1A) binds and modulates rat islet औ-cell Kv2.1 at its cytoplasmic C terminus (Kv2.1C). In HEK293 cells overexpressing Kv2.1, we observed identical effects of channel inhibition by dialyzed GST-Syn-1A, which could be blocked by Kv2.1C domain proteins (C1: amino acids 412–633, C2: amino acids 634–853), but not the Kv2.1 cytoplasmic N terminus (amino acids 1–182). This was confirmed by direct binding of GST-Syn-1A to the Kv2.1C1 and C2 domains proteins. These findings are in contrast to our recent report showing that Syn-1A binds and modulates the cytoplasmic N terminus of neuronal Kv1.1 and not by its C terminus. Co-expression of Syn-1A in Kv2.1-expressing HEK293 cells inhibited Kv2.1 surfacing, which caused a reduction of Kv2.1 current density. In addition, Syn-1A caused a slowing of Kv2.1 current activation and reduction in the slope factor of steady-state inactivation, but had no affect on inactivation kinetics or voltage dependence of activation. Taken together, SNAP-25 and Syn-1A mediate secretion not only through its participation in the exocytotic SNARE complex, but also by regulating membrane potential and calcium entry through their interaction with Kv and Ca2+ channels. In contrast to Ca2+ channels, where these SNARE proteins act on a common synprint site, the SNARE proteins act not only on distinct sites within a Kv channel, but also on distinct sites between different Kv channel families. Voltage-gated K+(Kv) 2.1 is the dominant Kv channel that controls membrane repolarization in rat islet औ-cells and downstream insulin exocytosis.

Vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is initiated by the sensing of Ca2+ by the vesicle protein synaptotagmin. This is followed by, through yet unclear mechanisms, core complex formation by SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) proteins, which involve another vesicle protein synaptobrevin (vesicle-SNARE) and two plasma membrane SNARE proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1 (target-SNAREs) (1Gerber S.H.

Neher E. Science. 2002; 298: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It is proposed that core complex formation brings the two apposing membranes together and liberates the energy required to drive lipid re-orientation during fusion (1Gerber S.H. Sudhof T.C.

SNARE proteins have been known to be tethered to various VDCC, and thus such a protein complex may provide rapid release response with SNARE proteins exposed to a high local Ca2+concentration permeating through the VDCCs, which in turn are being modulated by the SNARE proteins (4Seagar M.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because of such an intimate physical and functional coupling, the secretory vesicle-SNARE protein-Ca2+ channel complex has been termed excitosome (6Atlas D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides their participation in membrane fusion, SNARE proteins appear to have a regulatory role on other components (i.e. membrane ion channels) of the exocytotic process. During increased glucose metabolism, a high intracellular ATP to ADP concentration ratio ([ATP]/[ADP]) causes inhibition of pancreatic islet औ-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) channels, which in turn results in depolarization and consequently insulin release (9Nichols C.G. Koster J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E403-E412PubMed Google Scholar). Outward currents carried by voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels in औ-cells are responsible for repolarization, which results in closure of VDCC and subsequent termination of exocytosis (10Hille B.

The role for these Kv channels in औ-cell excitation-secretion coupling is of clinical therapeutic importance, as blocking Kv channels with pharmacological agents can prolong depolarization and enhance Ca2+ entry, and thereby sustain insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner (14Henquin J.C.

Although SNARE protein-Ca2+ channel interaction has been studied in great detail, little is known about SNARE protein-Kv channel interaction. Recently, using the Xenopusoocyte expression system and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we have shown that SNAP-25 and Syn-1A physically interact with Kv1.1 and Kv2.1 (16Ji J. Tsuk S.

Functionally, SNAP-25 inhibits Kv1.1 and Kv2.1 currents, and such inhibition was mediated through binding of SNAP-25 to the Kv1.1 and Kv2.1 cytoplasmic N termini (16Ji J. Tsuk S. Salapatek A.M.

We have also shown that Syn-1A has a concentration-dependent biphasic effect on Kv1.1 current amplitudes: at low concentration it enhances current without affecting surface channel expression while at high concentration it decreases current amplitude probably by reducing surface channel expression (18Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we further demonstrated that Syn-1A also binds to the cytoplasmic N terminus of Kv1.1, at the T1A domain and forms a stable complex with Gऔγ subunits (19Michaelevski I. Chikvashvili D.

In this work, we surprisingly found that Syn-1A binds to the cytoplasmic C terminus of islet औ-cell Kv2.1 channel protein and modulates channel properties. Syn-1A, when overexpressed, also inhibited Kv2.1 surface expression and reduced Kv2.1 current density in heterologous HEK293 cells. Although SNARE protein interactions with Kv channels follow a similar paradigm as the Ca2+ channels, the interacting domains within and between the Kv channel families seem to be distinct in contrast to the highly conserved synprint site (cytoplasmic II-III loop) between the Ca2+ channel families (4–6,8). HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in 57 CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml, 100 ॖg/ml) (Invitrogen). The cells were transiently transfected with GFP and Kv2.1 with or without Syn-1A using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and placed in 35-mm dishes for voltage-clamp experiments. Transfected cells were identified by visualization of the fluorescence of the co-expressed GFPs. Rat pancreatic islets were isolated by collagenase digestion as described previously (17MacDonald P.E. Wang G. Tsuk S. Dodo C. Kang Y. Tang L. Wheeler M.B. Cattral M.S. Lakey J.R. Salapatek A.M. Lotan I. Gaisano H.Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Islets were dispersed to single cells by treatment with 0.0157 trypsin (Invitrogen) in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Islet cells were plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes and cultured in low glucose Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (2.5 mm glucose) supplemented with 7.57 fetal bovine serum, 0.257 HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd.), and 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Islet cells were cultured for 2 days before electrophysiological recordings. The vectors pcDNA3-Kv2.1, pcDNA3-Syntaxin 2, and pcDNA3-Syntaxin 1A were generously provided by Dr. R. Joho (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and Richard Scheller (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). The coding sequences corresponding to N-terminal region (1–182) of Kv 2.1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into pGEX-5X-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) for generation of GST fusion proteins. The primers used for PCR were 5′-ATGACGAAGCATGGCTCGC (sense) and 5′-CACCGACGAGTTGGGCT (antisense). The plasmids pGEX-4T-1-Kv2.1-C1 (the region corresponding to amino acids 412–633) and pGEX-4T-1-Kv2.1-C2 (the region corresponding to amino acids 634–853) were similarly generated. These constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. pGEX-4T-1-syntaxin-1A (wild type) is a gift from Dr. W. Trimble (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). GST fusion protein expression and purification were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Syn-1A was obtained by cleavage of GST-Syn-1A with thrombin (Sigma). GST (as a control) and GST-Kv2.1-N or -C1 or -C2 (500 pmol of protein each) were bound to glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with thrombin-cleaved Syn-1A (500 pmol of protein) in 200 ॖl of binding buffer (25 mmHEPES pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.17 gelatin, 0.17 Triton X-100, 0.17 bovine serum albumin, and 0.27 औ -mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C for 2 h with constant agitation. The beads were then washed two times with washing buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mm KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 57 glycerol, and 0.17 Triton X-100. The samples were then separated on 157 SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and identified with specific primary antibody against Syn-1A (1:2000) (Sigma). HEK293 cells were voltage-clamped in the whole-cell configuration (20Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar) using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany) as we previously described (7Kang Y.

Recording pipettes were pulled from 1.5-mm borosilicate glass capillary tubes (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) using a programmable micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument). Pipettes were then fire-polished and tip resistances ranged from 1.5–3 MΩ (for HEK cells) or 2.5–4 MΩ (for औ-cells) when filled with intracellular solution, containing (in mm): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 5 MgATP (pH 7.25 adjusted with KOH). Bath solution contained (mm): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 adjusted with NaOH). After a whole-cell configuration was established, membrane potential was held at −70 mV and outward currents were triggered with depolarizing voltage pulses (+70 mV, 250 ms). Steady-state outward currents was determined as the mean current in the final 95–997 of the 250-ms pulse. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). Data for voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation were fit by the Boltzmann equation:I/Imax = 1/{1 + exp[(V − V12)/k]}, where V12 is the half-maximal activation potential (for voltage dependence of activation) or the half-maximal inactivation potential (for steady-state inactivation), and k the slope factor. Results are presented as means ± S.E. Unpaired Student'st test was employed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (17MacDonald P.E. Wang G. Tsuk S. Dodo C. Kang Y. Tang L. Wheeler M.B. Cattral M.S. Lakey J.R. Salapatek A.M.

Transfected HEK cells were fixed with 1007 methanol on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-treated glass slides. The slides were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies, including mouse monoclonal anti-Kv2.1 (1:100) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-syntaxin-1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) (1:100) and rabbit anti-syntaxin-2 (1:200, kindly provided by Dr. V. Olkkonen, National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland). The slides were rinsed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.17 saponin and treated with secondary antibodies (FITC sheep anti-mouse IgG 1:500 or Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:250) for 1 h. Next, they were incubated with 0.17 p-phenylenediamine (ICN, Cleveland, OH) in glycerol and examined using a laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM-410; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). FITC signal was visualized by excitation at a wavelength of 488 nm and emitted fluorescence was measured through a 515- to 540-nm bandpass filter. Texas Red signal was visualized by an excitation wavelength of 568 nm and emitted fluorescence was detected through a 590-nm long-pass filter. Two days after transfection HEK293 cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were further washed with borate buffer (154 mmNaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm boric acid, pH 9.0) and then incubated in 5 ml of Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) (0.5 mg/ml) in borate buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with ice-cold quenching buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3), cells were solubilized on ice in 500 ॖl of immunoprecipitation buffer (17 deoxycholic acid, 17 Triton X-100, 0.17 SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was retained. 50 ॖl of immobilized streptavidin resin (Pierce) (507 slurry in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mmNaN3) was added to the supernatant, which was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 8,000 × g, and the resin was washed five times with immunoprecipitaton buffer. The protein was eluted from the resin by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 57 2-mercaptoethanol and incubation at 65 °C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed for Kv2.1 expression by Western blotting using anti-Kv2.1 (1:1000, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). Integrated density of the bands was determined using a commercial software (Scion Image Beta 4.02; Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). We had previously shown that Kv2.1 channels account for ∼607 of the outward current in rat islet औ-cells (15MacDonald P.E. Sewing S. Wang J. Joseph J.W. Smukler S.R. Sakellaropoulos G. Wang J.

Fig.1A shows the current-voltage relationships of outward K+ currents in rat islet औ-cells after an 8-min dialysis with various fusion proteins. For clarity, the results are presented as bar graphs at two positive voltages, which triggered outward currents (+10 and +60 mV) (Fig. 1, B andC). GST alone was used as a control that by itself did not cause any significant effect on औ-cell outward K+currents (data not shown). GST-Syn-1A (1 ॖm) caused a 26 and 227 reduction (p < 0.05) in current density at +10 and +60 mV, respectively. We then examined whether this is mediated via the cytoplasmic N terminus (amino acids 1–182) as we had reported with Kv1.1 (16Ji J. Tsuk S. Salapatek A.M. Huang X. Chikvashvili D. Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Sheu L. Tsushima R. Diamant N. Trimble W.S. Lotan I. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20195-20204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or with the cytoplasmic C terminus (amino acids 411–853). Since the cytoplasmic C terminus of Kv2.1 is quite large and difficult to generate the recombinant protein, we generated two smaller sections of this protein, C1 (412–633) and C2 (634–853). Surprisingly, we found that co-dialysis with C1 and/or C2 prevented Syn-1A from inhibiting the Kv2.1 currents, with C2 being more effective than C1, whereas the cytoplasmic Kv2.1 N terminus had no effect on Syn-1A actions. These data suggest that Syn-1A inhibited औ-cell Kv2.1 currents by interacting with the Kv2.1 C terminus. We next investigated whether the interactions between Syn-1A and the Kv2.1 C1 and C2 domains are direct by direct protein binding studies and functional studies using a heterologous expression model system (i.e. HEK293), which has little if any endogenous expression of these proteins (22Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding assay and electrophysiological data from our previous reports (16Ji J. Tsuk S. Salapatek A.M. Huang X. Chikvashvili D. Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Sheu L. Tsushima R. Diamant N. Trimble W.S. Lotan I. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggest that SNAP-25 inhibits Kv1.1 and Kv2.1 current by binding to the cytoplasmic N terminus. We have also shown that Syn-1A binds to the N terminus of Kv1.1 (19Michaelevski I. Chikvashvili D. Tsuk S. Fili O. Lohse M.J. Singer-Lahat D. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34909-34917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We therefore examined if Syn-1A bound to the cytoplasmic N or C terminus of Kv2.1 by performing the binding assay with recombinant proteins (Fig. 2). Syn-1A (Fig. 2, top panel) bound very strongly with C1 and less so with C2. Syn-1A bound only weakly with the N terminus. As a negative control, GST did not bind to Syn-1A at all. Fig. 2, bottom panel, shows a Ponseau S staining of the blot, which demonstrates the equal protein loading of the C1 and C2 proteins, whereas the N-terminal protein and GST were loaded somewhat more but nonetheless showed little and no binding to Syn-1A, respectively. Immunostaining of this blot with anti-GST antibodies confirmed the presence of these proteins (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, dialyzing Syn-1A-GST fusion protein through the recording pipette into Kv2.1-transfected cell caused a reduction (14.4 ± 5.07; p < 0.05) of Kv2.1 current after 6–8 min. This reduction could be abolished by co-dialysis with C1 or C2. Again, similar to the results with rat islet औ-cell Kv2.1 channels, C2 was more effective than C1 in blocking the effects of the dialyzed GST-Syn-1A. However, Kv2.1 N terminus was completely ineffective in preventing such reduction. These data indicate that Syn-1A inhibited Kv2.1 currents by a direct interaction with the cytoplasmic C terminus. Dialysis of the Syn-1A might either interact with a cytosolic protein and may not be specifically targeted to the plasma membrane where the Kv2.1 channel is situated. This could be circumvented by overexpressing Syn-1A, which would be appropriately targeted to the plasma membrane compartment (7Kang Y. Huang X. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Holz G.G. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Syn-1A has been shown to not only affect Kv1.1 channel function but also affected surface expression of Kv.1.1 in Xenopus oocytes (18Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, expression of Syn-1A drastically reduced Kv2.1 current density (0.21 ± 0.05 nA/pF compared with Kv2.1 alone 0.99 ± 0.18 nA/pF; p < 0.05). The reduction in Kv2.1 current density in the presence of syntaxin-2 (Syn-2) was small and insignificant. To investigate whether Syn-1A reduced Kv2.1 current density by inhibiting the trafficking of Kv2.1 protein to the plasma membrane, we performed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4B). When Kv2.1 was expressed alone, there was bright and clear fluorescence at the cell periphery, suggesting that the majority of the Kv2.1 channel protein was present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B,left panel). With Syn-1A co-expression, the Kv2.1 plasma membrane fluorescence was dimmer and diffuse (note patches of fluorescence beneath the cell periphery) (Fig. 4B,middle panel), indicating that the overexpressed Syn-1A (inset) inhibited Kv2.1 from surfacing to the plasma membrane, and a substantial proportion of Kv2.1 was retained in the cytoplasm. Consistent with the current density data shown in Fig.4A, overexpression of Syn-2 (inset) did not cause significant inhibition of surfacing of Kv2.1 (Fig. 4B,right panel). To quantitatively determine the amount of reduction of plasma membrane surfacing of Kv2.1 caused by the overexpression of Syn-1A and Syn-2, we performed the following study. Transfected HEK293 cells were biotinylated so that plasma membrane proteins can be separated from the rest of the cells using the streptavidin resin. Fig. 4C(upper panel) shows that the levels of plasma membrane Kv2.1 proteins pulled down by the streptavidin resin was reduced by 497 with the Syn-1A co-expression, but only by 227 with the Syn-2 expression. The Kv2.1 proteins in the total lysates obtained just prior to the treatment with streptavidin resin did not change, indicating that both syntaxins did not have any significant effect on total protein synthesis of Kv2.1 (lower panel). A number of reports have already shown that SNARE proteins profoundly affected Kv channel electrophysiological properties, such as activation and inactivation kinetics (16Ji J. Tsuk S. Salapatek A.M. Huang X. Chikvashvili D. Pasyk E.A. Kang Y. Sheu L. Tsushima R. Diamant N. Trimble W.S. Lotan I. Gaisano H.Y. J. Biol.

We next explored whether Syn-1A targeted to the plasma membrane by co-expression would modulate the electrophysiological properties of Kv2.1 channel current. Only those cells expressing currents greater than 4 nA were selected for analysis because HEK293 cells express endogenous outward K+ currents as high as 0.4 nA (data not shown). Kv2.1 had a fairly rapid activation rate, with a τ of 5.6 ± 0.6 ms (Fig.5A). The overexpressed Syn-1A significantly (p < 0.05) slowed down the activation rate (τ = 8.5 ± 0.7 ms) while Syn-2 had no effect. Kv2.1 exhibited a very slow inactivation rate (Fig. 5B), which was neither affected by Syn-1A nor Syn-2 co-expression. Since Syn-1A slows down Kv2.1 activation, we then examined whether Syn-1A would affect the voltage dependence of activation of Kv2.1. To study this, instantaneous activation curves were obtained using the protocol in which voltage steps from −50 to +70 mV in 10 mV increments were followed by a −40 mV step to trigger tail currents. Normalized peak tail currents are then plotted against the various voltage steps and fit by the Boltzmann equation (Fig.6A). Syn-1A did not significantly alter the voltage dependence of activation of Kv2.1. We performed the steady-state inactivation experiments to determine channel availability for activation as a function of membrane potential. A dual-pulse protocol was used in which a test pulse step of +70 mV was preceded by a long pre-pulse (12 s) of different potentials. The test pulse currents are normalized to the largest test pulse current and plotted against the pre-pulse voltages. The curves are best fit by the Boltzmann equation (Fig. 6B). Kv2.1 currents have a half-maximal inactivation potential (V12) of −29.9 ± 2.5 mV. The left shift of the inactivation curve (V12 value of −34.7 ± 1.3 mV) caused by Syn-1A was slight and statistically insignificant. However, Syn-1A significantly decreased the slope factor from 6.2 ± 0.63 to 4.4 ± 0.25 (p < 0.05), indicating that Syn-1A increased the sensitivity of voltage-dependent inactivation with"

The latter are major constituents of amyloid plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Inhibitors of γ-secretase are considered potential therapeutics for the treatment of this disease because they prevent production of Aऔ peptides.

Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is characterized by the formation of senile plaques in the brain. Major constituents of these plaques are the amyloidogenic 40- and 42-residue-long Aऔ peptides Aऔ40 and Aऔ42, respectively (1Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4244) Google Scholar). The amyloid cascade hypothesis casually links the generation of amyloid plaques with the neuropathological changes accompanying the symptoms typical of this disease (2Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Aऔ peptides are generated from the type I transmembrane protein औ-APP (औ-amyloid precursor protein) by sequential proteolysis (3Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L.

It is not well understood how these mutations, which are essentially scattered along the entire PS1 gene, can lead to a specific increase in the production of the 42-residue-long peptide that corresponds to the most amyloidogenic form of Aऔ (13Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PS1 plays a key role in transport and maturation of औ-APP (14Kaether C. Lammich S. Edbauer D. Ertl M. Rietdorf J. Capell A. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is also an essential component of the γ-secretase complex (6Haass C. Steiner H.

Thus, in recent years, the development of small molecular weight compounds aimed at reducing γ-secretase/PS1 activity as a possible therapeutic strategy for AD has attracted major attention. Several potent inhibitors that affect γ-secretase/PS1 in cellular assays have been reported, and at least one compound has been shown to reduce plaque load in a transgenic animal model for AD-type amyloidosis (23Josien H. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2002; 5: 513-525PubMed Google Scholar). The major concern related to this approach is that γ-secretase/PS1 not only catalyzes the processing of C99, but it is also required for the processing of other transmembrane proteins such as CD44 (24Lammich S.

Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified the intramembrane-cleaving protease SPP (for signal peptide peptidase) that contains motifs YD and LGLGD characteristic for GXGD aspartic proteases (29Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). These identical motifs are present in the predicted transmembrane regions of PS1, supporting its function as an intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease and hence a catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase/PS1 complex (6Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). SPP promotes intramembrane proteolysis of distinct signal peptides after they have been cleaved off from newly synthesized secretory or membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of higher eukaryotes (29Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 31Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In humans, SPP is essential for the generation of signal sequence-derived human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-E epitopes and thus plays a crucial role in our immune system (32Lemberg M.K. Bland F.A. Weihofen A. Braud V.M. Martoglio B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6441-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SPP promotes cleavage at an internal signal sequence in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) polyprotein and is essential for proper maturation of the viral core protein (33McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of SPP may thus be considered as potential therapeutics for the treatment of HCV infection. The common features of SPP and PS1 raise the question of whether γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors directed against the putative active site of PS1, for example aspartic protease transition state analogues, are also acting against SPP and hence affect intramembrane-cleavage of signal peptides. In the present study, we investigated the effects of representative, potent γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors on SPP activity. We first tested the compounds for their potency in blocking Aऔ generation in intact cells as well as inhibiting solubilized γ-secretase activity in a cell-free in vitro assay. In the same type of assays, we then investigated the effect of these compounds on SPP activity and assessed their propensity to compete with active site labeling. L-658,485 (34Nadin A. Sanchez J.M.

Checler and pepstatin A was purchased from Sigma. Inhibition of γ-secretase activity in live cells was assayed by quantifying the generation of secreted Aऔ. In brief, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK)-293 cells stably transfected with औ-APP carrying the Swedish mutation (38Mullan M. Crawford F. Axelman K. Houlden H. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Nat.

Brain Res. 1996; 716: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were plated in microtiter plates. After 1 day, the inhibitors were added in fresh medium, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. 10 ॖl of conditioned medium were removed for determination of Aऔ levels by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Aऔ40-specific monoclonal antibody 25H10 raised against the free C-terminal peptide, MVGGVV, of Aऔ40. The monoclonal औ1antibody (39Schrader-Fischer G. Paganetti P.A. Brain Res. 1996; 716: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was biotinylated and used as a detection antibody with alkaline phosphatase coupled to streptavidin. For chemiluminescence, substrate CSPD (disodium 3-(c-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate) and the enhancer EmeraldII (Tropix) were applied. Standard curves with synthetic Aऔ40 peptide (Bachem) were run in parallel. For testing γ-secretase in vitro, detergent-solubilized γ-secretase activity was prepared from HEK-293 cells (40Li Y.M.

After incubation, samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody 25H10 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging using 157 polyacrylamide Tris-Bicine-urea acrylamide gels (41Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J.

Reference peptide Met-Aऔ40 was synthesized byin vitro translation. γ-Secretase inhibitors were tested on SPP in a previously established in vitroassay (35Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Ploegh H.L. Bogyo M.

In brief, 2 ॖl of cell-free translation mixture containing [35S]methionine-labeled peptidep-PrlPP29/30 (31Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were diluted with 35 ॖl of SPP buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mmKOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and supplemented with 1 ॖl of 100× concentrated inhibitor in Me2SO. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 ॖl of CHAPS-solubilized ER membrane proteins, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Samples were analyzed next by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging using 157 polyacrylamide Tris-Bicine-urea acrylamide gels (41Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W.

Quantification was performed with IQMac version 1.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). For affinity labeling, CHAPS-solubilized ER membrane proteins were incubated in SPP buffer in the presence of 50 nm TBL4K or 25 nm L-852,646 and the indicated concentrations of competitor (29Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and subsequently irradiated with UV light (30 s for TBL4K, 5 min for L-852,646; 350-watt high pressure mercury lamp, 10-cm distance to lamp) (29Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 127 polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and biotinylated proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) after Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-biotin antibody (Bethyl) (29Weihofen A.

Hepatitis C virus structural proteins C, E1, and E2 were transiently expressed in baby hamster kidney C13 cells as described previously (33McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Following electroporation with in vitro transcribed mRNA encoding the CE1E2 polyprotein, cells were diluted in growth medium at a concentration of ∼106cells/ml. An 0.25-ml cell suspension was diluted with 0.25 ml of growth medium containing either 27 Me2SO, or 27 100× concentrated inhibitor dissolved in Me2SO and seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 h, cells were either solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer or fixed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis with monoclonal core-specific antibody JM122 (43Hope R.G.

Virol. 2000; 81: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, proteins were first separated by SDS-PAGE using 137 polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with polyclonal core-specific antibody R308 (43Hope R.G.

Lemberg M.K. Ploegh H.L. Bogyo M. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30951-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and TBL4K (29Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) were investigated in this study (Fig.1A). In a first series of experiments, we tested whether NVP-AHW700-NX and (Z-LL)2-ketone function as γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors and affect generation of Aऔ peptides and compared the potency of the two compounds with known γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors DAPT, L-685,458, and LY411575 (Fig. 1B). Stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing औ-APP were treated with various concentrations of inhibitor. Following incubation for 24 h, medium was removed and analyzed for Aऔ peptides in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compounds LY411575 and NVP-AHW700-NX efficiently inhibited Aऔ generation with IC50 values of 0.4 nm and 0.62 ॖm, respectively, as well as the previously described inhibitors L-685,458 (0.46 ॖm) and DAPT (0.17 ॖm). In contrast, (Z-LL)2-ketone did not inhibit the generation of soluble Aऔ40 up to a concentration of 100 ॖm. The latter finding was confirmed in a cell-free in vitroassay using detergent-solubilized HEK cell membranes containing γ-secretase/PS1 activity (Fig. 1C). As a substrate, we used Met-C99, which was synthesized by cell-free in vitrotranslation. This peptide corresponded to the natural substrate of γ-secretase/PS1, C99, with an additional N-terminal methionine required to initiate peptide synthesis. After incubation, samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an Aऔ40-specific antiserum and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. As expected, the γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitor DAPT (5 ॖm) blocked the generation of Aऔ40. The SPP inhibitor (Z-LL)2-ketone, in contrast, did not affect production of Aऔ40 up to a concentration of 100 ॖm. We next investigated the effect of γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors on SPP activity, first in a previously described cell-free in vitro assay (35Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Ploegh H.L. Bogyo M. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30951-30956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A radiolabeled SPP substrate, peptide p-PrlPP29/30 (31Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), was prepared by cell-free in vitro translation in wheat germ extract and incubated with detergent-solubilized ER membrane proteins containing SPP. Cleavage of the 30-residue-longp-PrlPP29/30 by SPP resulted in the generation of an ∼20-residue-long product that was readily detected and quantified by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (Fig.2). The addition of the SPP inhibitors (Z-LL)2-ketone and TBL4K and the γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors L-685,458, L-852,646, LY411575, and NVP-AHW700-NX efficiently inhibited cleavage ofp-PrlPP29 with apparent IC50 values ranging from 8 to ∼100 nm. Interestingly, the γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitor DAPT, which is a less potent derivative of LY411575, had no effect on SPP activity at concentrations up to 100 ॖm (Fig. 2). Also, pepstatin A and JKL2, both of which were reported to inhibit γ-secretase/PS1 activity (37Petit A. Bihel F. Alves da Costa C. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 40Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), did not affect SPP at concentrations up to 100 ॖm. To test whether the effective γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors affect SPP by binding to the active site of SPP, we labeled the protease with the previously described photoaffinity label, TBL4K (29Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) in the presence of increasing amounts of inhibitors (Fig.3A). The central ketone moiety of TBL4K, a derivative of (Z-LL)2-ketone, is thought to be converted in situ to a transition state mimicking gem-diol upon binding to the SPP active site. As expected, increasing concentrations of the transition state analogues L-685,458 and NVP-AHW700-NX progressively displaced TBL4K from SPP (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the most potent γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitor tested, LY411575, reduced labeling of SPP in a dose-dependent manner. In agreement with what we observed in the cell-free in vitro SPP assay, DAPT (Fig.3A), pepstatin A, and JKL2 (not shown) did not influence the labeling of SPP. To further demonstrate that some of the γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors target SPP, we made use of the photoreactive compound L-852,646, a derivative of L-685,458, that was applied previously to label PS1 in detergent-solubilized HeLa total cell membranes (19Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). When incubated with detergent-solubilized ER membrane proteins and activated with UV light, L-852,646 selectively labeled an ∼40-kDa protein such as TBL4K (Fig. 3B). The addition of increasing amounts of the SPP inhibitor (Z-LL)2-ketone progressively reduced labeling. Consistently, compounds that inhibited SPP in the cell-free in vitro assay competed with TBL4K and L-852,646 for binding to the SPP active site. This finding is further evidence that PS1 and SPP are of the same type of aspartic protease (30Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 44Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.L. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 45Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2156-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We next tested the inhibitory potency of γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors on SPP in a cellular assay system. Besides cleaving signal peptides, SPP also catalyzes the processing of HCV core protein and promotes its release from the ER membrane and trafficking to lipid droplets in the cytosol (33McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). When SPP is inhibited, the core protein is not processed and remains anchored in the ER membrane by the C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region. We therefore could investigate SPP activity in tissue culture cells expressing HCV proteins and monitor the processing of core protein either by detecting core protein by Western blot analysis (Fig.4A), or by visualizing its intracellular localization using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 4,B and C). As depicted in Fig. 4A, (Z-LL)2-ketone, L-685,458, NVP-AHW700-NX, and LY411575 inhibited the processing of HCV core protein. Apparent IC50 values varied from ∼10 nm (for LY411575) to ∼5 ॖm (for L-685,458). The IC50 values observed with the less membrane-permeable compounds, (Z-LL)2-ketone and L-685,458, were much higher than in the in vitro assays. These compounds most likely penetrate the plasma membrane to a lower extent compared with the less peptidic and therefore more permeable compounds LY411575 and NVP-AHW700-NX, which showed comparable IC50 values in both assays. DAPT and pepstatin A did not inhibit the processing of HCV core protein and hence did not affect SPP, as already observed in the cell-free in vitro assay. Also JKL2 did not affect the processing of HCV core protein at concentrations up to ∼10 ॖm, at which level the compound started to become cytotoxic (not shown). The consequences of SPP inhibition on the processing of HCV core protein were next visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. When processed and released from the ER membrane, core protein was found associated at the surface of lipid droplets in the cytosol and appeared in characteristic ring-like structures (Fig. 4B). When expressed in the presence of (Z-LL)2-ketone, L-685,458, NVP-AHW700-NX, and LY411575, all of which inhibit SPP, HCV core protein did not localize to lipid droplets and appeared in a reticular staining pattern, indicating retention in the ER membrane. DAPT and pepstatin A, which do not affect the processing of HCV core protein, had also no effect on its intracellular distribution. Taken together, (Z-LL)2-ketone and the γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors L-685,458, LY411575, and NVP-AHW700-NX efficiently inhibit SPP in the detergent-solubilized state as well as in living cells. These compounds prevent intramembrane proteolysis of SPP substrates, which, in turn, cannot be released from the ER membrane, and fulfill associated functions in the cell (46Hegde R.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 697-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study we have demonstrated that aspartic protease inhibitors directed against γ-secretase/PS1 are not necessarily specific and can affect the related intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease SPP. This finding has implications for the therapeutic strategy in the treatment of AD. To date, the therapeutic potential of small compound inhibitors of γ-secretase/PS1 was scored mainly against the possible side effects that could be expected by the concomitant inhibition on the Notch-1 signaling pathway (28Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). This was evaluated by measuring the inhibition of fetal T cell maturation in the presence of γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors (47Hadland B.K. Manley N.R. Su D. Longmore G.D. Moore C.L. Wolfe M.S. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7487-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 48Doerfler P. Shearman M.S. Perlmutter R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the results presented in this study suggest that some of the most potent γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors can also block SPP. At first glance, our data are discouraging in respect to developing γ-secretase/PS1 inhibitors as therapeutics, because SPP plays a key role in the processing of distinct signal peptides (30Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which can have post-targeting functions such as that of reporting proper biosynthesis of antigen-presenting major histocompatibility class I molecules to the immune system (32Lemberg M.K. Bland F.A. Weihofen A. Braud V.M. Martoglio B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6441-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 50Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S.

Our study, however, also identified compounds that are more selective against either γ-secretase/PS1 or SPP, indicating that specific inhibitors may be designed but need to be tested against the individual intramembrane-cleaving aspartic proteases. The nature of the catalytic site of the γ-secretase complex has been probed intensively, but it still remains somewhat controversial. Biotinylated photoaffinity labels, based on aspartic protease transition-state analogues that mimic the γ-secretase cleavage site in औ-APP/C99, can be covalently cross-linked to PS1 (19Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Furthermore, γ-secretase activity is abolished by mutations of two critical aspartate residues (asp-257 andasp-385) located in the predicted transmembrane domains of PS1 (21Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 22Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14600-14605Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although such findings support the hypothesis that PS1 is the catalytic component of the complex, this notion was hampered by the fact that PS1 did not share any sequence homology with other known aspartic proteases. A limited relationship to the bacterial type IV prepilin peptidase, as revealed by Haass and co-workers (44Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.L. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and the discovery of SPP, an intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease with active site motifs identical to the putative ones in PS1 (29Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), overruled this objection and provided further evidence that PS1 is a protease. Additional indirect evidence that PS1 is a protease was provided by the present study reporting on overlapping inhibitor activities. Compounds, including transition state analogues, were found to efficiently inhibit both γ-secretase/PS1 and SPP. Furthermore, the active site-directed affinity probe L-852,646, previously applied to label PS1 in solubilized total cell membranes (19Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), selectively labeled SPP when applied on detergent-solubilized ER membrane proteins. The latter also contained PS (not shown) but only in the unprocessed form, which cannot be labeled by L-852,646 (19Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). In fact, all of the effective inhibitors competed with labeling of SPP by the transition state analogue L-852,646 and the photoaffinity label TBL4K, which mimics the gem-diol intermediate upon hydration in the active site. These results suggest that the compounds investigated in this study target the active site of SPP, and it is likely that they similarly interact with PS1. Although three compounds, pepstatin A, DAPT, and (Z-LL)2-ketone, could discriminate between γ-secretase/PS1 and SPP, the other tested inhibitors affected both proteases to a variable degree. Thus despite overlapping inhibitor activities, the two proteases clearly differ in the way they interact with the inhibitors. The small number of compounds investigated, however, does not allow us make predictions about the specificity of a particular compound. Modifications on a lead compound may not only significantly increase its inhibitory potency but also can influence compound selectivity, as shown for DAPT and its second-generation derivative, LY411575. The new derivative is indeed ∼400 times more potent against γ-secretase/PS1, but it also became an efficient inhibitor of SPP. The potency of LY411575 against SPP, however, was less than against γ-secretase/PS1. Similarly, the transition state analogue L-685,458 was less potent against SPP, whereas the related compound NVP-AHW700-NX was equally effective against SPP and γ-secretase/PS1. Thus, SPP and γ-secretase/PS1 interact differently with various compounds, but to determine what makes an inhibitor selective against one or the other protease will be a major challenge for future drug design. SPP and γ-secretase/PS1 are both of pharmaceutical interest. SPP is essential for the processing of the HCV core protein (33McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and γ-secretase/PS1 is implicated in the cause of AD (51Wolfe M.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Drugs against either protease may be useful for the treatment of HCV infection or AD, but they should discriminate between the two proteases in order to minimize side effects. An added complication, however, is that the human genome encodes four additional homologues of SPP (29Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B.

It is likely that these candidate aspartic proteases catalyze intramembrane proteolysis of so far unidentified substrate proteins. In analogy to known intramembrane-cleaving proteases, they may promote the release of bioactive peptides and proteins such as signaling molecules and transcription factors (30Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because all of these proteins contain motifs identical to the active site motifs of SPP and γ-secretase/PS1, compounds like the ones tested in the present study may well target the SPP-like candidate proteases too. Therefore, compound specificity will be even more important. In the future, the development of effective therapeutic agents targeting γ-secretase/PS1 or SPP will challenge the chemists and may require systematic probing of all human intramembrane-cleaving aspartic proteases.

We here report that the nuclear forms of SREBPs are modified by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-1. Mutational analyses identified two major sumoylation sites (Lys123 and Lys418) in SREBP-1a and a single site (Lys464) in SREBP-2. Mutant SREBPs lacking one or two sumoylation sites exhibited increased transactivation capacity on an SREBP-responsive promoter. Overexpression of SUMO-1 reduced whereas its dominant negative form increased mRNA levels of SREBP-responsive genes. Nuclear SREBPs interacted with the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and overexpression of a dominant negative form of Ubc9 increased the mRNA levels of SREBP-responsive genes. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that sumoylation did not affect the degradation of SREBPs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In vitroubiquitylation assay showed no competition between ubiquitin and SUMO-1 for the same lysine. Considered together, our results indicate that SUMO-1 modification suppresses the transactivation capacity of nuclear SREBPs in a manner different from the negative regulatory mechanism mediated by proteolysis.

Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). These transcription factors belong to a large class of transcription factors containing a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) motif. The SREBP family comprises three subtypes: SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which are generated by alternative splicing, mainly regulating lipogenic gene expression, and SREBP-2 governing cholesterol metabolism. Unlike other members of the bHLH-Zip transcription factors, the SREBPs are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activated by a two-step proteolytic process (2Sato R.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The precursor proteins contain an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain with a bHLH-Zip motif and a C-terminal regulatory domain separated by two transmembrane regions. The C-terminal regulatory domain associates with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), an ER membrane protein with eight membrane-spanning segments, which contains a sterol-sensing domain (5Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). An SREBP·SCAP complex remains on the ER membrane as long as intracellular cholesterol levels are high, whereas in cells depleted of cholesterol ER-derived membrane vesicles containing this complex moves to the Golgi, where a sequential cleavage of the SREBPs by site 1 and site 2 protease occurs, releasing the active nuclear forms (6Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22795-22804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Once the nuclear form of SREBPs is released into the cytoplasm, it is actively transported into the nucleus in an importin औ-dependent manner (7Nagoshi E. Imamoto N. Sato R. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2221-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the SREBPs are modified by polyubiquitin chains and rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome (8Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, ALLN and lactacystin, the stabilized nuclear SREBPs are capable of enhancing their responsive gene expression. Thus, ubiquitylation of the nuclear SREBPs and the subsequent turnover play important roles in regulation of lipid metabolism. Posttranslational modification of a variety of cellular proteins has been variably linked to protein phosphorylation and acetylation other than ubiquitylation. SUMO-1, a 101-amino acid protein bearing 187 identity with ubiquitin but with a remarkably similar secondary structure, has been recently identified. SUMO-1 differs from ubiquitin in its surface-charge distribution, eliciting its specificity (9Jin C. Shiyanova T. Shen Z. Liao X. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 28: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and does not have a consensus sumoylation motif, (I/V/L)KX(E/D), in its molecule, explaining why SUMO-1 does not make multichain forms (10Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 11Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Sumoylation requires a multiple-step reaction similar to that of ubiquitin, but the specific enzymes are distinct from those involved in ubiquitylation (12Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 is synthesized as a precursor with the C-terminal extension of several amino acids, which needs to be processed to expose the C-terminal Gly97 residue that is essential for conjugation to target proteins (13Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Then the processed SUMO-1 is recognized as a substrate by SUMO-activating enzyme (E1), which is a heterodimer consisting of SAE1 (also called Uba2) and SAE2 (also called Aos1) subunits (14Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5509-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Ubc9 is a SUMO-conjugating enzyme (E2), receiving SUMO-1 from the E1 enzyme and transferring it to target proteins (15Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Most sumoylated proteins directly interact with Ubc9, which catalyzes the sumoylation of such proteins (16Desterro J.M. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A recent report showed that Ubc9 recognizes the consensus sequence that surrounds the acceptor lysine residue in sumoylation substrates (17Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), implying that Ubc9 itself might play to a certain extent a ubiquitin E3-like role in determining the substrate specificity (18Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D. Cell. 2002; 108: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have identified ubiquitin ligase (E3)-like ligases for sumoylation that enhance SUMO-1 conjugation to target proteins in yeasts and mammals (19Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In recent years, a growing number of SUMO-1 target proteins including several transcription factors have been reported (20Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In contrast to ubiquitylation, which usually marks proteins for rapid degradation, sumoylation is involved in the regulation of protein functions through changes in protein-protein interactions (21Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 22Seeler J.S. Marchio A. Losson R. Desterro J.M. Hay R.T.

Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and antagonism to ubiquitylation. Thus, sumoylation serves to enhance the stabilization of target proteins (24Desterro J.M. Rodgriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) and inhibit DNA repair (25Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The effects of SUMO-1 modification of transcription factors are very diverse, depending on the nature of transcription factors. SUMO-1 modification induces nuclear relocalization of p53 and enhances the DNA-binding ability of heat shock transcription factor 1 and 2, resulting in increased transcriptional activities (26Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 27Goodson M.L. Hong Y.

In contrast, sumoylation to p73α does not affect its transcriptional activity but rather its subcellular localization (29Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), whereas SUMO-1 modification attenuates the transcriptional activities of c-Myb, c-Jun, and androgen receptor (30Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J.S. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13321-13329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 31Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8999-9009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, SUMO-1 modification might be a common mechanism that regulates specific activities of transcriptional factors. Here we report a novel posttranslational modification of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 by the covalent attachment of two molecules and a single molecule of the SUMO-1 protein, respectively. We show that sumoylation does not affect ubiquitylation and the stability but does modulate transcriptional activities of the SREBPs. Our results point to another mechanism through which the SREBPs activities are attenuated in conjunction with degradation by the ubiquitin/26 S proteasome pathway. We obtained Redivue Pro-mix L-35Sin vitro cell labeling mix, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B from Amersham Biosciences; protease inhibitor mixture and lipoprotein-deficient serum from Sigma; MG-132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO) andN-ethylmaleimide from Calbiochem; and iodoacetamide from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). The pSREBP-1a-(1–487) and the pSREBP-2-(1–481) were described previously (33Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Sato R.

Expression plasmids pFLSBP-1a-(2–487) and pFLSBP-2-(2–481) were constructed by inserting fragments coding amino acids 2–487 of human SREBP-1a and 2–481 of SREBP-2 into the pCMV-3Flag (Sigma), respectively. To generate expression plasmid pGSTSBP-1a-(2–487) and pGSTSBP-2-(2–481), the fragments were transferred to the pME-GST(6P-3), which was kindly provided by Dr. Tezuka (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo). To generate the expression plasmid pG4-FLSBP-1a-(2–487), the fragment coding amino acids 2–487 of SREBP-1a was ligated into the expression plasmid pM-Flag, which was constructed by inserting a GAL4 DNA-binding domain expression vector, pM (Clontech). The expression plasmid pG4-HisSBP-2-(2–481) was constructed by inserting the fragment for amino acids 2–481 of SREBP-2 into the expression plasmid pM-His, which was engineered to contain the in-frame N-terminal His epitope tag MRGS(H)6. All expression plasmids encoding SREBP mutants were synthesized by a PCR-assisted method using the site-directed mutagenesis kit following the instructions provided by the supplier (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pEGFP-SUMO-1 was a kind gift from Dr. Minoru Yoshida (RIKEN). The pHA-SUMO-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Chiba (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science). The expression plasmid pHisSUMO was constructed by inserting a fragment encoding human SUMO-1 cloned into the pME-His (8Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids pHisSUMO(GG) and pHisSUMOΔGG were generated by ligating PCR-generated fragments. To construct expression plasmids pHisUbc9 and pGFPUbc9, a fragment of human Ubc9 was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and inserted into the pME-His and the pME-GFP (8Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pHisUbc9(C93S) was generated using the site-directed mutagenesis kit. To generate the pG5Luc reporter plasmid, five copies of Gal4 binding sites in the pG5CAT (Clontech) were transferred to the pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The anti-SREBP-1 polyclonal antibody RS005 and the anti-SREBP-2 polyclonal antibody RS004 have been described previously (8Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

HeLa, COS-1, HEK293 and M19 cells and site 2 protease null mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells, which were kindly provided by Dr. Chang (Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH), were cultured as described previously (8Hirano Y.

For detection of sumoylated endogenous SREBPs, HeLa cells (20 100-mm dishes) were set up on day 0 in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Sigma) supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 3 ॖg of pHA-SUMO-1 using X-tremeGENE Q2 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). After transfection, the cells were refed with medium A containing 57 lipoprotein-deficient serum, 50 ॖmpravastatin, and sodium mevalonate. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were harvested with Buffer C* containing 20 mmHEPES/KOH (pH 7.9), 207 glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 0.57 Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm EDTA supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors, 10 ॖm MG-132, 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 10 mm iodoacetamide. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated by the Seize Classis X Protein A immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) following the instructions provided by the supplier and resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described previously (8Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). COS-1 and M19 cells were set up on day 0. On day 1, the COS-1 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran methods and then refed with medium A supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum. M19 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and then refed with medium B (a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 57 lipoprotein-deficient serum supplemented either with 1 ॖg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 ॖg/ml cholesterol (the sterol-loaded condition) or 50 ॖm pravastatin plus 50 ॖm sodium mevalonate (the sterol-depleted condition). After incubation for 48 h, the cells were harvested with a radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 17 Nonidet P-40, 0.757 sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol for binding assays or Buffer C* for sumoylation assays supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors, 10 ॖm MG-132, 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 10 mmiodoacetamide. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with 50 ॖl of a 507 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B or immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and 50 ॖl of a 507 slurry of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. All resins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described previously (8Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

HeLa cells (5 × 105cells/60-mm dish) transfected with various expression plasmids were cultured under the sterol-depleted condition for 48 h and then harvested. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (34Sato R. Okamoto A. Inoue J. Miyamoto W. Sakai Y. Emoto N. Shimano H. Maeda M. J. Biol.

Membranes transferring total RNA were hybridized with radioactive cDNA probes, human hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase, LDL receptor, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Reporter Assays were performed as described previously (36Nakahara M. Fujii H. Maloney P.R. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

After incubation for 48 h, the Dual-LuciferaseTM Reporter System (Promega) was used to determine luciferase activities. On day 0, monolayers of COS-1 cells were set up and transfected on day 1 with wild-type or mutant SREBPs. One day after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and reseeded to normalize the transfection efficiency. On day 3, the cells were preincubated for 1 h with methionine/cysteine-free medium A (Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum and then pulsed with 200 ॖCi of L-35S cell labeling mix for 1 h. After the pulse period, the cells were incubated for 1 h and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with a prewarmed complete medium. After each chase period, the cells were harvested and lysed with a cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 0.17 Triton X-100, 0.17 SDS, and 2 mm EDTA. The immunoprecipitates with anti-FLAG antibodies were visualized by autoradiography. Exposed filters were quantitatively analyzed on FluorImage Analyzer with Image Gauge (Fuji Film). The ubiquitylation assay was previously described (39Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 21: 1133-1138Crossref Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Substrate GST-SREBPs were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with pGSTSBPs. The cells were treated with 20 ॖm MG-132 for the last 12 h of the culture and then lysed. The GST-SREBPs immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose 4B were incubated with 40 ng of E1, 0.4 ॖg of E2, and 8.0 ॖg of GST-Ub in 40 ॖl of the ubiquitylation buffer containing 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 4 mm ATP for 3 h at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of the SDS sample buffer. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the nuclear forms of human SREBPs revealed that SREBP-1a contains four matches to the consensus sumoylation sequence centered around Lys123, Lys381, Lys418, and Lys470, and that SREBP-2 contains two matches, centered around Lys420 and Lys464 (Fig.1A). To examine whether the endogenous SREBPs are modified by SUMO-1, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for HA-SUMO-1 and cultured under sterol-depleted conditions for 48 h to increase in the amount of the nuclear SREBPs. The nuclear extracts treated with isopeptidase inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide, were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. In the case of SREBP-1a, anti-HA antibodies recognized several slower migrating bands in the immunoprecipitates with anti-SREBP-1 antibodies (Fig.1B, left top). Anti-SREBP-1 antibodies also detected weaker bands for SUMO-1-modified forms above the parental form of SREBP-1a (left bottom). In the case of SREBP-2, anti-HA antibodies recognized a single band in the immunoprecipitates with anti-SREBP-2 antibodies (right top), and anti-SREBP-2 antibodies detected a faint SUMO-1-modified form above the parental form of SREBP-2 (right bottom). These results demonstrated that endogenous SREBPs are modified by SUMO-1. Based on the fact that SUMO-1 can be covalently attached to a lysine residue only in a monomeric form (40Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

To determine whether the transcriptional activities of endogenous SREBPs are regulated by sumoylation, either SUMO-1(GG), a processed mature form of SUMO-1 (13Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), or SUMO-1ΔGG, a dominant-negative form of SUMO-1 that is unable to attach target proteins (42Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), was overexpressed in HeLa cells. Northern blot analyses for SREBP-responsive genes shown in Fig.2 indicate that overexpression of SUMO-1(GG) decreased the amounts of HMG-CoA synthase and LDL receptor mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that sumoylated endogenous SREBPs (Fig. 1B) down-regulate transcription of their target genes (Fig. 2A). In contrast, overexpression of SUMO-1ΔGG increased the amounts of HMG-CoA synthase and LDL receptor mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that block of sumoylation accelerated transcription of SREBP target genes (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that sumoylation of endogenous SREBPs can affect regulation of the SREBP-responsive gene expression. To determine which Lys residues in SREBP-1a are sumoylated, we cotransfected COS-1 cells with expression plasmids for His-SUMO-1 and either wild-type or mutant versions of GST-SREBP-1a. GST-SREBP-1a bound to glutathione-Sepharose resins were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (Fig.3, A and B,top panels). Three sumoylated bands were detected in cells transfected with an expression plasmid for wild-type SREBP-1a, whereas a single sumoylated band was detected in cells expressing either SREBP-1a K381R/K418R/K470R or K123R/K381R/K470R (Fig.3A, top, lanes 1,2, and 4). No bands were observed after the removal of four lysine residues in potential sumoylation sites (lane 6). Another immunoblotting analysis with anti-SREBP-1a antibodies confirmed that all sumoylated bands observed in the top panel were derived from sumoylated SREBP-1a (bottom). It is likely that the most slowly migrating sumoylated band in GST-SREBP-1a (top,lane 1) represents doubly sumoylated proteins at Lys123 and Lys418. Fig. 3B also shows that mutation at both Lys123 and Lys418completely abolished sumoylation of SREBP-1a (lane 10). Mutation of one of two possible sumoylation sites, Lys123 and Lys418, resulted in a single sumoylated band (lanes 8 and 9), confirming that these residues are major sumoylation sites. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that the molecule of SREBP-1a contains two possible sumoylation sites, Lys123and Lys418. To determine which Lys residues of two putative sumoylation sites in SREBP-2 are modified, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for His-SUMO-1 and either wild-type or mutant versions of SREBP-2. Fig. 4 shows that a slowly migrating SUMO-1-conjugated band (∼83 kDa) was detected when either wild-type or K420R SREBP-2 was expressed together with His-SUMO-1. These results clearly indicate that Lys464serves as the sumoylation site in the nuclear form of SREBP-2. To assess the potential consequences of sumoylation of SREBPs, we examined whether sumoylation influences the transcriptional activities of SREBPs. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid, pLDLR, containing the promoter region of human low density lipoprotein receptor gene, and expression plasmids encoding either wild-type or mutant versions of SREBPs. The cells were cultured under the sterol-loaded condition to suppress the processing of endogenous SREBPs, and luciferase assays were carried out. As shown in Fig.5A, both SREBP-1aK123R and -K418R significantly increased luciferase activities compared with wild-type SREBP-1a. Double mutation markedly activated the transcription of the reporter gene. Fig. 5B also shows that SREBP-2K464R markedly activated transcription of the reporter gene compared with wild-type SREBP-2. Similar results were obtained using a reporter plasmid containing the promoter region of the human HMG-CoA synthase gene (data not shown). These results indicate that sumoylation of both SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 negatively regulates their transcriptional activities and that sumoylation at both Lys123 and Lys418 of SREBP-1a coordinately attenuates the transcription. SREBPs require co-regulatory transcription factors, such as Sp1 and CBF/NF-Y, that bind DNA sequences adjacent to the SREBP binding sites and enhance the transcriptional activities of SREBPs by forming complexes with SREBPs (33Inoue J. Sato R. Maeda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Based on these early findings, we speculated that sumoylation might influence the interaction between SREBPs and these co-regulatory factors. Alternatively, it is possible that modification by SUMO-1 may weaken the affinity between SREBPs and their responsive DNA sequences. Instead of focusing on these possibilities, we evaluated whether sumoylation of SREBPs directly resulted in inactivation of these proteins. Accordingly, we used the heterologous Gal4 system with a reporter plasmid, pG5Luc. In this assay the luciferase gene transcription is driven by a"

In addition to mutations in RET and VHL in familial disease, germline mutations in SDHD and SDHB genes that encode subunits of mitochondrial complex II have also been associated with the development of familial phaeochromocytomas. To further investigate the role of SDHD and SDHB in the development of these tumours we determined the occurrence of germline SDHD and SDHB mutations in four patients with a family history of phaeochromocytoma with associated head and neck paraganglioma, one patient with a family history of phaeochromocytoma only and two patients with apparently sporadic extra-adrenal phaeochromocytoma, one of whom had early onset disease. Secondly, we investigated whether somatic SDHB mutations correlated with loss of heterozygosity at 1p36 in a subgroup of 11 sporadic and three MEN 2-associated RET-mutation-positive phaeochromocytomas. Novel SDHB mutations were identified in the probands from four families and two apparently sporadic cases (six of seven probands studied), including two missense mutations, a single nonsense and frameshift mutation, as well as two splice site mutations, one of which was shown to have partial penetrance resulting in 'leaky' splicing. Further, five intronic polymorphisms in SDHB were found. No SDHD mutations were identified. In addition, no somatic SDHB mutations were found in the remaining allele of the 11 sporadic adrenal phaeochromocytomas with allelic loss at 1p36 or the three MEN 2-associated RET-mutation-positive phaeochromocytomas. Therefore, we conclude that SDHB has a major role in the pathogenesis of familial phaeochromocytomas, but the possible role of SDHB in sporadic tumours showing allelic loss at 1p36 has yet to be ascertained."
https://openalex.org/W1975084250,"DNA amplifications are important mechanisms for proto-oncogene activation. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to metaphase chromosome preparations has revealed amplifications in 10–20% of B-cell lymphomas (B-NHL). We analysed a series of 16 aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas by the new approach termed Matrix-CGH (M-CGH) using genomic DNA microarrays as hybridization target. For M-CGH, a dedicated B-cell lymphoma chip was constructed containing 496 genomic targets covering oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes as well as chromosome regions frequently altered in B-NHL. In 10 of 16 samples a total of 15 DNA amplifications were identified. The amplicons included BCL2, REL, CCND1, CCND2, JAK2, FGF4 and MDM2. Four of the 15 amplifications remained undetected by chromosomal CGH. The respective amplicons mapped to bands 2p13, 9p13–p21 and 12q24 and, were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Furthermore, for four genomically amplified genes real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed elevated mRNA expression levels. These data show the superior diagnostic sensitivity of the newly developed diagnostic tool. As only a small portion of the genome (approximately 1.5%) has been analysed by the present DNA array, it is likely that gene amplifications are much more common in aggressive lymphomas than previously assumed."

The NrfA active site is similar to that of peroxidases with a nearby calcium site at the heme distal side nearly in the same location as occurs in the class II and class III peroxidases.

This is a process making part of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle that may start with the reduction of nitrate to nitrite catalyzed by nitrate reductase (NapA) (7Dias J.M. Than M.E. Humm A. Huber R.

This electron transport chain is located at the periplasmic membrane. Mutation studies in the operon encoding cytochrome c nitrite reductase from Wolinella succinogenes suggest that these enzymes are not integral membrane proteins but they are anchored to the membrane by a second subunit (NrfH) encoded in the same operon (8Simon J.

These enzymes are homologous and share a highly conserved three-dimensional structure. The sequence of W. succinogenes NrfA is 757 identical to the one from S. deleyianum, whereas E. coli NrfA is 48 and 467 identical with the ones from W. succinogenesand S. deleyianum, respectively. The crystal structures of these enzymes show the same homodimeric structure, the same packing for the five c-type heme groups within each monomer, and the same environment at the active site, localized at heme 1, an unusual lysine-coordinated heme with the distal coordination position free to accommodate the substrate molecule. Biochemical studies suggest that the homodimer is the functional form of the catalytic unit (13Stach P. Einsle O. Schumacher W. Kurun E. Kroneck P.M.H. J. Inorg.

This is the first structure of this family of enzymes from a δ-proteobacterium, and it reveals considerable structural differences relative to the previously reported structures. A second calcium site (calcium II) with nearly perfect octahedral coordination, caged by a loop not existent in the previous structures, was identified coordinating the propionates A of hemes 3 and 4. This calcium ion is located at nearly the same position as a yttrium and calcium ions bound at the protein surface in the crystal structures of NrfA from W. succinogenes and E. coli, respectively. However, in these cases, the ions presented incomplete coordination shells and no physiological relevance had been assigned to them. In the present work, the physiological role of the two calcium sites present in D. desulfuricans NrfA is discussed. The NrfA internal peptides AETETKM and KAEQWEGQDR obtained by automated Edman degradation 1M. G. Almeida, S. Macieira, L. L. Gonçalves, R. Huber, C. A. Cunha, M. J. Romão, C. Costa, J. Lampreia, J.

Using these oligonucleotides a DNA fragment of about 1431 base pairs was amplified by PCR. The resulting product was cloned in the vector pPCR-ScriptTM Amp SK(+) (Stratagene) and sequenced in both strands with primers T3 and T7 (New England Biolabs) and with internal primers, using an automated DNA sequencer (model 373, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the PRISM ready reaction dye deoxyterminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). More information on the N terminus was gained after identification and sequencing of the gene encoding the small subunit.1 The presence of a signal peptide was checked with the program Signal P V1.1 2www.cbs.dtu.dk. (18Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). D. desulfuricans NrfA was extracted by mild treatment of the membrane fraction with sodium choleate (4–6 mg/liter) in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.6, as previously described (15Liu M.C. Costa C. Moura I. Peck Jr., H.D. LeGall J. Inorganic Microbial Sulphur Metabolism. 243. Academic Press, Inc., London, UK1994: 303-319Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified by sequential ammonium sulfate fractionation (30–607), resuspension in potassium phosphate buffer, and high performance liquid chromatography/gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated and eluted with 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.6. The purity was checked by UV-visible spectroscopy and by SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gel (12.57) electrophoresis according to the Laemmli method (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that NrfA enzymes are not integral membrane proteins but anchored to the membrane by the second subunit, crystals ofD. desulfuricans NrfA could only be obtained using detergents in the crystallization conditions (20Dias J.M.

Single crystals of dimensions 0.3 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm suitable for x-ray diffraction studies were grown for 1 month using 3-(decylmethylammonium)propane-1-sulfonate (Zwittergent 3-10 fromCalbiochem) added to the crystallization conditions as a solution with a concentration of about 10 times the critical micellar concentration (40 mm). The crystallization conditions contained 157 (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 mCaCl2, and 0.1 m HEPES buffer at pH 7.5. The protein was used at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion method with hanging drop. The drops were prepared by adding 4 ॖl of protein solution, 1 ॖl of detergent at 10 times the critical micellar concentration, and 5 ॖl of reservoir solution. A cryo-cooled single crystal of dimensions 0.3 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm3 was used to collect MAD data at the iron absorption edge, on beamline BM-14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Ethylene glycol added at a concentration of 257 to the crystallization solution was used as cryoprotectant and the crystal was cryo-cooled to 100 K in a flux of nitrogen gas. The wavelengths at the point of inflection and at the peak of the K-shell absorption edge of iron were determined to be λ1 = 1.7403 Å and λ2 = 1.7390 Å, respectively, from an x-ray fluorescence spectrum. Data sets were collected at these wavelengths with a resolution up to 2.7 Å, using a MAR 345 image plate detector. The remote wavelength data set was collected at λ3 = 0.9919 Å, up to a resolution of 2.5 Å. Data were processed using version 1.96.1 of programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space groupP212121 with unit cell constants a = 78.94 Å, b = 104.59 Å, and c = 143.18 Å. The statistics of data processing are presented in Table I. Using the program SOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 472-494Google Scholar), resulting in a phasing power of 2.24 and an overall figure of merit of 0.49 (Table I). Density modification was performed with programs SOLOMON (24Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

At this stage, the protein boundaries, the helical regions at the dimer interface, and the heme cofactors could be distinguished in the electron density maps. However, large regions of the protein showed highly discontinuous electron density that did not improve much with the density modification procedures, making difficult the task of model building in those regions. Because at this stage the primary sequence was not yet known and the related S. deleyianum NrfA structure was available, attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement were done in parallel.Table IMAD data processing and phasing statisticsWavelengthResolution limitCompletenessRmergeI/ς(I)f′f“Phasing powerIsoPhasing poweranoRCullisÅ71.74032.795.1 (91.5)1-aValues in parentheses refer to the last resolution shell.0.09 (0.20)6.9 (3.4)−10.83.02.141.0872.11.73902.794.9 (84.5)0.09 (0.21)7.3 (3.2)−11.12.02.240.9268.30.99192.596.2 (85.2)0.04 (0.12)14.6 (5.6)0.241-bIndicates that the values were not refined.1.531-bIndicates that the values were not refined.1.201-a Values in parentheses refer to the last resolution shell.1-b Indicates that the values were not refined.

The data set used in this case, with a resolution up to 2.3 Å, was collected from a crystal similar to the one used in the MAD experiment, using radiation at λ4 = 0.932 Å, on beamline ID14-EH4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and using the local 2 × 2 array of ADSC CCD detectors. The structure ofS. deleyianum NrfA (10Einsle O. Messerschmidt A. Stach P. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Kroneck P.M.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) was used as a search model. The solution was obtained using the model comprising the residue ranges 60 to 140, 150 to 217, 239 to 304, 319 to 490, and hemes 1, 3, and 4. Heme 2, located in an exposed and flexible region of the protein, and heme 5, located at the dimer interface, were not included in the search model because there could be significant shifts in their position and orientation between the model and the D. desulfuricansNrfA structure as was found to be true for heme 2 after solving the structure (see Fig. 3A). A dimer was found in the asymmetric unit that corresponds to a Matthews volume (28Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) of 2.3 Å3Da−1 and in agreement with the 10 iron sites found in the asymmetric unit by the MAD experiment. The MR solution has aR-factor of 51.97 and a correlation of 36.97, in the resolution range between 10.0 and 3.0 Å, which is a highR-factor accompanied by a low correlation. However, the MR solution could superimpose well on the electron density maps obtained by MAD if its coordinates were shifted half a unit cell along the a axis that corresponds to an alternative allowed origin in space group P212121. Model building was done with program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and refinement was carried out with program REFMAC (26Collaborative Computational Project, N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar,30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The initial model obtained by MR was corrected accordingly to the electron density maps calculated after rigid body refinement and also by comparison to the ones calculated using the experimental phases determined by MAD. Hemes 2 and 5 as well as the calcium ion near the active site were incorporated in the model obtained by MR, and the residue ranges of the model were corrected to the following regions: 56 to 151, 153 to 222, 234 to 244, 252 to 263, 266 to 308, 315 to 377, and 385 to 441. At this point it could already be observed that the last 73 residues in the C terminus region of the S. deleyianum NrfA structure did not follow the electron density and, for this reason, they were removed from the initial model. The side chains that did not fit the electron density were mutated to alanines. Refinement of the model thus obtained, with inclusion of the experimental phases from MAD, lowered the R-factor to 44.17 in the resolution range between 14.5 and 2.5 Å. During the early stages of model building, until the R-factor decreased to below 407, refinements were carried out including the experimental phases from MAD. Following the refinement with program REFMAC, the program ArpWarp (31Perrakis A. Morris R.J. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) was used in mode molrep, not including the experimental phases and using data in the resolution range between 14.5 and 2.3 Å. Model building was performed using the improved electron density maps obtained from ArpWarp until the R-factor of the protein model decreased to below 307 when refined with program REFMAC after model building. During the last stages of model building, refinement was carried out with the program REFMAC5. The R-free calculation was done using 17 of the reflections. The stereochemical quality of the final refined model was analyzed with WHATCHECK (32Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). The final model of the dimer was refined to a R-factor of 18.97 andR-free of 22.47 and refinement statistics are summarized in Table II. Each monomer is composed of 482 residues (sequence residues 38 to 519), five c-type heme groups, two calcium ions, and one chloride ion. One of the monomers in the asymmetric unit binds one zinc ion with one additional chloride ion as one of its ligands, which corresponds to a tetrahedral metal center that was identified at an intermolecular contact between crystallographic symmetry related copies of that monomer. Electron density corresponding to at least one more amino acid after residue 518, in the C terminus, could be seen in the maps. However, more amino acids after residue 518 could not be detected during the sequence determination. For this reason, residue 519 is present as an alanine in the crystal structure. There was no electron density corresponding to the residues from 325 to 331 in monomer A, suggesting that this region was disordered in the crystal. The final model has 498 water molecules, 174 of which have a non-crystallographic symmetry-related mate. The model coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 1oah.Table IIRefinement statisticsWavelength (Å)0.932Resolution range (Å)20.0–2.3Number of independent reflections51633I/ς(I) (last shell)11.7 (2.2)Completeness (last shell)97.3 (89.8)Rmerge (last shell)0.08 (0.39)Number of amino acid residues (waters)964 (498)Number of hemes10Number of calcium ions4Number of chloride ions3Number of zinc ions1Average B-factor for protein atoms (water) (Å2)27.6 (29.1)Root mean square deviation in bond lengths (Å)0.008Root mean square deviation in bond angles (degrees)1.378CrystallographicRfactor(Rfree)0.189 (0.224) Open table in a new tab A sequence alignment performed with the amino acid sequences of the known cytochrome c nitrite reductases and with the NrfA internal peptides AETETKM and KAEQWEGQDR allowed the identification of these two sequences as portions of NrfA N and C terminus, respectively. The designed oligonucleotides were used to amplify by PCR a DNA fragment of about 1431 base pairs containing part of the nrfA gene sequence. The identification of the gene encoding the small subunit (nrfH) located upstream ofnrfA allowed the identification of the NrfA N-terminal sequence. The encoded NrfA is a 518-residue polypeptide chain harboring a signal peptide targeting protein export to the periplasm. According to the program Signal P (18Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) this peptide is predicted to be 28 residues long, but N-terminal sequencing of the protein1indicates that the cleavage site should be located between positions 24 and 25 (Fig. 1). Further attempts to identify the sequence located downstream of nrfA were not successful, so the stop codon was not identified and the gene was considered to be only partially sequenced. The nrfA sequence has been submitted to the EMBL data base under accession numberAJ316232. The mature NrfA polypeptide chain is then composed of 494 residues according to the nrfA sequence, but it can be one residue longer, as shown by the electron density maps from x-ray crystallography. The polypeptide chain in the crystal structure begins at residue Thr-38 suggesting that the initial amino acids in the N-terminal region of the mature enzyme are disordered. D. desulfuricans NrfA is homologous to its counterparts with known structure (Fig. 1) but its shared identity at the primary structure level is relatively low, with a degree of sequence identity of 35.9, 34.3, and 32.97 relatively to the cytochrome c nitrite reductases from S. deleyianum, E. coli, andW. succinogenes, respectively. The structure of D. desulfuricans NrfA (Fig.2A) follows the typical dimer structure of the NrfA family of enzymes (Fig. 2B), which is believed to be the active form of the enzyme (13Stach P. Einsle O. Schumacher W. Kurun E. Kroneck P.M.H. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 79: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The monomers are related in the dimer by a 2-fold ncs axis and they are structurally homologous to the previous NrfA structures but to a lesser degree in this case (Fig. 2, Cand D). The conserved regions correspond to 777 of the total number of amino acid residues with a root mean square deviation of 1.7 Å in relation to the NrfA from E. coli (for the main chain atoms of 370 residues) and a root mean square deviation of 2.0 Å in relation to the NrfA from W. succinogenes (for the main chain atoms of 372 residues). The structure is dominated by the conserved characteristic three-helix bundle in the region at the dimer interface (h21,h22, and h23 in Fig. 2C). Helix h21 shows a kink at residue Thr-368 where its main chain nitrogen atom is H-bonded to the main chain carbonyl group of Val-365 changing the α-helical structure to a 310 helical geometry in this region. On the other hand, helices h22 and h23 are straight along their extension. In the case of h22 this is made possible by the fact that the loop connecting helices h21 and h22 is longer than in the other NrfA structures where it is found that the N terminus of helix h22 bends toward the C terminus of helix h21. The packing of the five c-type heme groups and their axial ligands are similar to what has been observed in the NrfA enzymes (Fig.3A). Hemes 2 to 5, according to the order of their binding motifs in the sequence, arebis-histidinyl-coordinated and are most probably used by the enzyme to store and transfer electrons to the active site. Heme 1, which constitutes the active site, is coordinated by a lysine side chain at the proximal side, whereas the iron coordination position at the distal side is vacant. The distances separating the hemes are sufficiently short to allow direct electron transfer between them (33Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar) including electron transfer between the monomers through both hemes 5 at the dimer interface that interact directly with each other by their propionates. The characteristic calcium ion near the active site (calcium I) is also present in D. desulfuricans NrfA but, in this case, there is a very clear second calcium ion (calcium II) with octahedral coordination to protein ligands near the propionates of hemes 3 and 4 (as described below). The most significant structural differences relative to the previous NrfA structures occur in the regions of the sequence contiguous to the N and C termini. These regions are involved at the dimer interface as well as surrounding the putative substrate inlet and product outlet (Fig. 2C). Near the N-terminal region, residues 68 to 76 form an additional loop (loop L1 in Fig. 2C) that is responsible for the caging and octahedral coordination of the second calcium site (calcium II). Following this loop, residues 84 to 94 form another additional polypeptide segment that blocks partially the product outlet as described below (loop L2 in Fig. 2C). The structure at the C-terminal region, comprising residues 463 to 519, is also not conserved. Residues 465 to 470 in this region form a short additional helix (h24 in Fig. 2C) involved in the interaction at the dimer interface, followed by a long loop connecting a one turn α-helix, and three short 310 helices (h26, h27, and h28) in a two-elbow arrangement and ending in a short anti-parallel औ-sheet at the C terminus. The characteristic long curved α-helix found in the other NrfA structures at the C terminus, which surrounds one side of the substrate inlet, is not present in this case (Fig. 2, C and D). The electrostatic potential at the surface of the protein is dominated by the positively charged region around the channel leading to the active site (Fig. 3C) and by the negative electrostatic potential around the putative product outlet. These electrostatic features, conserved in this family of enzymes, are considered to be important to attract the negatively charged nitrite ions to the active site and to drive the positively charged ammonium ions to the exterior of the enzyme. The total contact area at the dimer interface is 1530 Å2, being in the range of the contact extents in the other NrfA structures. The main interaction occurs at helix h23 that packs against h23 and h21 from the other monomer. The N terminus region of helix h21 establishes also an interaction with the short α-helix h18 (residues 307 to 314) at the opposite side of the dimer interface. Another interaction occurs between the additional helices h24 (residues 465 to 470) from both monomers, at the top of the dimer interaction region. The overall interaction is mainly hydrophobic but there is also an electrostatic contribution. The main hydrophobic interactions occur at the contact region of helices h23 and h24 with their ncs symmetry-related mates. However, there is an important electrostatic contribution in the interaction at helix h21 that involves a set of basic residues in this region interacting with negatively charged groups from the other monomer. This interaction involves Lys-356 from the loop at the N terminus of h21, and Arg-364, Lys-371, Lys-378, and Lys-385 from h21 that interact, respectively, with the propionate D from heme 5*, Asp-307* at h18*, and Asp-441*, Glu-448*, and Asp-455* at h23* at the other side of the dimer interface. This contact region is located near the product outlet and, in this way these charged residues make an important contribution to the electrostatic potential in that region. In the monomer alone the electrostatic potential will have only the contribution from the positively charged residues at h21, suggesting that dimer formation is important for creating the negative electrostatic potential around the product outlet. The active site environment of D. desulfuricans NrfA is conserved, with Lys-150 as the proximal axial ligand of the iron in the penta-coordinated heme 1 (Fig.4A). At the distal side of the active site, a blob of electron density in the electron density map could be interpreted as a water molecule bound to the heme iron at a distance of 2.1 Å and H-bonded to the Nε-2 of His-299 with a bond distance of 2.7 Å. His-299 at the distal side of the active site is conserved and its conformation corresponds to a generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot as it happens in the other NrfA structures. The other residues present at the distal side of the active site, Arg-130 and Tyr-237, are also conserved. In addition to Tyr-237, the cavity of the active site is lined by a set of aromatic side chains that are also conserved within the NrfA structures: these include Tyr-106, Phe-108, Tyr-112, and Phe-239. Among these residues, Tyr-237 and Ph"

In eucaryotic cells the synthesis ofN-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins involves the translocation of dolichyl-linked mono- and pentasaccharide intermediates from the cytosolic leaflet to the lumenal monolayer of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 (1Hirschberg C.B.

Similarly, the synthesis of glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors in eucaryotic cells is initiated on the cytoplasmic face of the ER, but the completed anchor structure is linked to protein on the lumenal face (6Vidugiriene J.

The transbilayer movement of phospholipids also occurs during the assembly of the phospholipid bilayers of biogenic membranes in procaryotic and eucaryotic cells (8Rothman J.E. Kennedy E.P. Proc.

Studies using synthetic lipid bilayers indicate that the transbilayer migration of di(N-acetylglucosaminyl)pyrophosphoryldolichol (GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol) and spin-labeled analogues of polyisoprenyl compounds does not occur spontaneously (12Hanover J.A.

Rather, it has been proposed that the transbilayer diffusion of polar-lipid head groups is mediated by specific integral membrane proteins called “flippases” or “translocases” (14Bishop W.R.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Flippase proteins are also believed to be involved in the assembly of a large group of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigens collectively referred to as Wzy-dependent O antigens (20Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.H. Morrison D. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York.1999: 331-358Google Scholar). Although these O antigens are structurally distinct, they are all heteropolysaccharides comprised of oligosaccharide repeat units and all are assembled by the same general mechanism (20Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.H. Morrison D. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York.1999: 331-358Google Scholar). The repeat units of these O antigens are synthesized as undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (Und-P-P)-linked oligosaccharides on the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequently translocated en bloc to the periplasmic face where they are utilized as substrates for chain elongation by a polymerase enzyme (Wzy) (20Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.H. Morrison D. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York.1999: 331-358Google Scholar, 21McGrath B.C. Osborn M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 649-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerization occurs by the transfer of nascent polysaccharide chains from the carrier lipid to the non-reducing termini of newly synthesized carrier lipid-linked repeat units (22Bray W. Robbins P.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 28: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Robbins P.W. Bray D. Dankert M. Wright A. Science. 1967; 158: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The assembly of Wzy-dependent O antigens by this mechanism has been called “block-polymerization.” The O antigen chains are then transferred to the core-lipid A region of LPS, and the completed LPS molecules are translocated to the exterior leaflet of the outer membrane by an unknown mechanism. All of the gene clusters involved in the synthesis of Wzy-dependent O antigens contain a gene, designatedwzx, that is believed to encode the flippase that mediates the transbilayer movement of the Und-P-P-linked repeat unit (24Reeves P.R. Neuberger A. van Deenen L.L.M. Bacterial Cell Wall, New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 27. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1994: 281-314Google Scholar). Analyses of the predicted structures of the putative O antigen flippases have revealed that all are hydrophobic proteins with twelve putative transmembrane domains (24Reeves P.R. Neuberger A. van Deenen L.L.M. Bacterial Cell Wall, New Comprehensive Biochemistry. 27. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1994: 281-314Google Scholar). Although these proteins share very little structural homology at the primary amino acid sequence level, all have strikingly similar hydropathy profiles (25MacPherson D.F. Manning P.A. Morona R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indirect evidence in support of the proposed functions of the O antigen flippases ofSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Shigella dysenteriae was obtained by Liu et al. (26Liu D. Cole R.A. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated the accumulation of single lipid-linked O antigen repeat units on the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane in wzxmutants. However, the mechanism involved in flippase-mediated transbilayer movement of lipid-linked O antigen repeat units, as well as definitive identification of the proteins involved, remains to be established. The assembly of phosphoglyceride-linked enterobacterial common antigen (ECAPG) of Gram-negative enteric bacteria is also believed to occur by a Wzy-dependent mechanism (27Rick P.D. Silver R. Neidhardt F. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 104-122Google Scholar). ECAPG is a glycolipid component of the outer membrane of all Gram-negative enteric bacteria (27Rick P.D. Silver R. Neidhardt F. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B.

The carbohydrate portion of ECA consists of a linear heteropolysaccharide chain comprised ofN-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc),N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid (ManNAcA), and 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-d-galactose (Fuc4NAc) (29Lugowski C.

The available data are consistent with the synthesis of lipid III on the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane followed by its transbilayer movement to the periplasmic face of the membrane where assembly of the polysaccharide chains occurs by a block-polymerization mechanism. The polysaccharide chains are subsequently transferred from the carrier lipid to an as yet unidentified glyceride acceptor to yield ECAPG molecules in which the potential reducing terminal GlcNAc residue is linked to diacylglycerol through phosphodiester linkage (33Kuhn H.-M. Neter E. Mayer H. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 696-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rick P.D. Hubbard G.L. Kitaoka M. Nagaki H. Kinoshita H. Dowd S. Simplaceanu V. Ho C. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Completed ECAPG polymers are then incorporated into the exterior leaflet of the outer membrane. The synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-Und is the initial step in the assembly of the ECA trisaccharide repeat unit (30Rick P.D. Mayer H. Neumeyer B.A. Wolski S. Bitter-Suermann D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 494-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the repeat units of many Wzy-dependent O antigens (20Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.H. Morrison D.

The wecgene cluster also includes a gene designated wzxE (formerlyrfbX) that is believed to encode the flippase that mediates the transbilayer movement of the Und-P-P-linked trisaccharide repeat unit (25MacPherson D.F. Manning P.A. Morona R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, the hydropathy profile of the predicted product of the wzxE gene is almost identical to the hydropathy profiles of the putative flippases involved in the assembly of many Wzy-dependent O antigens (25MacPherson D.F. Manning P.A. Morona R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The O16 O antigen repeat unit of Escherichia coli K-12/O16 is a branched pentasaccharide whose assembly is initiated by the synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-Und catalyzed by WecA, and the assembly of this O antigen is believed to occur by a Wzy-dependent mechanism (36Alexander D.C. Valvano M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7079-7084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yao Z. Valvano M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4133-4143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Stevenson G. Neal B. Liu D.

Recent studies reported that a complete Und-P-P-linked O16 repeat unit was not required for translocation by the WzxO16 translocase (42Feldman M.F. Marolda C.L. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Parodi A.J. Valvano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35129-35138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Indeed, the data presented in these studies suggested that the E. coli WzxO16translocase was able to translocate GlcNAc-P-P-Und. The studies presented here were conducted to investigate a role forwzx genes in the transbilayer movement of Fuc4NAc-ManNAcA-GlcNAc-P-P-Und in E. coli. Attempts to measure the flippase-mediated transbilayer movement of naturally occurring undecaprenyl- or dolichyl-linked substrates are complicated by the extremely hydrophobic nature of these compounds. To circumvent this technical difficulty, we employed a variation of the experimental strategy of Rush et al. (18Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Rush J.S. van Leyen K. Overffelli O. Wolucka B. Waechter C.J.

Bishop and Bell (14Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) originally used a water-soluble analogue of phosphatidylcholine to investigate one or more phosphatidylcholine flippases in sealed rat liver microsomes. Subsequently, phospholipid analogues with short fatty acid chains have been utilized by several other research groups to partially purify and characterize membrane proteins involved in the transbilayer diffusion of phospholipids (43Huijbregts R.P.H. de Kroon A.I.P.M. de Kruijff B.

Furthermore, water-soluble analogues of glucosylceramide have been used to study the transbilayer movement of glucosylceramide in the Golgi apparatus (47Lannert H. Gorgas K. Meissner I. Wieland F.T.

The results presented here demonstrate the translocase-mediated transport of [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Ner into everted membrane vesicles of E. coli. The data support the conclusion that the observed transport was not mediated by the WzxO16translocase, but rather by WzxE, the putative flippase involved in the transbilayer movement of lipid III across the cytoplasmic membrane during the assembly of ECAPG. (s)-Citronellol, nerol (cis-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol), tetramethylammonium phosphate, trichloroacetonitrile, and phosphorous oxytrichloride were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). UDP-N-acetyl-d-[6-3H]glucosamine (40–60 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). [14C]Glucose (360 mCi/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), and it was adjusted to a specific activity of 94 dpm/pmol by the addition of non-radioactive glucose. [3H]GDP-mannose was prepared as described previously (48Rush J.S. Shelling J.G. Zingg N.S. Ray P.H. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13110-13117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selecto silica gel was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). All other chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from standard commercial sources. E. coli K-12 strains used in this study are listed in TableI. Transductions were carried out using phage P1 vir as described by Silhavy et al. (49Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 107Google Scholar). Cultures were routinely grown at 37 °C with vigorous aeration in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (50Miller J.H.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose to give a final concentration of 0.27 or on LB agar containing 0.27 glucose. Tetracycline, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol were added to media to give final concentrations of 10, 50, and 30 ॖg/ml, respectively. Plasmid pRL160 was constructed by digestion of pCA32 (39Meier-Dieter U. Barr K. Starman R. Hatch L. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 746-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) withHindIII yielding an 8.4-kb fragment containingwzxE as well as additional upstream genes of thewec gene cluster. This fragment was digested withXmaI to yield a 7.65-kb fragment that was subsequently ligated to the HindIII and AvaI sites of pBR322. Plasmid pRL162 was constructed by ligation of the 8.4-kbHindIII fragment of pCA32, described above, to the corresponding site of the low copy number vector, pWSK29 (51Wang F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRL147 contained the wecA gene under the control of the PBAD promoter, and it was constructed as follows. ThewecA gene was obtained by PCR amplification of the DNA sequence from bp 9984 to 11141 (GenBankTM accession numberAE000454) using genomic DNA from E. colistrain AB1133 as template. The polynucleotides 5′-CTCTGAGAGCATGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACGTTTCCCAGGCATTGGT-3′ were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively, and anSalI restriction site was incorporated into the reverse primer (underlined sequence). PCR amplifications were carried out usingTaq polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals). The amplified sequence contained 17 bp immediately upstream of the translational start site and 36 bp immediately downstream of the translational termination site, and it was cloned into TA cloning site of the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting construct was digested withEcoRI and SalI, and the 1.1-kb fragment was subcloned into the expression vector, pBAD18 (52Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J.

[3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Ner was synthesized enzymatically using the UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenyl phosphateN-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphate transferase (WecA) present in E. coli membranes. Membrane fractions were prepared as previously described (37Rush J.S. Rick P.D. Waechter C.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained membranes (2.7 mg of membrane protein), 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm neryl phosphate (Ner-P), 40 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 0.1 mmUDP-[3H]GlcNAc (18–1800 dpm/pmol) in a total volume of 3 ml. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 21 °C for 16 h and then subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min using a Beckman TL100.3 micro-ultracentrifuge. The supernatant solution was removed and layered on a 15-ml column of benzyl-DEAE-cellulose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) equilibrated with 10 mmNH4HCO3. The column was developed with two column volumes of 10 mm NH4HCO3followed by a 60-ml gradient of NH4HCO3 (0–1m). Fractions containing [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Ner were pooled and dried by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure at 30 °C. The radiolabeled analogue was then dissolved in H2O and desalted by gel-filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G-10 column (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with H2O. Fractions containing [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Ner were pooled, dried by rotary evaporation, dissolved in a small volume of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v) and layered onto a 15-ml Selecto silica gel column equilibrated with CHCl3. The column was then eluted with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/concentrated NH4OH (65:35:6:1, v/v), and fractions of 3.5 ml were collected. Radiolabeled GlcNAc-P-P-Ner eluted in fractions 8–15. Fractions containing [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Ner were pooled, dried by rotary evaporation, dissolved in 2 ml of CH3OH, and stored at −20 °C until used for transport assays. Formation of [3H]GlcNAc-P-P-Ner was strictly dependent upon the addition of exogenous Ner-P to reaction mixtures. The product was detected as a single radioactive compound when analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates developed with three different solvent systems, and it was detected by a phospholipid-specific spray reagent (55Dittmer J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2005431141,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) regulates the rapid and transient expression of heat shock genes in response to stress. The transcriptional activity of HSF1 is tightly controlled, and under physiological growth conditions, the HSF1 monomer is in a heterocomplex with the molecular chaperone HSP90. Through unknown mechanisms, transcriptionally repressed HSF1·HSP90 heterocomplexes dissociate following stress, which triggers HSF1 activation and heat shock gene transcription. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening system, we have identified Ral-binding protein 1 (RalBP1) as an additional HSF1-interacting protein. We show that RalBP1 and HSF1 interact in vivo, and transient cotransfection of HSF1 and RalBP1 into hsf1−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts represses HSP70 expression. Furthermore, transient cotransfection of HSF1 and the constitutively active form of RalA (RalA23V), an upstream activator of the RalBP1 signaling pathway, increases the heat-inducible expression of HSP70, whereas the dominant negative form (RalA28N) suppresses HSP70 expression. We further find that α-tubulin and HSP90 are also present in the RalBP1·HSF1 heterocomplexes in unstressed cells. Upon heat shock, the Ral signaling pathway is activated, and the resulting RalGTP binds RalBP1. Concurrently, HSF1 is activated, leaves the RalBP1·HSF1·HSP90·α-tubulin heterocomplexes, and translocates into the nucleus, where it then activates transcription. In conclusion, these observations reveal that the RalGTP signal transduction pathway is critical for activation of the stress-responsive HSF1 and perhaps HSP90 molecular chaperone system.

Phosphorylation of HSF1 is indicative of its complex mode of regulation by various signaling pathways. Studies using phosphopeptide analysis of HSF1 protein as well as studies analyzing the transactivation properties of HSF1 using chimeric constructs containing GAL4-HSF1 or LexA-HSF1 have suggested that phosphorylation of serine residues Ser303, Ser307, and Ser363 is likely to be involved in repression of HSF1 transcriptional activity (1Dai R.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases and glycogen synthase kinase 3 are candidates for phosphorylating these residues. HSF1 could potentially be phosphorylated during its activation process as well, perhaps at Ser230 by calcium calmodulin protein kinase II (8Holmberg C.I. Hietakangas V. Mikhailov A. Rantanen J.O.

Specifically, HSP90 has been co-immunoprecipitated with the monomeric form of HSF1, suggesting that an HSP90·HSF1 heterocomplex may keep HSF1 in a repressed state. Disruption of this heterocomplex by stress would allow HSF1 to form trimers and acquire DNA binding capability. One likely outcome of the disruption of HSF1·HSP90 heterocomplexes during stress is the accumulation of denatured polypeptides and the ability of HSP90 to bind such denatured polypeptides (9Bharadwaj S.

Heat shock factor-binding protein 1, which interacts with HSF1 trimers together with HSP70, has also been isolated (12Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I.

HSF1 interacts with a Ral effector molecule, RalBP1, bothin vivo and in vitro. The HSF1·RalBP1 complex dissociates upon Ral activation by heat shock, since RalGTP has a high affinity for the Ral binding domain of RalBP1, thus leading to HSF1 activation. We also show that the HSF1·RalBP1 heterocomplexes contain HSP90 and α-tubulin.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show evidence that the Ral-binding protein RalBP1 interacts with HSF1 in vivo. The RalPB1-HSF1 interaction occurs at 37 °C, and RalBP1·HSF1 heterocomplexes dissociate after heat shock. We also find significantly high levels of HSP90 and α-tubulin in the RalBP1·HSF1 heterocomplexes. This extends the previous observations indicating that the monomeric, repressed form of HSF1 is in heterocomplexes with HSP90 (11Guo Y. Guettouche T. Fenna M. Boellmann F. Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45791-45799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and extends a previous observation that HSF1·HSP90 heterocomplexes are located on α-tubulin that is a component of the cytoskeleton. Under stress conditions, HSP90·HSF1 heterocomplexes dissociate, perhaps because of the affinity of HSP90 for denatured polypeptides (9Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Guo Y. Guettouche T. Fenna M. Boellmann F. Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45791-45799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These results indicate that RalBP1·HSF1·HSP90·α-tubulin heterocomplexes receive signals from stresses that activate the Ral signaling pathway, which also leads to HSF1 activation. HSF1·HSP90 heterocomplexes are reported to be dynamic, and immunodepletion of HSP90 leads to activation of HSF1 (11Guo Y. Guettouche T. Fenna M. Boellmann F. Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45791-45799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We have not detected HSP70/HSC70 proteins in RalBP1· HSF1·HSP90·α-tubulin complexes, a result that is also consistent with previous studies indicating that the repressed form of HSF1 interacts only with HSP90 and not with HSP70 (11Guo Y. Guettouche T. Fenna M. Boellmann F. Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45791-45799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, HSP70 interacts with the trimeric form of HSF1 together with HSP90 and multiple other co-chaperones during the HSF1 inactivation process; this interaction occurs in the nucleus (9Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).We also show that the Ral signal transduction pathway is highly activated by heat shock. Activation of the Ral signaling pathway is associated with conversion of RalGDP to RalGTP and, because of the high affinity of RalGTP for RalBP1, the RalBP1·HSF1·HSP90·α-tubulin heterocomplexes can potentially dissociate, leading to release of HSF1 and allowing it to translocate into the nucleus. It is conceivable that RalBP1·HSF1·HSP90·α-tubulin heterocomplexes also contain protein kinases, and such a kinase could be activated upon activation of the Ral signaling pathway. This protein kinase could then phosphorylate and activate HSF1. Similarly to the Ras-Raf-Mek-extracellular signal-regulating kinase signaling pathway, activation of the Ral signaling pathway could also lead to activation of an as yet unknown protein kinase cascade. Since Ral is found not only in the plasma membrane but also in membrane vesicles, and Ras-independent activation of Ral is calcium-dependent (13Bielinske D.F. Pyun N.Y. Linko-Stentz K. Macara I.

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been implicated in phosphorylation of HSF1 on serine 230, leading to its activation (8Holmberg C.I. Hietakangas V. Mikhailov A. Rantanen J.O. Kallio M.

Ral, through its interacting partners, has been implicated in multiple cellular processes such as endocytosis, actin/cytoskeletal organization, and vesicle function (17Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S.

The significance of the RalBP1 binding to the active form of RalGTP is not understood. RalBP1 contains a weak GTPase activity toward Cdc42 and Rac, which influences the actin cytoskeleton and can modulate the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway (33Ward Y. Wang W. Woodhouse E.

Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RalGTP-RalBP1 interaction represses the activity of Rac. Since Jun N-terminal kinase has been shown to be activated by heat shock (1Dai R. He B. Freitag W. Zhang Y. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18210-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and it has been suggested that it also phosphorylates HSF1 and represses its transcriptional activity during its inactivation cycle (1Dai R. He B. Freitag W. Zhang Y. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18210-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), slowing down Rac activation and similarly slowing down activation of Jun N-terminal kinase after heat shock could perhaps provide a sufficient amount of time for a rapid activation of HSF1 and transcription of downstream genes followed by its subsequent inactivation by phosphorylation by Jun N-terminal kinase and perhaps other protein kinases. RalBP1 has also been shown to interact with the ॖ2 subunit of AP2, which is involved in endocytosis (49Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,55Pishvaee B. Payne G.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, active RalGTP has been suggested to stabilize association of ॖ2-RalBP1 with the membrane, leading to inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis of certain receptors such as epidermal growth factor (49Jullien-Flores V. Mahe Y. Mirey G. Leprince C. Meunier-Bisceuil B. Sorkin A. Camonis J.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, RalBP1 has a Ral binding region, and this region of RalBP1 partially overlaps with the region that binds HSF1. This suggests that Ral and HSF1 could compete for a binding site on RalBP1. However, the HSF1 binding region in RalBP1 requires a number of amino acids that extend to the POB1 binding region. The exact boundaries of the Ral binding region and POB1 binding region in RalBP1, however, has not been fully defined. POB1 (partner of RalBP1) is a protein with unknown function. It contains an Eps15 homology domain, and proteins with such domains appear to be involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis (56Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). RalBP1 and POB1 may link the tyrosine kinase and Src homology 3-containing proteins to Ral. We also have further found that RalBP1 colocalizes and is in the same complex with α-tubulin. Furthermore, HSF1 and HSP90 also colocalize to this same complex. This is significant, since these results locate the repressed HSF1 on the cytoskeletal proteins that have been shown to undergo major morphological changes upon heat stress (47Liang P. MacRae T.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further show that the Ral signaling pathway is activated by heat shock, and transient transfection of the constitutively active form of Ral (RalA23V) increases HSP70 expression in both H1299 cells, which contain endogenous HSF1, andhsf1−/− MEF cells in which HSF1 was transiently expressed. These results strongly suggest that activation of the Ral signaling pathway increases RalGTP binding to RalBP1, and therefore, there is less RalBP1 that is present in cells to bind and repress HSF1. Similarly, transient transfection of RalBP1 inhsf1−/− MEF reduced HSF1-mediated HSP70 expression.In conclusion, we show that HSF1 interacts with RalBP1 in vivo at 37 °C. HSF1·RalBP1 heterocomplexes also contain HSP90 and α-tubulin. Upon heat shock, HSF1 dissociates from RalBP1 and translocates into the nucleus. This coincides with the activation of the Ral-GTP signaling pathway as shown by an increase in Ral-GTP binding to the Ral binding domain of RalBP1. Expression of constitutive active RalGTP leads to an increase in HSP70 e"

We determined the crystal structure of TLGT with and without an inhibitor, acarbose. TLGT is composed of two domains: an N-terminal domain (domain I), which contains a (β/α)7 barrel fold, and a C-terminal domain (domain II), which has a twisted β-sandwich fold. In the structure of TLGT complexed with acarbose, the inhibitor was bound at the cleft within domain I, indicating that domain I is a catalytic domain of TLGT. The acarbose-bound structure also clarified that Glu123 and Asp214 were the catalytic nucleophile and acid/base catalyst, respectively, and revealed the residues involved in substrate binding. It seemed that TLGT produces large cyclic glucans by preventing the production of small cyclic glucans by steric hindrance, which is achieved by three lids protruding into the active site cleft, as well as an extended active site cleft. Interestingly, domain I of TLGT shares some structural features with the catalytic domain of Golgi α-mannosidase from Drosophila melanogaster, which belongs to glucoside hydrolase family 38. Furthermore, the catalytic residue of the two enzymes is located in the same position. These observations suggest that families 57 and 38 evolved from a common ancestor.

The degree of polymerization of known CAs varies, from six to several hundreds of glucose units. α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins, which are the smallest CA species, consisting of 6, 7, and 8 glucose units, respectively, are well known doughnut-shaped rigid molecules and are able to accommodate guest molecules in their central cavity, yielding inclusion complexes. Although larger species of CA, which were recently found to be products of potato 4-α-glucanotransferase (3Takaha T. Yanase M. Takata H. Okada S. Smith S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2902-2908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), also form inclusion complexes, they have flexible single-helical conformations in an aqueous solution unlike cyclodextrins (4Kitamura S. Isuda H. Shimada J. Takada T. Takaha T. Okada S. Mimura M. Kajiwara K. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 304: 303-314Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and they lose their flexibility and fold into a compact structure during complex formation (5Kitamura S. Nakatani K. Takaha T. Okada S. Macromol. Rapid Commun. 1999; 20: 612-615Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because of this structural difference from cyclodextrins, large CAs show the advantageous features of the formation of inclusion complexes and higher solubility in water and thus are expected to be valuable for future industrial use (6Takaha T. Smith S.M. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 1999; 16: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an artificial chaperone activity of large CAs has also been reported (7Machida S. Ogawa S. Xiaohua S. Takaha T. Fujii K. Hayashi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). According to Henrissat's classification (8Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 9Coutinho, P. M., and Henrissat, B. (1999) Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes server, afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/∼cazy/CAZY/index.html.Google Scholar), TLGT belongs to family 57 of the glycoside hydrolases. Most family 57 enzymes catalyze reactions similar to those of some α-amylase family members (families 13, 70, and 77). However, no sequence similarity has been detected between family 57 and α-amylase family enzymes. The three-dimensional structures of many α-amylase family enzymes, including that of Thermus aquaticus amylomaltase (10Przylas I. Tomoo K. Terada Y. Takaha T. Fujii K. Saenger W. Strater N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 873-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which produces large CAs, have been determined (11Matsuura Y. Kusunoki M. Harada W. Kakudo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 12Klein C. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 13Katsuya Y. Mezaki Y. Kubota M. Matsuura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and the amino acid residues involved in the catalysis have also been studied extensively (for a review, see Ref. 14Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In contrast to α-amylase family enzymes, family 57 enzymes have received less investigation. Although the catalytic nucleophile of TLGT was recently determined (15Imamura H. Fushinobu S. Jeon B.S. Wakagi T. Matsuzawa H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12400-12406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), its three-dimensional structure, acid/base catalyst, and mechanism for large CA production remain unknown. Previously, we made a preliminary report of the crystal structure of TLGT (16Imamura H. Fushinobu S. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Wakagi T. Matsuzawa H. J. Appl. Glycosci. 2001; 48: 171-175Crossref Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the detailed structures of TLGT with and without a tetrasaccharide inhibitor, acarbose. The structures revealed the residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding of the enzyme and provided insight to investigate the mechanism for the production of large CAs. Purification and Crystallization—The nonlabeled enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (15Imamura H. Fushinobu S. Jeon B.S. Wakagi T. Matsuzawa H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12400-12406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In the last purification step, the buffer was changed to 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the enzyme was concentrated to 10–20 mg/ml by centrifugal filtration using a Centriplus 30 (Millipore). The seleno-methionine-labeled enzyme was coexpressed in the methionine auxotrophic E. coli strain B834(DE3) (Novagen) with GroELS and tRNA cognates for AGA and AGG in a medium containing seleno-methionine. The purification procedures for the labeled enzyme were the same as those for the nonlabeled enzyme, except that the buffer used in the last step was replaced by 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Form I crystals were obtained at 25 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 5 μl of protein solution with 5 μl of a reservoir solution comprising 1.9 m ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5. The crystals were harvested in a solution comprising 2.2 m ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400 and 0.1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5. The concentration of trehalose (a gift from Hayashibara (Okayama, Japan), recrystallized before use) in the harvesting solution was increased stepwise to 25% (w/v), and then the crystals were subjected to flash freezing before data collection. Form II crystals were grown at 25 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The drops were made by mixing 5 μl of protein solution with 5 μl of a reservoir comprising 35% (w/v) 2,4-dimethylpentanediol (Hampton Research), 20 mm calcium chloride, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The crystals were transferred to a solution comprising 40% (w/v) 2,4-dimethylpentanediol, 20 mm calcium chloride, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by flash freezing. Acarbose-bound crystals were obtained by soaking crystals overnight in a solution comprising 40% (w/v) 2,4-dimethylpentanediol, 20 mm calcium chloride, 10 mm acarbose (a gift from Bayer), and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by flash freezing. Data Collection—A multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data set for a seleno-methionine-labeled form I crystal was collected at wavelengths of 1.0400 Å (remote), 0.9793 Å (peak), and 0.9795 Å (edge) at 100 K on beamline BL45PX of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). A native data set for a form II crystal was collected at a wavelength of 1.0200 Å at 100 K on beamline BL45PX of SPring-8. An acarbose-bound data set for a form II crystal was collected at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å at 100 K on beamline BL18B of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The first two data sets were processed with DENZO and Scalepack (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar), and the last one was processed with Mosflm (18Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). Phase Calculation and Refinement—For phase calculation of the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data set, the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) was used. The multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion map was improved by density modification using the program DM (20Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). The model for “form I-Se” was built into the resultant electron density map using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) and refined to 2.8 Å resolution, including simulated annealing, bulk solvent correction, and grouped B-factor refinement with the program CNS (22Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Water molecules were picked automatically from Fo - Fc electron density maps using the program CNS and checked manually at a graphic station. The phase for form II-free crystal was calculated by molecular replacement using form I-Se as the initial model using the program CNS. Noncrystallographic symmetry was found on the self-rotation function, but it was not used for cross-rotation function nor translation function. Density modification was not applied to the molecular replacement solution. The calculated model was refined to 2.4 Å resolution, including rigid body minimization, simulated annealing, and grouped B-factor refinement with the program CNS. The two TLGT monomers in the asymmetric unit were not restrained during refinement, because there are some variations in the conformation of the two molecules as described later. The final model was found to exhibit good geometry, as determined using the program Procheck (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar); 88.7% of the residues have ϕ/Ψ angles in the “most favored region” of a Ramachandran plot. The model for form II complex was also refined using the program CNS. During refinement of form II complex, the ligands were added based on 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. The refinement statistics are presented in Table I. A structural data base search was performed using the DALI server (24Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar). Least mean square fitting of the structures was carried out with the program LSQMAN (25Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide model shown in Fig. 7 was constructed using the program XtalView (26McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsForm I-SeForm II-freeForm II-complexBeamlineSPring-8 BL45PXSPring-8 BL45PXPhoton factory BL18BCell constant (Å)a = b = 124.9, c = 246.9a = 137.7, b = 161.5, c = 70.4a = 137.6, b = 161.0, c = 70.2Wavelength (Å)1.04000.97930.97951.02001.0000Resolution range (Å)aThe values in parentheses are for the outer resolution shell20-2.8020-2.8020-2.8050-2.4040-2.4(2.90-2.80)(2.90-2.80)(2.90-2.80)(2.49-2.40)(2.53-2.40)Observed reflections107608104954106848394421274277Unique reflectionsaThe values in parentheses are for the outer resolution shell27918 (2760)27937 (2724)27795 (2731)61900 (6064)61753 (8891)Completeness (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the outer resolution shell98.4 (98.9)98.5 (98.2)98.3 (98.2)99.7 (99.3)99.9 (99.9)<I>/<σ> (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the outer resolution shell11.9 (7.2)9.0 (4.5)11.7 (7.0)10.6 (9.8)6.3 (2.2)Rmerge (%)aThe values in parentheses are for the outer resolution shell4.2 (18.6)6.7 (24.6)4.4 (17.7)8.3 (15.7)9.0 (32.1)Figure of meritbThe value in parenthesis is after density modification.

An oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-GTGTTCCATGACAATGGTGAAAAGTTCGG-3′ and a complementary oligonucleotide, which replaced the codon for Asp214 (GAC) with AAT and introduced a HphI site for rapid screening of the mutation, were used. The mutation was reconfirmed by sequencing with an ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Activity toward maltotriose was measured as described previously (27Imamura H. Jeon B.S. Wakagi T. Matsuzawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberated 1 μmol of glucose from maltotriose per min at 80 °C. Structure Determination—TLGT was crystallized in two forms (forms I and II). Form I crystals belonged to hexagonal space group P6422 and form II crystals to orthorhombic space group P21212. First, we determined the structure at 2.8 Å resolution by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method using a form I crystal labeled with seleno-methionine. The model was refined to an R-factor of 22.1% (Table I). We called this structural model form I-Se. The form I crystal contained one TLGT monomer/asymmetric unit. Next, we determined the structures of a form II crystal through molecular replacement in the free form, designated as form II-free, and in a complex form with acarbose, designated as the form II-complex. Acarbose, an inhibitor of α-amylase family enzymes, β-amylases, and glucoamylases, is a maltotetraose analog composed of a nonreducing end inhibitory group, acarviosine, and a reducing end maltose. Acarbose also inhibits the activity of TLGT. 3H. Imamura and H. Matsuzawa, unpublished results. The form II crystal contained two TLGT monomers (chains A and B)/asymmetric unit (Fig. 1a). The form II-free structure was refined to an R-factor of 19.5% at 2.4 Å resolution (Table I). Overall Structure—The TLGT monomer has approximate dimensions of 50 × 55 × 90 Å. TLGT is composed of two distinct domains; an N-terminal domain (domain I, residues 1–381) and a C-terminal domain (domain II, residues 389–659) (Fig. 1), comprising 20 α-helices, 24 β-strands, and eight 310-helices (Fig. 2). There is no cross-over between the two domains. Domain I—The core of domain I is a (β/α)7 barrel (residues 1–258), in which seven central parallel β-strands (β1, β2, β3, β4, β5, β7, and β8) are flanked by helices (Fig. 3a). The (β/α)7 barrel is followed by a helical region that consists of 10 helices including the three-helix bundle made of α16, α17, and α18 (Figs. 1a and 3b) and covers the C termini of the (β/α)7 barrel, forming a cleft between them. The observation that acarbose was bound in the cleft in the form II complex (see below) and that the catalytic nucleophile Glu123 (15Imamura H. Fushinobu S. Jeon B.S. Wakagi T. Matsuzawa H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12400-12406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was located in the middle of the cleft indicates that the cleft is an active site and domain I is a catalytic domain. Domain II—Domain II of TLGT is composed entirely of β-strands, with the exception of two short α-helices (α19 and α20). This domain is characterized by a β-sandwich fold, in which two layers of anti-parallel β-sheets are arranged in a nearly parallel manner. The layer adjacent to domain I consists of 10 β-strands (β10, β11, β12, β13, β14, β15, β20, β21, β22, and β23), and the other layer consists of seven β-strands (β16, β17, β18, β19, β21, β22, and β24). β21 and β22 bend sharply and lie across the two layers. The same fold is found in chondroitin AC lyase from Flavobacterium heparinum (Protein Data Bank code 1CB8), β-galactosidase from E. coli (1BGL), hyaluronate lyase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (1EGU), methylamine oxidase from Hansenula polymorpha (1A2V), and copper amine oxidases from pea seedlings (1KSI) and E. coli (1OAC). Although the function of domain II is unclear at present, this domain may play a role in transglycosylation reaction of TLGT, because it has been suggested that β-sandwich domain of E. coli β-galactosidase is involved in transglycosylation reaction (28Juers D.H. Huber R.E. Matthews B.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Calcium-binding Site—A calcium ion was bound at the loop between β10 and β11 in domain II (Figs. 1a and 2). The calcium ion was coordinated with Oδ1 of Asp392, Oδ2 of Asp394, Oδ1 of Asp396, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Arg398, and Oϵ1 and Oϵ2 of Glu400. In form II-free, one additional calcium ion was identified between Glu60 of chain B and Asn248 of chain A of an adjacent asymmetric unit (data not shown). Because no form II crystals were observed when calcium chloride was omitted from the crystallization buffer, the latter calcium ion may promote crystallization by tightening the interaction between the two TLGT molecules. Catalytic Residues—An acarbose-TLGT complex was obtained by soaking a form II crystal in a buffer containing acarbose. The structure of the complex was determined at 2.4 Å resolution and refined to an R-factor of 19.8% (Table I). Electron density corresponding to an intact acarbose molecule was clearly observed for the active site of chain A (Fig. 4a). As expected, the acarbose molecule bound to subsites -1 to +3, where the acarviosine moiety, the inhibitory disaccharide group of acarbose, occupied subsites -1 and +1 and the maltose moiety occupied subsites +2 and +3 (Fig. 5a). The nomenclature for the subsites is according to Davies et al. (29Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). This is the inhibitory binding mode observed for most of the structures of α-amylase family enzymes in complex with acarbose (30Przylas I. Terada Y. Fujii K. Takaha T. Saenger W. Strater N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6903-6913PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages can be classified into two major types according to the anomeric configuration of the product, retaining and inverting, and in both cases the catalytic residues are typically two carboxylates (31McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In retaining glycoside hydrolases, such as TLGT (2Jeon B.S. Taguchi H. Sakai H. Ohshima T. Wakagi T. Matsuzawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Imamura H. Fushinobu S. Jeon B.S. Wakagi T. Matsuzawa H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12400-12406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), one residue acts as a nucleophile and the other as an acid/base catalyst. Glu123 is close (3.15 Å) to the C1 atom of the valienamine moiety at subsite -1, allowing nucleophilic attack (Fig. 4c), which is consistent with the results of a cross-linking study that demonstrated Glu123 to be a catalytic nucleophile (15Imamura H. Fushinobu S. Jeon B.S. Wakagi T. Matsuzawa H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12400-12406Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is considered most likely that Asp214 is the acid/base catalyst of TLGT, because Oδ2 of Asp214 is only 2.96 Å away from the amide group of the valienamine moiety (this amide group is replaced by a glucosidic oxygen in a native substrate) (Fig. 4c), and there is no other acidic residue nearby. The average distances between all four pairs of O atoms of Glu123 and Asp214 (6.72 and 6.97 Å in the acarbose-free and acarbose complex structures, respectively) are in appropriate range for retaining enzymes (32Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). We generated the D214N mutant, in which Asp214 was replaced by Asn. The specific activity of the D214N mutant (0.0016 units/mg) was decreased about 10,000-fold as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme (17.7 units/mg). These results indicate that Asp214 is the acid/base catalyst.Fig. 5Schematic drawing of subsite structures of TLGT.a, interactions between acarbose and residues at subsites -1 to +3. b, interactions between maltose and residues at subsites -6 and -5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subsite Structure—Fig. 5a shows interactions between acarbose and the protein. The valienamine moiety at subsite -1 is within hydrogen bonding distance of His11 and Asp354 and interacts with His13, Glu216, and Trp357 via water molecules. The 6-deoxyglucose moiety is fixed at subsite +1 with Arg124, Asp213, and Asp214 through hydrogen bonds, with Tyr272 through aromatic stacking, and with Trp221 through a hydrophobic interaction. The glucose moiety at subsite +2 is bound to Arg182 and Asp213 though hydrogen bonds, to Tyr183 through an aromatic stacking interaction, and to Trp221 through a hydrophobic interaction. The glucose moiety at subsite +3 seems to be more flexible, because it only exhibits a stacking interaction with Phe187 and a hydrophobic interaction with Trp221, i.e. no hydrogen bonding interaction with the protein. In contrast to chain A, acarbose did not bind at the active site of chain B of the form II complex, and only a Tris molecule was identified there (data not shown). Tris was also found at the active site of chain B of the form II-free (Fig. 1a). Although acarbose did not bind to the active site, we found electron density corresponding to disaccharide, which seems to be maltose, at the edge of the active site cleft of chain B (Fig. 4b). The reducing end of maltose is ∼14.5 Å apart from subsite -1, suggesting that this binding site corresponds to subsites -5 and -6. The glucose moiety at subsite -5 is bound to His368 through a hydrogen bond and to Phe19 through a hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 5b). The glucose moiety at subsite -6 is within hydrogen bonding distance of Arg371 and exhibits hydrophobic interactions with Phe19 and Tyr601 (Fig. 5b). In chain A, maltose did not bind to this site, because this region was involved in the crystal contact. From the complex structure with acarbose, TLGT was revealed to possess at least nine subsites, -6 to +3, although the residues forming subsites -4 to -2 could not be determined in this study. Unexpectedly, a glucose molecule was found at subsite +1 of form I-Se (data not shown). Glucose interacted with Arg124, Asp214, Asp213, and Tyr272. Interactions between glucose and these residues in form I-Se are the same as those observed between the +1 glucose moiety of acarbose and the corresponding residues in the form II complex. Glucose was probably derived from trehalose reagent, which was used as a cryoprotectant and contained a trace amount of glucose. The active site cleft of TLGT is tunnel-like in shape, as evidenced by the three lids that cover the cleft (Figs. 6 and 7). The first lid (lid 1, residues 220–224) protrudes from the (β/α)7 barrel (Fig. 2). The second (lid 2, residues 358–363) and third (lid 3, 627–630) lids protrude from the three-helix bundle and domain II, respectively (Fig. 2). Upon binding of acarbose, the conformations of lids 2 and 3 change significantly (Fig. 6). In the absence of acarbose, the side chains of Val360 and Phe361 are directed toward the active site cleft. The bound acarbose collides with the side chains of Val360 and Phe361, leading to movement of lid 2. This movement induces a large movement of lid 3 (Fig. 6). For example, the Cα of Ser627 and Glu628 move 4.2 and 6.2 Å, respectively. In addition to the movements of these two regions, the χ1 axis of Tyr183 and the χ2 axis of Phe187 rotated to interact with the pyranose rings of the maltose moiety via hydrophobic stacking at subsites +2 and +3, respectively (Fig. 6). Subunit Interface—Although the TLGT gene encodes a 78-kDa polypeptide, purified TLGT is eluted as a 168-kDa protein in gel filtration chromatography using Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) (data not shown). This indicates that TLGT is a homodimer, as previously suggested by Xavier et al. (1Xavier K.B. Peist R. Kossmann M. Boos W. Santos H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3358-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a form II crystal, two TLGT monomers, which are in an asymmetric unit, interact via the same surface of domain I, because there is a pseudo-2-fold axis between them (Fig. 1a). In a form I crystal, two TLGT monomers, which are in adjacent asymmetric units associated through a 2-fold axis, interact in the same manner (data not shown). This observation indicates that the two TLGT monomers interact in the same manner as observed in these crystals. Two hydrogen bond networks and a hydrophobic patch form the primary contribution to the interactions between the two subunits (Fig. 8a). One hydrogen bond network is constructed from two water molecules and six residues: Glu166 and Tyr266 from one monomer, and Ala91, Lys314, Asn324, and Lys328 from the other (Fig. 8a). The hydrophobic patch is formed by Leu287, Phe288, Phe291, Leu295, Tyr304, Phe307, and Val308 (Fig. 8b). In particular, Leu295 and Val308 are conserved (Fig. 2) and in contact with their counterparts in the other monomer (Fig. 8b), which suggests that they play a central role in the hydrophobic contact in this region. The proportion of the buried surface area (∼1500 Å2) is large enough for dimerization, compared with the total molecular surface of a monomer (∼22300 Å2). Oligomerization is known to be one of the strategies by which proteins acquire thermostability (33Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Because the dimer interface is located on the opposite"

The protein predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the gene has 367 amino acids and a molecular mass of 42 kDa. Several sequence motifs found in other FPPSs are present in TbFPPS, including an 11-mer peptide insertion present also in the Trypanosoma cruziFPPS. Heterologous expression of TbFPPS inEscherichia coli produced a functional enzyme that was inhibited by several nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, such as pamidronate and risedronate. Risedronate was active in vivoagainst T. brucei infection in mice (giving a 607 survival rate), but pamidronate was not effective. The essential nature ofTbFPPS was studied using RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the expression of the gene. Expression of TbFPPSdouble-stranded RNA in procyclic trypomastigotes caused specific degradation of mRNA. After 4 days of RNAi, the parasite growth rate declined and the cells subsequently died. Similar results were obtained with bloodstream form trypomastigotes, except that the RNAi system in this case was leaky and mRNA levels and parasites recovered with time. Molecular modeling and structure-activity investigations of enzyme and in vitro growth inhibition data resulted in similar pharmacophores, further validating TbFPPS as the target for bisphosphonates. These results establish that FPPS is essential for parasite viability and validate this enzyme as a target for drug development.

Bisphosphonates are pyrophosphate analogs in which the oxygen bridge between the two phosphorus atoms has been replaced by a carbon substituted with various side chains. Several bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and are in clinical use for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia caused by malignancy, and tumor metastases in bone (7Rogers M.J.

Although a recombinant FPPS from Trypanosoma cruzi has recently been shown to be potently inhibited by bisphosphonates (17Montalvetti A. Bailey B.N. Martin M.B. Severin G.W. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33930-33937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the question as to whether or not this enzyme is essential for trypanosomatid viability has remained unresolved. Here, we report the results of RNA interference (RNAi) studies together with in vitro and in vivoinhibition studies that demonstrate that FPPS is indeed an essential cellular component in T. brucei. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, protease inhibitor mixture, geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum (normal and dialyzed) was from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA) and Serum Plus was from JRH Biosciences (Lenex, KS). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Taqpolymerase, the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, Trizol reagent, and 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder were from Invitrogen. pCR2.1-TOPO cloning kit, and Superscript II RT were from Invitrogen. Hybond-N nylon membrane, PD-10 desalting column, and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. [4-14C]IPP (57.5 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The pET-28a+ expression system and BenzonaseTM nuclease were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pZJM vector was a gift from Paul Englund (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (18Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). All other reagents were analytical grade. Bisphosphonates and the bromohydrin pyrophosphate (Fig. 1) were synthesized using standard methods (3Martin M.B. Grimley J.S. Lewis J.C. Heath III, H.T.

(2000) French Patent 2,782,721.Google Scholar) and were characterized by C/H/N microanalysis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Procyclic forms of T. brucei,strain ILTar 1, were grown in SDM-79 supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum (FBS). Procyclic form cell line 29-13 and bloodstream form (cell line BF, with a single marker) co-expressing T7 RNA polymerase and Tet repressor were gifts from G. A. M. Cross (Rockefeller University) (21Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Procyclic forms were grown in SDM-79 supplemented with 157 FBS or dialyzed FBS in the presence of G418 (15 ॖg/ml) and hygromycin (50 ॖg/ml). Bloodstream forms were grown in HMI-9 medium (22Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) supplemented with 107 FBS or dialyzed FBS with 107 Serum Plus, and G418 (2.5 ॖg/ml). Cell densities were determined using a Neubauer chamber. Procyclic forms were diluted to 1 × 106cell/ml and bloodstream forms to 0.5 × 105 cell/ml and cultured in appropriate media. Growth curves were plotted by using the product of the cell density and the dilution factor. A fragment of 428 bp of the TbFPPS gene was amplified using the oligonucleotide primers TbFPPS1(5′-GGCTATTTGTTAGTGAGGCT-3′) and TbFPPS2(5′-CTTCTGGCGCTTGTAAGTCT-3′) derived from a T. bruceigenomic survey sequence (GenBankTM accession numberAQ651702) that showed pronounced similarity to FPPSs of other organisms. Based on this sequence, we designed specific primers to obtain the entire coding sequence using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system, version 2.0 (Invitrogen). The primerTbFPPS2 was used for cDNA synthesis and the primersTb-5′-SL (5′-AACGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTG-3′), complementary to the T. brucei 5′-spliced leader sequence, and TbFPPS3 (5′-CCCACAGAGTTTCTACGCTG-3′), complementary to sequences just upstream of the primer TbFPPS2, were used to amplify the 5′ end of the TbFPPS. The PCR was performed with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, using 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase, and cDNA as template, 200 pmol of each of the two primers, 1× Pfubuffer, and 0.2 mm dNTPs in a total volume of 50 ॖl. For 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primer, and primers TbFPPS1 and oligo(dT) were used to amplify the 3′ end of the gene. Two oligonucleotide primers based on the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the TbFPPSgene were then used to amplify the entire coding sequence, usingPfu DNA polymerase and T. brucei genomic DNA as a template. PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence of TbFPPS was aligned with the sequences of other FPPSs by using the Biology Workbench 3.2 utility. 2Workbench.sdsc.edu. The sequences alignment and phylogenetic tree were done using CLUSTAL W (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and PHYLIP phylogeny packages (version 3.5c) (24Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) following the method of Saitou and Nei (25Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment corresponding to the FPPS from T. brucei(nucleotides 130–810) was amplified using the 5′ primer (CCGCTCGAGTTGGGCGGCAAATACAAC) and the 3′ primer (CCCAAGCTTGACTTTTCCTAGCCGCTC) having flanking XhoI andHindIII sites, respectively. The resulting 680-bp fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO, verified by sequencing, and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of the pZJM vector (26Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For stable transfection of the procyclic form (cell line 29-13) and the bloodstream form (cell line BF) via integration into a rDNA spacer region, the vector was linearized by NotI digestion. Transfectants were selected using phleomycin (2.5 ॖg/ml) (18Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The procyclic forms were cloned 1 day after transfection by limiting dilution while the bloodstream forms were cloned immediately after electroporation, by splitting cells into 24 wells of a microtiter plate. For induction of RNAi, cells were cultured in the presence of tetracycline (1 ॖg/ml). Total genomic DNA from procyclic T. brucei was isolated by phenol extraction (27Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), digested with different restriction enzymes, separated on a 17 agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membranes. The blot was probed with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled TbFPPS. After hybridization, the blot was washed three times in 2× SSC, 0.17 SDS at 65 °C (SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 msodium citrate). For the Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from procyclic and bloodstream forms using Trizol reagent. RNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 17 agarose gels containing 1× Mops buffer (20 mm Mops, 0.08 m sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA) and 6.297 (v/v) formaldehyde, after boiling for 10 min in 507 (v/v) formamide, 1× Mops buffer, and 5.97 (v/v) formaldehyde. The gels were transferred to a Hybond-N filter and hybridized with a probe containing the entire coding sequence of theTbFPPS gene obtained by PCR. All Southern and Northern blots were visualized by autoradiography. A fragment of the α-tubulin gene was used as a control in Northern blots (26Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of Northern blots were performed by using a Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440 CF. Comparison of levels of TbFPPS transcription between non-induced and induced cells was performed by taking as a reference the densitometric values obtained with the TbFPPStranscripts from non-induced parasites. To analyze the level ofTbFPPS mRNA in cells grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline, total RNA was also isolated from equal cell numbers and used for reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis using SuperScript II RT and the same set of primers that were used to amplify the fragment (680 bp) that was cloned into the pZJM vector. For expression in E. coli, the entire coding sequence of theTbFPPS gene was amplified by PCR. Oligonucleotide primers for amplification of the FPPS coding region, ATG-TbFPPS(5′-CTAGCTAGCATGCCAATGCAAATG-3′) and TGA-TbFPPS(5′-CCCAAGCTTCACTTCTGGCGCTTGTA-3′), were designed so thatNheI and HindIII restriction sites were introduced at the 5′ and 3′ ends for convenient cloning in the expression vector pET-28a+ to give pETbFPPS, which was cloned and propagated in Escherichia coli DH5α. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed to confirm that the correct reading frame was used, with the polyhistidine tag placed in the N-terminal position. Subsequently, pETbFPPS was used to transformE. coli BL21(DE3). Bacterial clones were grown in LB medium containing 50 ॖg/ml kanamycin. When induction was performed, bacterial cells transformed with pETbFPPS were first grown to an A600 of 0.6 at 37 °C and then 1 mm isopropyl-औ-d-thiogalactoside was added. After 5 h of growth at 37 °C, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mmimidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2), incubated with 10 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min on ice, then sonicated. The lysate was incubated with BenzonaseTM nuclease for 15 min on ice, then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, then loaded onto a column and washed with lysis buffer in which the concentration of imidazole increased from 15 and 25 mm. Protein was eluted from the column with the same buffer but containing 500 mm imidazole. The eluted fraction was desalted with a PD-10 desalting column. Proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard and analyzed for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Total trypanosome proteins (30 ॖg of protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (107). Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. Membranes were probed with a 1:1,000 dilution of a rabbit anti-FPPS polyclonal antiserum prepared against recombinant T. cruzi FPPS (17Montalvetti A. Bailey B.N. Martin M.B. Severin G.W. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33930-33937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were revealed by using goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) and the ECLTM chemiluminescent detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). To purify the T. cruzi FPPS antibodies, an affinity matrix was prepared by coupling 5 mg of T. cruziFPPS to 1 ml of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma). Immune serum (3 ml) was diluted 2-fold with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the affinity matrix overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and the eluate was neutralized with 0.1 volume of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The activity of the enzyme was determined by using the radiometric assay described previously (17Montalvetti A. Bailey B.N. Martin M.B. Severin G.W. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33930-33937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the activity required to incorporate 1 nmol of 4-[14C]IPP into 4-[14C]FPP in 1 min. BALB/c mice (8 weeks old) were infected intraperitoneally with 10,000 T. bruceibloodstream trypomastigotes (monomorphic strain 427 from clone MITat 1.4, otherwise known as variant 117). Starting the next day, mice were then treated intraperitoneally with pentamidine or bisphosphonates in 200 ॖl of 0.97 sodium chloride solution for the times and doses indicated under “Results.” Control mice received only the vehicle. Using an avian FPPS x-ray structure as a template (Protein Data Bank number 1UBW (29Tarshis L.C. Proteau P.J. Kellogg B.A. Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 15018-15023Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar)), a homology model of TbFPPS was built using default settings in the Modeler module of Insight II (30Accelrys, Inc. Insight II Program 2000.1. Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). The majority of models constructed in this way were immediately discounted because of energy considerations and restraint violations, leaving a small group of structures that was further evaluated using the Procheck program (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). In the reported model, the number of residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and the overall G-factor were significantly better than typical for 2.6-Å resolution structures (917 and 0.0, respectively). This, together with the fact that the root mean square deviation of the homology model from the template for non-loop atoms was only 0.41 Å, lends confidence to the quality of the reported structure. To model GPP in the TbFPPS active site, we transferred the GPP coordinates from the template model into the TbFPPS structure. This resulted in steric clashes between GPP and Tyr99, because the template residue for Tyr99 in the avian crystal structure is a F113S mutant and so provides little information about the side chain geometry of Tyr99. To correct this, the geometries of His98 and Tyr99 were therefore optimized, because the template for His98 is also a mutant (F112A) and hence also lacks important side chain information. Rotamer searches for His98 and Tyr99 were performed to minimize the GPP-Tyr99 and His98-Tyr99 interactions. Hydrogen atoms were added within Insight II to simulate a pH of 7.0, and GPP was taken to be deprotonated. CHARMM27 potentials and partial charges were applied to all atoms, except for the vinylic hydrogens in GPP, which were set manually. Charges for GPP were obtained using the Gaussian 98 program (32Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G. Montgomery Jr., J.A. Stratmann R.E.

Gaussian 98, Revision A. 9. Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1998Google Scholar), using the x-ray coordinates of GPP to calculate Merz-Singh-Kollman charges at the HF/6–31++G** level. The coordinates of His98 and Tyr99 were then optimized by using 1000 steps of steepest descents minimization, then further optimized by using the conjugate gradient algorithm to a gradient tolerance of 0.0001 kcal mol−1 Å−1. This structure was then uploaded to the Consurf server 3F. Glaser, T. Pupko, I. Paz, R. E. Bell, D. Bechor, E. Martz, and N. Ben-Tal, www.consurf.tau.ac.il. and Rasmol (33Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar) was used to visualize the three-dimensional locations of highly conserved residues in the TbFPPS model. To further understand the activities of the bisphosphonates investigated (Fig. 1), we applied pharmacophore modeling techniques to the TbFPPS inhibition results discussed later. The HipHop module in Catalyst 4.6 (34Accelrys, Inc. Catalyst 4.6 Program. Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA2000Google Scholar) was used to identify the spatial relationships of the chemical features common to the most active models. Compounds1, 2, 3, 4, and5 (Fig. 1) were used in pharmacophore generation, because only these compounds were identified as “active” by Catalyst default settings. Up to 255 best quality conformations of each compound were built using the Confirm module in Catalyst 4.6. We allowed models to contain two negative ionizable features, one positive charge feature, and one custom endocyclic carbon atom feature, as input for pharmacophore generation. Although HipHop did not identify any pharmacophore that could map all four features in each compound, a suitable hypothesis that did identify these features was found by merging two HipHop models. For comparison purposes, T. brucei cell growth inhibition data (4Martin M.B. Sanders J.M. Kendrick H. de Luca-Fradley K. Lewis J.C. Grimley J.S. Van Brussel E.M. Olsen J.R. Meints G.A. Burzynska A. Kafarski P. Croft S.L. Oldfield E. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2904-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was used to build a quantitative pharmacophore model using the Hypogen module in Catalyst 4.6 (34Accelrys, Inc. Catalyst 4.6 Program. Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA2000Google Scholar). For this model, we used the same features as in the TbFPPS analysis, but pharmacophores found in this way did not adequately describe the activities of the aliphatic bisphosphonates. To account for these compounds, a hydrophobic aliphatic feature was added to the Hypogen pharmacophore to describe long chain compounds. The endocyclic carbon feature was modified to also identify terminal methyl carbon atoms in short side chains (less than 6 heavy atoms long), thus accounting for the increased potency of olpadronate with respect to pamidronate. This pharmacophore gave good correlation between predicted and experimental IC50values, with R2 = 0.68 (data not shown). To screen for genes encoding FPPS in T. brucei, the amino acid sequence of T. cruziFPPS (AF312690) was used to search the T. brucei data base of The Institute for Genome Research (TIGR) using tBLASTn. This search yielded six T. brucei genomic survey sequence clones. The predicted amino acid sequence encoded by clone 6A5 (accession numberAQ651702) contained the C terminus of this protein. The fragment of theT. brucei FPPS gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers complementary to the genomic survey sequence with genomic T. brucei DNA acting as a template. The product of the amplification (428 bp) was ligated into vector pCR2.1TOPO for sequence analysis. This sequence enabled appropriate gene-specific primers to be designed for the generation of 5′-end and 3′-end DNA fragments using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (35Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar) and reconstruction of a full-length cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of 2070 bp revealed an open reading frame of 1101 bp, which encodes a 367-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 42 kDa. Two oligonucleotide primers based in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of this gene were then used to amplify the open reading frame from genomicT. brucei DNA, to obtain a genomic clone. The open reading frame was identical with the full-length cDNA. A BLAST search of the protein data base showed that the amino acid sequence from T. brucei has 32–687 identity and 50–817 similarity with other representative FPPS. The amino acid sequence of the T. brucei enzyme was aligned with the sequences of T. cruzi, human, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae FPPSs as shown in Fig. 2A. All residues involved in catalysis or binding (regions I–VII) identified in other FPPSs (36Koyama T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) are present in the T. brucei enzyme. A CLUSTALW alignment of FPPS peptide sequences from avian, some mammalian, fungal, plant, and bacterial FPPSs was then used as the basis for the generation of a phylogentic tree (Fig. 2B). The results suggested that T. brucei and T. cruzienzymes shared a most recent common ancestor. Plasmodium falciparum and fungal and plant FPPSs were the closest outgroups to the trypanosomatid sequences. Southern blot analysis was performed with a PCR fragment that encompasses the entire coding region of TbFPPS (Fig.3A). Digestions with enzymes that cut at sites not contained within the coding region of the gene gave single bands (EcoRI, HindIII,XhoI), whereas two bands were obtained with enzymes with unique restriction sites in the open reading frame (KpnI,SpeI, AvaI, HincII, NsiI), suggesting that the gene was single copy per haploid genome. TbFPPS was expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) as a fusion protein with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. Affinity chromatography on nickel-chelated agarose permitted a simple, one-step purification. Enzyme purity was judged by using SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3B). The final protein preparation catalyzed the incorporation of 4-[14C]IPP into a hexane-extractable material when the allylic substrates, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and GPP, were used (data not shown) (17Montalvetti A. Bailey B.N. Martin M.B. Severin G.W. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33930-33937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). 4-[14C]IPP incorporation into the organic solvent extractable material was linear with time for at least 60 min. The radioactive assay was performed in the presence of different concentrations of Mg2+ and Mn2+, to determine their effect on the T. brucei FPPS. Mg2+ and Mn2+ were added to the reaction mixture at concentrations between 0.5"
https://openalex.org/W2037832555,"Nogo-A is a potent neurite outgrowth inhibitory protein in vitro and is suggested to play a role in the lack of regeneration in the central nervous system of adult higher vertebrates. A shorter splice isoform, ASY/Nogo-B, has recently been reported to act as a proapoptotic protein, the loss of which would be typical for cancer cells. Here, we show that the osteosarcoma cell line SaOS-2 and the cell line CHO do express high levels of endogenous Nogo-B and that stable transfectants overexpressing high levels of Nogo-B do not differ significantly from the respective parental wild-type or control cell lines both in respect to cell proliferation and to spontaneous apoptosis or cell death induced by staurosporine and tunicamycin. The deletion of the second transmembrane domain of Nogo-B, which has been claimed to abolish its proapoptotic activity, leads to a shift of the protein from the ER to a cytoplasmic localization, suggesting that ER stress of highly overexpressed Nogo-B may lead to aversive cellular reactions under particular conditions. Our data do not support a function of Nogo-B as a physiological pro-apoptotic protein in certain types of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2047285350,"Fission yeast Rhp23 and Pus1 represent two families of multiubiquitin chain-binding proteins that associate with the proteasome. We show that both proteins bind to different regions of the proteasome subunit Mts4. The binding site for Pus1 was mapped to a cluster of repetitive sequences also found in the proteasome subunit SpRpn2 and the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) subunit Cut4. The putative role of Pus1 as a factor involved in allocation of ubiquitinylated substrates for the proteasome is discussed. Fission yeast Rhp23 and Pus1 represent two families of multiubiquitin chain-binding proteins that associate with the proteasome. We show that both proteins bind to different regions of the proteasome subunit Mts4. The binding site for Pus1 was mapped to a cluster of repetitive sequences also found in the proteasome subunit SpRpn2 and the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) subunit Cut4. The putative role of Pus1 as a factor involved in allocation of ubiquitinylated substrates for the proteasome is discussed. anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ubiquitin-like ubiquitin-associated glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is a mechanism employed in eukaryotic cells not only to recycle damaged and misfolded proteins but also to control cellular processes by specific breakdown of regulatory proteins (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6952) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinylation is accomplished in multiple steps (2Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Initially ubiquitin is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) in an ATP-dependent process whereby the E1 forms a thiol ester bond with the C terminus of ubiquitin. Subsequently the ubiquitin molecule is transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). E2s carrying ubiquitin associate with substrate binding ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) resulting in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate protein. Several rounds of this conjugation process produce substrates carrying a chain of ubiquitin moieties. There is a range of different E2s that associate with various E3s, incorporating an element of substrate specificity to this process. Ubiquitin protein ligases can be divided in two major groups, HECT domain E3s and RING finger domain E3s. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)1belongs to a family of multimeric ubiquitin protein ligases of the RING finger type that also include the SCF and the VCB (2Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 3Page A.M. Hieter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 583-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has a molecular mass of 700 kDa and consists of 11 different subunits. Mitotic events are controlled by the APC/C via multiubiquitinylation of cell cycle regulators like Cut2/Pds1p/securin and B-type cyclins. Once a ubiquitin chain is conjugated to these proteins they become targets for degradation by the 26 S proteasome enabling the continuation of downstream mitotic events. The 2.5 MDa 26 S proteasome catalyzes the degradation of cellular proteins in an ATP-dependent manner (4Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Its proteolytic component is the 20 S core complex, a cylindrical structure comprising four stacked rings each containing seven proteins. The inner rings enclose a central chamber harboring the catalytic sites. Access to the lumen is provided via the outer rings and regulated by the 19 S regulatory complex that is attached to one or both ends of the 20 S core (5Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). The 19 S regulatory complex can be dissociated in two subcomplexes called the base and the lid (6Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 7Ferrell K. Wilkinson C.R. Dubiel W. Gordon C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Six ATPases subunits are presumed to form a structure that associates with the 20 S core. Together with the two largest subunits of the proteasome SpRpn2/Rpn2/S1 and Mts4/Rpn1/S2 these ATPases form the base complex that was suggested to be participating in the unfolding and translocation of substrates. The lid complex is believed to contact the base via the subunits SpRpn2/Rpn2/S1, Mts4/Rpn1/S2, and Pus1/Rpn10/S5a. It is composed of a number of non-ATPase subunits whose function remains rather enigmatic. Proteasomes lacking the lid can cleave small peptides in an ATP-dependent manner, but they are unable to degrade ubiquitinylated proteins (6Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Thus the lid is believed to be involved in the recognition and processing of those substrates. To date, one subunit of the proteasome has been found to possess the ability to recognize multiubiquitinylated substrates, namely Pus1/Rpn10/S5a (8Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, given the fact that in yeast the corresponding RPN10/pus1+ genes are not essential for cell viability, other mechanisms must clearly exist for this crucial step in the degradation process (9Wilkinson C.R. Ferrell K. Penney M. Wallace M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15182-15192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the UBA/UBL domain proteins Rhp23/ Rad23p and Dph1/Dsk2p can interact with both the proteasome and with multiubiquitin suggesting that these factors play a role in the recognition and delivery of substrates for proteolysis (10Wilkinson C.R.

The Pus1/Rpn10p protein contains a stretch of 20 amino acids recently defined as ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) that is involved in multiubiquitin chain binding, whereas in Dph1/Dsk2p and Rhp23/Rad23p the task is accomplished by a C-terminal ubiquitin pathway associated (UBA) domain (9Wilkinson C.R.

Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). As Pus1/Rpn10p does not have a UBL domain it must use different structures to associate with other proteasome subunits. Lambertson et al. (18Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were able to precipitate the proteasome from cells deleted for RPN10 and RAD23 using tagged Rad23p or Rpn10p, respectively, demonstrating that these proteins bind to the proteasome independently. So far little is known about how ubiquitinylated substrates arrive at the proteasome. Some ubiquitinylating enzymes associate directly with the proteasome as shown for the E2s Ubc1, Ubc2, Ubc4, and Ubc5 as well as for the E3s Ubr1p, Ufd4p, and KIAA10 (19Ortolan T.G. Tongaonkar P. Lambertson D. Chen L. Schauber C. Madura K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that multiubiquitin-binding proteins provide a link between components of the ubiquitinylation machinery and the proteasome as implied by the finding that hPLIC proteins, the human homologues of Dph1/Dsk2p, associate with E3 proteins (24Kleijnen M.F.

However, previously neither Rhp23/Rad23p nor Pus1/Rpn10p have been reported to interact with ubiquitinylating enzymes. To improve our understanding of how the proteasome recruits ubiquitin substrates we started to investigate the association of these proteins with the 19 S regulatory complex. We characterize regions in proteasome subunits that bind Pus1 and Rhp23 and describe the interaction of these multiubiquitin-binding proteins with the APC/C. Sequence similarity searches were carried out using Psi-BLAST (version 2.2.3) (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60199) Google Scholar) using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix for the first iteration. Sequences identified with a BLAST E-value of <1e−5 at convergence were filtered to remove overly similar sequences (807 identity in alignment) and aligned using ClustalW (1.74). The HMMer 2.0 package (version 2.2g;) was used to generate and optimize Hidden Markov models (HMMs) from the multiple sequence alignment. HMMsearch was used with the HMM to identify further examples of the UBL binding region in the SPTR data base. Fission yeast strains used in this study (wt, mts2-1,mts4-1, Δpus1, cut4-533,cut9-665, and cut9HA) are derivatives of the wild-type heterothallic strains 972h− and975h+. Standard genetic methods and media were used as described, andS. pombe transformations were performed by the lithium acetate procedure (26Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). The plasmid pREP1Rhp23 was produced as described (10Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To generate Mts4 constructs FL (full-length), CΔ1 (amino acids 1–755), CΔ2-(1–582), CΔ3-(1–180), NΔ1-(181–891), NΔ2-(408–891), and PC-1-(408–582) cDNAs were amplified from the pmts4+ plasmid (27Wilkinson C.R. Wallace M. Seeger M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25768-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) except Mts4PC1, which was subcloned into pET6H (Novagen). Regions encoding the PC repeats of SpRpn2 (amino acids 385–744) and Cut4-(873–1023) were amplified from genomic S. pombe DNA as these regions of the gene do not contain introns and subcloned into pQE30. GST-Pus1 full-length, NΔ1 (amino acids 84–243), NΔ2-(144–243), and CΔ1-(1–193) were constructed by inserting the amplified pus1+ cDNAs into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences). GST-Rhp23 proteins were produced as described (10Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). pREP1GST and pREP1GST-Pus1 plasmids were generated by amplifying thegst+ and gst-pus1+cDNAs from pGEX-KGPus1 and inserting them into the pREP1 vector (28Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-Udp7 was produced by amplifying theudp7+ open reading frame from genomic S. pombe DNA and inserting in-frame into the pGEX-KG plasmid. The full-lengthrhp23+ gene and the UBL encoding domain ofrhp23+ were subcloned into the MCS of the pAS2 vector (Clontech). The yeast strain Y190was transformed using this construct as bait. The obtained transformants were then transformed again, this time with a series of constructs encoding proteasomal subunits cloned into the pACT2 vector (Clontech) as prey. The obtained double transformants were tested for growth on plates containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) and for their ability to activate the lacZ reporter by filter lifts assays. Only the Mts4 pACT2 prey construct scored positive in both of these tests. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS, bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer and protein/beads ratio was adjusted to about 1 mg/ml. For assays using His-tagged constructs, proteins were expressed in E. coli M15 cells (Qiagen) and lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 107 glycerol, 17 Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). 0.5 ml of the cleared extract were mixed with 15 ॖl of beads bound to GST or GST fusion protein and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the extracts varied between 10 and 50 mg/ml depending on the expression level of the His-tagged protein. The beads were washed four times in buffer A and resuspended in 50 ॖl of SDS sample buffer. 10 ॖl of the samples were separated on 10 or 127 SDS gels and subjected to Western blot analysis. For binding assays using total yeast extracts, cells were grown to an OD5950.8, lysed in buffer B (1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 in buffer A) using glass beads (Braun) and cleared by centrifugation. The extracts were adjusted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml, and the binding assay was performed as described for the bacterial extracts except that Buffer B was used for washing the beads. Antisera used in Western blots were polyclonal anti-Mts2, monoclonal anti-HA12CA5 (Roche Diagnostics), and monoclonal anti-His6 (a gift from V. Van Heiningen). pREP1GST and pREP1GST-Pus1 were transformed into cut9HA cells and total extracts of S. pombe transformants expressing gst+ andcut9HA+ or gst-pus1+ andcut9HA+ were prepared as described under “In vitro Binding Assays.” 1 ml of the extract containing 5 mg of total protein were incubated with 15 ॖl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in buffer B, resuspended in 50 ॖl of SDS sample buffer, and 10 ॖl were loaded onto a 107 SDS gel. GST and GST-Pus1 were visualized by Coomassie staining and Cut9HA by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics). As a first step to characterize the interactions of Rhp23 with the proteasome we employed the yeast two-hybrid system. We tested the ability of Rhp23 to bind to the proteasomal subunits Mts1 (Rpn9), Mts2 (Rpt2p), Mts3 (Rpn12p), SpRpn2 (Rpn2), Mts4 (Rpn1), Pad1 (Rpn11), Pus1 (Rpn10), SpRpt1 (Rpt1), SpRpt6 (Rpt6), and to the proteasome-associated ubiquitin hydrolase Uch2. The two-hybrid assay detected an interaction of Rhp23 with Mts4, a subunit of the proteasomal base complex (data not shown). To test whether there is also a genetic interaction between rhp23+ andmts4+ we used the fission yeastmts4-1 strain that carries a mutation in the gene encoding Mts4 (27Wilkinson C.R. Wallace M. Seeger M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25768-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By transforming mts4-1 cells with the plasmid pREP1Rhp23, in which Rhp23 expression is driven by the thiamine inducible nmt1 promoter, we were able to partially suppress the temperature sensitive (ts) phenotype of the mutant (Fig.1A). As a control we also introduced the plasmid into mts2-1 cells, which have a mutation in the gene for the proteasome subunit Mts2 and display a temperature sensitive phenotype similar to mts4-1 (29Gordon C. McGurk G. Dillon P. Rosen C. Hastie N.D. Nature. 1993; 366: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, transformation of mts2-1 with pREP1Rhp23 could not rescue the mutant phenotype indicating that the interaction betweenrhp23+ and mts4+ is specific. In addition, the observed genetic interaction was dependent on the Rhp23 UBL domain as when this domain was deleted from therhp23+ gene suppression of the mts4-1mutant no longer occurred. 2C. Gordon and R. Hartmann-Petersen, unpublished results. In order to determine whether this genetic interaction reflected a direct physical interaction between Rhp23 and Mts4, we performed anin vitro binding assay. A GST-Rhp23 fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with His-tagged full-length Mts4 as well as N- and C-terminal truncated versions of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli. As shown, GST-Rhp23 precipitated Mts4 from the bacterial extracts (Fig. 1B) demonstrating a direct interaction between these proteins. The use of truncated versions of Mts4 revealed that Rhp23 binds within a region stretching from amino acid position 181 to 407. It has been shown that Rhp23 binds the proteasome via its UBL domain (10Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore the binding of Rhp23 to Mts4 should also be dependent upon the UBL domain. Truncated versions of Rhp23 fused to GST were used in an in vitro binding assay similar to the one described above. We found that only the truncation of Rhp23 containing the UBL domain could precipitate Mts4 indicating that the UBL domain mediates the binding between them (Fig. 1C). To demonstrate that binding to the Mts4/Rpn1 subunit of the 26 S proteasome is a general property of proteins that contain a UBL domain we assayed the fission yeast Udp7 protein (SwissProt accession numberQ94580). The Udp7 protein, like the Rhp23 protein, contains a UBL domain in its N terminus. When assayed in vitro GST-Udp7 was able to precipitate Mts4 protein from the bacterial extracts demonstrating an interaction (Fig. 1D). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the UBL domain is a general Mts4/Rpn1 interaction domain. It has been demonstrated in budding yeast that Rpn10p (Pus1) interacts with Rpn1 (Mts4) in an in vitro binding assay (20Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2497-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus we investigated interactions between these two subunits. Previously, a genetic interaction was detected between the genes encoding these two proteins. The mts4-1 allele was found to be synthetically lethal with a null allele of pus1(9Wilkinson C.R. Ferrell K. Penney M. Wallace M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15182-15192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Pus1 binding site within Mts4 was determined in an in vitro binding assay using the same Mts4 constructs employed for mapping the Rhp23 binding site. An N-terminal GST fusion of Pus1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was used to precipitate full-length Mts4 as well as truncated versions of the protein. We could narrow down the binding site for Pus1 on Mts4 to a stretch of amino acids ranging from position 408 to 582 (Fig.2, A and B). This particular region contains a cluster of repeats that can also be found in SpRpn2, the fission yeast homologue of the budding yeast Rpn2p subunit of the proteasome, and in Cut4 a subunit of the APC/C or anaphase- promoting complex (30Lupas A. Baumeister W. Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 195-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the repeats are rather weakly conserved they appear to be present only in orthologues of the proteins mentioned. In the Prosite data base (www.expasy.ch/ prosite/) this structure is referred to as APC_SEN3_REPEAT (accession number PS50248), whereas the Pfam data base (www.sanger.ac.uk/Pfam/) lists it as PC_rep for proteasome/cyclosome repeat (accession number PF01851). We will therefore call it PC repeat. Having shown that Pus1 binds to one of the PC repeat modules found in Mts4 we asked whether Pus1 might also interact with the PC repeat modules present in SpRpn2 and Cut4. Moreover we wanted to narrow down the region of Pus1 that is responsible for binding the PC repeat structures. We expressed truncated versions of Pus1 with an N-terminal GST fusion. These constructs were tested in a binding assay using His-tagged PC repeat modules of Mts4, SpRpn2 and Cut4. Both the full-length Pus1 and PusCΔ1 were capable of binding to all three PC repeat modules tested, whereas no binding was observed using Pus1NΔ1 and Pus1NΔ2 (Fig. 2B). From these data we conclude that the N-terminal region of Pus1 up to amino acid position 84 appears to contain a region necessary for binding PC repeat modules. We have demonstrated that Pus1 can bind to the PC repeat module present in the APC/C subunit Cut4 in vitro. If Pus1 binds to Cut4 in vivo, it should be possible to use the GST-Pus1 fusion protein to precipitate the APC/C from fission yeast extracts. Therefore we incubated GST-Pus1 and GST-Rhp23 with extracts from cut9HAcells that carry a genomically HA-tagged version of the APC/C subunit Cut9 and tested whether these GST fusions could precipitate the APC/C and/or the proteasome. Because Rhp23 and Pus1 bind to multiubiquitin chains it had to be considered that they might interact with multiubiquitinylated substrates attached to the APC/C. Taking that into account, we also used Pus1N5 and Rhp23PP, which have mutations in their ubiquitin binding domains and do not bind multiubiquitin (9Wilkinson C.R. Ferrell K. Penney M. Wallace M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15182-15192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we tested truncated versions of Pus1, which lack the C-terminal multiubiquitin binding motif (Pus1CΔ1) as well as versions of Rhp23 lacking either its UBL domain (Rhp23NΔ1) or both UBA domains (Rhp23CΔ1). We were able to precipitate the APC/C and the proteasome using Pus1, Pus1N5, or Pus1CΔ1 fusion proteins but not Pus1NΔ1 or Pus1NΔ2 (Fig. 3A). These findings indicate that the interaction of Pus1 with the APC/C and the proteasome is independent of its ability to bind ubiquitin conjugates but can be assigned to the Pus1 N terminus up to amino acid position 84, which is consistent with the results of the mapping studies involving the Cut4 PC repeat region. Rhp23, Rhp23PP, and Rhp23 but not Rhp23NΔ1 were found to precipitate the proteasome, confirming that the UBA domains of Rhp23 are not involved in proteasome binding (10Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, the APC/C binding activity of Rhp23 appears to be mediated by its multiubiquitin binding UBA domains as we could detect APC/C when beads coated with Rhp23 or Rhp23NΔ1 but not with Rhp23PP or Rhp23CΔ1 were used. Thus it is likely that Rhp23 binds via multiubiquitinylated substrates associated with the APC/C. Given that Pus1 and Cut4 interact directly, we investigated whether any genetic interactions exist using existing mutant alleles of these genes. We crossed theΔpus1 strain to the temperature sensitive mutant cut4-533 (31Hirano T. Funahashi S. Uemura T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2973-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spores carrying both thecut4-533 and the Δpus1 allele were not viable. As a control Δ pus1 was crossed to cut9-665another temperature sensitive APC/C mutant (31Hirano T. Funahashi S. Uemura T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2973-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic lethality was not observed between cut9-665 and Δpus1indicating a specific genetic interaction betweenpus1+ and cut4+. In order to elucidate whether the genetic data mirror an in vivo interaction between Pus1 and the APC/C we performed co-precipitation studies. Extracts from cut9HA cells expressing either GST or GST-Pus1 were incubated with glutathione beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As presented in Fig.3B we detected the APC/C subunit Cut9 in precipitates fromcut9HA/GST-Pus1 but not fromcut9HA/GST indicating an in vivointeraction between Pus1 and the APC/C. We have characterized the interactions of Pus1 and Rhp23, representing two families of multiubiquitin-binding proteins, with the proteasome and the APC/C. Our studies demonstrate that Rhp23 binds to Mts4, a base component of the proteasomal 19 S regulatory complex. The UBL domain of Rhp23, which is responsible for the interaction with the proteasome, appears to bind the Mts4 protein between amino acid positions 181 and 407. Using this sequence to search the data base demonstrates that it is only found in other Mts4/Rpn1 orthologues from other species. Interestingly, this sequence comprises part of a pfamB domain, pfam B_4211. A multiple sequence alignment of the conserved pfamB domain is shown in Fig. 4. A homology search of the recently sequenced S. pombe genome with this pfamB domain demonstrated that it was only present in the Mts4 protein. Considering that there are a number of proteins carrying UBL domains two conclusions could be drawn. Either the structures that interact with the different UBL domains do not resemble each other, or all proteins containing a UBL domain can bind to Mts4/Rpn1. In this study we have shown that the UBL domain containing protein Udp7 is also able to interact directly with Mts4/Rpn1 indicating that the latter hypothesis seems more probable. Consistent with this hypothesis the Dph1/Dsk2, Bag1, and Ubp6/Usp14 UBL containing proteins have already been shown to bind the proteasome, presumably by interaction with the Mts4/Rpn1 subunit, although this has only been shown for the budding yeast Dsk2 protein (32Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 33Luders J.

Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Using protein cross-linking studies it has been reported that the budding yeast Dsk2 and Rad23 UBLs interact with both the Rpn1 and Rpn2 subunits (35Saeki Y. Sone T. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, in our in vitro binding experiments we found no interaction with the fission yeast Rpn2 orthologue and the fission yeast Rad23 orthologue, Rhp23. A recent study in budding yeast also indicated that the UBL domain of Rad23 specifically bound to the Rpn1 subunit and showed little affinity for the Rpn2 protein (32Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However the UBL binding domain identified in Rpn1 by this group was different to that found by our binding studies of the Mts4 protein. However, in each case the UBL-binding region was defined by a series of nested deletions and the binding region left was internally consistent. Therefore, further experiments will have to be carried out to resolve this apparent paradox in the different UBL binding sites, which might reflect a difference in the budding and fission yeast proteins. The structure of the UBL domain has recently been solved by NMR spectroscopy and shown to be related to ubiquitin (36Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether mono-ubiquitin or tetra-ubiquitin could bind to Mts4. In an in vitro binding assay we were not able to detect binding between those proteins (data not shown). In addition, in mammalian cells it has been shown that the hHR23 and S5a proteins, the human versions of the fission yeast Rhp23 and Pus1 proteins, can directly interact with each other (37Hiyama H. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Maekawa T. Tanaka K. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28019-28025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Using deletion analysis the S5a binding site was determined to be in the second UIM binding domain present in this protein. This domain is not present in the simpler versions of the fission yeast Pus1 and budding yeast Rpn10 proteins (9Wilkinson C.R. Ferrell K. Penney M. Wallace M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15182-15192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Consistent with this we observed no direct interaction between the fission yeast Pus1 and Rhp23 proteins. 3M. Seeger and C. Gordon, unpublished results. The proteasome subunits SpRpn2 and Mts4 appear to play a central role in the structural organization of the 19 S regulatory complex. They link the ATPases of the base and components of the lid and also harbor binding sites for proteins that recognize multiubiquitinated substrates (See Fig. 5). This provides a simple model for the delivery of ubiquitinated substrates between the lid subcomplex and the ATPase ring. Presumably upon release from the multiubiquitin-binding proteins the ubiquitnated subtrates are captured by the multiubiquitin binding Rpt5/S6′ ATPase, before the substrate protein is unfolded by the action of the ATPase ring and the polypeptide translocated to the 20 S catalytic complex for degradation (39Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Pus1 association with Mts4 revealed a specific interaction between Pus1 and a cluster of PC repeats in Mts4. These repetitive sequences contain an alternating pattern of large aliphatic residues and glycine or alanine (30Lupas A. Baumeister W. Hofmann K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 195-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these repeats form a structure possessing a concave surface of a hydrophobic nature which might represent a binding site. According to the Prosite data base, Mts4 contains two PC repeat clusters with five and three repeats, respectively, which we call here PC-1 and PC-2. The mapping experiments show that PC-1 is sufficient to bind Pus1. It is conceivable that PC-1 and PC-2 together form one binding site. This would imply that deletion of PC-2 does not interfere with the integrity of the binding site, but that PC-2 on its own is unable to form a functional binding structure itself. Mts4 binds not only Rhp23 and Pus1, its human homologue S2 was also shown to associate with the HECT E3 KIAA10 (22You J. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19871-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). SpRpn2 can bind Pus1 and for its budding yeast orthologue Rpn2p, an interaction with the RING finger E3 Ubr1p was demonstrated (20Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2497-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Data base searches revealed that PC repeats can be found only in the two largest subunits of the proteasome Mts4/Rpn1 and SpRpn2 and in the APC/C component Cut4/APC1. In binding studies we demonstrated that Pus1 could bind also to the PC repeat clusters of SpRpn2 and Cut4. This indicates that binding of Pus/Rpn10 represents a general and conserved function of these PC repeat structures. The Pus1/Rpn10 protein represents a special case among regulatory subunits of the proteasome as it is the only subunit that also occurs in low molecular weight fractions of cell extracts (9Wilkinson C.R. Ferrell K. Penney M. Wallace M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15182-15192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M.

Biochem. 1995; 231: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore it has been suggested that Rpn10p might have a role in linking the proteasome base and lid, based on the observation that the 19 S regulatory complex dissociates easily when purified from a null allele of RPN10 (6Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Our binding studies using truncated forms of Pus1 show that deletion of the N-terminal region up to amino acid position 84 is sufficient to abolish not only the ability of Pus1 to bind PC repeat modules but also its association with the proteasome and the APC/C. Glickman et al. (6Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) demonstrated that budding yeast Rpn10p deleted for its N-terminal region up to position 61 can still bind to the proteasomal base complex, but not to the lid. As the PC repeat-containing subunits of the proteasome are part of its base component the data suggests that in Pus1 the region between amino acids 61 and 84 is indispensable for the interaction with the PC repeat modules. Interestingly the N terminus of Rpn10p up to position 50 has been shown to be critical for the degradation of Ub-Pro-औ-gal and resistance to amino acid analogues (14Fu H. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. van Nocker S. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1970-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore the ability of Pus1/Rpn10p to bind the proteasome might be crucial for these phenotypic functions of the protein. However, considering that Pus1 binds multiubiquitin chains as well as associating with the APC/C and the proteasome, it is conceivable that it has a role in the delivery of multiubiquitinylated substrates to the proteasome. Pus1 and UBA/UBL proteins might represent separate but, in terms of substrate specificity, overlapping pathways that facilitate the transfer of substrates from ubiquitin protein ligases to the proteasome. Alternatively one could speculate that Pus1 acts as a factor involved in delivery of multiubiquitinylated substrates, be it from the APC/C to UBA/UBL proteins and to the proteasome or directly from E3s to the proteasome. Depending on which pathway is used to deliver the substrate, Pus1 might associate with the appropriate PC repeat structure in order to facilitate the process. Therefore one would predict that Pus1 binds to Mts4 when substrates are acquired via Rhp23 or KIAA10 or it uses the SpRpn2 PC repeat for the Ubr1p pathway. Recently it has been demonstrated that valosin-containing protein, a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) family, can bind ubiquitin chains and is essential for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of certain proteasome substrates (41Dai R.M. Li C.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Future work will shed light on the relationship between the various factors involved in the recruitment of multiubiquitinylated proteins to the proteasome and elucidate further the role of individual proteasomal subunits in this process.

Several reports have investigated the regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, which varies along with cell differentiation and upon various stimulations, but very little is known about the regulation of its expression. In a first part, we show that the expression of 4E-BP1 protein and transcript decreases in hematopoietic cell lines cultivated in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). This decrease depends on the activation of the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinases. 4E-BP1 expression also decreases when the p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is activated by granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor but to a lesser extent than with PMA. In a second part, we examine how 4e-bp1 promoter activity is regulated. PMA and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor induce Egr-1 expression through ERK and p38 activation, respectively. Using a dominant negative mutant of Egr, ZnEgr, we show that this transcription factor is responsible for the inhibition of 4e-bp1 promoter activity. In a third part we show that histidine decarboxylase, whose activity and expression are inversely correlated with 4E-BP1 expression, is a potential target for the translational machinery. These data (i) are the first evidence of a new role of ERK and p38 on the translational machinery and (ii) demonstrate that 4E-BP1 is a new target for Egr-1. 4E-BP1 plays a major role in translation by inhibiting cap-dependent translation initiation.

The predominant step in translational regulation is the initiation phase, which consists of the recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA (2Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). This occurs through recognition of the 5′ cap structure (m7GpppX, where X is any nucleotide) by the cap-binding protein complex eIF4F (eukaryotic initiation factor 4F) which, in higher eukaryotes, consists of three subunits: eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G. The initiation process is largely regulated through changes in the phosphorylation state of eIFs and other components involved in this process (3Raught B. Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Imataka H. Morino S.

Gingras A.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition to the regulation of its phosphorylation, the activity of eIF4E is tightly controlled through reversible interaction with a family of inhibitory proteins termed 4E-BP (eIF4E-binding proteins). Of the three known proteins (4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, and 4E-BP3), 4E-BP1, also named PHAS-1, is the best characterized. 4E-BP1 specifically inhibits cap-dependent translation by competing with eIF4G for binding to the cap-binding factor eIF4E and consequently preventing the formation of the eIF4F complex (6Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The affinity of the 4E-BPs to eIF4E depends on their phosphorylation state. Hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs interact with high affinity with eIF4E, whereas hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BPs, elicited by stimulation of cells with hormones, cytokines, or growth factors, results in an abrogation of eIF4E-binding activity. Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or a downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase effector, Akt/protein kinase B, and FRAP/mTOR (FKBP and rapamycin-associated protein), leads to 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation (7von Manteuffel S.R.

Induction of HL-60 and U-987 cell differentiation by PMA or interferon-γ into monocytic/macrophages results in a dephosphorylation and consequent activation of 4E-BP1. In contrast induction of HL-60 into the granulocytic differentiation by Me2SO decreases 4E-BP1 expression level, whereas it increases 4E-BP2 expression level (44Grolleau A. Sonenberg N. Wietzerbin J. Beretta L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3491-3497PubMed Google Scholar, 45Grolleau A Wietzerbin J. Beretta L. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1909-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Expression of 4E-BP2 is down-regulated during thymocyte maturation (46Beretta L. Singer N.G. Hinderer R. Gingras A.C. Richardson B. Hanash S.M. Sonenberg N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3269-3273PubMed Google Scholar), but nothing is known about the mechanisms by which 4E-BP expression is modified. We derived from the pluripotent UT7 cell line a subpopulation, the UT7D1 cell line, which in the presence of the growth factor GM-CSF spontaneously expresses the mRNA coding for histidine decarboxylase (HDC). Stimulation of these cells during 24 h with PMA induces a basophil differentiation characterized by an induction of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 expression, the presentation of the basophil Bsp-1 antigen, and an increase in histamine production (47Dy M.

Whereas the induction of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, the HDC expression seems to be regulated at a post-transcriptional level (47Dy M. Pacilio M.

Thus we examined the activity of the translational initiation machinery in PMA-treated UT7D1 cells. Such a treatment induced a decrease in 4E-BP1 expression, but 4E-BP2 or eIF4E expressions did not change. We also have shown that 4E-BP1 expression is negatively regulated at the transcriptional level by the ERK and p38 via the induction of Egr-1 expression. Ultimately we have provided new insights into the regulation of HDC expression at the translational level.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatments—Human UT7D1, 11OC1, HEL, K562, and HMC1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% 100× l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 2 ng/ml of recombinant GM-CSF (R&D) was added to the UT7D1 cell line. Passages were performed every 3 or 4 days at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), 10 ng/ml rapamycin, 25 μm LY294002, 3 μm bisindolylmaleimide, 10 μm U0126, 20 μm PD98059, or 10 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem) were added to the medium 30 min before PMA (Sigma) treatment (20 ng/ml) for 30 min to 48 h as indicated.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA were extracted by a modified method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (49Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar), using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 20 μg of total RNA were separated on agarose formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nylon membranes (HybondTM-N+; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane filters were hybridized with [32P]dATP random primed cDNA probes prepared from a partial 4e-bp1 cDNA fragment amplified per PCR (sense primer, 5′-GGACTACAGCACGACCCCCG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-TGACTCTTCACCGCCCGCCC-3′), a partial 4e-bp2 cDNA fragment amplified per PCR (sense, primer 5′-GGGGGACGGTCTTCTCCACC-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GCATGTTTCCTGTCGTGATTGTTC-3′), a partial hdc cDNA fragment amplified per PCR (sense primer, 5′-GCCCGATGCTGATGAGTCCT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CACCGTCTTCTTCTTAGTCT-3′) or a partial cDNA fragment of egr-1 (GenBankTM accession number AA507023). Hybridized filters were washed under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC, 70 °C), analyzed by autoradiography, and quantified using QuantityOne. Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the blots with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe or staining of the ribosomal RNA with ethidium bromide.Protein Kinase Assays—1 × 106 UT7D1 cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C). Kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 20 min using 20 μl of lysate in 25 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μm ATP) containing 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 3 μg of Hsp25 (nicely provided by Professor Matthias Gaestel) as substrate. The proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 7.5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried, and kinase activity was analyzed by autoradiography.Western Blot—The cell lysates were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (HybondTM; Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm Tris, 40 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, and 20% methanol at 1 mA/cm2 for 90 min. The membranes were blocked for 2 h at 4 °C and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:500 4E-BP1 rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), 1:1000 phospho-ERK/MAPK (p44/p42), phospho-JNK/SAPK1 (p54/p46), phospho-p38/SAPK2, ERK/MAPK, JNK/SAPK1, or p38/SAPK2 antibodies (New England Biolabs). Immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescent protocol (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences) using 1:5000 horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody. The blots were exposed to film (Hyper-film; Amersham Biosciences) for 1–10 min. The signals were quantified using QuantityOne.Cloning of 4e-bp1 Promoter—A sequence of 1020 bp upstream of the ATG of 4e-bp1 gene was cloned in pCDRIVE vector (Qiagen) by PCR using the 5′-CGGGGGTACCCCGCCTCAAACCCCTGGGCTC-3′ sense primer, the 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGGTCTCCTGTGCGCTGCAC-3′ antisense primer, and the BAC clone RPCI-11–701H6 (CHORI-BACPAC Resources) as matrix. This sequence was fused to the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) using XhoI and KpnI restriction sites. Entire sequence was verified by sequencing the insert with pGL1 and pGL2 primers (Promega).Transfection and Reporter Assays—HeLa cells were plated 24 h before transfection in 24-well plates so that they are 60–70% confluent the day of transfection. Transfection was realized with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pIRES-EGFP was always cotransfected to estimate the level of transfection (fluorescence measure from lysates with the Victor2) and normalize the luciferase activity. This control level varied from 0.73 to 1.22 times. Luciferase reporter reagent (Promega) was used to measure the luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions in a LB96V luminometer (Berthold Technologies).Histamine and HDC Assays—Histamine concentrations in cell lysates were routinely determined by an automated continuous flow fluorometric technique (lower limit of sensitivity, 0.5 ng/ml), as previously described (49Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). Its specificity has been confirmed by radioimmunoassay (Immunotech, Marseille, France). HDC activity was measured by a radiochromatographic technique, as described before (49Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm ice-cold phosphate buffer and gently sonicated. Aliquots of the HDC-containing suspensions were then incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer at a final concentration of 10 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and 0.1 μm l-[3H]histidine (specific activity, 50 Ci/mmol). The incubations were stopped by the addition of perchloric acid (final concentration, 0.4 n) containing 0.3 m unlabeled histidine to minimize possible nonspecific decarboxylation of the remaining l-[3H]histidine. To assess the specificity of the assay, each reaction was performed with or without 10–5m α-fluoromethylhistidine, the specific inhibitor of HDC. After centrifugation, the synthesized [3H]histamine was separated from the [3H]histidine by ion exchange chromatography on Amberlite CG-50 columns.RESULTS4E-BP1 Expression Decreases in Response to PMA—Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 occurs in response to mitogens or growth factors by activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and/or MAPK signal transduction pathways and is rapamycin-sensitive (10Liu G. Zhang Y. Bode A.M. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8810-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Herbert T.P. Tee A.R. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

To assess to what extend PMA modifies 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and/or expression, we analyzed by Western blot the expression and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in UT7D1 cells treated with or without PMA for 24 h. It should be mentioned that in all experiments UT7D1 cells were placed in fresh culture medium and GM-CSF-starved for 120 min before the addition of the inhibitors. After 30 min, we added fresh GM-CSF alone or GM-CSF and PMA. 4E-BP1 migrates in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as four bands (α, β, γ, and δ; Fig. 1A). The α band is the less phosphorylated form, and the δ band is the highly phosphorylated isoform. According to our personal observations and in line with the literature, the β band represents the 4E-BP1 isoform phosphorylated on Thr37 and Thr46; the γ isoform is phosphorylated on Thr37, Thr46, and Thr70; and the δ isoform is phosphorylated on these three threonines and on Ser65 (11Herbert T.P.

Polakiewicz R.D. Wyslouch-Cieszynska A. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2852-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). When the cells were cultivated with GM-CSF, the four phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 were present. In contrast, when the cells were treated with PMA, only the α, β, and γ forms of 4E-BP1 were barely detected. These results not only reflect a change in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 but also a decrease in 4E-BP1 protein amount (Fig. 1A). In the presence of rapamycin, an inhibitor of FRAP/mTOR, or LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, we observed an accumulation of the α less phosphorylated form of 4E-BP1 in the absence or in the presence of PMA (Fig. 1A). These results are in line with the data from literature that show that the Thr37, Thr46, and Thr70 are phosphorylated by the FRAP/mTOR. p38 and ERK can phosphorylate several sites of 4E-BP1, notably the Ser65 (10Liu G. Zhang Y. Bode A.M. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8810-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Herbert T.P. Tee A.R. Proud C.G. J. Biol.

This regulation did not occur in our system because treatment of the cells with SB203580 or U0126 did not have any effect on the phosphorylation pattern of 4EBP1. 2M. Rolli-Derkinderen, F. Machavoine, and M. Dy, unpublished results. Nevertheless we could not rule out changes that could have occurred at shorter times of treatment. Northern blot analysis showed that neither rapamycin nor LY294002 affected the transcript level of 4E-BP1, whereas the PMA application resulted in a loss of 4E-BP1 transcript (Fig. 1B). We also looked at the effect of PMA on 4E-BP1 in three different cell lines: 11OC1, HEL, and K562. Twenty-four hours of PMA treatment led to an accumulation of the less phosphorylated isoforms of 4E-BP1 in 11OC1 and K562 cells, whereas in the HEL cell line only the most highly phosphorylated form of 4E-BP1 was detectable (Fig. 1C). In all three cell lines PMA decreased 4E-BP1 expression (Fig. 1C).4e-bp1 Transcript Level Decreases, Whereas the Expression of 4e-bp2 Is Not Sensitive to PMA—Time course analysis showed that 4E-BP1 expression transiently decreased after 4h of GM-CSF (47 ± 17%; Fig. 2, A and C) and that the δ phosphorylated form of 4E-BP1 disappeared after 4 h of GM-CSF treatment. The α less phosphorylated form was mainly detected after 24 h of GM-CSF treatment (Fig. 2A). The expression of 4E-BP1 protein decreased after 4 h of PMA and was undetectable after 24 h (32.5 ± 13% and 4 ± 1%; Fig. 2, A and C). Northern blot analysis showed that the transcript level was strictly correlated with the protein expression level, that PMA negatively regulated 4E-BP1 expression at the transcript level (Fig. 2, B and C), and that this effect lasted 48 h (Fig. 2, D and E). Because 4E-BP2 expression was also known to vary during cell differentiation, we analyzed its expression by Northern blot. The transcript of 4e-bp2 was only present at 24 h of culture in the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. 2, D and E). Taken together, these results showed that the two repressors of translation have different ways of regulating.Fig. 2Kinetics of 4E-BP1 and 4e-bp2 expression. GM-CSF-starved (2 h) UT7D1 cells were cultivated in the presence or absence of PMA for different times as indicated. Samples of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using either anti-4E-BP1 or anti-actin antibodies (loading control) as indicated (A). The means"

Although Kv channels are activated by changes in cell membrane potential, tyrosine phosphorylation of channel subunits can modulate the extent of channel activation by depolarization. We have previously shown that dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 by the nonreceptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPε (cyt-PTPε) down-regulates channel activity and counters its phosphorylation and up-regulation by Src or Fyn. In the present study, we identify tyrosine 124 within the T1 cytosolic domain of Kv2.1 as a target site for the activities of Src and cyt-PTPε. Tyr124 is phosphorylated by Src in vitro; in whole cells, Y124F Kv2.1 is significantly less phosphorylated by Src and loses most of its ability to bind the D245A substrate-trapping mutant of cyt-PTPε. Phosphorylation of Tyr124 is critical for Src-mediated up-regulation of Kv2.1 channel activity, since Y124F Kv2.1-mediated K+ currents are only marginally up-regulated by Src, in contrast with a 3-fold up-regulation of wild-type Kv2.1 channels by the kinase. Other properties of Kv2.1, such as expression levels, subcellular localization, and voltage dependence of channel activation, are unchanged in Y124F Kv2.1, indicating that the effects of the Y124F mutation are specific. Together, these results indicate that Tyr124 is a significant site at which the mutually antagonistic activities of Src and cyt-PTPε affect Kv2.1 phosphorylation and activity.

Kv channels are composed of four α-subunits that span the cell membrane and that can be found in some cases in association with regulatory cytosolic औ-subunits (1Yi B.A. Minor Jr., D.L. Lin Y.F.

All Kv channel α-subunits share a common core structure of six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and a P-loop forming the pore region of the channel (7Yellen G. Nature. 2002; 419: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). α-Subunits contain several major structural domains. Among these is a voltage-sensing domain, composed of segments S1–S4 that folds in α-helical structure and surrounds the pore. This domain is responsible for energy transduction and for controlling gating behavior. A second major domain of α-subunits is the pore domain (segments S5-P-S6), whose structure is likely to be similar to the crystal structure of the bacterial KcsA K+ channel, with the inner helix S6 lining much of the pore (7Yellen G. Nature. 2002; 419: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Another major domain of α-subunits is the T1 region, which is part of the cytosolic N-terminal domain. In Shaker-related Kv channels, this domain comprises ∼120 amino acids and is located between the N-terminal inactivation ball and S1 (8Cushman S.J. Nanao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The T1 domain is responsible for molecular segregation of Kv channels, in which tetramerization of α-subunits belonging to the same subfamily is preferred (8Cushman S.J. Nanao M.H. Jahng A.W. DeRubeis D. Choe S. Pfaffinger P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, this domain associates with the auxiliary औ-subunits ofShaker-related Kv channels and is the site for regulation of channel activity by various cytosolic factors (8Cushman S.J.

Significant evidence has shown that Kv channels are substrates of protein kinase activities and that phosphorylation can affect channel characteristics (12Levitan I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 3-22.13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Siegelbaum S.A. Curr.

Physiol. 2001; 281: H1835-H1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have established a prominent role for Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in regulation of Kv channels. Among these, Src family kinases have been shown to phosphorylate Kv1.3 and to down-regulate its activity in heterologous expression systems as well as in Jurkat T cells and in rat olfactory bulb neurons (16Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A Ren R. Levitan I.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17Holmes T.C. Berman K. Swartz J.E. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J.

A. 1997; 94: 7661-7666Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Similar effects were noted with Kv1.5 in transfected HEK 293 cells (22Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Src- and Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of Kv1.5 and of Kv2.1 enhanced K+ channel activity in mouse Schwann cells and in rat cortical astrocytes (23MacFarlane S.N. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5245-5253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Peretz A. Sobko A. Attali B. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Sobko A. Peretz A. Attali B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4723-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in rat retinal pigment epithelial cells, Src family tyrosine kinases can activate or inhibit Kv1.3 channel activity in a manner dependent on protein kinase C activity (26Strauss O. Rosenthal R. Dey D. Beninde J. Wollmann G. Thieme H Wiederbolt M. Invest. Ophtalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1645-1654PubMed Google Scholar). Last, an indirect role for the Kv1.5 α-subunits in phosphorylation of other subunits was recently shown. The Src homology 3 domains of Src family kinases can bind Kv1.5, thereby granting these PTKs access to Kv channel α-subunits that associate with Kv1.5 but that have no Src homology 3 binding sites of their own (27Nitabach M.N. Llamas D.A. Araneda R.C. Intile J.L. Thompson I.J. Zhou Y.I. Holmes T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are generic antagonists of PTKs and play crucial roles in regulating physiological processes by affecting protein phosphorylation (28Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar, 29Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 30Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). However, in contrast with the wealth of information concerning the effects of PTKs on Kv channels, very little is known about how PTPs participate in these processes. The receptor-type PTPα (31Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) physically associates with Kv1.2 and up-regulates channel activity following its inhibition by the G protein-coupled M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor inXenopus oocytes and mammalian cells (33Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Cachero T.G. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The same PTP was later shown also to counter serotonergic inhibition of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 in a similar experimental system (34Imbrici P. Tucker S.J. D'Adamo M.C. Pessia M. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 441: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the nonreceptor form of PTP epsilon (cyt-PTPε) (35Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) dephosphorylates and down-regulates Kv1.5 and Kv2.1 following their phosphorylation by Src or by Fyn in transfected cells and in Xenopus oocytes (36Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, both Kv1.5 and Kv2.1 were hyperphosphorylated in primary Schwann cells and in sciatic nerve tissue from mice genetically lacking PTPε. These effects were correlated with increased Kv channel currents in PTPε-deficient Schwann cells, as well as with transient but severe hypomyelination of sciatic nerve axons in young PTPε-deficient mice (36Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Strong support for Kv2.1 being a substrate of cyt-PTPε was obtained in experiments, which established that a substrate-trapping mutant of cyt-PTPε bound and co-precipitated with Kv2.1 (36Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Interactions between this mutant and Kv2.1 were severely reduced by sodium pervanadate, indicating that they were mediated by the catalytic site of cyt-PTPε binding to at least one phosphotyrosine residue in Kv2.1. The identity of that residue, however, remained unknown. In the present study, we identify Tyr124, a tyrosine residue located in the T1 cytosolic domain of Kv2.1, as an important site for phosphorylation by Src. We also identify the same residue as a docking site for the substrate-trapping mutant of cyt-PTPε, implying that it is dephosphorylated by this phosphatase. Phosphorylation of Tyr124 has significant effects on Src-mediated regulation of Kv2.1 channel activity, since mutating this residue to a nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine abolishes most of the ability of Src to up-regulate channel activity without affecting other properties of the channel. These results establish Tyr124 as an important site for mutually antagonistic regulation of Kv2.1 by Src and by cyt-PTPε and highlight the role of post-translational modifications in the T1 domain in affecting Kv2.1 activity. The following cDNAs were used in this study, all cloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen): mouse cyt-PTPε (35Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), D245A cyt-PTPε (36Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), rat Kv2.1 (gift of Drs. J. Barhanin and M. Lazdunski), and chicken wild-type and Y527F Src (gift of Dr. S. Courtneidge). Both PTPε cDNAs contained a FLAG tag at their C terminus. The Y124F mutation was introduced into the rat Kv2.1 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis; the presence of the desired mutation and absence of other mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies used in this study included polyclonal anti-PTPε (38Elson A. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26116-26122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), polyclonal anti-Kv2.1 (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem), monoclonal anti-v-Src (Calbiochem), anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (Sigma), and anti-phosphotyrosine (clone PY20; Transduction Laboratories). HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 107 (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 ॖg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using the calcium-phosphate method (39Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, 293 cells were plated on glass cover slips previously coated with polylysine (Sigma), transfected with the relevant expression vectors, and stained with antibodies as described previously (40Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 and/or polyclonal anti-Kv2.1, each diluted 1:250; secondary antibodies included CY3- or fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:300 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Stained cells were examined with the aid of a Bio-Rad model MRC 1024 confocal system and an argon/krypton mixed gas laser, mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Cells were lysed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Nonidet P-40), supplemented with 0.5 mm sodium pervanadate and protease inhibitors (1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 40 ॖmbestatin, 15 ॖm E-64, 20 ॖm leupeptin, 15 ॖm pepstatin; Sigma). SDS gel electrophoresis, blotting, and antibody hybridization were as described (40Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Complete protein transfer following blotting was verified routinely by noting transfer of prestained molecular size marker proteins of the proper size range; the absence of lane-to-lane variations in blotting was verified by staining the blotted membranes with Ponceau S (Sigma). In control experiments, where known, graded amounts of protein were subject to SDS-PAGE and blotting, the intensities of signals obtained were proportional in a linear fashion to the amounts of antigen loaded on the gel. For substrate-trapping immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in Buffer A supplemented with 5 mm iodoacetic acid and protease inhibitors. One mg of cellular proteins was reacted with anti-FLAG M2 beads for 6–8 h, followed by two washes with buffer A and one wash with radioimmune precipitation buffer. GST-Y124 was prepared by annealing the two complementary oligomers, Y124 sense (GATCCGGCATCGATGAGATCTACCTGGAGTCCTGCG) and Y124 antisense (AATTCGCAGGACTCCAGGTAGATCTCATCGATGCCG). The resulting double-stranded DNA fragment, which encoded a decapeptide centered around Tyr124 of Kv2.1 (119GIDEIYLESC; accession number X16476) and which contained BamHI andEcoRI overhangs, was cloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX2TK (Amersham Biosciences). The mutated GST-Y124F construct, in which Tyr124 was replaced by an unphosphorylatable phenylalanine, was prepared in a similar manner using oligonucleotides Y124F sense (GATCCGGCATCGATGAGATCTTCCTGGAGTCCTGCG) and Y124F antisense (AATTCGCAGGACTCCAGGAAGATCTCATCGATGCCG). The structure of the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were grown in Escherichia coli DH5α bacteria, and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and subsequent elution with 20 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Wild-type chicken Src was expressed in 293 cells and was immunoprecipitated using anti-v-Src antibodies (Calbiochem). GST fusion phosphorylation reactions were conducted in 25 ॖl of kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2), to which equal amounts of precipitated Src, 1 ॖl (equal to 5 ॖCi) of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences), and equal amounts (∼2 ॖg/5 ॖl) of eluted GST fusion proteins were added. Tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min; samples were then separated on 127 SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto membranes. Radioactivity present in GST fusion proteins was quantified with a phosphor imager (BAS 2500; Fuji, Japan). Verification of the amounts of GST fusion proteins present in the reactions was performed by Ponceau S staining of membranes and by probing membranes with anti-GST antibodies. For verification of amounts of Src present, blots were probed with anti-Src antibodies. Xenopus laevis frogs were purchased from Xenopus 1 (Dexter, MI). The procedures followed for surgery and maintenance of frogs were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of Tel Aviv University. Frogs were anesthetized with 0.27 tricaine (Sigma). Pieces of the ovary were surgically removed and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase (type IA; Sigma) in Ca2+-free ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES titrated to pH 7.5 with NaOH) for 1 h to remove follicular cells. Stage V and VI oocytes were used for DNA nuclear injection and were maintained at 18 °C in ND96 (containing 1.8 mm CaCl2), supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate and 50 ॖg/ml gentamycin. Nuclear injections utilized 0.5 ng/10 nl plasmid DNA encoding WT Kv2.1 or Y124F Kv2.1 per oocyte; when indicated, similar amounts of DNA for constitutively active Y527F Src were also injected. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were performed as previously described (41Abitbol I. Peretz A. Lerche C. Busch A.E. Attali B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4137-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) 2–4 days following nuclear DNA microinjection. Oocytes were bathed in a modified ND96 solution (containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) under constant perfusion using a peristaltic pump (Gilson) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. CaCl2 was reduced to 0.1 mm to virtually eliminate the contribution of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− currents. Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature (20–22 °C) using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Glass microelectrodes (A-M Systems, Inc.) were filled with 3 m KCl and had tip resistances of 0.5–1.5 megaohms. Stimulation of the preparation and data acquisition and analyses were performed using the pCLAMP 6.02 software (Axon Instruments) and a 586 personal computer interfaced with a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon Instruments). Current signals were filtered at 0.5 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz. Unless specified, the holding potential was −80 mV. Leak subtraction was performed off-line, using the Clampfit program of the pCLAMP 6.02 software. Data analysis was performed using the Clampfit program (pCLAMP 8.1; Axon Instruments) and Axograph 4.0 (Axon Instruments). All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences between paired groups were assessed by Student's t test. Previous studies have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv2.1 by Src and Fyn up-regulates channel activity, whereas dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 by cyt-PTPε counters this effect (36Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This result suggests that both kinases, on the one hand, and cyt-PTPε, on the other hand, affect phosphorylation of the same set of tyrosine residues in opposite manners. The Kv2.1 α-subunit has 19 tyrosine residues, of which five are located in extracellular or in membrane-spanning segments and are presumably inaccessible to cytosolic or membrane-associated enzymes. Of the remaining 14 tyrosines, six are located in the N-terminal cytosolic domain, seven are within the C-terminal domain, and one is located in the short cytosolic loop between the S4 and S5 membrane-spanning domains. Examination of the tyrosine residues in Kv2.1 revealed that only one of these, Tyr124 of the N-terminal cytosolic T1 domain, is embedded in a sequence that is somewhat similar to the consensus sequence for Src phosphorylation (121DEIYLESversus consensus of EEIYG/EEF) (42Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether Src could phosphorylate Tyr124 of Kv2.1 in vitro, we examined the ability of Src to phosphorylate a peptide derived from the sequence of Kv2.1, 119GIDEIYLESC, which was centered around Tyr124 and in which this residue was the only tyrosine. A similar peptide in which Tyr124 was replaced with a nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine residue (119GIDEIFLESC) served as a negative control. Both peptides were produced as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in bacteria and were purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography and by subsequent elution as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts of both fusion proteins were mixed with Src and with [γ-32P]ATP, and phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for 30 min. Some background phosphorylation of the GST-Y124F fusion protein was evident in these studies (Fig.1). Since the Kv2.1-derived sequence of the GST-Y124F fusion protein lacks tyrosine residues, this finding indicated that some of the 14 tyrosine residues of GST were phosphorylated, in agreement with previous results (43Toledano-Katchalski H. Elson A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5024-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In agreement, similar weak phosphorylation levels were detected in experiments using purified GST protein to which no peptide had been added (not shown). In contrast, phosphorylation of the GST-Y124 fusion protein, in which Tyr124 was present, was considerably higher than that of GST-Y124F (Fig. 1). This indicates that Tyr124 can be phosphorylated by Src in vitro and is consistent with results presented below being mediated by phosphorylation at this residue. In order to examine the potential role of Tyr124 in regulation of Kv2.1 in the context of the entire Kv2.1 protein, we mutated this residue to phenylalanine. Upon expression in cells, WT and Y124F Kv2.1 localized to the cell membrane in similar manners, as indicated by confocal microscopy analyses of cells expressing either protein (Fig.2). Although cyt-PTPε is predominantly cytosolic, substantial amounts of cyt-PTPε are targeted to the cell membrane, and some cyt-PTPε is found within the cell nucleus (35Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 40Gil-Henn H. Volohonsky G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Gandre S. Elson A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,44Kraut J. Volohonski G. Toledano-Katchalski H. Elson A. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 281: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, both WT and Y124F Kv2.1 co-localized with membrane-associated cyt-PTPε, indicating that both had similar opportunities to interact with the phosphatase. In addition, both WT and Y124F Kv2.1 channels were expressed at similar levels following transfection into cells (Fig. 3). We conclude that the Y124F mutation did not significantly affect the subcellular localization or expression levels of Kv2.1.Figure 3Reduced phosphorylation of Y124F Kv2.1 by Src. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with activated (Y527F) Src, together with WT or mutant (Y124F) Kv2.1. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, after which precipitates were analyzed on 77 SDS-PAGE gels. Shown is precipitated, tyrosine-phosphorylated Kv2.1 (top panel); the middle and bottom panels document expression of Kv2.1 and of Src in cell lysates, respectively.

Data (average and S.E.) indicate that Y124F Kv2.1 phosphorylation is 30.7 ± 12.17 of that of WT Kv2.1 (n = 3, p = 0.00293 by Welch'st test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of WT Kv2.1 with constitutively active (Y527F) Src resulted in robust phosphorylation of the channel, in agreement with previous studies (36Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, Src-mediated phosphorylation of Y124F Kv2.1 was reduced by ∼707 under similar conditions (Fig. 3). Interestingly, co-expression of cyt-PTPε in the same system reduced phosphorylation of both WT and Y124F Kv2.1 by Src (not shown). These results confirm that cyt-PTPε can counter Src-mediated phosphorylation of Kv2.1 at Tyr124 and most likely at other sites as well. We have recently shown that PTPε can dephosphorylate and activate Src (45Gil-Henn H. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 21, 10.1074/jbc.M210273200)PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of cyt-PTPε on Kv2.1 in the above studies was not due to cyt-PTPε affecting Src activity, since this study utilized Y527F Src, which lacks the tyrosine that can be dephosphorylated by PTPε. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of Src by cyt-PTPε activates Src (45Gil-Henn H. Elson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; (February 21, 10.1074/jbc.M210273200)PubMed Google Scholar) and would have led to increased, rather than decreased, phosphorylation of Kv2.1. These results, together with the in vitro Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr124 shown above, indicate that Tyr124 is a significant site of phosphorylation by Src in Kv2.1. In a separate series of experiments, binding of the substrate-trapping mutant D245A cyt-PTPε to Y124F Kv2.1 was examined. Substrate-trapping mutants of this type are virtually inactive but in many cases can recognize and bind their phosphorylated substrates stably enough to allow co-precipitation of the trapping mutant with its associated substrate (37Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Indeed, D245A cyt-PTPε bound and precipitated WT Kv2.1 from transfected cells (Fig.4). However, ∼607 less Y124F Kv2.1 was co-precipitated with D245A cyt-PTPε despite expression of similar levels of WT and Y124F Kv2.1 channels in these cells (Fig. 4). Of note, precipitation of either Kv channel with D245A cyt-PTPε was significantly reduced when these experiments were performed in the presence of sodium pervanadate (not shown). Pervanadate oxidizes the critical cysteine residue of the catalytic center of PTPs (46Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), thereby disrupting the binding of D-to-A type PTP mutants to their putative substrates (37Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). This last result indicated that the binding observed was due to specific association of the catalytic site of cyt-PTPε with phosphorylated tyrosines of Kv2.1. Importantly, immunoprecipitation experiments using D245A cyt-PTPε were performed without co-expression of exogenous Src, thereby avoiding possible bias in the results due to prior phosphorylation of specific tyrosines by the exogenous kinase. In all, these results indicate that Tyr124 is a significant site to which the catalytic center of cyt-PTPε binds and, by extension, dephosphorylates. To investigate the impact of the Y124F mutation on Kv2.1 channel activity, we expressed WT and Y124F Kv2.1 channels in Xenopus oocytes in the presence or absence of constitutively active (Y527F) Src. Fig.5 shows that expression of WT Kv2.1 channels generated delayed rectifier outward K+ currents that activated above −20 mV. Active Src up-regulated WT Kv2.1 current amplitude by more than 3-fold, with no significant changes in activation kinetics and voltage dependence of activation. Mutant Y124F Kv2.1 channels produced K+ currents that were very similar to those generated by WT Kv2.1 with no significant differences either in amplitude or in kinetics and voltage dependence of activation (Fig.5). In contrast to WT Kv2.1 channels, active Src increased Y124F Kv2.1 current amplitude by only 357 (Fig. 5). The Y124F Kv2.1 channels are therefore functional and are activated by depolarization in the absence of Src in a manner similar to the nonmutant Tyr124 Kv2.1 channels. However, mutant Y124F Kv2.1 channels are severely and specifically impaired in their ability to undergo up-regulation by Src-mediated phosphorylation, underscoring the role of Tyr124 in regulating this process. Results presented here demonstrate the importance of Tyr124 of Kv2.1 as a site that is phosphorylated by Srcin vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation at Tyr124 accounts for approximately two-thirds of Src phosphorylation of Kv2.1, for a similar fraction of binding to D245A cyt-PTPε, and for ∼807 of the ability of Src to enhance Kv2.1 activation by membrane depolarization. Whereas not all of the effects of Src are mediated by Tyr124, the role of this residue is nonetheless very significant. Of note, Kv channels are activated by membrane depolarization, with phosphorylation acting as a modulator of this effect. It is therefore not surprising that mutant Y124F and the wild-type Tyr124 Kv2.1 channels were activated by depolarization to the same extent in the absence of Src and that the differential effect of Src phosphorylation was limited to their current amplitude without affecting other electrical parameters. In fact, this behavior, together with the conservative nature of the Y124F mutation and the normal expression levels and correct subcellular localization of Y124F Kv2.1 channels, underscores the specific but otherwise limited nature of the change introduced into Kv2.1 by the Y124F mutation. The same results establish Tyr124 as a significant target site for the mutually opposing effects of Src and cyt-PTPε on Kv2.1. Identification of particular tyrosine residues as sites for PTP activity reflects substrate specificity of the PTP in question but also specificities of PTKs that phosphorylate these residues beforehand. Strong preference on the part of a PTK toward phosphorylating a particular tyrosine may limit the range of phosphotyrosines available to the PTP and bias the result obtained. For this reason, binding studies of D245A cyt-PTPε were performed without co-expression of exogenous Src, relying entirely on phosphorylation of Kv2.1 by endogenous PTKs present in HEK 293 cells. These cells express moderate levels of endogenous Src as well as other tyrosine kinases. The fact that under these circumstances the Y124F mutation was found to profoundly affect cyt-PTPε binding indicates the importance of this site also in the absence of strong Src activity. Despite its significant effect on current amplitude, results presented here indicate that Src phosphorylation does not affect voltage-dependence and kinetics of activation of either WT or Y124F Kv2.1. It is therefore possible that Src family tyrosine kinases control the number of available active channels or, alternatively, that tyrosine phosphorylation increases the channel open probability (Po), as previously described forN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (47Yu X.-M. Askalan R. Keil II G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The mechanism behind this effect is not known at present, but it is likely mediated by conformational changes induced in the cytosolic T1 domain by phosphorylation of Tyr124 and that affect properties of the membrane-spanning regions of Kv2.1. Of note, Tyr124 is conserved in the only other known Kv2 family member, Kv2.2, as well as in Kv11.1. This residue is not conserved in most other families of Kv channel α-subunits. For example, all known Kv1 family members contain an alanine residue at the analogous position; Kv3 proteins contain aspartic acid, whereas Kv4 proteins contain leucine or isoleucine residues. Nevertheless, cyt-PTPε has been shown to counter activation of Kv1.5 by Src and by Fyn in HEK 293 cells and in Xenopus oocytes despite the absence of a tyrosine at the analogous position (36Peretz A. Gil-Henn H. Sobko A. Shinder V. Attali B. Elson A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4036-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This suggests that a similar mechanism of mutually antagonistic regulation by cyt-PTPε and a Src family PTK may operate via another tyrosine residue in other Kv channels. Modulation of Kv2.1 channels by PTKs and PTPs may be functionally relevant for the control of cell excitability in different types of neurons. In both pyramidal and inhibitory interneurons of the cortex and hippocampus, Kv2.1 channels are clustered primarily on somata and proximal dendrites but not on axons (48Du J. Tao-Cheng J.H. Zerfas P. McBain C.J. Neuroscience. 1998; 84: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that Kv2.1-containing channels play a role in regulating pyramidal neuron somato-dendritic excitability primarily during episodes of high frequency synaptic transmission (49Du J. Haak L.L. Phillips-Tansey E. Russell J.T. McBain C.J. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this context, the fine tuning of Kv2.1 current strength by PTKs and PTPs may play a role in synaptic efficacy during high frequency synaptic transmission. Similarly, Kv2.1-containing channels, which are found to regulate the tonic firing of sympathetic neurons (50Malin S.A. Nerbonne J.M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10094-10105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the discharge pattern of globus pallidus neurons (51Baranauskas G. Tkatch T. Surmeier D.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6394-6404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may be potentially subject to such modulation by PTKs and PTPs. In all, the fine tuning of Kv2.1 channel activity through the tyrosine phosphorylation of its amino-terminal residue Tyr124 may play a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability in various regions of the brain.

However, the effects of GRP78/BiP on activation of the coagulation cascade leading to thrombin generation are not known. In this study, we examined whether GRP78/BiP overexpression mediates cell surface thrombin generation in a human bladder cancer cell line T24/83 having prothrombotic characteristics. We report here that cells overexpressing GRP78/BiP exhibited significant decreases in cell surface-mediated thrombin generation, prothrombin consumption and the formation of thrombin-inhibitor complexes, compared with wild-type or vector-transfected cells. This effect was attributed to the ability of GRP78/BiP to inhibit cell surface tissue factor (TF) procoagulant activity (PCA) because conversion of factor X to Xa and factor VII to VIIa were significantly lower on the surface of GRP78/BiP-overexpressing cells. The additional findings that (i) cell surface factor Xa generation was inhibited in the absence of factor VIIa and (ii) TF PCA was inhibited by a neutralizing antibody to human TF suggests that thrombin generation is mediated exclusively by TF. GRP78/BiP overexpression did not decrease cell surface levels of TF, suggesting that the inhibition in TF PCA does not result from retention of TF in the ER by GRP78/BiP. The additional observations that both adenovirus-mediated and stable GRP78/BiP overexpression attenuated TF PCA stimulated by ionomycin or hydrogen peroxide suggest that GRP78/BiP indirectly alters TF PCA through a mechanism involving cellular Ca2+ and/or oxidative stress. Similar results were also observed in human aortic smooth muscle cells transfected with the GRP78/BiP adenovirus. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that overexpression of GRP78/BiP decreases thrombin generation by inhibiting cell surface TF PCA, thereby suppressing the prothrombotic potential of cells.

The inability of nascent polypeptide chains to fold into their native conformation generally leads to retention in the ER and degradation (1Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). To assist in the correct folding of newly synthesized proteins and to prevent aggregation of folding intermediates, the ER contains a wide range of molecular chaperones such as the glucose-regulated proteins, calnexin, calreticulin, protein-disulfide isomerase, and Erp72 (2Gething M.-J.

These chaperones are postulated to act as a quality control system by ensuring that only correctly folded proteins are processed prior to entering the Golgi apparatus for further processing and secretion (2Gething M.-J.

In addition to their function as molecular chaperones, recent studies have demonstrated that some of these ER proteins protect cells against oxidative stress (5Liu H. Bowes R.C. van de Water B.

GRP78/BiP transiently associates with correctly folded proteins but forms more stable complexes with misfolded or incompletely assembled proteins (1Helenius A. Mol. Biol.

The observation that GRP78/BiP is induced by conditions of stress that result in the accumulation of misfolded or underglycosylated proteins in the ER (8Lee A.S. Curr. Opin.

Recent studies have demonstrated that alterations in GRP78/BiP protein levels mediate selective changes in the abundance of membrane or secretory proteins that transit the ER. In mammalian cells, reduced levels of GRP78/BiP increase the secretion of factor VIII and a mutant form of tissue plasminogen activator lacking glycosylation sites (18Dorner A.J. Krane M.G. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4063-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, elevated levels of GRP78/BiP decrease the secretion of von Willebrand factor (vWf) and factor VIII (18Dorner A.J. Krane M.G. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell.

Although these studies provide convincing evidence that alterations in GRP78/BiP levels lead to selective changes in the processing and secretion of certain coagulation factors, the effect of GRP78/BiP on the prothrombotic potential of cells was not investigated. The major physiological initiator of the extrinsic coagulation cascade is tissue factor (TF), a 47-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein (21Nemerson Y.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Given that TF transits the ER prior to its localization in the plasma membrane, we have postulated that GRP78/BiP overexpression could potentially alter the prothrombotic potential of cells. In this study, GRP78/BiP was stably overexpressed in a human bladder cancer cell line T24/83 having prothrombotic characteristics. Our findings indicate that overexpression of GRP78/BiP significantly decreases TF-mediated cell surface thrombin generation. The finding that GRP78/BiP overexpression fails to decrease cell surface levels of TF suggests that the inhibition of TF PCA by GRP78/BiP does not result from the retention of TF in the ER. The ability of GRP78/BiP overexpression to attenuate TF PCA induced by ionomycin, hydrogen peroxide, or adenovirus supports a mechanism involving cellular Ca2+ and/or oxidant stress. These findings show that GRP78/BiP overexpression decreases TF PCA and provides novel evidence that alterations in the levels of GRP78/BiP can have profound effects on the prothrombotic potential of cells. The human transitional bladder carcinoma cell line T24/83 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in M199 medium containing 107 fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 ॖg/ml penicillin, and 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 57 CO2. Although previous studies classified T24/83 cells as an immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, designated ECV304 (55Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), recent genetic analysis and functional responses have demonstrated that ECV304 cells are indeed T24/83 (56Brown J. Reading S.J.

Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were purchased from Cascade Biologicals (Portland, OR) and cultured in medium 231 containing 207 smooth muscle growth supplement and PSA solution (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 ॖg/ml amphotericin) (Cascade Biologicals). Construction of the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1(+)- GRP78/BiP, encoding human GRP78/BiP and the establishment of stable T24/83 cell lines overexpressing human GRP78/BiP have been described previously (57Werstuck G.H.

The anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody (SPA-827), which recognizes both GRP78/BiP and GRP94, was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies(Victoria, BC). Total protein lysates from T24/83 cells were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 27 SDS, 107 glycerol, 17 औ-mercaptoethanol, 0.017 bromphenol blue), separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), as described previously (58Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). After incubation with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, ON), the membranes were developed using the Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Polyclonal antibodies to GRP78/BiP (sc-1050) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunofluorescence for GRP78/BiP was performed as described previously (58Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C.Y. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 59Outinen P.A. Sood S.K.

For detection of cell surface levels of TF, cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS for 2 min, blocked with 37 BSA in 1× PBS for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with an anti-human TF monoclonal antibody (5 ॖg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with 1× PBS containing 0.57 BSA, cells were incubated with the appropriate Alexa-labeled secondary antibody (BioLynx, Brockville, ON) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed again, and fixed with 17 paraformaldehyde. Images were subsequently captured and analyzed using Northern Exposure image analysis/archival software (Mississauga, ON). Cell surface TF was immunoprecipitated essentially as described previously (42Penn M.S. Patel C.V. Cui M.-Z. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-human TF polyclonal antibodies at 0.5 ॖg/ml in FBS-free M199 medium were added to cell monolayers at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing twice with ice-cold 1× PBS, cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 17 Nonidet P-40, 0.57 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QC), and cell surface TF protein was immunoprecipitated from total cell protein by overnight incubation with protein A-Sepharose-linked beads (Pierce). After washing with RIPA buffer, the beads were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were separated on 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with anti-human TF polyclonal antibodies, as described above. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (60Xiao G. Chung T.-F. Fine R.E. Johnson R.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 652-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 61Xiao G. Chung T.-F. Pyun H.Y. Fine R.E. Johnson R.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers were washed once with ice-cold FBS-free M199 medium and three times with ice-cold 1× PBS to remove residual FBS and other proteins from the culture medium. PBS containing 1 mg/ml EZ Link NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) was added to the monolayers, and the biotinylation reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 min with gentle shaking. Following three washes with ice-cold 1× PBS, cells were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To detect biotinylated cell surface proteins, immunoblot analysis was performed using HRP-conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma). Thrombin generation studies were conducted with either control pooled plasma from healthy adults or factor VII-deficient plasma (Affinity Biologicals). Factor VII levels in the deficient plasmas were ≤17, according to the manufacturer. Prior to use in the thrombin generation assay, plasmas were defibrinated using arvin and total amidolytic activity of thrombin generated on cell surfaces was measured as previously described (62Chan A.K.C. Berry L. Mitchell L. Baranowski B. O'Brodovich H. Andrew M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L914-L921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,63Ling X. Delorme M. Berry L. Ofosu F. Mitchell L. Paes B. Andrew M. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers in 24-well plates were placed on a Thermolyne dri-bath set at 37 °C. After washing twice with 1 ml of acetate/barbital/saline (ABS) buffer (0.036 m sodium acetate, 0.036 m sodium diethylbarbitarate, 0.145m NaCl, pH 7.4), monolayers were incubated for 3 min with 100 ॖl of ABS buffer and 200 ॖl of defibrinated plasma, in the absence or presence of 107 activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) reagent (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC). At time periods up to 30 min following the addition of 100 ॖl of 40 mmCaCl2 in ABS buffer, 25-ॖl aliquots of the reaction mixture on the surface of the cells were removed and mixed with 475 ॖl of 5 mm EDTA on ice. 25 ॖl of each EDTA sample were then mixed with 775 ॖl of 0.16 mm S-2238 (KabiVitum, Stockholm, Sweden) in buffer and heated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to termination of the amidolytic reaction with 200 ॖl of 507 acetic acid. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured and the concentration of total thrombin determined by comparing results to a standard curve generated with purified thrombin in S-2238. EDTA samples were also used to measure the concentrations of prothrombin, thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes and thrombin-heparin cofactor II complexes. Prothrombin, TAT, and thrombin-heparin cofactor II complexes were assayed using commercially available ELISA kits (Affinity Biologicals). Because thrombin bound to α2 macroglobulin (α2M) retains amidolytic activity against S-2238 (64Hemker H.C. Verstraete M. Vermylen J. Lijinen R. Anrout J. Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Leuven University Press, Leuven1987: 17-36Google Scholar), the contribution of thrombin-α2M to total thrombin activity was measured as previously described (63Ling X. Delorme M. Berry L. Ofosu F. Mitchell L. Paes B. Andrew M. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 37: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amidolytic activity of total thrombin was measured as described above, except that the 25-ॖl reaction mixture taken at each time point was incubated with 3.5 ॖl of 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.25 units of standard heparin and 0.042 units of antithrombin (to inhibit any free thrombin) for 1 min on ice, followed by the addition of 475 ॖl of 5 mm EDTA. α2M-dependent thrombin activity was then subtracted from the total thrombin activity to give the amount of physiologically active free thrombin generated by the cell surface. EDTA samples were used to determine prothrombin consumption during the experiments. Prothrombin concentrations were determined for each time point during the thrombin generation experiments using a commercially available ELISA kit. Control plasma with a known concentration of prothrombin was used as a standard. Factor VIIa generation on the surface of T24/83 cells was performed by a one-step assay, which directly measures the conversion of factor VII to factor VIIa, using the chromogenic substrate S-2288 (65Wildgoose P. Foster D. Schiodt J. Wiberg F.C. Birktoft J.J. Petersen L.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were washed twice in ABS buffer and incubated for time periods up to 30 min in the absence (blank control) or presence of 108 nm recombinant human factor VII (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and 5 mm Ca2+ in ABS buffer. The generation of factor VIIa was assessed by subsampling cell surface supernatant into S-2288, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. After termination with 507 acetic acid, absorbance at 405 nm was determined for each sample. The rates of factor VIIa formation in the various samples were calculated based on a standard curve using known amounts of human factor VIIa (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and TF (Thromborel S, Dade Behring, Newark, DE). Cell surface TF activity, measured as the amount of factor Xa generated, was performed as described previously (66Hansen C.B. van Deurs B. Petersen L.C. Rao L.V.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 67Nishibe T. Parry G. Ishida A. Aziz S. Murray J. Patel Y. Rahman S. Strand K. Saito K. Saito Y. Hammond W.P. Savidge G.F. Mackman N. Wijelath E.S. Blood. 2001; 97: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded onto 24-well tissue culture plates and upon reaching confluence, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with 1× PBS and incubated with FBS-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells in FBS-free medium were untreated or treated with ionomycin (5–10 ॖm for 10 min) or hydrogen peroxide (10 mmfor 1 h). Cells were washed twice with 1× TBS (50 mmTris, 120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 3 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) and incubated with 300 ॖl of 1× TBS containing 0.5 nm human factor VIIa and 15 nm human factor X (Enzyme Research Laboratories). Activation of factor X was initiated by the addition of 5 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. 250-ॖl aliquots were removed and incubated with 25 ॖl of chromogenic substrate S-2765 (0.2 mm) (DiaPharma, West Chester, OH) for 3 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated using 20 ॖl of 507 acetic acid, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a microplate reader. Standards containing the reaction mixture and various amounts of rabbit brain thromboplastin (Thromboplastin C Plus, Dade Behring) were also prepared and incubated with S-2765 as described above. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined and used to generate a standard curve where 100 units of TF activity was defined as the amount of activity in 1 ॖl of rabbit brain thromboplastin. Cells in the 24-well plates were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the amount of total protein was measured using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbances were measured at 750 nm and the amount of total protein calculated by comparing the OD750 with ref"

In the absence of integrin-mediated signals, normal epithelial cells undergo a form of apoptosis termed anoikis. It has been proposed that the activation of initiator caspases is an early event in anoikis, resulting in Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. We have previously demonstrated that the loss of integrin signaling in mammary epithelial cells results in apoptosis and that this is dependent upon translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria. In this paper, we ask whether caspases are required for Bax activation and the associated changes within mitochondria. We show that Bax activation occurs extremely rapidly, within 15 min after loss of integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix. The conformational changes associated with Bax activation are independent of caspases including the initiator caspase-8. We also examined downstream events in the apoptosis program and found that cytochrome c release occurs after a delay of at least 1 h, with subsequent activation of the effector caspase-3. This delay is not due to a requirement for new protein synthesis, since cycloheximide has no effect on the kinetics of Bax activation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 cleavage, or apoptosis. Together, our data indicate that the cellular decision for anoikis in mammary epithelial cells occurs in the absence of caspase activation. Moreover, although the conformational changes in Bax are rapid and synchronous, the subsequent events occur stochastically and with considerable delays.

Moreover, although the conformational changes in Bax are rapid and synchronous, the subsequent events occur stochastically and with considerable delays. Apoptosis is an important cellular mechanism for packaging and removing unwanted, damaged, or infected cells (1Kaufmann S.H. Hengartner M.O. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 526-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Normal cells are kept alive through the action of signal transduction pathways triggered by extracellular ligands but undergo apoptosis if survival factors are withdrawn or if a cell detects inappropriate stress or damage. Apoptosis is mediated by dynamic changes within Bcl-2 family proteins that lead to alterations in mitochondrial homeostasis and activation of the apoptosome. Certain cells may alternatively enter an extrinsic apoptosis program if they are targeted by cells of the immune system, through ligand binding of death domain-containing surface receptors such as Fas (2Wajant H. Science. 2002; 296: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This results in formation of the death-inducing signaling complex and then cleavage and activation of initiator caspases. The subsequent activation of effector caspases can occur independently of mitochondria. Thus, the cellular decisions for these two modes of apoptosis regulation are distinct. On the one hand, kinase-mediated signaling pathways control the post-translational modification and/or subcellular redistribution of Bcl-2 proteins to mitochondria, with the indirect and subsequent activation of caspases, whereas on the other hand multiprotein complexes are assembled at the plasma membrane to orchestrate caspase activation directly. Subtle variations on this theme also exist because cross-talk can occur between the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. Many cell types are naturally adherent in vivo and form integrin-mediated interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; z-VAD, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; poly-HEMA, polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; BH3, Bcl2 homology domain 3. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that link components of the ECM with intracellular structural elements of the cytoskeleton through adhesion complexes. Associated with such complexes are signaling proteins whose activation is critically required for migration, differentiation, cell cycle, and survival (3Miranti C.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E83-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Activation of signaling proteins such as pp125FAK within the adhesion complex is achieved only when integrins are ligated to the ECM and does not occur in cells that have been detached from the matrix (4Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Adherent cells normally require integrin-mediated adhesion in order to stay alive, and the downstream signals resulting from integrin activation cooperate with those from soluble factors to prevent apoptosis (5Meredith J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar, 6Pullan S. Wilson J. Metcalfe A. Edwards G.M. Goberdhan N. Tilly J. Hickman J.A. Dive C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Apoptosis mediated by the loss of integrin signaling is sometimes referred to as anoikis (10Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Two broadly different mechanisms have been proposed for adhesion control of cell survival. One of these involves signaling pathways that link integrins with apoptosis commitment events in mitochondria, whereas the other invokes the activation of death effector domain proteins. In primary fibroblasts, a pp125FAK-p130Cas complex drives integrin-mediated survival through a Ras/Rac1/Pak1/MKK4 pathway, which regulates the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p53 (9Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 11Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In epithelial MDCK cells, integrin survival is via a Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling cassette that appears to be mediated in part by pp125FAK and in part by Rac1 (7Khwaja A. Rodriguez Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 12Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chanhui P.Y. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28113-28120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p53 pathways have been shown in some cell models to regulate the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Bax, thereby controlling apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (14Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 15Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Moreover, adhesion signals triggered through pp125FAK in mammary epithelial cells cause the sequestration of Bax within the cytosol, thereby preventing its activation and translocation to mitochondria (16Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, in some cells, adhesion appears to regulate the cellular decision to enter apoptosis by controlling events at the mitochondrion. By contrast, several publications have suggested that death receptors may be involved in anoikis, thereby implicating mitochondria-independent caspase activation. In certain epithelial cell lines, loss of integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM results in rapid activation of caspase-8, an initiator caspase that is normally associated with the ligation of death receptors (17Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This leads to direct activation of effector caspases as well as cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid. The role of caspases in detachment-induced cytochrome c mobilization, at least in MDCK and MCF-10A cells, is supported by the observation that both a dominant-negative death domain that blocks caspase-8 recruitment to the death-inducing signaling complex and a generic caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, prevent cytochrome c release (19Rytomaa M. Lehmann K. Downward J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in endothelial cells, the FasL/Fas/caspase-8 axis is sensitized by detachment of cells from the ECM, although this occurs over a substantial (12-h) time frame (20Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated an essential role for Bax activation in detachment-induced apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells (16Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In view of the possibility that caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage may be involved in anoikis of some epithelial cell lines, we have now addressed the question of whether or not after removing integrin-mediated adhesion signals, initiator caspases are required for Bax translocation to mitochondria, cytochrome c release, and effector caspase activation. Cell Culture—FSK-7 is a mouse mammary epithelial cell line isolated from luminal epithelial cells (21Kittrell F.S. Oborn C.J. Medina D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1924-1932PubMed Google Scholar). FSK-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 880 nm insulin, and 2% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. MDCK dog kidney epithelial cells were cultured similarly; we used one strain of MDCK cells already existing within our laboratory as well as early passage MDCK-II cells purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures and used within three further passages. In all experiments, adherent cell monolayers were harvested after growth on tissue culture plastic or glass coverslips for 48 h, or cells were detached from the substratum with 5 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma), immediately washed in serum-containing medium and plated in whole medium onto dishes coated with polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (poly-HEMA; Sigma) for various lengths of time. In the case of inhibitor experiments, cells were preincubated 1 h prior to trypsinization and throughout culture on poly-HEMA with inhibitors at the following concentrations: 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem catalog no. 239764); 100 μm z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem catalog no. 627610); 50 μm IETD-CHO (Calbiochem catalog no. 218773); 10 μm z-IETD-fmk (Calbiochem catalog no. 218759). These concentrations of z-VAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk are effective for inhibiting caspase-8 in other cell systems (17Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Pervanadate was used at 1 mm from sodium orthovanadate and hydrogen peroxide and treated with catalase to quench unreacted hydrogen peroxide. To confirm that cycloheximide inhibited protein synthesis, mammary cells were cultured with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 24 h, and cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and autoradiographed. Although the lysates contained similar amounts of total cell protein, cycloheximide completely blocked the incorporation of isotope into newly synthesized proteins. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, cytospun onto polysine slides (BDH), and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Cells were stained as previously described with an antibody specific for the Bax 62M epitope (6Pullan S. Wilson J. Metcalfe A. Edwards G.M. Goberdhan N. Tilly J. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 631-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Metcalfe A.D. Gilmore A. Klinowska T. Oliver J. Valentijn A.J. Brown R. Ross A. MacGregor G. Hickman J.A. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1771-1783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an antibody to amino acids 163–175 of the caspase-3 P20 subunit, which detects the active form of caspase-3 but not the precursor (R&D Systems catalog no. AF835), or an antibody to cytochrome c (Pharmingen catalog no. 65971A), followed by either Cy-2- or Cy-3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories catalog no. 33697 and 31053, respectively). Cells were counterstained with 4 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) to examine nuclear morphology and quantify apoptosis. Cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence, and images were captured with a digital camera using Metamorph software. For comparison of each staining, all exposures and subsequent image manipulations were identical. For visualization of YFP-Bax costained with mitochondrial HSP70, fixed and stained cells were embedded in ProLong mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and then images were collected on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a DeltaVision imaging system, using a × 100 UPLAN-APO 1.35 NA objective. Images were captured with a Photometrics CH350L cooled CCD camera and were processed by constrained iterative deconvolution using SoftWoRx version 2.5 software (Applied Precision). Flow Cytometry—Cells cultured on poly-HEMA were harvested and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with 62M anti-Bax antibody at 4 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% horse serum. After three washes in PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min with 1:500 dilution fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson catalog no. 41624). Analysis was performed on a FACS-Vantage flow cytometer. Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was detected at 530 ± 30 nm, and fluorescence was acquired using logarithmic amplifiers. 10,000 cells were analyzed per sample at a flow rate of 300 cells/s. Protein Extraction—For total protein extraction, cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), pH 7.6). SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) was added, and the samples were boiled for 3 min and either used immediately for immunoblotting or stored at -20 °C before use. For rapid preparation of cytosolic fractions, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of mitochondria buffer (70 mm Tris-Cl, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and an equal volume of digitonin (0.2 mg/ml dissolved in MES buffer: 19.8 mm EDTA, 0.25 m d-mannitol and 19.8 mm MES, pH 7.4) was added to the sample for 5 min (23Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 900 × g for 2 min, the supernatant was centrifuged further at 20,000 × g for 5 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction, which was prepared for immunoblotting. For treatment of cell lysates with caspase-8, FSK-7 cells were lysed directly in caspase digestion buffer (50 mm HEPES-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.17 mm CHAPS, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5), and then 150 μg of total cell protein was incubated with 1 unit of activated recombinant caspase-8 (Calbiochem catalog no. 218812) before analysis by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as previously described (22Metcalfe A.D. Gilmore A. Klinowska T. Oliver J. Valentijn A.J. Brown R. Ross A. MacGregor G. Hickman J.A. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1771-1783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using antibodies specific for cytchrome c (Pharmingen catalog no. 65981A), caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; catalog no. Sc-1224), Erk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog no. Sc-154), and Bid (R & D Systems catalog no. AF860). Detection was achieved with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorimetric Assay for Caspase-3 Enzyme Activation—FSK-7 cells were cultured on poly-HEMA for different times, washed once with PBS, lysed in 100 μl of NET buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6) and kept on ice for 10 min prior to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of 50 μm caspase-3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (Calbiochem catalog no. 235425) was added to the lysate from 106 cells, and the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 5 mm NaOAc. 100 μl of each sample was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the fluorescence of cleaved AMC was measured using a spectrofluorometer (Berthold Technologies) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Bax Is Activated within 15 Min of Detachment from ECM—In mammary epithelial cells, integrin function suppresses the activation of Bax (16Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Upon cell detachment from ECM, Bax translocates to mitochondria. Concomitant with this, Bax undergoes a conformational change, which can be visualized using antibodies to cryptic epitopes within Bax that only become exposed following its activation. To determine whether Bax activation, as measured by a change in conformation, is an early initiator of the apoptotic program in response to cell detachment, we examined the kinetics of events following the removal of mammary epithelial cells from ECM. After plating onto the nonadhesive substratum, poly-HEMA, cells were cytospun at various time intervals. Bax activation was examined by immunostaining with a polyclonal anti-peptide antibody that has previously been shown to recognize only the activated form of Bax on a specific epitope overlapping the BH3 domain, 62M (22Metcalfe A.D. Gilmore A. Klinowska T. Oliver J. Valentijn A.J. Brown R. Ross A. MacGregor G. Hickman J.A. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1771-1783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in adherent cells, there was little or no exposure of the 62M epitope within 5 min following detachment from ECM (Fig. 1a). However, Bax became immunoreactive 10–15 min after loss of adhesion and was evident in the majority of the cells. Exposure of the Bax 62M epitope was maintained throughout 24-h culture on poly-HEMA and during the morphological changes associated with apoptosis. To quantify Bax activation, detached cells were fixed at the same time points after incubation on poly-HEMA, and stained with the 62M antibody for FACS analysis (Fig. 1b). There was little Bax staining immediately following detachment, but this very rapidly increased over 10–15 min. Exposure of the 62M epitope was maximal after 15 min in suspension and remained at this level over several hours. At later time points, Bax staining became slightly reduced, although this is probably due to cells undergoing the terminal stages of apoptosis. We did find, however, that cells containing apoptotic bodies still stain for active Bax. Two experiments were performed to confirm that Bax translocated to mitochondria. First, mammary cells were extracted under detergent-free, hypotonic conditions, and the soluble and membrane fractions were separated. Under these conditions, Bax was largely present in the cytosol of adherent cells (Fig. 1c). Following detachment from the ECM, the majority of Bax was associated with the membrane fraction. This occurred within 15 min of detachment and correlated exactly with the kinetics of exposure of the 62M epitope of Bax. Second, cells were transfected with YFP-Bax, and its location was examined in adherent cells and in those detached from the substratum. YFP-Bax was present in a diffuse, cytosolic distribution in adherent cells (Fig. 1d). Following cell detachment from the ECM for 15 min, YFP-Bax became punctate and co-stained with the mitochondrial marker mitochondrial HSP70, indicating its redistribution to mitochondria. These data suggest that following cell detachment, Bax activation and its translocation to mitochondria is a very rapid event and is complete within 15 min of removal of integrin signaling. This appears to occur synchronously within the cell population. A Delay Occurs between Bax Activation and the Release of Cytochrome c from Mitochondria—The rapidity of Bax activation is in contrast to mammary epithelial cell death, which occurs over several hours following loss of adhesion. To compare Bax activation with events previously indicated to characterize commitment to apoptosis, we examined the kinetics of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-3. Cells maintained on poly-HEMA were extracted with digitonin to leave mitochondria intact, and the soluble extracts were immunoblotted for cytochrome c. Although the Bax 62M epitope became exposed within 15 min of cell detachment from ECM, cytochrome c was not released at this time. Rather, the appearance of cytochrome c in the cytosol was first apparent 1 h following detachment and subsequently increased to a maximal level at 2 h (Fig. 2a). Cytochrome c release from mitochondria has been described to occur rapidly and, once initiated, to be complete within 5 min subsequent to the treatment of cells with a variety of apoptotic stimuli (24Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). This observation is not consistent with the gradual appearance of cytochrome c in the cytosol over a period of hours in ECM-detached mammary cells. To determine whether cytochrome c is released from mitochondria in a rapid and kinetically invariant manner following loss of integrin survival signals, we examined its subcellular distribution within individual cells in situ. After 1 h, when cytochrome c is first detectable in the cytosol by immunoblotting, most cells still showed it localizing to the mitochondria by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2b). At later time points, the percentage of cells without mitochondrial cytochrome c staining increased, and many of the cells displayed diffuse cytochrome c staining instead (Fig. 2, b (arrows) and c). These results suggest that the slow release of cytochrome c observed in immunoblotting is due to its release in an asynchronous manner. Importantly, the rapid and synchronous conformational changes that occur within Bax following loss of adhesion do not lead immediately to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Cytochrome c release into the cytosol is required for the formation of the apoptosome, within which the proenzymatic form of caspases are cleaved to generate the active enzyme (25Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). It has previously been suggested that the release of cytochrome c rapidly commits cells to caspase activation and apoptosis (26Rehm M. Dussmann H. Janicke R.U. Tavare J.M. Kogel D. Prehn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24506-24514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the kinetics of caspase-3 activation in response to cell detachment and compared this with the temporal release of cytochrome c. Activation of the effector caspase, caspase-3, was monitored in cells cultured on poly-HEMA by examining the appearance of its cleaved active subunit. Active caspase-3 was just detectable 2 h after detaching mammary cells from ECM and was significantly more pronounced at 8 h, as measured both by immunoblotting (Fig. 2a) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 2d). This time course was confirmed using a fluorimetric assay to measure caspase-3 enzyme activity (data not shown). We also noticed that some of the cells with cytochrome c released from mitochondria contained nuclei with normal morphology (Fig. 2b, arrowheads at the 1- and 8-h time points). Rather than becoming apoptotic just after cytochrome c release, the number of cells with normal nuclei gradually disappeared over time as the proportion of cells without mitochondrial cytochrome c but containing apoptotic nuclei increased (Fig. 2c). Thus, in anoikis, there is a lag between the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspases, leading to the subsequent morphological signs of apoptosis. Taken together, these results define a sequential ordering of apoptotic events following cell detachment from the ECM. In mammary cells that adhere to the ECM via integrins, Bax is localized within the cytosol and excluded from mitochondria. 15 min after cell detachment, Bax is redistributed to mitochondria and undergoes conformational changes to reveal the 62M epitope. These changes occur synchronously within the population of detached cells. Over the next 1–8 h, cytochrome c is released asynchronously into the cytosol, possibly in a stochastic manner. This is followed by the activation of caspase-3 and subsequently by cell death. Importantly, our results firmly place the activation of Bax and its translocation to mitochondria as one of the earliest detectable events leading to apoptosis after loss of integrin signaling. Anoikis in Mammary Cells Does Not Require de Novo Protein Synthesis—Although the ECM is a survival factor for mammary cells, other types of extracellular ligand can also regulate survival through Bax translocation in some cell systems. For example, in sympathetic neurons, the removal of neurotrophins results in Bax translocation to mitochondria and apoptosis in a mechanism that involves protein synthesis (27Putcha G.V. Deshmukh M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7476-7485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the redistribution of Bax does not require new protein synthesis following loss of integrin-mediated adhesion in mammary epithelia (16Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, our new data indicate that there is a considerable delay between Bax translocation and the subsequent release of cytochrome c, suggestive of a protein synthesis requirement. We examined whether this was the case by detaching cells in the presence of cycloheximide and measuring the kinetics of Bax activation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and apoptosis. Cycloheximide did not delay the kinetics of Bax activation as measured by exposure of the Bax 62M epitope in both immunofluorescence and FACS analysis (Fig. 3a). Similarly, cytochrome c release still occurred when protein synthesis was blocked. Immunoblots of isolated cytosolic fractions show that cytochrome c was released after 1 h, with caspase-3 activation after 2–4 h (Fig. 3b). This time course compares with that in the absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 2a). Finally, there was no difference in the rate of apoptosis over a 24-h time course in detached cells treated with or without cycloheximide, indicating that apoptosis occurs equally in the presen"

The PDZ domains form a complex that plays a major role in stabilizing CFTR at the apical membrane region of airway epithelial cells (6Sun F. Hug M.J. Lewarchik C.M. Yun C.C. Bradbury N.A.

The sorting of औ2AR between recycling endosomes and lysosomal compartments is controlled by their association with EBP50 (13Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Zastrw M.

Moreover, औ2ARs are linked to the actin cytoskeleton via EBP50-ezrin interactions, since ezrin contains actin-binding sites at its C-terminal domain. It has been recently shown that PDZ proteins regulate the endocytic re-cycling of CFTR in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (15Howard M. Jiang X. Beer Stolz D. Hill W.J. Johnson J.A. Watkins S.C. Frizzell R.A. Bruton C.M. Robbins P.D. Weisz O.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C375-C382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that औ2AR-EBP50-ezrin and -actin interactions may enhance the maturation of CFTR and its expression at the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The औ2AR belongs to the class of seven-transmembrane domain receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters, the stimulation of which leads to alterations in the metabolism, excitability, differentiation, and growth of many cell types. Signal transduction by औ2AR occurs upon ligand binding via the activation of adenylate cyclase, which increases the concentration of intracellular cAMP and produces a variety of cell-specific physiological responses. In epithelial cells, activation of PKA by cAMP elevation, which in turn activates CFTR-dependent chloride transport, is among the myriad of cell processes that are regulated by cAMP signals. It has been reported that, in addition to the activation of CFTR channel gating, cAMP increases CFTR apical membrane expression by inducing the apical membrane insertion of the protein in CFTR-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. However, this effect was shown to be dependent upon the level of protein expressed (16Loffing J. Moyer B.D. McCoy D. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C913-C920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Calu3 cells, a human secretory airway epithelial cell line, cAMP, induces the stimulation of CFTR channels present in the apical plasma membrane but not the recruitment of CFTR from an intracellular pool to the apical plasma membrane (17Davis P.B. Silski C.L. Kercsmar C.M. Infeld M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although CFTR-PDZ interactions have been analyzed in several epithelial cell types, CFTR-PDZ interactions and the effect of agonists of औ2AR on CFTR apical expression in human well differentiated primary cultures of surface epithelial cells remains unknown. In the present study, cultures of primary human airway surface epithelial cells were used to analyze whether a long term औ2AR agonist may modulate the expression of membrane CFTR via the cAMP/PKA pathway. We report that exposure of primary airway epithelial cells to औ2AR agonist induces a post-transcriptional, time-dependent increase in CFTR expression. This effect is mediated by औ2AR but does not involve the cAMP/PKA pathway. The primary antibodies used for both immunohistochemistry and Western blots were as follows: 24–1 mouse monoclonal anti-human CFTR (R&D Systems), rabbit polyclonal anti-human औ2AR and goat polyclonal anti-human ezrin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal anti-human EBP50 (Transduction Laboratories), and mouse monoclonal anti-human occludin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco). The appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies were all purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Salmeterol was provided by GlaxoSmithKline. Rolipram (Rp)-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate triethylamine and 8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate were purchased from Sigma. ICI 118,551 hydrochloride was purchased from Fisher. Nasal polyps were collected from non-cystic fibrosis patients and immediately immersed in Hanks'-Hepes culture medium containing 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 ॖg/ml streptomycin. After repeated washings with cold Hanks'-Hepes medium, the polyps were digested with 0.17 Pronase (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight under continuous rotation. The cell suspension obtained after digestion was centrifuged, and the pellet was shaken in 20 ml of fresh Hanks'-Hepes medium. The cell suspension obtained was then centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing insulin (1 ॖg/ml; Sigma), apo-transferrin (1 ॖg/ml; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml; Serva), retinoic acid (10 ng/ml; Sigma), hydroxycortisone (0.5 ॖg/ml; Sigma), amphotericin B (2.5 ॖg/ml; Sigma), streptomycin (100g/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). The cells were plated on 5-mm-thick collagen type I gels in 12-well plastic dishes and incubated at 37 °C, 57 CO2. The culture medium was changed daily. Confluent monolayers of HAEC were grown on Transwells and fixed in 2.57 glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffer saline (0.1 m), pH 7.4, for 1–2 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and post-fixed for 1 h in OsO4 (27 in distilled water) at pH 7.2–7.4 before being dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol. The specimens were then embedded in Epon and cut with an ultramicrotome, and ultra-thin sections (0.08 ॖm) were mounted on copper grids, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi 300, Elexience, Verrieres-leBuisson, France) at 75 kV. The degree of tightness of the cells in culture was evaluated by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of HAEC grown on collagen I-coated filters (0.4 ॖm). TER was measured every 2 days using an ERS electrical resistance system (Millipore). After a 1-h equilibration of sterile electrodes in culture medium, resistance values were measured and normalized by subtracting the contribution of the collagen-coated filter and bathing solution. To obtain TER values that were independent of the area of membrane used, we calculated the product of the measured resistance and the area of effective membrane on the Transwells. The value obtained was expressed in ohm·cm2. Expression and localization of औ2AR, CFTR, and CFTR-associated proteins (EBP50 and ezrin) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Cells were seeded onto 12-well plates, which were previously covered by 5-mm-thick collagen type I gels, at 507 confluence. Five to 6 days later confluent cells and their gels were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (Tissue Tek), cryofixed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Transverse frozen sections (5-ॖm thick) were placed on gelatin-coated glass slides and fixed in cooled methanol (−20 °C) for 10 min. After washing 2 times with PBS, cells were incubated in PBS containing 17 bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific sites. Primary antibodies (dilution, 1:40 each in PBS) were added to the cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS, 17 bovine serum albumin and incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the cells 3 times in PBS, streptavidin-coupled fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:50 in PBS) was added. Nuclei were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin solution (Sigma), mounted in Citifluor antifading solution (Agar Scientific), and observed with an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Le Pecq, France) at a magnification of ×40. HAEC total RNA was extracted using a High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). RT-PCR was performed with 10 ng of total RNA by using the GeneAmp Thermostable RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with pairs of primers for CFTR and for 28 S control amplification (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Forward and reverse primers for human CFTR and 28 S were designed as follows: CFTR primers (forward 5′-GCTTCCTATGACCCGGATAACAAG-3′; reverse 5′-GTGCCAATGCAAGTCCTTCATCAA-3′) and 28 S primers (forward 5′-GTTCACCCACTAATAGGGAACGTGA-3′; reverse 5′-GGATTCTGACTTAGAGGCGT TCAGT-3′). Reverse transcription was performed at 70 °C for 15 min followed by a 2-min incubation at 95 °C to melt RNA-DNA heteroduplexes. For PCR amplification, we used 27 cycles for CFTR and 17 cycles for 28 S; each cycle consisted of 15 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 68 °C, 10 s at 72 °C. To quantify CFTR mRNA levels, a synthetic RNA standard (pCTR) was introduced to each sample before PCR. To produce this standard, a PCR fragment corresponding to the CFTR RT-PCR amplification products with a 16-bp deletion was generated by PCR and cloned in the pCR®4-TOPO®-cloning (Invitrogen). A sequence-verified construct was then linearized, purified, and used as the template for RNA synthesis (SP6/T7 transcription kit, Roche Applied Science). RT-PCR amplification of this synthetic RNA with the pairs of primers designed for CFTR RT-PCR generated amplification products shorter than those obtained from the cellular RNA, enabling them to be discriminated by electrophoresis. RT-PCR products were separated by electrophoresis, stained with SYBR gold (Molecular Probes), and quantified by fluorometric scanning (LAS-1000, Fuji). The products from pCTR endogenous CFTR and endogenous 28 S were 260, 276, and 212 bp, respectively. Results are expressed as a ratio of endogenous CFTR mRNA to its specific internal control pCTR after normalization with 28 S mRNA level. Whole HAEC proteins were extracted in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and precipitated at 4 °C overnight with 47 (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), the pellet was dissolved in SDS-PAGE disaggregation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 27 SDS (w/v), 157 glycerol (w/v), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.027 bromphenol blue (w/v)) at a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated by electrophoresis on 7.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes using 20 V overnight at 4 °C in a 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm glycine buffer. Membranes were first incubated for 1 h in a blocking buffer containing 57 nonfat dried milk in PBS, then for 2 h with the relevant primary monoclonal antibody, and finally with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG. Blots were revealed by the enhanced ECL method using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). For membrane extracts, confluent cells were disrupted mechanically in cold Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 15–20 min on ice. After homogenization, and centrifugation (14,000 × g for 3 min), the supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet, corresponding to the membrane protein fraction, was dissolved in sample buffer and analyzed as above. Confluent cells from 3 wells (12 wells/plate) were disrupted mechanically and dissolved in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture for 15–20 min on ice. Proteins were precipitated at 4 °C with 47 trichloroacetic acid (v/v) overnight. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), pellets were dissolved in 100 ॖl of disaggregating buffer (containing 17 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 107 glycerol, in PBS), and the concentration of protein was assessed using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Proteins (400 ॖg) were incubated with 4 ॖg of human EBP50 antibody for 2 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Washed protein G-Sepharose beads (25 ॖl) were then added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were washed four times with PBS buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer before immunoblotting analyses. We used the cAMP enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system Biotrak (Amersham Biosciences) to assess cellular cAMP levels in both control and salmeterol-treated cells according to standard manufacturer's protocols. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. For statistical analyses, the Student's t test and analysis of variance analysis were performed. A value of p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Because protein trafficking and synthesis and certain drug effects depend on cell polarity and tightness, we therefore first characterized the polarity and tightness of HAEC under our culture conditions. A distinguishing characteristic of the polarized epithelial cells is the presence of tight junctions. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of structures corresponding to tight junctions (Fig.1A), along with which the exclusion of lanthanum nitrate precipitate by these structures suggested that they were functional (Fig. 1B). To further evaluate the functionality of the tight junctions observed, we measured TER, a commonly used method to assess tight junction function. As shown in Fig. 1C, the cultured cells showed an increase in their TER over time, with a maximal value of 1500 ohm·cm2reached 2 days after confluence. The presence of tight junctions correlated with the polarized distribution of apical and basolateral plasma membrane markers in these HAEC. Transverse sections of the cells and culture support (collagen I gel) enabled clear visualization of the apical and basolateral regions of the cells. Consistent with the TEM data and TER measurements, the immunofluorescence staining (Fig.2) for occludin, a tight junction protein, revealed an apical staining pattern located at the point of cell-cell contact. Moreover, these primary airway epithelial cells also showed distinct apical localization of CFTR, ezrin, and CFTR-associated protein EBP50 and a basal localization of औ1-integrin, a basal plasma membrane marker. The staining of औ2AR was apical and patchy in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2).Figure 2Expression and localization of औ2 adrenergic receptors, CFTR, and CFTR-associated protein EBP50 in primary HAEC. HAEC isolated from human nasal polyps were cultivated on collagen I gels until confluent. Cryofixed longitudinal sections of the cells (5 ॖm thick) were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for human औ2AR, mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for human CFTR, EBP50, औ1-integrin, and occludin, or rat polyclonal antibody specific for the EBP50-associated protein ezrin. Immunoreactivity was visualized using streptavidin-coupled fluorescein isothiocyanate staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of औ2AR agonist on endogenous CFTR expression by airway epithelial cells was assessed by Western blotting analyses using a mouse monoclonal anti-human CFTR antibody (C24-1). As shown in Fig.3, A and B, cell incubation with 2.10−7m salmeterol, a long acting औ2AR agonist, resulted in a significant increase in mature CFTR levels after 4 and 24 h of agonist administration. CFTR bands observed in Western blots were the N-glycosylated B and C forms, since a shift in the molecular weights was observed after N-glycanase treatment (data not shown). Cell treatment with salmeterol (24 h) produced a 2.2-fold increase over base line for the fully mature band C (p < 0.05). To verify that the effect of the agonist on CFTR expression was mediated by औ2AR and not as a result of a direct effect of the agonist on CFTR expression, cells were exposed to ICI 118,551 (100 nm), a highly specific औ2AR antagonist, for 20 min before treatment with salmeterol. Because this maneuver prevented the effect of the salmeterol, we concluded that the effect of salmeterol on CFTR expression was dependent upon its interaction with औ2AR. Moreover, cells treated with ICI 118,551 (100 nm) alone did not show any change in CFTR levels, suggesting that this receptor is not involved in the regulation of CFTR expression under resting conditions. To test whether the increase in CFTR after औ2AR agonist administration was due to effects on steady-state mRNA levels, we performed a semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis from total cellular RNA. The औ2AR agonist did not appear to cause significant changes in CFTR mRNA levels, suggesting that increased CFTR mRNA did not account for the protein increase observed (Fig.4). To demonstrate that the effect of the agonist was specific and not a result of a global alteration in cell protein expression, we evaluated by Western blotting the levels of EBP50 and ezrin (members of the protein network associated with CFTR) in both soluble and cytoskeletal fractions of untreated and treated cell lysates (Fig. 5, A andB). In both fractions EBP50 and ezrin levels remained unchanged after salmeterol treatment (Fig. 5, C andD). Because agonist treatment has been previously reported to cause औ2AR down-regulation and desensitization, we performed Western blots to analyze the expression of membrane औ2AR in HAEC after salmeterol treatment (Fig.6A). In contrast to its effect on CFTR, salmeterol induced a significant decrease of membrane औ2AR levels after 4 and 24 h of cell treatment (Fig.6B). औ2AR corresponded to a band of 54 kDa that disappeared when blots were treated with the anti-human औ2AR antibody blocking peptide (Fig. 6C).Figure 6Membrane औ2AR down-regulation after salmeterol treatment. Confluent primary epithelial cells cultured on collagen I gels and treated for the indicated times with salmeterol were incubated in lysis buffer and mechanically disrupted. Membrane protein fractions were obtained by centrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatants and resuspension of the pellets in sample buffer. InA, equal aliquots of these protein extracts were separated by electrophoresis on 127 SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. औ2AR was detected after incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti-human औ2AR and via ECL protocols. For the identification of औ2AR bands, similarly treated blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-human औ2AR and its blocking peptide (C). In B, histograms represent the relative changes in membrane औ2AR expression upon salmeterol treatment. Data are arbitrary densitometry units, where control values have been normalized to 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Treatment of cells with salmeterol also induced an increase in cellular cAMP. This increase was detected after 2 min of treatment, lasted for at least 30 min, and was partially restored to near normal at 4 and 24 h (Fig.7A). To test whether the effect of salmeterol on CFTR expression levels was mediated by this cAMP signal, we treated HAEC for different periods of time with 8-Br-cAMP (a cell-permeable analogue of cAMP), or with 8-Br-cAMP along with salmeterol, and then analyzed CFTR expression by Western blotting (Fig. 7, B and C). As shown in Fig.7B′, cellular CFTR levels were not significantly modified by exposure of cells to 8-Br-cAMP alone, whereas when the औ2AR agonist was added, CFTR expression was significantly increased (Fig. 7C′). Similarly, treatment with the protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMP, which is known to inhibit cAMP-dependent PKA-mediated effects in several cell types, did not prevent the increase in CFTR expression after salmeterol treatment. This suggests that PKA activity is not required for the agonist to increase CFTR levels. The cAMP analogue and the PKA inhibitor did not affect CFTR levels in control cells (not treated with औ2AR agonist), suggesting that the PKA/cAMP pathway is not involved in the regulation of CFTR expression under basal conditions. To verify whether औ2AR stimulation increases levels of CFTR that bind to EBP50 in HAEC, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-human EBP50 followed by Western blotting analysis of the resulting immunoprecipitates with anti-human CFTR or anti-human EBP50. As shown in Fig. 8C, the treatment of cells for 24 h with औ2AR agonist induced a detectable increase in the intensity of the band recognized by anti-human CFTR without any associated EBP50 alteration. When the immunoprecipitate blots were incubated with the anti-human औ2AR antibody, a 54-kDa band that most likely corresponds to औ2AR was revealed. Interestingly, this band intensity was decreased by 24 h of औ2AR agonist treatment (Fig. 8D). These results are in accordance with our direct Western blot analyses of cell protein extracts. The immunoprecipitate contained औ2AR, CFTR, and EBP50. औ2AR agonists represent key therapeutic agents in the treatment of obstructive lung diseases. औ2ARs are expressed within the lung on multiple cell types including bronchial smooth muscle cells, tracheal epithelial cells, and presynaptic cholinergic nerve terminals and on multiple immune cells present therein, including macrophages (17Davis P.B.

To our knowledge, no data are available concerning the localization of औ2AR in airway epithelial cells. To visualize औ2AR in transverse sections of primary airway epithelial cells cultured on collagen I gels, we used a polyclonal antibody directed against human औ2AR and its blocking peptide to identify the specificity of the staining observed. We found that the immunolabeling of औ2AR in HAEC was not uniform and that the औ2AR could be localized to the apical plasma membrane and be found in the cytoplasm. Importantly, this immunostaining study demonstrates that, besides a औ2AR cytoplasmic localization, which probably corresponds to constitutively internalized receptors, औ2AR could localize to the apical domain of cultured cells, where CFTR resides normally. As such, this finding is of major interest. It has been reported that,"

To better understand this apparent paradox, we performed a gain-of-function screen to identify sequences that could confer cell culture replication competence to replicons derived from chimpanzee infectious HCV isolates. We found that residue 470 in domain II of the NS3 helicase is a critical determinant in cell culture adaptation.

The specific substitution at residue 470 required for replication is context-dependent, with R470M and P470L being optimal for the activity of HCV-BK and HCV-H77 replicons, respectively.

An important feature of HCV is its high level of genetic variability, which is believed to be a consequence of the low fidelity of the viral polymerase. This variability is underscored by the identification of six major HCV genotypes (designated 1–6), more than 50 subtypes, and numerous quasi-species within each subtype (14Farci P. Purcell R.H. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar). Several clones that are infectious in chimpanzees have been described previously (15Kolykhalov A.A. Agapov E.V. Blight K.J. Mihalik K.

In contrast, replicons derived from only the HCV-con1 and HCV-N isolates have been shown to replicate robustly in cell culture thus far (11Lohmann V. Körner F. Koch J.-O. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar, 12Ikeda M. Yi M. Li K. Lemon S.M. J.

Efficient replication in cell culture has been invariably associated with adaptive mutations that dramatically increase the frequency with which replication is established (12Ikeda M. Yi M. Li K. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 23Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M.

Adaptive mutations in the HCV-con1 replicon have been localized to various non-structural genes, although substitutions in NS5A, for example S232I, appear to be the most effective (23Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Similarly a 4-amino acid insertion in NS5A that is not commonly observed in vivo is required for the replication in cell culture of an HCV-N replicon (12Ikeda M. Yi M. Li K. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, known infectious clones are not replication-competent even after the introduction of adaptive mutations (23Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study showed that cell culture adaptive mutations that confer cell culture replication competence to the HCV-con1 replicon abrogate or dramatically attenuate its infectivity in vivo (26Bukh J. Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Krieger N. Faulk K. Engle R.E. Govindarajan S. Shapiro M. St. Claire M. Bartenschlager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Efforts to identify additional HCV sequences that replicate in cell culture remain a high priority, because availability of these sequences will not only contribute to a better understanding of HCV biology but will also facilitate the development of therapeutic agents that are broadly effective against all clinically relevant HCV genotypes. We described recently the development of a powerful HCV replication system, Bla-Rep, that employs HCV replicons expressing the औ-lactamase reporter (bla) and subpopulations of Huh7 cells that are enhanced for HCV replication (27Murray E.M. Grobler J.A. Markel E.J. Pagnoni M.F. Paonessa G. Simon A.J. Flores O. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we used this system and a systematic mutational approach to identify the restriction to replication of two known infectious HCV isolates. We report that the amino acid residue at position 470 in domain II of the NS3 helicase acts in concert with the NS5A-S232I adaptive mutation in determining the cell culture replication competence of HCV-BK and HCV-H77 isolates (genotypes 1b and 1a, respectively). The results presented here predict that substitutions in the NS3 helicase in combination with previously identified HCV-con1 adaptive mutations can confer replication competence to diverse HCV isolates. Huh7 human hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 2 mm GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml of streptomycin, and 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Media for culture of cell lines harboring replicon that expressed neomycin phosphotransferase were supplemented with G418 as indicated. Cells were grown at 37 °C and 57 CO2 and were passaged twice per week. HCV-BK comprises the genotype 1b BK sequence from the 5′-UTR through the KpnI restriction site in NS5B derived from a Japanese patient and a 3′-UTR (genotype 1a) derived from an Italian patient (28Takamizawa A. Mori C. Fuke I. Manabe S. Murakami S. Fujita J. Onishi E. Andoh T. Yoshida I. Okayama H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Direct intrahepatic injection ofin vitro transcribed HCV-BK RNA causes HCV infection in chimpanzees. Inoculation of a second chimpanzee with serum from an HCV BK-infected chimpanzee also results in infection, demonstrating that the BK sequences used in this study are infectious (29Conley A.J. McKenna P.M. Murthy K.K. Migliaccio G. Paonessa G. DeFrancesco R. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 560AGoogle Scholar). HCV-con1 replicon constructs that express the bla reporter were as described previously (27Murray E.M. Grobler J.A. Markel E.J. Pagnoni M.F. Paonessa G. Simon A.J. Flores O. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The HCV-BK subgenomic replicon was constructed by replacing the NS3 through the 3′-UTR sequence of the HCV-con1 replicon with the corresponding region from HCV-BK. The HDV ribozyme was added to the 3′-ends of both the HCV-con1 and HCV-BK replicons to facilitate the generation of native 3′-ends (30Wang K.S. Choo Q.L. Weiner A.J. Ou J.H. Najarian R.C. Thayer R.M. Mullenbach G.T. Denniston K.J. Gerin J.L. Houghton M. Nature. 1986; 323: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In addition, a unique ClaI restriction site has been introduced at the NS5B-3′-UTR junction. Mutations were introduced as indicated using the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). NS3 amino acid numbering is based on the mature sequence and does not include the initiator methionine present in the replicon constructs used. Replicon RNAs were transcribed and purified as reported previously (27Murray E.M. Grobler J.A. Markel E.J. Pagnoni M.F. Paonessa G. Simon A.J. Flores O. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) except that the templates were digested with XbaI, which cuts downstream of the HDV ribozyme. The integrity of the transcribed RNAs was checked by analytical agarose gel electrophoresis, and RNA was quantitated by absorbance. Replication assays were performed as described previously (27Murray E.M. Grobler J.A. Markel E.J. Pagnoni M.F. Paonessa G. Simon A.J. Flores O. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Bla-Rep assays were performed using MR2 cells, which are derived from Huh7 cells and are enhanced for HCV subgenomic replication (27Murray E.M. Grobler J.A. Markel E.J. Pagnoni M.F. Paonessa G. Simon A.J. Flores O. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 2.5–3 × 105 cells/well in six-well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were lipotransfected with DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) at the indicated concentrations of bla-replicon RNA for 6–8 h and then incubated overnight. Cells were stained 16–24 h later with CCF4-AM dye to check for transfection efficiency. Cells were split into 96-well plates (4000 cells/well) and assayed at day 3 or 4 for replication by staining with CCF4-AM dye and measuring emission at 460 and 530 nm using a CytoFluor 4000-plate reader. In this assay format, viable cells that do not express the reporter fluoresce green (530 nm), whereas those that do express the reporter fluoresce blue (460 nm). The ratio of the blue emission to the green emission gives a measure of the fraction of the cells that harbor replicon. For colony formation assays, 2 × 105 Huh7 cells were transfected with the indicated neomycin replicon RNA using DMRIE-C. Medium for selection experiments was supplemented with 250 ॖg/ml G418. Colonies were counted 3 weeks after transfection. A “GAA” HCV-con1 replicon was used as the negative control for all replication assays. This replicon contains alanine residues in place of the aspartic acids at positions 318 and 319 in the GDD motif of NS5B that is essential for catalytic activity. HCV RNA was isolated from chimpanzee serum using the RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen), and total RNA was purified from 106 replicon-harboring cells by TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction followed by spin-column purification using the RNeasy RNA purification kit. cDNAs comprising the NS3 region were generated by reverse transcription using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNAs were subsequently amplified with Expand High Fidelity polymerase, subcloned into pSTBlue1 (Novagen), and then sequenced with an ABI 373 Sequencer. NS3 helicases were subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites of pET-21B and expressed in BL21(DE3) cells. NS3 helicases were isolated from clarified bacterial lysates in three steps using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography, Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography, and poly(U)-Sepharose column chromatography. Purified helicases were stored at −20 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 107 glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated molar extinction coefficient of 47,480 m−1cm−1. The32P-end-labeled, partial duplex DNA helicase substrate was prepared essentially as described by Levin and Patel (31Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unwinding assay reactions were performed in 20 ॖl and contained 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 ॖg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 nm substrate, and 10 nm helicase. Helicase and substrate were preincubated for 15 min at 25 °C before initiation of the reaction by the addition of ATP to 5 mm. Reactions were stopped at various times by the addition of 5 ॖl of 5× the termination mixture. Products were resolved using a 107 acrylamide-Tris borate-EDTA gel and quantified by densitometric scanning with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). We focused our efforts on HCV-BK and HCV-H77, two isolates that are infectious in chimpanzees but that have failed to replicate in cell culture. Because they are infectious, all the activities and cis elements required for replication that are encoded by both sequences are known to be functional. We generated replicons that comprise the NS3-NS5B non-structural genes and the 3′-UTR from HCV-BK to test for cell culture replication. These constructs were engineered with an HDV ribozyme, which autocatalytically cleaves itself from the 3′-end of the replicon to yield replicon RNA transcripts with native 3′-ends. HCV-con1 replicons that are transcribed with the HDV ribozyme show the same replication activity as replicons that are transcribed from aScaI digested template without the ribozyme (data not shown). Replicons were generated either with the bla reporter for transient replication assays or with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene for selection experiments. In addition, the S232I mutation in NS5A that confers cell culture adaptation to the HCV-con1 replicon (23Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) was engineered into the HCV-BK replicon. As shown in Fig.1, the wild-type replicon derived from the BK chimpanzee infectious genome did not replicate in the transient replication assay (Fig. 1). The activity of the HCV-BK replicon containing the S232I mutation is not significantly different from that of the replication-deficient HCV-con1 replicon, indicating that this adaptive mutation does not confer replication competence to HCV-BK (Fig. 1). Similar analyses were performed by colony formation assay using corresponding neor replicons. The wild-type HCV-BK replicon did not yield any colonies. Introduction of the S232I adaptive mutation conferred modest replication competence to HCV-BK (∼100 colonies/ॖg) compared with corresponding HCV-con1 replicons (∼5000 colonies/ॖg). These results indicate that the introduction of the NS5A-S232I adaptive mutation is not sufficient to confer robust replication competence to the HCV-BK replicon. To identify the block to replication in the BK replicons, we generated chimeras in which the various non-structural proteins of HCV-BK and HCV-con1 were swapped. These swaps were initially made using HCV-BK replicons that had the S232I mutation, because this mutation modestly improved BK replicon replication in the colony formation assay described above. Substitution of NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, or NS5B either alone or in combination had modest or no effects on the replication of either replicon, suggesting that these regions did not account for the differences in replication competence (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 1, replacement of the NS3 coding region in the BK replicon with the con1 NS3 resulted in a replicon that replicated with essentially the same activity as the HCV-con1 replicon with the NS5A-S232I mutation. Conversely, introduction of the HCV-BK NS3 into the HCV-con1 replicon essentially abolished replication activity (Fig.1). In contrast, none of the other con1 regions yielded any improvement in replication of the HCV-BK replicon (data not shown). The results obtained from the chimera experiments demonstrated that the block to HCV-BK replication in cell culture maps to NS3. An alignment of the HCV-BK and HCV-con1 sequences revealed that there are 12 amino acid differences in NS3, with 1 mutation mapping to the protease domain and the remaining 11 mapping to the helicase domain. To identify which of the amino acid differences accounted for the dramatic differences in replication efficiency, each of the residues in the HCV-BK NS3 that differed from that in HCV-con1 was individually mutated to the residue found in HCV-con1. The resulting replicons were then tested for replication activity by Bla-Rep. As shown in Fig. 2, two mutations restored replication competence to the BK replicon. The introduction of an R470M mutation into the HCV-BK NS3 helicase resulted in a replicon that had significantly higher replication efficiency than the HCV-con1 S232I replicon. The NS3-S196T mutation also enhanced HCV-BK replicon activity but with lower efficiency than the R470M mutation. At all other positions tested, introduction of the corresponding HCV-con1 residue had only modest effects. When the NS3-S196T and R470M mutations were combined, a modest but reproducible additivity in transduction efficiency was observed (data not shown). To determine the nature of the higher level of reporter gene expression observed in the HCV-BK replicons containing the R470M mutation, we measured the fraction of the cell population harboring replicon. We then calculated reporter activity normalized to the number of replicon-harboring cells (27Murray E.M. Grobler J.A. Markel E.J. Pagnoni M.F. Paonessa G. Simon A.J. Flores O. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The increase in reporter gene expression was found to be because of both increases in the frequency with which replication is established (the fraction of cells that expressed reporter) and to a modest (<2-fold) increase in the replicon copy number per cell (data not shown). Although the NS3-R470M mutation dramatically enhances the replication activity of HCV-BK replicons, different residues are observed at this position in other isolates. To determine whether arginine at this position is incompatible with replication or rather that the methionine at this position is unique in conferring cell culture replication competence, HCV-BK replicons containing R470P and R470G mutations were tested. Proline, glycine, and leucine are frequently seen in genotype 1 HCV isolates at this position (Table I). As shown in Fig. 3, replicons containing either proline or glycine in place of Arg-470 replicated albeit with modestly lower efficiency those with methionine at this position.Table IVariability of HCV NS3 at position 470ResidueFrequency1-aFrequency is the number of times the residue is observed at NS3 position 470 in 165 independent full-length HCV sequences in GenBank.Arg44Gly28Leu27Pro20Ser16Ala10Met8His7Ile2Thr2Gln11-a Frequency is the number of times the residue is observed at NS3 position 470 in 165 independent full-length HCV sequences in GenBank. Open table in a new tab To assess the effect of BK residues at positions 196 and 470 on HCV-con1 replication fitness, corresponding HCV-con1 replicons were engineered to have the T196S or M470R mutation or both and were tested in Bla-Rep. As shown in Fig. 4, T196S and M470R caused a modest and dramatic reduction in replication activity, respectively, whereas the combination of both mutations essentially abrogated replication activity. These results demonstrate that residues 196 and 470 both contribute to the replication of HCV-con1 replicons. As mentioned above, the S232I adaptive mutation in NS5A had minimal effects on the replication competence of the BK replicon. However, robust replication of BK replicons was observed when this mutation was combined with R470M and to a lesser extent with S196T-NS3 helicase mutations. The corresponding replicons without the S232I mutation in NS5A were tested in transient replication assays to assess whether S196T or R470M helicase mutations could by themselves confer replication competence to HCV-BK replicons. Replicons containing either of the NS3 helicase mutations but not the S232I-NS5A adaptive mutation did not replicate (Fig.5A), demonstrating that cell culture replication of both con1 and BK replicons is dependent on both the NS3 and NS5A adaptive mutations. Additional analyses using a colony formation assay confirmed the results shown in Fig. 5A but also indicated that residue 470 makes a significantly greater contribution to replication activity than residue 196 (Fig.5B). Replicons derived from the chimpanzee infectious genotype 1a isolate HCV-H77 also failed to replicate efficiently in cell culture with the introduction of the single adaptive mutation S232I in NS5A (3Poynard T. Marcellin P. Lee S.S. Niederau C. Minuk G.S. Ideo G. Bain V. Heathcote J. Zeuzem S. Trepo C. Albrecht J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The results obtained with HCV-BK replicons prompted us to address whether mutations at positions 196 and 470 would confer cell culture replication competence to HCV-H77 replicons as well. The wild-type HCV-H77 NS3 helicase has a serine at position 196 and a proline at position 470, a combination that is compatible with efficient replication in HCV-BK replicons as described above. We generated a series of HCV-H77 replicons containing either the wild-type serine or a threonine at position 196 and either the wild-type proline, methionine, or leucine at position 470 in NS3 with and without the S232I adaptive mutation in NS5A. These replicons were assayed by Bla-Rep, and the data are summarized in Fig.6. The H77 replicon containing Ser-196 and Pro-470 failed to replicate as did replicons containing the point mutations S196T and P470M in combination with S232I. However, HCV-H77 replicons containing both P470L and NS5A-S232I became replication-competent, thus demonstrating the importance of this region of NS3 helicase in the cell culture adaptation of HCV-H77. Although the S196T had essentially no effect in isolation, the introduction of this substitution into the HCV-H77 replicon containing P470L further enhanced replication activity. Similar data were obtained in colony formation assays using H77 replicons that express neor. No colonies were observed with either wild-type replicons or replicons that contained either single NS3 or NS5A mutations in isolation. Replicons containing the combination of the NS3-P470L and NS5A-S232I mutations yielded 140 colonies/ॖg of replicon RNA. Addition of the S196T mutations to this replicon further improved colony formation efficiency to 460 colonies/ॖg of replicon RNA. For comparison in the same sets of experiments, HCV-con1 replicons containing the NS5A-S232I mutation yielded ∼3000 colonies/ॖg of RNA. These data indicate that the NS3 helicase residues at positions 196 and 470 influence the replication potential of genotype 1a replicons. To explore the effects of the cell culture adaptive mutations on helicase unwinding activity, HCV-BK NS3 helicase domains with and without the S196T and R470M mutations were expressed and purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli. Helicases were then compared in unwinding assays using double-stranded DNA substrates. As shown in Table II, the rates of unwinding were comparable for each protein. This fact, with the fact that both NS3 mutations map to the protein surface, suggests that these mutations mediate interactions with other viral- or host-encoded proteins involved in viral replication.Table IINS3 helicase mutations that confer cell culture replication competence do not affect helicase unwinding activityHelicaseRatemin−1 × 103Wild-type0.62 ± 0.12S196T0.56 ± 0.14R470M0.76 ± 0.26 Open table in a new tab It was of interest to investigate whether revertants containing substitutions in NS3 470 and or NS3 196 could be found in the sera of HCV-BK infected chimpanzees. Sequence analyses of 10 NS3 sequences rescued from the serum of an HCV BK-infected chimpanzee (5780 genome equivalents/ml) (29Conley A.J. McKenna P.M. Murthy K.K. Migliaccio G. Paonessa G. DeFrancesco R. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 560AGoogle Scholar) did not reveal substitutions in these positions relative to the parental clone, consistent with the suggestion that substitutions at these positions are specifically required for cell culture adaptation. An unbiased mutagenesis approach was used to identify the block to cell culture replication of subgenomic replicons derived from two HCV isolates that have been shown to replicate in chimpanzees. We report that combination of the previously identified con1 NS5A adaptive mutation S232I with substitutions in NS3 helicase residue 470 is necessary to confer cell culture replication competence to the 1b-BK and 1a-H77 HCV replicons. Residue 470 maps to the surface of the NS3 helicase and is not in the nucleotide, metal binding, or nucleic acid binding sites, suggesting that this position might be part of an interaction interface for binding to other viral proteins or host-encoded factors (32Yao N. Hesson T. Cable M. Hong Z. Kwong A.D. Le H.V. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 33Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P.

Weber P.C. Structure. 1999; 7: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Furthermore the demonstration that mutations at this position do not affect the in vitrounwinding activities of purified NS3 helicase is consistent with a role in mediating interactions with other factors. Residue Ser-196 is located in domain I of the NS3 helicase and appears to play a secondary role compared with residue 470. Mutations in domain I that map near to this position in the helicase have previously been shown to improve transduction efficiency of the HCV-con1 subgenomic replicon. For example, mutations E177G and T255I increase the transduction efficiency of HCV-con1 replicons severalfold either alone or in combination with the NS5A adaptive mutation S225P (25Krieger N. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4614-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Likewise the mutations R258G and K583E were shown to increase the efficiency of colony formation in G418 selection experiments with HCV-con1 replicons, either with or without the NS5B adaptive mutation R465G (24Lohmann V. Körner F. Dobierzewska A. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1437-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In these previous examples, the improvement in replication efficiency was relatively modest, resulting in up to 10-fold increases in colony formation efficiency. Similarly, in G418 selection experiments using HCV-BK neomycin replicons, colony formation efficiency improved nearly 8-fold for replicons containing both the NS3-S196T and NS5A-S232I adaptive mutations compared with those with only NS5A-S232I (Fig.5B). These results suggest that the NS3-S196T mutation has modest effects, comparable with those engendered by the previously reported domain I mutations and that it may act by a similar mechanism. In contrast, residue 470 is localized to domain II and its critical involvement in cell culture replication has not been recognized previously. Methionine, proline, and glycine substitutions at this position are all able to confer replication competence to HCV-BK replicons. Interestingly, the 1b HCV-N isolate, which exhibits a high transduction efficiency, also has a glycine at this position and a 4-amino acid insertion in NS5A that appears to be functionally equivalent to the S232I adaptive mutation. Surprisingly, we find that neither methionine nor proline substitutions at this position are compatible for replication in the context of HCV-H77 replicons but instead a leucine substitution conferred replication competence to this isolate. These results suggest that the residue required at this position for optimal replication is context-dependent and may vary among different genotypes. More detailed analyses are likely to identify additional NS3 helicase domain II residues that are part of an interface and which may also influence cell culture replication activity. The biological activity attributed to NS3 helicase residues 196 and 470 is absolutely dependent on the presence of the NS5A adaptive mutation S232I. In turn the ability of the NS5A S232I mutation to confer replication competence is also dependent on its cooperation compatibility with NS3 helicase. The observation that the optimal residue at position 470 appears to be isolate-specific suggests that this residue might influence viral replication via a direct interaction with another viral protein. An alternative interpretation to these observations is that there are potentially two independent restrictions to cell culture replication, one of which can be addressed by the introduction of a mutation in residue 470 of NS3 helicase. The other restriction requires an adaptive mutation in either NS4B, NS5A, or NS5B. Additional work will be required to better understand the mechanism by which substitutions in these residues can confer replication activity in cell culture. Regardless of the mechanism by which these mutations mediate cell culture adaptation, the findings described here provide a rational and simple approach to generate and characterize isolates of other genotypes that are replication-competent in cell culture. The availability of clinically relevant isolates that replicate in cell culture will facilitate the development of broadly active HCV therapeutic agents.

https://openalex.org/W2088965506,"It is well known that intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) plays major roles in the maintenance of redox status and defense of oxidative stress. Ras, a small GTP-binding protein, may send growth-stimulating message to the nucleus through downstream Rac oncoprotein and superoxide (O(2*-)). These findings led us to investigate the effects of GSH and melatonin, a free-radical scavenger, on Ras-Rac-O(2*-)-related growth signal transduction. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of the inducible Ha-ras oncogene by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) increases the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS, including O(2*-) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))) and GSH in an Ha-ras-transformed NIH/3T3 fibroblast cell line. On the contrary, melatonin significantly suppresses ras-triggered cell growth by inhibiting the increase of ROS and GSH. Moreover, severe apoptosis of this transformed cell line occurred when the cell redox balance between ROS and GSH was dramatically changed in the presence of IPTG and L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO, a specific inhibitor of GSH synthetase). That BSO-induced cell apoptosis needs Ras to increase the ROS level was demonstrated by the free-radical scavenger melatonin. It effectively blocked cell apoptosis, but cell growth was also slowed without affecting Ras expression. Based on our studies, two approaches can be applied to treating ras-related cancers. One is utilizing melatonin to suppress cancer cell proliferation, and the other is utilizing BSO to induce cancer-cell apoptosis. Cotreatment of ras-related cancer cells with melatonin and BSO stops cell growth as well as apoptosis. Whether these cancer cells will undergo further regression or become recurrent merits investigation."

RSK is a serine/threonine kinase that is a substrate of ERK1/2 and lies downstream of the Raf/MEK/ERK protein cascade (1Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided insight into mechanisms responsible for activation of RSK1. RSK1 has two distinct domains, both of which are catalytically functional. Phosphorylation of RSK1 by ERK on the carboxyl-terminal catalytic loop activates the RSK1 carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. This induces a conformational change abrogating the negative effect of this domain, allowing activation of the amino-terminal kinase domain by PDK1 (2Richards S.A. Fu J. Romanelli A. Shimamura A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 810-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cellular localization is thought to be important in the regulation of RSK activity. Upon mitogen stimulation RSK undergoes a rapid and transient localization to the plasma membrane, which requires ERK docking and phosphorylation. At the plasma membrane PDK1 inputs as well as ERK- and PDK1-independent events lead to full activation of RSK (3Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Work in our laboratory has shown that NHE1 is activated by mitogens through phosphorylation of serine 703 by RSK (4Takahashi E.

Subsequently, 14-3-3β binds to this site and prevents dephosphorylation of serine 703 (17Lehoux S. Abe J. Florian J.A. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15794-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated whether RSK1 was also a binding partner for 14-3-3β because it contains a number of putative 14-3-3 interaction motifs. We found that 14-3-3β specifically interacts with RSK1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and the site of interaction was identified as serine 154. RSK-14-3-3β binding is maximal under quiescent conditions and upon mitogen stimulation; both RSK and 14-3-3β translocate to the plasma membrane where they presumably dissociate because binding to 14-3-3β is decreased. Furthermore, 14-3-3β binding is inhibitory to RSK activity, and RSK1S154A, which does not interact with 14-3-3, has increased activity both basally and upon mitogen stimulation. This study suggests an important role for 14-3-3β in the negative regulation of RSK kinase activity. RSK1 and 14-3-3β point mutations were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. GST-14-3-3β was a gift from A. J. Muslin (Washington University School of Medicine). 14-3-3β constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1Xpress/His vector (Invitrogen), and rat RSK1 was subcloned into pCMV-FLAG (Stratagene) or pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen). All of the constructs and mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Full-length rat p90RSK1 under control of the T7 promoter in pcDNA3.1/Myc-His was transcribed and translated in vitro using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The nascent protein was labeled using Transcend biotin-lysyl-tRNA (Promega). Briefly, 40 μl of TnT Quick Master Mix, 1 μl of methionine (1 mm), 1 μg of template DNA, and 1 μl of biotin-lysyl-tRNA were mixed in a final volume of 50 μl, incubated for 90 min at 30 °C, and immediately used for the binding assays. PS127A cells (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts that overexpress NHE1) were a gift from Dr. J. Pouyssegur (University of Nice, Nice, France). PS127A, NIH3T3, Cos7, and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 5% CO2, 95% O2 incubator at 37 °C. The cells were serum-starved (0% FBS) overnight prior to the experiments. The cell monolayers were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.4) and then scraped in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After a brief centrifugation, the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100 plus 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). The cells were sonicated for 20 s (in the case of pull-down studies) or needle-homogenized (in the case of coimmunoprecipitations), agitated on a rotating rocker at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble cellular debris. For some pull-down experiments, phosphatase treatment of cell lysates was performed by lysing cells in CIAP buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, plus 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture). The lysates were treated with or without 200 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Promega) at 37 °C for 1 h. Where indicated the inhibitors Na3VO4 (1 mm) and NaF (50 mm) were added. For coimmunoprecipitation studies, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged RSK1 and Xpress-tagged 14-3-3β. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by preclearing cell lysates with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz) for 1 h followed by incubation with anti-Xpress antibody for 3 h and with protein A/G-agarose for a further 1 h or M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads for 4 h. Pull-downs were performed by incubating 10 μg of GST-14-3-3β or GST-14-3-3β K49Q (produced as described previously (17Lehoux S. Abe J. Florian J.A. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15794-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)) bound to glutathione-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates and pull-downs were then washed four times with 1 ml of cell lysis buffer before the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. After heating at 95 °C for 3 min, the proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western analysis. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen), M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-RSK1 antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-14-3-3β antibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-NHE1 antibody (Chemicon), anti-phospho-RSK1 (Ser363) (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-phospho-RSK (Ser380) (which was a gift from Dr. C. Chrestensen, University of Virginia). Immunoreactive bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and enhanced chemiluminescence. The cell monolayers were rinsed and scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After a brief centrifugation the cells were resuspended in 750 μl of membrane fractionation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1:1000 protease inhibitor mixture). The lysates were prepared by needle homogenization and nuclei, and unbroken cells were pelleted at 850 × g for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein in postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to obtain soluble fractions and total membrane pellets. The soluble fraction was removed, and the membrane pellets were solubilized in 250 μl of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and rocked for 1 h at 4 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Twenty milliunits of recombinant RSK1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) overnight with 10 μg of GST-14-3-3β or GST-14-3-3βK49A. To initiate the kinase reaction, 10 μg of S6 peptide, 7.5 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the reaction was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by spotting 25 μl of the reaction onto P81 phosphocellulose filter paper. The filters were washed five times in 0.75% phosphoric acid and one time in acetone, and radioactive incorporation was determined by Cerenkov counting. HEK293 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with the activator plasmid for CREB (pFA2-CREB) and the reporter gene for luciferase (pFR-Luc) (Stratagene). A plasmid expressing the enzyme Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control (pRL-TK; Promega). After 24 h, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated as indicated. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase Reporter System (Promega) with a Wallac 1420 luminometer. The data are expressed as firefly luciferase normalized byRenilla luciferase activity. Cos7 cells seeded on glass coverslips were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-RSK1 using LipofectAMINE 2000. After 24 h the cells were serum-starved for a further 12 h and treated with 20% FBS. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% FBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were stained with anti-FLAG antibody to visualize RSK1 and anti-14-3-3β antibody and then incubated in secondary antibodies (Vector). The images were acquired using an Olympus IX70 Fluoview confocal microscope. Previously our laboratory has demonstrated a direct interaction between the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform NHE1 and 14-3-3β at serine 703, the site of NHE1 phosphorylation by RSK (17Lehoux S. Abe J. Florian J.A. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15794-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation by RSK on serine 703 is required for binding of the scaffolding protein 14-3-3 and RSK1 contains several putative 14-3-3-binding sites similar to the consensus 14-3-3-binding motif RSXpSXP, we investigated whether 14-3-3β could interact with RSK1. Indeed, we found that RSK1 from extracts of PS127 fibroblasts was able to bind 14-3-3β in vitro (Fig.1A). Previously, lysine 49 has been shown to be essential for interaction with 14-3-3-binding partners Bcr, Raf, and Cbl via a phosphoserine type interaction (18Wang H. Zhang L. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16297-16304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mutation of lysine 49 (K49A) in 14-3-3β abolished NHE1 interaction with 14-3-3 (17Lehoux S. Abe J. Florian J.A. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15794-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This mutation also abolished binding of RSK1 to 14-3-3β. In addition, GST alone was unable to bind to RSK1 (Fig.1A). To determine whether the interaction between 14-3-3β and RSK1 was direct, full-length RSK was synthesized by in vitrotranslation, and its ability to bind to GST-14-3-3β was determined.In vitro translated RSK bound avidly to GST-14-3-3β but bound weakly to GST-14-3-3β K49A (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate an in vivo interaction between RSK1 and 14-3-3β in mammalian cells, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-RSK1 and Xpress-14-3-3β. Xpress-14-3-3β immunoprecipitates were prepared, and their ability to interact with RSK1 was examined by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1C (middle panels), 14-3-3β interacted with RSK1 in vivo. The reverse immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C, right panels) demonstrates that FLAG-RSK1 can also coprecipitate 14-3-3β. Many interactions with 14-3-3 are dependent on binding partner phosphorylation. To determine whether this is also the case for the RSK1–14-3-3β interaction, PS127 cell lysates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at 37 °C before GST-14-3-3β pull-down. As shown in Fig.2A, phosphatase treatment (CIAP) inhibited the binding of RSK to 14-3-3β in the absence but not the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Hence dephosphorylation of RSK1 abolished its ability to bind 14-3-3β. In support of this conclusion, treatment of intact cells with the broad spectrum serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine also decreased the binding of RSK1 to GST-14-3-3β in vitro (Fig. 2B). Binding to 14-3-3 proteins is usually mediated via a RSXpSXP or RXXXpSXP consensus motif (12Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 13Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). RSK1 contains a number of putative 14-3-3β binding sites as shown in Fig.3A(RLS154KEV, RLGS307GP, RDS363PGI, RGFS380FV, RDPS457EE, REAS513FV, RIS630S631GK, and RKLPS732TT). RSK1 constructs with indicated serine to alanine point mutations were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and the possible involvement of these motifs in the RSK1–14-3-3β interaction was investigated using GST-14-3-3β pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. Pull-down experiments demonstrated that mutation of S154A within the motif RLS(154)KEV strongly reduced RSK1–14-3-3β interaction, whereas the other mutations had little or no effect (Fig. 3B). Coimmunoprecipitation confirmed that RSK1S154A no longer bound to 14-3-3β in vivo (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that RSK1 interacts with 14-3-3β through phosphorylated serine 154. Because serum stimulates RSK1 activity, which then activates NHE1 through phosphorylation of serine 703 (increasing the NHE1–14-3-3 interaction) (4Takahashi E. Abe J. Gallis B. Aebersold R. Spring D.J. Krebs E.G. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20206-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Lehoux S. Abe J. Florian J.A. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15794-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of serum on the RSK1–14-3-3β interaction. PS127 fibroblasts were stimulated with 20% serum, and RSK association with GST-14-3-3β was determined in a pull-down assay. Binding of RSK1 to 14-3-3β was decreased by 34.6 ± 7.5% in cells stimulated for 5 min, 36.2 ± 4.1% at 10 min, and 28.2 ± 6.5% at 20 min (p < 0.05; Fig. 4, A and B). This effect was also observed in HEK293 cells and Cos7 cells overexpressing exogenous RSK1 (data not shown). Preincubating PS127 cells for 30 min with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (30 μm), which prevents agonist-stimulated ERK1/2 and RSK activation, reversed this inhibition (Fig. 4, A and B). As a control, NHE1 interaction with GST-14-3-3β was verified. Binding of GST-14-3-3β to NHE1 was stimulated by serum, and this stimulation was significantly inhibited by PD98059 treatment (Fig. 4C, especially at 10 and 20 min). 14-3-3 proteins function as scaffolding proteins and have been shown to affect the subcellular localization of interacting proteins (reviewed in Refs. 7Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholarand 14van Hemert M.J. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). For example, 14-3-3 can sequester proteins in the cytosol and/or target them to the plasma membrane. RSK1 has previously been shown to be located in the cytosol under basal conditions and to translocate to the plasma membrane after stimulation where it becomes fully activated (3Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7470-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the subcellular distribution of 14-3-3β and RSK1 before and after serum stimulation using subcellular fractionation in PS127 fibroblasts. In the absence of serum, RSK1 and 14-3-3β were predominantly localized in the cytosol. After stimulation with 20% fetal calf serum for 5 min, there was a significant translocation of both 14-3-3β and RSK1 to the membrane fraction (Fig. 5A) In contrast, the distribution of actin was unchanged after fetal calf serum treatment (Fig. 5A). This translocation also occurred with endogenous RSK and 14-3-3β in NIH3T3 cells and in HEK293 cells expressing exogenous RSK (data not shown). To demonstrate colocalization of RSK1 and 14-3-3β in intact cells, Cos7 cells were transfected with FLAG-RSK1, and RSK1 and 14-3-3β were visualized by immunofluoresence staining with anti-FLAG antibody and anti-14-3-3β, antibody respectively (Fig.6). In unstimulated Cos7 cells, RSK1 and 14-3-3β appeared diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm with significant colocalization (Fig. 6A). In cells stimulated with 20% fetal calf serum for 5 min, both 14-3-3β and RSK1 translocated to the periphery of the cells (Fig. 6B). Overlaying the two images demonstrated significant colocalization, which was greatest at the plasma membrane (Fig. 6B). It is possible that RSK1 binding to 14-3-3 could either increase or decrease kinase activity based on previous reports (reviewed in Ref. 14van Hemert M.J. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Because overexpressing a dominant negative 14-3-3 construct in cells would inhibit the Raf-MEK1-ERK pathway (20Xing H. Zhang S. Weinheimer C. Kovacs A. Muslin A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and therefore decrease RSK kinase activity, it was not satisfactory to perform this experiment. Therefore, we determined the effect of incubating active recombinant RSK1 with 14-3-3β in vitro. Recombinant RSK1 was preincubated with GST alone, GST-14-3-3β K49Q, or GST-14-3-3β for 4 h, and then a kinase assay was performed using S6 peptide as the substrate. The activity of RSK1 in the presence of GST-14-3-3β was significantly reduced by ∼50% as compared with GST alone or GST-14-3-3β K49Q (Fig. 7A). This finding suggests that binding of RSK1 to 14-3-3 may suppress RSK1 activity in vivo. To assess the functional significance of the RSK-14-3-3 bindingin vivo, we compared the kinase activity of wild type RSK1 to the non-14-3-3β-binding RSK1S154A mutant using a luciferase reporter assay system to measure the activity of CREB. CREB is activated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and by all three members of the RSK family (RSK1–3) in cells stimulated by activators of the Ras/MEK/ERK1/2 cascade (21Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 22Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 23Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7B, CREB activity in cells expressing RSK1 wild type (RSK1WT) was increased after serum stimulation. However, in cells overexpressing RSKS154A, there was an 80% increase in CREB basal activity and a 114% increase in serum-stimulated activity relative to RSK1WT. This suggests that 14-3-3 binding to RSKS154 inhibits RSK activity both basally and after activation with serum. We next investigated the effect of the RSK1S154A mutation on EGF-stimulated CREB activity. The cells were transfected with RSK1WT or RSK1S154A and stimulated for 6 h with different concentrations of EGF, after which CREB activity was measured. In cells transfected with RSK1S154A, the EGF dose-response curve was significantly shifted to the left compared with cells expressing RSK1WT (EC50 of 1 ng/ml versus 6 ng/ml; Fig.7C), demonstrating that 14-3-3β binding inhibits EGF-stimulated RSK1 activity and thus CREB activation. The increased CREB activity in cells transfected with RSK1S154Aversus those transfected with RSK1WT combined with the finding that 14-3-3β and RSK1 interact maximally under basal conditions suggest that 14-3-3β inhibits RSK1 by preventing its activation rather than by interfering with RSK1-substrate interaction. To verify this hypothesis we used phospho-specific antibodies targeting two phosphorylation sites on RSK1, Ser380 and Ser363. Ser380 is autophosphorylated basally, and it is further phosphorylated by the carboxyl-terminal RSK1 kinase domain upon docking and activation by ERK (1Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 2Richards S.A. Fu J. Romanelli A. Shimamura A. Blenis J. Curr.

Ser363 phosphorylation is thought to occur subsequently, after translocation of the RSK-ERK complex to the plasma membrane (3Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7470-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We found that in RSK1S154A constructs, phosphorylation of both Ser380 and Ser363 was increased basally (by 27.3 ± 2.6% and 137.9 ± 10.6% respectively,n = 3) and after 5 min of serum stimulation (by 35.9 ± 3.9 and 28.1 ± 2.8%, respectively,n = 3; Fig. 8,A and B), compared with RSK1WT. These data demonstrate that 14-3-3 inhibits the activation of RSK1. Because full activation of RSK requires plasma membrane translocation (3Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7470-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the increased activity of RSK1S154A suggested an increase in the amount of this mutant at the plasma membrane compared with RSK1WT. Therefore, we performed subcellular fractionation in HEK293 cells overexpressing RSK1WT or RSK1S154A. The amount of RSK1S154A in the membrane fraction under basal conditions was increased by 28.3 ± 2.9% (p < 0.05) as compared with RSK1WT, whereas upon serum stimulation the relative amounts of RSK1WT and mutant in the membrane fraction were similar (Fig.9, A and B). The major finding of the present study is that the serine/threonine kinase RSK1 is a 14-3-3-interacting protein whose activity is negatively regulated by 14-3-3. The association between RSK and 14-3-3β was demonstrated by (i) the ability of a GST-14-3-3β fusion protein to bind RSK1 from cell lysates, (ii) direct binding ofin vitro translated RSK1 to GST-14-3-3β, and (iii) coprecipitation of transfected 14-3-3β and RSK1.

Mutations in the parkin gene cause a loss-of-function and/or alter protein levels of parkin. As a result, the toxic build-up of parkin substrates is thought to lead to autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism. To identify a role for the ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) of parkin, we created a number of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged parkin constructs using mutational and structural information. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry showed a much stronger expression level for HA-parkin residues 77–465 (without ULD) than HA-parkin full-length (with ULD). The deletion of ULD in Drosophila parkin also caused a sharp increase in expression of the truncated form, suggesting that the function of the ULD of parkin is conserved across species. By progressive deletion analysis of parkin ULD, we found that residues 1–6 of human parkin play a crucial role in controlling the expression levels of this gene. HA-parkin residues 77–465 showed ubiquitination in vivo, demonstrating that the ULD is not critical for parkin auto-ubiquitination; ubiquitination seemed to cluster on the central domain of parkin (residues 77–313). These effects were specific for the ULD of parkin and not transfection-, toxic-, epitope tag-, and/or vector-dependent. Taken together, these data suggest that the 76 most NH2-terminal residues (ULD) dramatically regulate the protein levels of parkin.

Parkin has been suggested to be an E3 ligase and, in combination with its E1 and E2 enzyme partners, may be involved in the polyubiquitination of substrate proteins (8Haass C. Kahle P.J.

Parkin is thought not to directly ubiquitinate substrate proteins but rather act as a “docking station” for the coming together of its substrates and appropriate E2 enzymes allowing the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to the target protein. Polyubiquitination of proteins is a priming event for protein degradation via the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6903) Google Scholar, 13Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). The lack of parkin function (i.e. mutation in both alleles) is thought to lead to the progressive accumulation of it substrates leading to cell stress, degeneration, and eventually death of dopaminergic neurons (7Kahle P.J. Leimer U. Haass C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 524-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Human parkin is 465 amino acids in length (∼52 kDa) with its residues 1–76 forming a ubiquitin homology-like domain (ULD) that shares 62% homology to ubiquitin and may be involved in target protein recognition (14Shimura H.

Parkin has also been shown to interact with actin filaments but not microtublues in COS1 cells (23Huynh D.P. Scoles D.R. Ho T.H. Del Bigio M.R. Pulst S.M. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), to bind actin and the actin-binding protein, filamin (24Choi P. Passer B. Farrer M. D'Adamio L. Sparkman D. Lee J.M. Wolozin B.

Hattori N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to ubiquitination of its substrates, parkin is also known to catalyze its own ubiquitination and proteasomal-mediated degradation, thus regulating its own cellular levels (11Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 26Choi P. Ostrerova-Golts N. Sparkman D.

Nevertheless, a set of studies have shown that E2 enzymes, UbcH7 and UbcH8, interact with the RING-IBR-RING domain parkin and are involved in the ubiquitination of parkin substrates (9Imai Y. Soda M.

Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2635-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More specifically, in one report both UbcH7 and UbcH8 were shown to bind to parkin with equal affinities (20Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Another group have isolated a parkin-UbcH7 complex from human brain (10Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) and showed that UbcH8 weakly binds parkin (14Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). A third report suggested that parkin only interacts with UbcH8 and that the low expression level of UbcH7 in brain makes it less physiological relevant for interaction with parkin (11Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Finally, in yeast two-hybrid studies UbcH7 has been shown to interact with a human homologue of Drosophila ariadne (HHARI) and UbcH7-associated protein 1 (H7-AP1) (16Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F. Scheffner M. Robinson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30963-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Ardley H.C. Tan N.G. Rose S.A. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19640-19647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both HHARI and H7-AP1 contain a RING-IBR-RING domain and together with parkin constitute a family of parkin/aridine like ubiquitin ligases (PAULs) (7Kahle P.J. Leimer U. Haass C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 524-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In these studies, the weak interaction between parkin-UbcH8 and HHARI-UbcH8 was suggested not to be physiologically relevant (17Ardley H.C. Tan N.G. Rose S.A. Markham A.F. Robinson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19640-19647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The structural domains within parkin that may regulate its expression and/or self-ubiquitination have not been clearly investigated. In addition, the E2 enzymes involved in parkin ubiquitination and control its degradation rate also remain unclear. Our present study investigates some of the factors that may control cellular protein levels of parkin. Here, we demonstrate that the ULD of parkin, specifically its first six residues, is important for regulating protein levels of parkin in the cell. These data suggest that residues 77–313 of parkin play an important role in self-ubiquitination. cDNA fragments of parkin (human clone AB009973; Drosophila cloneAE003593) corresponding to the residues indicated in Fig. 1 were amplified using PCR and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) or into the Sf9/baculovirus GST tag expression vector pGEX-PreScission (Amersham Biosciences) by standard cloning procedures. Amino acid residue mutations and deletions were introduced in human parkin cDNA using QuikChangeTMkit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). A hemagglutinin (HA) or a Myc epitope tag was added to the NH2 terminus of human parkin or Drosophila parkin, respectively. Similar procedures were used for the creation of Myc-UbcH7 (human clone X92962) and Myc-UbcH8 (human clone AF031141) mammalian expression constructs. Isolation of all DNA from transformed Escherichia coli was performed using Qiagen plasmid kits (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). The integrity of constructs was verified by DNA sequencing as described by manufactures (Applied Biosystems-PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). HEK-293 cells were grown in 80-cm2 flasks using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 culture media (3.151 g/liter glucose, with 0.524 g/liter l-alanyl-l-glutamine (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Amimed, Basel, Switzerland) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. HEK-293 cells were transfected as described previously (27Dev K.K. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. Neuropharmacol. 1999; 38: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) with 0.5–1 μg each plasmid DNA in the presence of Opti-MEM using LipofectAMINE/PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were used ∼48 h after transfection. For expression analysis the cells were scraped from multiwell plates, the cell pellets solubilized in 50–100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the samples (10–20 μl) denatured. Electrophoretic separation was carried out on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (BioWhittaker, Allschwill, Switzerland) as described previously (27Dev K.K. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. Neuropharmacol. 1999; 38: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The blots were developed either by incubating in alkaline phosphatase buffer (Promega), and immunoreactivity was visualized as a blue-purple color or by incubating in enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) supersignal west femto substrate reagent (Pierce, Bonn, Germany) and then exposed to film and developed. For immunocytochemistry, transfected HEK-293 cells were grown on coverslips and immunocytochemistry performed as described previously (27Dev K.K. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. Neuropharmacol. 1999; 38: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabibit primary antibodies include anti-parkin (AbCam, Cambridge, UK), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-ubiquitin (Calbiochem, Schwalbach, Germany). Monoclonal mouse primary antibodies include anti-Myc (Oncogen, Boston, MA) and anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies that were alkaline phosphatase-conjugated were goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) and goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega). The secondary antibodies that were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated were goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). The secondary antibodies used in immunocytochemistry were Texas Red-X goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or Texas Red-X goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). All antibodies were used at dilutions recommended by the manufacturer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using serum bovine albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad, Munchen, Germany). The parkin gene (PARK2) was identified by positional cloning from genetic materials donated by Japanese families affected by ARJP (2Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). It was shown that ARJP has a recessive mode of inheritance where both alleles of parkin are mutated (4Mizuno Y. Hattori N. Matsumine H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To date several mutations in parkin have been linked to ARJP (2Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y.

Sci. 2000; 25: 524-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We generated a number of parkin constructs to examine the function of the parkin domains and the effects of disease-causing mutations on parkin expression (Fig.1 A). When equivalent amounts of cDNA were transfected we found that cellular levels of NH2-terminal HA-tagged full-length parkin, HA-parkin-FL, proteins (either wild type or mutants) were too low for detection by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, all the constructs where residues 1–76 (ULD) were removed, HA-parkin-77 deletion mutants, showed high levels of expression in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1 B). None of the point mutations tested were found to significantly alter the expression levels of HA-parkin-FL or HA-parkin-77. The self-ubiquitination of parkin is an event that controls parkin degradation rates (14Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar, 24Choi P. Passer B. Farrer M. D'Adamio L. Sparkman D. Lee J.M. Wolozin B. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2000; 26: 13.11Google Scholar). In some reports, overexpressed parkin has been found ubiquitinated in vivo (20Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), while in other studies parkin was not ubiquitinated (14Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). To explain these results, it has been suggested that the higher expression levels of parkin lead to the better detection of ubiquitinated parkin (20Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of full-length parkin is ∼52 kDa, the mass of HA-parkin-77 is ∼43 kDa, and the molecular mass of ubiquitin is ∼8.5 kDa. In our study, HA-parkin-77-expressed proteins showed band sizes corresponding to the molecular masses of native (∼43 kDa) and monoubiquitinated (∼51 kDa) HA-parkin-77 (Fig. 1 B). We also detected band smears for some (but not all) HA-parkin-77 proteins, indicating these band patterns are specific for particular forms of HA-parkin-77 (Fig. 1 B). Of interest, when HA-parkin-77-transfected cells were resuspended, sonicated, and rotated in PT×E buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4; see Ref. 27Dev K.K. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. Neuropharmacol. 1999; 38: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), these band patterns were found predominantly in the cell pellet fraction as compared with the cell sonicate. As reported previously, we suggest these high molecular weight band patterns to represent polyubiquitinated parkin (20Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Specifically, we found HA-parkin constructs encoding only the central domain and RING1 (residues 77–313) were mono- and polyubiquitinated, whereas those encoding the central domain alone (residues 77–237) were mono- but not polyubiquitinated (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, this data indicate that residues 1–76 (the ULD) of parkin regulate its protein levels, and as a result the high protein levels of HA-parkin-77 lead to elevated ubiquitination. Furthermore, the removal of the ULD of parkin does not significantly alter parkin ubiquitination and that parkin polyubiquitination requires the presence of central and RING1 domains but not the ULD. To examine the effects of UbcH7 and UbcH8 on the protein levels and ubiquitination of parkin we co-expressed them with UbcH7 or UbcH8. Overexpression of UbcH7 or UbcH8 appeared neither to increase parkin ubiquitination nor to regulate the expression of HA-parkin-FL or HA-parkin-77 (data not shown). Interestingly, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 also showed no significant effects on the expression levels of HA-parkin-FL or HA-parkin-77 (data not shown). These results suggest that the ubiquitination of parkin may be associated with a regulation of its function rather than proteolysis-associated ubiquitination or that proteolysis-associated ubiquitination of overexpressed HA-parkin-FL or HA-parkin-77 may not be the (only) mechanism controlling their cellular protein levels. Next, we performed a number of in vitro ubiquitination assays to identify E2 enzymes involved in the auto-ubiquitination of HA-parkin-77. Despite observing the ubiquitination of p27 (as control), we did not observe any evidence of parkin self-ubiquitination using the E2 enzyme UbcH7 or other E2 enzymes UbcH2, -3, -5a, -5b, -6, -7, and -10 (data not shown). These results are in agreement with a previous report suggesting that UbcH7, and perhaps UbcH8, are involved in parkin-substrate ubiquitination, but these two enzymes do not directly affect parkin self-ubiquitination (20Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). We also attempted to clarify conflicting data from previous studies suggesting that parkin interacts with only UbcH7, or UbcH8, or both (11Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In yeast two-hybrid assays (and co-immunoprecipitation studies) we were unable to observe any specific interaction between parkin and UbcH7 or UbcH8, despite identifying novel interacting proteins for full-length parkin (parkin-FL) in a large-scale yeast two-hybrid study. 2K.

Interestingly, in yeast two-hybrid studies, we found that the NH2-terminal deletion mutant parkin 77–465 (but not parkin-FL or parkin 1–76) showed a strong activation of β-galactosidase, suggesting that residues 1–76 of parkin may also play a negative role in gene transcription (data not shown). In agreement, parkin has been suggested to play a role in transcription and/or in ubiquitinating a nuclear substrate (28Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Numerous investigators have successfully expressed full-length wild type and mutant parkin using different tags in HEK-293 cells and neuroblastoma cells (18Fallon L. Moreau F. Croft B.G. Labib N.

Within these studies, some differences have been noted in terms of E2 enzymes that interact with parkin and the ubiquitination of overexpressed parkin (compare Refs. 10Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). These differences have previously been linked, in part, to unknown cell type-specific factor(s), possibly E2 enzymes, co-factors, and/or associated proteins (20Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Although reasons for the poor expression of HA-parkin-FL is presently unclear, our current studies have enabled to detect differences between HA-parkin-FL and HA-parkin-77 and thus determine the effects of ULD on parkin expression. To further validate our hypothesis that the ULD of parkin plays a role in regulating its cellular protein levels, we have performed a number of control experiments. First, as control, we observed a single, specific, and antibody concentration-dependent band for native full-length parkin in a variety of cell types and brain tissue regions (Fig.2 A). Of note, we did not find endogenous full-length parkin to be ubiquitinated (Fig. 2 A). Second, to determine whether the differences in HA-parkin-77 and HA-parkin-FL protein expression were due to differences in transfection methods, we tested a number of transfection protocols (Fig.2 B). LipofectAMINE and NeuroPorter transfection complex mixtures gave similar results showing that HA-parkin-77 was highly expressed compared with that of HA-parkin-FL and that these results were not due to differences in transfection methods (Fig.2 B). Third, to exclude the possibility that lack of parkin-FL expression is not epitope tag- and/or vector type-dependent, we tested the role of ULD in a Myc-tagged Drosophila parkin. In HEK-293 cells, we found that Drosophila Myc-parkin-FL showed no expression whereas Drosophila Myc-parkin-93 (lacking the ULD, residues 1–92) showed high expression levels (Fig.2 B). Finally, to confirm that the lack of parkin-FL expression was not due to detection problems caused by our parkin gene sequence or by antibody recognition, we used a large batch non-mammalian cellular expression system. Using Sf9/baculovirus expression, we still found that GST-parkin-FL was poorly expressed as compared with GST-parkin-77 (Fig. 2 C). However, by using large culture volumes and affinity purification we were able to observe small amounts of GST-parkin-FL, further indicating that the differences in GST-parkin-77 and GST-parkin-FL are not due to the epitope tag and/or vector type used (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these results indicate that the ULD of parkin is responsible for controlling not only the protein levels of human parkin but alsoDrosophila parkin and that these effects are not dependent on the epitope tags and/or vectors used. To further examine the role of the ULD of parkin, we performed immunocytochemistry to observe the distribution patterns of parkin 77–465 on a single cell level and to determine any low level expression of parkin-FL. In HEK cells, the distribution pattern of endogenous parkin was found to be diffuse and cytoplasmic (Fig.2 D). No oddities (for example clusters, endoplasmic reticulum retention, and/or nuclear build up) were found in the distribution patterns of transfected HA-tagged human parkin constructs (Fig. 2 D). In agreement with Western blotting results, in these studies, we found low protein levels of HA-parkin-FL as compared with the high expression levels of HA-parkin-77. Similar results were found using Myc-tagged Drosophila parkin, where full-length Myc-parkin showed a lower expression level as compared with Myc-parkin-93 (Fig. 2 D). As control, the E2 enzymes showed similar expression levels as human HA-parkin-77 and Drosophila Myc-parkin-93, indicating that expression was not non-specifically dependent on the used vector or epitope tag (Fig. 2 D). To test for differences in toxicity between HA-parkin-FL and HA-parkin-77, we also determined whether transient expression of HA-parkin-FL and HA-parkin-77 altered cell viability. HA-parkin constructs, together with a luciferase reporter plasmid, were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells. Cellular viability was quantified in terms of luciferase activity. When compared with empty pCI vector-transfected cells (taken as 100%), HA-parkin-FL (138 ± 12%) and HA-parkin-77 (134 ± 13%) had no drastic effects on cellular viability and in some cases showed a slight protective effect as suggested previously by other reports (9Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 20Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 15042-15047Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast the transfection of Bax cDNA (15 ± 2%) and caspase cDNA (2 ± 0) into HEK-293 cells resulted in cellular death. These results indicate that differences in HA-parkin-FL and HA-parkin-77 expression cannot be explained by some intrinsic cytotoxicity related to these expression constructs (data not shown). To further characterize the exact site within the ULD of parkin responsible for controlling its protein levels, a series of progressive deletion mutants within the ULD of parkin were created and tested for expression (Fig.3 A). Using the same concentrations of cDNA for transfections, we found that removal of the first six residues, namely MIVFVR, of parkin (see deletion constructs Δ1 or Δ1a) resulted in its expression detectable by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, any parkin construct encoding the first 6 residues showed no detectable expression (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the first 6 residues of the ULD of mammalian parkin play an important role in regulating its protein levels. Since the ULD of Drosophila parkin also appears to regulate its expression levels similar to that seen for the ULD of its human counterpart (Fig. 2 B), we searched for this motif in Drosophila. Although this linear epitope is conserved in human, mouse, and rat sequences of parkin, it was not found in the Drosophila parkin (residues 1–6 correspond to MLELLQ). Interestingly, Drosophila parkin also lacks the PDZ binding motif found at the extreme carboxyl terminus of human, mouse, and rat sequences of parkin. This PDZ binding motif is thought to be critical for parkin interaction with CASK (18Fallon L. Moreau F. Croft B.G. Labib N. Gu W.J. Fon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 486-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore it appears that Drosophila parkin has some (but not complete) identity in its structural/functional domains as compared with mammalian parkin. Taken together, we propose that the ULD (although variable in sequence) is likely to have a conserved function through evolution in terms of regulating parkin levels in the cell. In summary, in this study we identify two structural/functional domains within parkin, namely the ULD (residues 1–76, specifically the MIVFVR epitope) as a site that controls parkin expression and the central + RING1 domain (residues 77–313) as a site that plays a role in parkin ubiquitination. The molecular mechanism regulating parkin protein levels is not well understood. We propose that the ULD of parkin could play a role in protein-protein interaction events where this domain is recognized either directly or indirectly by an associated protein that targets parkin for proteolysis. Under normal conditions, polyubiqutination of parkin could alter proteins interacting with parkin, modulate parkin function, and/or regulate the rate parkin proteolysis. In disease or under experimental conditions an altered ULD may result in parkin no longer being recognized by accessory protein(s) and/or being degraded and thus leading to changes of parkin protein levels in the cell.

Conflicting reports exist concerning the interaction between FGFR1 and Src family kinases. To address the role of c-Src in FGFR1 signaling, we compared proliferative responses of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in c-Src, Yes, and Fyn to MEF expressing either endogenous levels or overexpressing c-Src. MEF with endogenous c-Src had significantly greater FGF-induced DNA synthesis and proliferation than cells lacking or overexpressing c-Src. This was related directly to c-Src expression by analysis of c-Src-deficient cells transfected with and sorted for varying levels of a c-Src expression vector. This suggests an “optimal” quantity of c-Src expression for FGF-induced proliferation. To determine if this was a general phenomenon for growth factor signaling pathways utilizing c-Src, responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were examined. As for FGF, responses to EGF were clearly inhibited when c-Src was absent or overexpressed. In contrast, varying levels of c-Src had little effect on responses to PDGF or LPA. The data show that mitogenic pathways activated by FGF-1 and EGF are regulated by c-Src protein levels and appear to differ significantly from those activated by PDGF and LPA.

The FGF signaling pathway also plays a significant role in normal development, and increased FGF production is associated with chronic immunologic injury as well as tumor development and metastasis (4Zhao X.M. Frist W.H. Yeoh T.K. Miller G.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 992-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Miller G.G. Davis S.F. Atkinson J.B. Chomsky D.B. Pedroso P. Reddy V.S.

Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such a diverse array of biological effects occurs through ligand interaction with high affinity cell surface receptors (FGFR1–4) that are structurally similar and exhibit a high degree of sequence homology at the amino acid level (3Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 7Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The full-length FGFR exhibits three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a split intracellular tyrosine kinase domain (7Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Ligand binding causes receptor dimerization allowing transautophosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues and activation of intrinsic kinase activity (8Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Activation of FGFR1 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple signaling and adaptor proteins, including FRS2 (FGF receptor substrate 2/SNT-1), Shc, Grb2, Ras/Raf, Crk, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP-2, and Src (reviewed in Ref. 9Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: d165-d177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A constitutive association of the multidocking protein FRS2 at the juxtamembrane segment of FGFR1 occurs independently of receptor activation (10Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Interaction of FRS2 with Ras is associated with cell cycle progression (11Kouhara H.

Numerous other studies provide evidence that FGF activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway contributes mainly to cellular proliferation and differentiation (10Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R.

Multiple studies have demonstrated activation of the non-receptor Src family tyrosine kinase members in response to activated FGFR (14Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Landgren E. Klint P. Yokote K. Claesson-Welsh L.

An association of c-Src and FGFR1 has been reported by immunoprecipitation of recombinant receptor (14Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, this finding has not been reported elsewhere. Transient exposure of 3T3 cells to FGF-1 induces continuous activation of the Src kinase pathway, which in turn stimulates increases in the level of c-myc (12LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, Landgren et al. (17Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2027-2035PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that mutation of FGFR1 tyrosine residue 766 to phenylalanine causes an increase in activation of Src family members, suggesting a regulatory role of protein kinase C in Src activation. The involvement of c-Src in migration of rat bladder carcinoma cells and murine fibroblasts in response to FGF-1 has also been reported (12LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Rodier J.M. Valles A.M. Denoyelle M. Thiery J.P. Boyer B. J.

Similarly, the direct association of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-Src in an SH3-dependent manner suggests that these intracellular signaling proteins may act in concert downstream of FGFR1 to co-ordinate cellular motility (20Fincham V.J. Brunton V.B. Frame M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6518-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The nine known Src family kinase members exhibit functional redundancy as evident from mice that are homozygous deficient for singleversus multiple Src kinases. The predominant abnormality of Src−/− mice is osteopetrosis (21Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar) and mice deficient in other individual Src family kinases exhibit mild phenotypes (reviewed in Ref. 22Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), whereas multiply deficient animals demonstrate severe phenotypes or lethality (23Stein P.L. Vogel H. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1999-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). With such overlap in function, it is difficult to delineate the exact role of Src family kinases in FGFR signaling. Therefore, the absence of one family member may not eliminate FGFR-induced biological responses if other members are available to compensate. To assess the role of c-Src in cells with physiologic levels of FGFR1, we examined the effect of varying levels of c-Src expression on FGF-1-induced proliferation of murine embryonic fibroblasts deficient for Yes and Fyn. These fibroblasts express either no c-Src, endogenous levels, or 10-fold excess c-Src (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Cells with endogenous levels of c-Src exhibited enhanced proliferation to FGF when compared with c-Src-deficient cells. Unexpectedly, overexpression of c-Src also inhibited FGF-1-proliferative responses. These findings were confirmed using deficient cells that were transfected and sorted by FACS for varying levels of c-Src. Similarly, endogenous levels of c-Src resulted in maximal response to EGF while overexpression was inhibitory. In contrast, cell growth in response to PDGF was minimally affected by c-Src overexpression. The data suggest that these two classes of growth factors differ in their regulation of MEF-proliferative responses by c-Src. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) deficient in c-Src, Yes, and Fyn (SYF) were obtained from the ATCC and kindly provided by Dr. Graham Carpenter, Vanderbilt University. Src++ (MEF deficient for Yes and Fyn with endogenous c-Src expression) and cSrc (SYF cells deficient for Yes and Fyn but overexpressing c-Src) cells were obtained from the ATCC. Src4 cells (SYF cells transfected to express endogenous levels of c-Src protein comparable to Src++ cells) were kindly provided by Dr. Leslie Cary, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. These MEF have been described previously and were also determined to be deficient in Lck and Lyn (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P.

Total RNA was isolated from fibroblasts using TRI Reagent® (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 ॖg of total RNA using oligo-dT and SUPERSCRIPT RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Each PCR reaction contained cDNA equivalent to 80 ng of template DNA. FGFR1 transcripts were detected using oligonucleotide PCR primers designed to amplify the transmembrane and kinase domains of hFGFR1 as previously described (4Zhao X.M. Frist W.H. Yeoh T.K.

Sense (5′-GAC AA(A/G) GA(G/A) ATG GAG GTG CT-3′) and antisense (5′-GTT (G/A)TA GCA GTA (T/C)TC CAG CC-3′) primers each exhibited 907 homology to the murine sequences (human/mouse). FGFR2 transcripts were detected using oligonucleotide primers designed against the transmembrane and kinase domains of hFGFR2. Sense (5′-GTC CAT CAA (T/C)CA CAC (G/C)TA CCA CCT G-3′) and antisense (5′-AAT CAT CTT CAT CAT CTC CAT CTC T-3′) primers were used as previously described (4Zhao X.M. Frist W.H. Yeoh T.K. Miller G.G.

All PCR reactions included H2O only (no DNA) as a negative control. The housekeeping transcript glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a positive control of RNA expression and was amplified over 30 cycles using sense (5′-ATC GAG CTC ATC CCA TCA CCA TCT TCC AGG-3′) and antisense (5′-ACA TCT AGA GCC ATC ACG CCA CAG TTT CCC-3′) primers. Amplified products were analyzed by separation on 17 agarose gels containing 0.4 ॖg/ml ethidium bromide. FGFR1 expression at the cell surface was detected by FACS analysis using a modified method of enzymatic amplification staining (Flow-Amp Systems, Ltd.).

Cells were collected by brief microcentrifugation and rapidly washed with PBS containing 250 ॖg/ml heparin to remove ligand from low affinity cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding sites. Samples were subsequently incubated with HRP-anti-human IgG (diluted 1:200 in 27 BSA/PBS) for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were collected by microcentrifugation, washed with PBS, and stained with Flow-Amp EAS amplifier and Streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were fixed in 17 paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. Whole cell lysates (20 ॖg/lane) from MEF cultures incubated in the presence or absence of FGF-1 (10 ng/ml) were separated by 107 SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon nitrocellulose (Millipore) for protein immunodetection. The anti-Src clone GD11 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, membranes were blocked for 20 min at RT in 37 milk/PBS and antibody was diluted 1:1000 in block solution for membrane incubation overnight at 4 °C. The PY20 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used at 1:1000 in 17 BSA/TBS-T (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.17 Tween 20) for 1 h at RT. Flg (C-15) rabbit polyclonal anti-FGFR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:500 in 57 nonfat dry milk/TBS-T for 1 h of membrane incubation at RT. Blots were subsequently incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (HRP)-goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon International) or HRP-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) diluted 1:5000 in the appropriate block solution for 45 min at RT. Protein bands of interest were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Membranes were stripped for 30 min at 70 °C using stripping solution (62.5 mmTris (pH 6.8), 27 SDS, and 100 mm औ-mercaptoethanol) for reprobing with relevant antibodies. SYF cells were plated at 2.5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottom plates. Src++ and cSrc cells were plated at 1.25 × 103 cells per well. Cultures were incubated in 107 FBS/DMEM for 24 h, washed with sterile PBS, and serum-starved in 0.17 FBS/DMEM overnight. Cells were subsequently incubated for 22 h in 0.27 BSA/DMEM with 10 units/ml heparin supplemented with either FGF-1, EGF (R&D Systems), PDGF-B (R&D Systems), or LPA (Sigma) as indicated. [3H]Thymidine was added at 1 ॖCi/well for the final 17 h of culture, and incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Experiments were performed four times. For each condition, the mean incorporation of six wells was determined and normalized as a -fold increase over the basal average ± S.E. For experiments comparing various growth factors, cell lines were plated at equal density (1.25 × 103 cells per well) for thymidine incorporation. Data are expressed as mean incorporation (total counts per minute) ± S.E. of six individual wells. MEF cells were plated in 24-well dishes at 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 107 FBS/DMEM. After 24 h the media was aspirated and the cells were washed with SF-DMEM. Cultures were incubated in 0.27 BSA/DMEM supplemented with 10 units/ml heparin ± FGF-1, EGF, PDGF-B (all at 10 ng/ml), or 107 FBS for 5 days. Unless otherwise specified, cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, collected by microcentrifugation, and resuspended in 107 FBS/DMEM for visual counting every day. Culture media was replaced at day 3 of stimulation. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. The pLSXH.mSrc retroviral vector containing mouse non-neuronal Src (mSrc) was made by Dr. Lionel Arnaud and kindly provided by Dr. Leslie Cary, both of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, WA). The mSrc sequence was excised from pLSXH by BamHI digestion and ligated to the BamHI sites of pIRES2-EGFP expression vector (Clontech, kindly provided by Dr. David Piston, Vanderbilt University) (mSrc.EGFP). SYF cells were grown to 707 confluency in 75-cm2 plastic tissue culture flasks and transiently transfected with empty vector or mSrc.EGFP DNA using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, DNA incubated with 1:5 SuperFect for 10 min at RT was found to provide optimal EGFP expression and cellular survival. The cultures were transfected for 3 h at 37 °C and incubated with fresh media overnight prior to experimentation. FACS analysis determined transfection efficiency to be ∼197 in the vector control population and ∼357 in the mSrc.EGFP population (not shown). SYF cells were plated on ethanol-sterilized glass coverslips in 6-well culture plates at 7.5 × 104 cells/well for 24 h (∼707 confluency). Cells were transiently transfected as described previously. At twenty-four hours post-transfection the cells were washed with RT sterile PBS, fixed in 47 paraformaldehyde (10 min, RT), permeabilized with 0.27 Triton X-100/PBS (5 min, RT), and blocked for 1 h at RT with 107 normal goat serum/block buffer (17 BSA in PBS). The coverslips were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 ॖg/ml anti-Src antibody and for 45 min at RT with 1:500 Alexa 568 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes). Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. Samples were imaged using the 40×, 1.3-numerical aperture F-Fluar objective lens of a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Multiline scans (488- and 543-nm laser lines) were used to eliminate detection bleed-through for the green (bandpass 505–530 filter) and red (longpass 560 filter) fluorophores. Transfected cells were identified by expression of EGFP and c-Src expression was confirmed by visualization of c-Src-associated Alexa fluorescence. The intensity of EGFP- and c-Src-associated fluorescence was quantified using Scion Image Software, version 3.6 (Scion Corp.). Internal, non-transfected control cells were also examined as were coverslips incubated in the absence of primary antibody, and these showed negligible fluorescence. Transiently transfected SYF cells were washed with serum-free media, harvested with T/E, and collected by centrifugation prior to resuspension at 106/ml in 17 BSA/PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+. EGFP-positive populations were determined by FACS analysis comparing transfected cells to the SYF parental line. Samples were gated for sorting of low and high level EGFP-expressing cells, with gates being maintained between vector and mSrc.EGFP populations. Sorted cells were plated in 107 FBS/DMEM for 48 h to assess viability. To determine the ability of each population to respond to FGF-1, cells were harvested with T/E and replated at 2 × 103 cells/well (96-well plates), and [3H]thymidine incorporation was assessed as previously described. FGFR expression has not been characterized in SYF, Src4, Src++, or cSrc mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Therefore, we examined the MEF for FGFR1 and FGFR2 mRNA expression by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Jurkat C2-14, a T cell tumor line expressing stably transfected FGFR1, was used as a positive control for FGFR1 expression. BALB/c mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs), which express only FGFR2, were used as the positive control for FGFR2 expression (25Bastaki M. Nelli E.E. Dell'Era P. Rusnati M. Molinari-Tosatti M.P. Parolini S. Auerbach R. Ruco L.P. Possati L. Presta M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 454-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). FGFR1 mRNA was expressed by all MEF (Fig. 1,top) but FGFR2 mRNA was not (Fig. 1,middle). To confirm expression of FGFR1 protein capable of ligand binding, FACS analysis was performed using an Fc-FGF fusion protein (26Dikov M.M. Reich M.B. Dworkin L. Thomas J.W. Miller G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15811-15817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After incubation with Fc-FGF, the fibroblasts were washed with heparin to remove ligand from low affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding sites on the cell surface. Significant binding of Fc-FGF to high affinity cell surface receptor binding sites was observed for all fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). The mean fluorescence intensity, a reflection of the number of receptors per cell, increased modestly with enhanced c-Src expression. Derivation of the multiply deficient SYF cell lines required immortalization of the primary cells with SV40 large T antigen (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). c-Src was reintroduced into SYF to produce cSrc, a line with 10-fold greater expression than wild-type cells but which has the same clonal origin as SYF (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The Src++ line was derived from a different embryo and therefore may have clonal differences from SYF and cSrc in addition to differences arising from levels of c-Src protein expression. To overcome this problem, we also examined the Src4 MEF line, which was derived from SYF cells and expresses endogenous levels of c-Src protein. Expression of 60-kDa c-Src was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Src antibody (Fig. 2B). As expected, c-Src was not detected in SYF cells, was present at comparable levels in Src4 and Src++ cells, and was overexpressed in cSrc cells. Expression of the non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms of full-length FGFR1 was confirmed in all cell lines as proteins of ∼120–125 and 145 kDa (Fig. 2C). A slight retardation of mobility was observed for the 145-kDa fully glycosylated form with FGF stimulation, reflecting tyrosine phosphorylation predominantly of the cell surface receptor. A protein of ∼90-kDa molecular mass was visualized in all FGF-1-stimulated MEF by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 2D, arrow). Molecular size suggests this is FRS2, and its phosphorylation confirms activation of FGFR1. As expected, overexpression of c-Src also caused a marked increase in total tyrosine phosphorylation. Experiments using neutralizing antibodies or dominant-negative forms of c-Src have shown that, in fibroblasts, mitogenic responses to EGF, PDGF, and CSF-1 depend upon Src kinase activity (27Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 28Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Zhan et al. (14Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that FGF-induced proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells was not dependent on c-Src, and Klinghoffer et al. (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) suggest that c-Src, Yes, and Fyn are largely dispensable for PDGF-induced proliferation and signaling, because SYF cells exhibit mitogenic responses to this growth factor. To examine MEF mitogenic response to FGF-1, serum-starved cells were stimulated with FGF-1, and DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. A dose response was observed, and FGF-1 at 1 ng/ml stimulated maximal incorporation in all cell lines (Fig. 3). Src++ cells, however, demonstrated significantly enhanced incorporation compared with either the deficient SYF cells or the overexpressing cSrc cells. Src4 cells, which have the same clonal derivation as SYF and cSrc but express endogenous levels of c-Src, also exhibited greater thymidine incorporation than SYF or cSrc cells at all concentrations of FGF-1 examined (data not shown). These results suggested that endogenous levels of c-Src expression are optimal for transition of quiescent fibroblasts from G0 to G1 phase of the mitotic cycle in response to FGF-1. MEF growth was examined to determine the effects of c-Src expression and FGF-1 stimulation on later phases of the mitotic cycle (Fig.4). SYF, Src++, and cSrc cells were plated at equal density in serum and exposed to FGF-1 for 5 days. In the absence of serum or FGF (Fig. 4A, black bars), the number of viable cells ultimately declined. Not surprisingly, the most rapid loss of viability occurred in c-Src-deficient SYF cells. However, in response to FGF, Src++ cells unexpectedly showed significantly greater proliferation than cells overexpressing c-Src (Fig. 4A,middle versus lower panels). To confirm that these results were not a consequence of the Src++ cell line being derived from a different embryo (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), the study was repeated and included Src4 cells that were derived from the same embryo as SYF and cSrc cells (Fig. 4B). Src4 and Src++ cells expressing endogenous levels of c-Src again demonstrated significantly greater cell growth than either SYF or overexpressing cSrc cells. In contrast, growth in FBS correlated directly with the quantity of c-Src, and no inhibition was seen with overexpression (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that, although c-Src is not essential for FGF-1-stimulated MEF growth, endogenous levels of expression are optimal for maximal proliferation. To quantify this observation and eliminate clonal variability, the deficient SYF cells were transiently transfected with a control pIRES2-EGFP expression vector or vector containing the non-neuronal mSrc sequence. Cells were sorted based on c-Src expression, and [3H]thymidine incorporation of the subpopulations was measured. Transfected cells were identified by EGFP immunofluorescence (Fig. 5, Band E). Cells expressing c-Src were identified by immunostaining (Fig. 5, C and F). The intensity of EGFP expression was an excellent indicator of c-Src expression in mSrc.EGFP cultures (Fig. 5G, r2 = 0.953). Cells with low EGFP expression (“Low”) and high EGFP expression (“High”) were isolated by sorting (Fig.6A, populations collected as indicated by bars). Sorted subpopulations were resuspended in 107 FBS/DMEM for 48 h to determine viability. Vector control cells exhibited reduced viability and fewer cells were recovered than those that were plated, whereas mSrc.EGFP cells exhibited a 4.6- (Low) and 2.6-fold (High) increase in total cell number. Consequently, insufficient pIRES vector control cells were recovered to include all three FGF-1 concentrations in the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay.Figure 6SYF fibroblasts expressing low level c-Src kinase are more sensitive to FGF-1 induction of the mitotic cycle than high level c-Src-expressing cells.A, detection of EGFP expression by flow cytometry. Black tracing represents pIRES vector control cells; gray tracing represents mSrc.EGFP cells; dotted tracing represents the SYF parental population. Bars indicate gated populations isolated by sorting. B, low level c-Src expression enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation in SYF cells in the presence of FGF-1 (0.1–10 ng/ml) compared with either high level c-Src expression or control pIRES expression. Data represent the average -fold increase in thymidine incorporation over basal values ± S.E. of sextuplet wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Low level expression of c-Src significantly enhanced FGF-1-induced DNA synthesis at all concentrations of FGF-1 examined (Fig. 6B). A high level of expression of c-Src suppressed [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with low level c-Src-expressing cells, and these values were no different than vector control cells. No significant dose response to FGF-1 was observed in control cells. The results show directly that either overexpression or deficiency of c-Src results in impaired initiation of the mitotic cycle in response to FGF-1. The results with FGF-1 suggested that there is an “optimal” level of c-Src for growth factor-induced mitogenesis. To determine whether this phenomenon is unique to FGF or common to other growth factors, we examined the effects of varying c-Src expression on response to EGF, PDGF-B, and LPA (Fig.7A). Compared with both deficient cells and cells overexpressing c-Src, Src4 cells that express endogenous levels of c-Src showed maximal DNA synthesis to all stimuli, but some striking differences were apparent. Restoration of endogenous levels of c-Src resulted in significantly enhanced response to FGF and EGF compared with deficient cells. For both FGF-1 and EGF, the response of overexpressing cSrc cells was not different from deficient cells. In contrast, responses to PDGF-B and LPA were only minimally enhanced by restoration of endogenous levels of c-Src. Comparison to basal DNA synthesis of these cell lines in the absence of growth factors showed that varying levels of c-Src expression had little effect on response to PDGF-B and LPA (Fig. 7A, values above bars). The latter data for cSrc and SYF cells are consistent with results reported previously by Klinghoffer et al. (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) for PDGF. Distinct effects of c-Src overexpression between PDGF versusFGF-1 and EGF were also apparent when we assessed proliferation (Fig.7B). Maximal proliferation to all individual growth factors was seen in Src4 cells that express endogenous levels of c-Src. However, overexpressing cSrc cells showed markedly reduced proliferation to FGF-1 and EGF but only minimal reduction to PDGF-B. This was not due to a generalized defect in overexpressing cells as evident from the fact that the greatest increase in cell number occurred in overexpressing cSrc cells grown in FBS. Experiments using neutralizing antibodies or dominant-negative forms of Src have shown that Src family kinases are required for EGF-, PDGF-, and CSF-1-stimulated entry to the S-phase of the mitotic cycle in fibroblasts (27Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 28Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A.

Similarly, it has been reported that c-Src, Fyn, and Yes are activated at mitosis and play a role in cellular division at the G2-M transition phase (29Roche S. Fumagalli S. Courtneidge S.A. Science. 1995; 269: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 30Chackalaparampil I. Shalloway D. Cell. 1998; 52: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Here we show that SYF, Src4, Src++, and cSrc MEF express functional FGFR1, but not FGFR2, similar to human fetal fibroblasts (31Tartaglia M. Fragale A. Battaglia P.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All MEF responded to FGF-1 as measured by thymidine incorporation and increased cell number, indicating that FGF-1 can induce proliferation even in the absence of Src family kinases. Surprisingly, however, cells expressing endogenous levels of c-Src showed greater responsiveness to FGF than both Src-deficient and Src-overexpressing cells. This was the case for both clonally derived cell lines and Src-transfected SYF cells, demonstrating that the effect is due to Src and not simply a result of clonal origin. Our results differ from Liu et al. (19Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) who reported that Src deficiency did not affect FGF-1-induced proliferation in cells from Src−/− mice compared with Src+/+ mice. The difference likely reflects the compensatory effects of Fyn and Yes that were expressed in Src−/− cells used previouslyversus the absence of other Src family kinases in the cells used here. In addition, inclusion of high concentrations of insulin in their medium may have activated insulin and IGF receptors thereby stimulating the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway and masking the effects for FGF (reviewed in Ref. 32Bevan P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1429-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the experiments with neutralizing antibodies and dominant-negative Src, Klinghoffer et al. (24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) reported that c-Src is dispensable for PDGF- and LPA-induced proliferation. They found no significant difference in thymidine incorporation between deficient SYF cells and overexpressing cSrc cells. The 5-fold increase in total cell number for cSrc versus 3-fold increase for SYF cells in response to PDGF was not specifically addressed, and cells expressing endogenous levels of c-Src were not examined. Our results for PDGF-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 7A) and proliferation (Fig. 7B) of cSrc versus SYF cells are consistent with those of Klinghoffer. Using cells with endogenous levels of c-Src, we now show that the quantity of c-Src also has little effect on PDGF-induced proliferation. An important caveat is that all of these MEF lines are derived after transformation with SV40 large T antigen. Broome and Courtneidge (33Broome M.A. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2867-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have reported that MEF responses to PDGF occur due to the independent effect of SV40 large T antigen on c-myc induction rather than c-Src expression. Their study showed data for NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and wild-type MEF expressing an interfering form of Src, and data for Src-deficient or Src overexpressing cells was not provided. The unanticipated observation in our experiments was the finding that quantitative differences in c-Src expression have major effects on FGF-1 induced entry into cell cycle and cell growth. MEF with endogenous levels of c-Src showed maximal DNA synthesis and proliferation, whereas cells with 10-fold overexpression of c-Src behaved identically to those that lack c-Src when stimulated by FGF-1. This is in contrast to cells in the absence of growth factor stimulation, where overexpression of c-Src clearly rescues cells from death (Figs. 4A and 7B). This indicates that c-Src has negative as well as positive regulatory effects on FGFR1 signaling and suggests that there is an “optimal” level of c-Src for maximal FGF-induced proliferation. The pronounced negative effect of c-Src overexpression was also observed for EGF but not for PDGF-B, LPA, or serum. This may indicate that there are similar mechanisms for Src regulation of FGF and EGF signaling pathways that differ from PDGF. The mechanisms underlying the negative effects of c-Src overexpression are not addressed by our data. At least for FGFR1, it is unlikely to involve quantitative effects on cell surface receptor density or maximal ERK1/2 activation, because these were similar in cells with endogenous levels of c-Src and overexpression (Fig. 2A and data not shown).

The highly bent औ-sheet forms a curved shape that encompasses a hydrophobic core extending to both edges of the molecule. This structure dictates that Sm/Lsm proteins have a preference for forming closed ring oligomers of seven subunits, whereby each subunit interacts with its neighbors through a combination of औ-strand pairing and extensive hydrophobic contacts. In the cases of the bacterial Sm homolog Hfq and Sm2 from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, homomeric hexamer assemblies of the fold have been observed (13Schumacher M.A. Pearson R.F. Moller T.

Nature. 2001; 409: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The RNA binding interaction of the Sm/Lsm heptamers is governed by stacking of bases with conserved residues lining the inner surface on one face of the ring (12Törö I. Thore S.P. Mayer C.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The dominating features on the opposite ring face are the variable loops (loop L4) from individual Sm subunits. Lsm genes have been identified in prokaryotic archaeal species, although only 1–3 Sm-like proteins are usually encoded per genome, compared with the 16 or more found for eukaryotic organisms (10Collins B.M.

In line with this observation, these single proteins form highly stable homo-oligomers with comparable RNA-binding affinities to the more complex mixed heptamers of the eukaryotic snRNPs (10Collins B.M.

Ortega J. Steven A.C. Storz G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 25Moller T.M. Franch T. Jrup P.H. Keene D.R. Bächinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Valentin-Hansen P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), mediating RNA-RNA interactions as a homo-hexameric assembly. In this study we have focused on the functional organization of recombinant versions of Sm and Lsm proteins from the simple eukaryoteSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that the three yeast proteins SmE, SmF, and Lsm3 are able to form stable homo-oligomeric ring structures in solution, in a similar manner to their archaeal and bacterial Lsm counterparts. SmE and SmF, thought to form a direct pairwise interaction within spliceosomal snRNPs in vivo, do not associate with each other when in these stable homo-oligomeric states. The ring-forming Sm/Lsm proteins are shown to bind poly(U) RNA. Surprisingly, in contrast to Sm/Lsm complexes described previously, the SmF complex actively binds single-stranded DNA as well as poly(U) RNA. The structure of SmF determined by x-ray crystallography reveals an Sm protein assembly with a novel higher order arrangement of 14 monomers. Genes encoding yeast proteins SmE, SmF, Lsm9, and Lsm3 were isolated from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR. Primers were designed to incorporate NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genes, respectively. Genes were inserted into the expression plasmid pETMCSIII, which relies on transcription by T7 RNA polymerase and results in a hexa-His fusion at the N terminus of expressed proteins (26Neylon C. Brown S.E. Kralicek A.V. Miles C.S. Love C.A. Dixon N.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11989-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into the BL21(DE3)/pLysS Escherichia coli strain for expression. The single cysteine mutants (C16S)SmE and (C75S)SmF were made from pETMCSIII-derived plasmids using the Stratagene QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The (C75S)SmF gene was also inserted into the pGEX-4T-2 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) for alternative expression as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The gene was cloned from the pETMCSIII-derived plasmid by PCR using a 5′ primer that allowed insertion of the gene into pGEX-4T-2 using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes. This plasmid was transformed into the BL21 E. colistrain for protein expression. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB broth (containing appropriate antibiotics), and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-औ-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the culture medium at A595 of 0.5–0.6. Harvested cells were lysed by a French press in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 50 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.57 (w/v) Tween 20® (Calbiochem), 10 ॖg/ml RNase A, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30 min at 15,000 × g, 4 °C), and expressed proteins were purified on Ni-NTA or glutathione-Sepharose affinity media as appropriate. The yeast protein Lsm9 was refolded from inclusion bodies by solubilizing in urea (8m), glycerol (107), imidazole (10 mm), binding to Ni-NTA-agarose and elution with gradual dilutions of urea. All proteins were further purified by gel-filtration chromatography using 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl as running buffer. Recombinant production of the Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Lsm protein (MtLsmα) has been described previously (10Collins B.M. Harrop S.J. Kornfeld G.D. Dawes I.W. Curmi P.M.G. Mabbutt B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For RNA binding assays, the site-specific mutants MtLsmα(R72L) and MtLsmα(R72L/N48A) were also prepared. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Tricine buffering system (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) or in solution by analytical gel filtration with Superose® 12 and Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences). Gel-filtration columns were run in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 60 ॖl/min. Elution and void volumes were calibrated using standard globular proteins and blue dextran (28Laurent T.C. Killander J. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 14: 317-330Crossref Google Scholar). Protein samples of (C75S)SmF, (C16S)SmE, Lsm3, and MtLsmα were diluted to 10–100 ॖg/ml in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl. Copper grids (400 ॖm mesh) were coated with an ultra-thin layer of carbon (∼10 nm). Preparations were stained for 10 s with 5.07 uranyl acetate, 2.07 acetic acid after binding the protein for 5 s. Grids were examined using a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope, and electron micrographs were recorded at a magnification of ×73,000–145,000. Cultures of E. colistrains expressing bait GST-(C75S)SmF were mixed with cultures expressing prey His-tagged (C16S)SmE. The mixed cells were lysed with a French press in lysis buffer (see above). A 500-ॖl aliquot of the clarified lysate was incubated with 50 ॖl of glutathione-agarose and bound protein pelleted. The pellet was washed several times with buffer, and bound and unbound fractions were examined by SDS-PAGE. Biosensor interaction studies were performed with a BIAcore2000 surface plasmon resonance instrument. His-tagged (C16S)SmE (75 ॖl, 200 nm) introduced to a Ni-NTA chip at a flow rate of 5 ॖl/min resulted in an increase of 3,300 response units above base line. Binding of (C75S)SmF (derived from the GST fusion protein by thrombin proteolysis) to His-tagged (C16S)SmE was tested by injecting 15 ॖl of 15 nm protein (i.e. 150 nm) at a flow rate of 5 ॖl/min. Similarly, binding of GST-(C75S)SmF fusion protein was tested by injecting 15 ॖl of protein at a concentration of 590 nm. Following gel filtration, His-tagged versions of SmF and (C75S)SmF in Tris/NaCl (plus 10 mmdithiothreitol for SmF) were concentrated to 20 mg/ml. Crystals of both proteins were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion in a reservoir containing 247 polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5), and 0.1 m sodium acetate. Diffraction quality crystals measuring 2 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm formed within several weeks. From these conditions, two tetragonal crystal forms have been identified, P4122 and P43212. Data from the P4122 crystal form of SmF was collected at beamline 14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Data to 2.8 Å resolution was collected at 100 K after cryoprotecting the crystal in mother liquor plus 107 glycerol. Images were integrated using MOSFLM (29Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and scaled using CCP4 programs (30Dodson E.J. Winn M. Ralph A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 620-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As a starting point for molecular replacement, the MtLsmα heptameric structure (Protein Data Bank code1I81) was converted to polyserine and truncated by removal of the N-terminal helix of each protein chain. Molecular replacement was performed with AMORE (31Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using data from 15 to 4 Å. Very clear rotationally related solutions constituted the top six results, with a seventh rotationally related solution appearing at the eighth position. The top solution (correlation coefficient 37.0, R factor 48.7) was subjected to rigid body and simulated annealing refinement in CNS (32Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), resulting in a model with Rcryst = 407 and Rfree = 417 and a clearly interpretable electron density map. The model was rebuilt in the O program (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and subjected to TLS refinement with REFMAC5 (34Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) to finalRcryst and Rfree values of 25.4 and 26.77, respectively (Table I). There is one heptameric ring in the asymmetric unit, but visual inspection revealed a striking co-axially stacked interaction with a symmetry-related heptamer. This involves contacts between all seven of the variable loops on one face of the structure with all seven of the loops from the symmetry-related molecule (see text for discussion).Table IStatistics of data collection and structure refinementData collectionProteinSmF(C75S)SmFSpace groupP4122P43212X-ray wavelength (Å)0.93931.0Unit cell dimensionsa = 79.9 Å; b = 79.9 Å;c = 253.2 Å; α = औ = γ = 90°a = 105.6 Å; b = 105.6 Å; c = 236.6 Å; α = औ = γ = 90°No. heptameric rings per asymmetric unit12Resolution (Å)79.0–2.8 (2.95–2.80)95.0–3.5 (3.69–3.50)Rmerge1-aRmerge = ΣΣi‖Ih −Ihi‖/ΣΣiIh where Ih is the mean intensity of reflection h.0.066 (0.390)0.064 (0.353)Rmeas1-bRmeas = Σ(n/n−1)Σ‖Ih −Ihi‖/ΣΣiIh, the multiplicity weighted Rmerge (48).0.072 (0.415)0.069 (0.381)〈〈I〉/ς(〈I〉)〉19.6 (4.6)23.5 (6.0)Completeness (7)99.9 (99.9)99.3 (99.3)Multiplicity6.8 (7.1)6.7 (6.8)Wilson plot B (Å2)84.288.9RefinementResolution (Å)20.0–2.820.0–3.5Rcryst/Rfree1-cR = Σ(FP −Fcalc)/ΣFP.0.254/0.2670.292/0.297〈B〉(Å2)50.344.8No. reflections (no. in Rfree)19,819/107516,292/876No. atoms38377887r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.0230.023r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)2.12.3Ramachandran violations1-dFrom PROCHECK (49).00Residues in final modelA, 19–86; B, 18–86; C, 19–86; D, 19–86; E, 19–86; F, 18–86; G, 19–86A, 19–86; B, 19–86; C, 13–86; D, 16–86; E, 19–86; F, 17–86; G, 17–86; H, 16–86; I, 17–86; J, 15–86; K, 18–86; L, 13–86; M, 17–86; N, 18–86Values in parentheses apply to the high resolution shell.1-a Rmerge = ΣΣi‖Ih −Ihi‖/ΣΣiIh where Ih is the mean intensity of reflection h.1-b Rmeas = Σ(n/n−1)Σ‖Ih −Ihi‖/ΣΣiIh, the multiplicity weighted Rmerge (48Diederichs K.

Data from cryo-cooled crystals of the (C75S)SmF protein in space group P43212 was collected on beamline BL9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using an ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector with x-rays at 1.0 Å wavelength. As calculations indicated two heptameric rings per asymmetric unit in this crystal form (35Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar), a molecular replacement model was constructed by pairing the refined SmF heptameric structure (above) with its strongly interacting symmetry equivalent. Molecular replacement with AMORE showed that this dimeric arrangement of the heptameric rings constituted the asymmetric unit of the P43212 crystal form. The structure of 14 subunits was rebuilt using the O program (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and refined with REFMAC5 to yield final Rcryst and Rfreevalues of 29.2 and 29.77, respectively (Table I). The coordinates and structure factors for both the P4122 and the P43212 structures of yeast SmF have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1N9R and1N9S). RNA/DNA oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled at their 5′ ends, purified on a 107 polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel, and recovered byn-butanol precipitation (36Cathala G. Brunel C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Labeled oligonucleotides were heat-denatured (2 min, 95 °C) and immediately cooled on ice before addition of reaction mixture. RNA binding mixture (15 ॖl) containing 20 fmol of RNA/DNA oligonucleotides, 5 ॖg of protein, and 1.5 ॖl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 70 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 77 (w/v) glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 units of ribonuclease inhibitor) were incubated at 22 °C for 30 min. Oligonucleotide species were fractionated on a 57 native polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate/EDTA buffer (with 3 mm औ-mercaptoethanol) and detected by autoradiography. In order to characterize the yeast Sm and Lsm proteins, we have produced several as recombinant molecules in E. coli. SmE, SmF, and Lsm3 when expressed in bacteria were found to be soluble and easily purified in high yields by affinity chromatography. As there was some evidence of a proportion of covalently linked dimers within samples of His-tagged SmE and SmF on SDS-PAGE, non-native disulfide bond formation was avoided by mutating the single non-conserved cysteine residues of each sequence to serine, resulting in His-tagged (C16S)SmE and (C75S)SmF. These site-specific mutants yielded single bands by electrophoresis, yet otherwise appeared to possess an identical fold to proteins of native sequence as judged by gel-filtration, electron microscopy, and crystallography (see below). The molecular integrity of the recombinant products was verified by electro-spray mass spectrometry. Gel-filtration chromatograms were used to ascertain the oligomeric composition of the various recombinant proteins in solution. By including in each run samples of archaeal MtLsmα characterized by us previously (10Collins B.M. Harrop S.J. Kornfeld G.D. Dawes I.W. Curmi P.M.G. Mabbutt B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as an oligomeric complex of seven subunits, we were able to compare the relative sizes of the homo-oligomers formed by (C16S)SmE, (C75S)SmF, and Lsm3 (Fig. 1). Of the group of proteins described here, only Lsm9 and MtLsmऔ samples elute with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to a monomer (9 and 8 kDa, respectively). The majority of the (C16S)SmE sample elutes as a molecule with an apparent molecular mass of 55–60 kDa and at the same volume as the MtLsmα heptamer. The chromatograms of both (C16S)SmE and SmE often contained an additional shoulder corresponding to a size of ∼110 kDa, indicating some dimerization of the major SmE species (Fig. 1A). The proteins (C75S)SmF and Lsm3, however, each elute as single species with apparent molecular masses of 100–110 and 95–105 kDa, respectively, i.e. they appear to be twice the molecular size of the (C16S)SmE and MtLsmα oligomers. The large (C75S)SmF and Lsm3 complexes are particularly stable, as shown by their electrophoretic properties (Fig. 1B); the large (C75S)SmF oligomer withstands 27 SDS and boiling for 5 min, and this treatment merely halves the size of the Lsm3 complex. In contrast, (C16S)SmE is more readily converted to a monomeric species. These results suggest that Lsm3 and (C75S)SmF associate in a similar dimeric arrangement of two ∼55-kDa complexes in solution, with the Lsm3 dimerization being somewhat less stable. Note that the (C75S)SmF oligomer is significantly thermostable, resisting unfolding after heating to 65 °C, a point at which the (C16S)SmE complex is dissociated (Fig. 1C). Transmission electron micrographs of the complexes of (C16S)SmE, (C75S)SmF, and Lsm3 stained with uranyl acetate were examined to determine the organization of the oligomeric assemblies. In all cases, ring structures are revealed (Fig.2A). Each protein complex is the same dimension and is similar in size to the structure of the MtLsmα heptameric ring, showing a diameter of ∼8 nm and a central area of stain ∼2 nm wide. As the rings of (C75S)SmF and Lsm3 appear to be equal in dimension to those of MtLsmα and (C16S)SmE, despite having twice their effective molecular size in solution, this suggests that the former proteins are organized as co-axially stacked double rings. The ultra-structures of these yeast homo-oligomeric assemblies are highly similar to the hetero-heptameric Sm/Lsm protein complexes seen at the core of snRNPs from HeLa cells (16Raker V.A. Hartmuth K. Kastner B. Lührmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6554-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Stark H. Dube P. Lührmann R. Kastner B.

A. 1990; 87: 1710-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). SmE and SmF are known to interact with each other, both within RNA-free hexameric complexes with SmG and in intact splicing snRNPs (38Plessel G. Lührmann R. Kastner B. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid studies and immunoprecipitations have also detected a direct pairwise interaction between these two core Sm molecules (39Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 40Camasses A. Bragado-Nilsson E. Martin R. Séraphin B. Bordonne R.M. Mol. Cell.

The specific pairing of these proteins is a key event in the formation of a functional spliceosomal Sm complex (9Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. delaFortelle E. Raker V.A. Luhrmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 39Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the recombinant molecules are capable of a similar pairingin vitro. With (C16S)SmE attached to the sensor chip surface via its N-terminal hexa-His affinity tag, no binding event could be detected upon introduction of either (C75S)SmF or the heavier variant GST-(C75S)SmF (Fig. 2B). Similarly, no mass change was detected when the biosensor experiment was configured for binding of GST-(C16S)SmE to His-tagged (C75S)SmF on the Ni-NTA chip. We were also unable to detect any co-complex of GST-(C75S)SmF and (C16S)SmE in solution phase following the mixing of expression host cell lysate and pull-down with glutathione-agarose (not shown). The lack of observable interaction between the recombinant forms of SmE and SmF does not exclude very weak interactions between the proteins but certainly rules out the possibility in vitro of the 1:1 complex formation thought to occur in native snRNPs. It appears that the formation of such a mixed complex is inhibited by the highly organized and stable oligomeric states formed separately by each protein component. We have determined the crystallographic structures of the homo-oligomeric complexes of both SmF and the mutant form (C75S)SmF. Both crystallize under identical conditions, although we have observed that (C75S)SmF crystallizes in two different forms (P43212 and P4122) while so far observing only the P4122 form for native SmF. We report here the structure of SmF in the P4122 crystal form and (C75S)SmF in the P43212 form. The statistics of data collection and structure refinement are given in TableI. The two structures were determined sequentially by molecular replacement using the previously solved MtLsmα heptamer as a starting model to first solve the structure of the SmF P4122 crystal form. SmF from S. cerevisiae forms a homo-heptameric ring (Fig.3), where each subunit binds to its neighbor via औ-strand pairing and hydrophobic interactions. Each SmF polypeptide chain essentially adopts an identical fold to that defined for its human and archaeal Sm and Lsm counterparts (9Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. delaFortelle E. Raker V.A.

Here we report the purification and identification of the factor that binds to the BTE. This factor was purified from GH3 pituitary nuclear extracts using ammonium sulfate fractionation, heparin-Sepharose and Mono Q chromatography, and BTE-affinity magnetic beads. We purified two proteins of 57 and 47 kDa and identified the 57-kDa protein by mass spectrometry as the Ets factor GABPα. Western blot analysis identified the 47-kDa protein as GABPऔ1. Co-transfection of dominant-negative GABPऔ1 blocks prolactin promoter basal activity by 85–887 in GH3 cells in the presence or absence of FGF-4. Additionally, expression of wild-type GABPα/औ1 selectively activates a minimal BTE promoter 24–28-fold in GH3 cells, and this activation is dependent on the Ets-binding site. Finally, small interfering RNA depletion of GABP in GH3 cells results in the loss of prolactin protein. Thus, we have identified GABPα/GABPऔ1 as a critical and functionally relevant Ets factor that regulates rPRL promoter activity via the BTE site.

The proximal 425 bases of the rat prolactin (rPRL)1promoter are sufficient to confer cell type-specific expression of the PRL gene (1Keech C.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Within this region, DNase footprinting studies have identified three binding sites for the pituitary-specific POU homeodomain transcription factor Pit-1 (FPI, -III, and -IV) (2Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Siddiqui S. Loukin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5211-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Pit-1 has been shown to play a critical role in the cell type-specific expression of the PRL gene and the development of the lactotroph cell lineage. However, Pit-1 has also been shown to control the expression of the growth hormone (GH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone औ genes in somatotroph and thyrotroph cells, respectively (3Ryan A. Rosenfeld M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 4Theill L. Karin M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 670-689PubMed Google Scholar, 5Treier M. Rosenfeld M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, othercis-elements and transcription factors must be involved in the cell type-specific expression of the PRL gene. Further studies of the rPRL promoter have identified a region between −112 and −85 that is critical for the basal activity of the promoter (6Iverson R.A. Day K.H. d'Emden M. Day R.N. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1564-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Jackson S.M. Keech C.A. Williamson D.J. Gutierrez–Hartmann A. Mol. Cell.

This basal transcription element (BTE) was subsequently shown to overlap with a cAMP-response element (1Keech C.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 6Iverson R.A. Day K.H. d'Emden M. Day R.N. Maurer R.A. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 885-892PubMed Google Scholar); however, it was shown that the proto-typical target CREB is unlikely to be involved at this site (8Liang J. Kim K.E. Schoderbeck W.E. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 885-892PubMed Google Scholar, 9Peers B. Nalda A.M. Monget P. Voz M.L. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies (9Peers B. Nalda A.M. Monget P. Voz M.L. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using the human PRL promoter have shown that the homologous A-site is critical for both basal and cAMP human PRL promoter activity, and that a ubiquitous 100-kDa protein distinct from CREB and Pit-1 binds to this site. Recent studies have identified a binding site for the Ets family of transcription factors within the BTE. This Ets-binding site has been shown to be a critical cis-element for several growth factor signaling pathways, including fibroblast growth factors 2 and 4 (10Schweppe R. Frazer-Abel A.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1094-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), Stanley and co-workers (16Jacob K. Stanley F. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4542-4550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the EBS at −96 can bind to the Ets factors Elk-1, Sap-1, and GABPα/GABPऔ1; this group has also shown that the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPα) also binds to the BTE. However, the functional significance of any of these factors in pituitary cells remains unclear. We have characterized previously the Ets factors that bind to the BTE and have shown by EMSA and antibody supershift analysis that Ets-1 and GABPα/GABPऔ1 can bind to the EBS of the BTE (17Schweppe R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, UV cross-linking studies with GH3 nuclear extract and the BTE probe suggested that a protein of ∼49–57 kDa binds to the BTE (17Schweppe R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, transient transfection studies of a variety of Ets factors have failed to identify the functionally relevant protein. Thus, the exact identity of the protein that binds to the BTE and regulates rPRL gene expression remains unknown. The Ets family of transcription factors is composed of more than 30 members that contain a highly conserved DNA binding domain (18Graves B. Petersen J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All members of the Ets family recognize and bind to a core 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′ DNA motif in a variety of promoters. Thus, the mechanism by which Ets factors achieve specific transcriptional responses is of great interest. Additional sequences flanking the core are thought to contribute to binding specificity, in addition to the tissue-restricted expression of certain Ets factors (18Graves B. Petersen J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the primary mechanism for achieving specificity is thought to be through the interaction of Ets factors with other transcription factors bound to adjacent elements (19Wasylyk B. Nordheim A. Papavassiliou A.G. Transcription Factors in Eukaryotes. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 251-284Google Scholar, 20Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 213-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 21Graves B. Science. 1998; 279: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rPRL promoter in GH3 pituitary cells represents an excellent model system to study the mechanisms by which Ets factors in combination with other classes of transcription factors at adjacent elements elicit specific transcriptional responses. Our laboratory has previously shown that Pit-1 selectively interacts with Ets-1 at the rPRL promoter Ras-response element centered at −212, and this interaction may contribute to the cell type-specific expression of the PRL gene (22Bradford A. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,23Bradford A. Conrad K. Tran P. Ostrowski M. Gutierrrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification and characterization of the Ets factor that binds to the BTE should further our understanding of the cell type-specific expression of the PRL gene. In order to identify definitively the Ets factor that binds to the BTE of the rPRL promoter, a large scale purification scheme was undertaken. By using four purification steps, we have purified two proteins of 57 and 47 kDa from GH3 pituitary nuclear extracts. The 57-kDa protein was identified as the Ets factor GABPα by MALDI-TOF and MS/MS sequencing, and the 47-kDa protein was identified as GABPऔ1 by Western blotting. By using transient transfection studies, we show that expression of dominant-negative GABPऔ1 blocks basal rPRL promoter activity in the presence or absence of FGF-4. Co-transfection of wild-type GABPα/GABPऔ1 activates the rPRL promoter in GH3 pituitary cells and selectively activates a minimal BTE promoter. Finally, siRNA against GABP results in the selective reduction of PRL protein levels. These studies show that GABPα/GABPऔ1 is the critical nuclear factor that binds to the BTE and regulates basal rPRL promoter gene expression. The EMSA was performed essentially as described previously (17Schweppe R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Binding buffer contained 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 47 glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, 200 ॖg/ml insulin, and 250 ng poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). Poly(dI-dC) was not included in gel shift reactions containing the DNA affinity-purified fractions. The sequence of the BTE probe used is (message strand only, linker sequences in lowercase): tcgaCTTAATGACGGAAATAGATG. The putative Ets-binding site (GGAA) is in boldface, and the mutant BTE probe is identical except that the underlined sequences were changed to an XhoI site. Protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography, and gel shift activities were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Complementary oligonucleotides containing three repeats of the BTE sequence were annealed for the DNA-affinity purification step as described previously (17Schweppe R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The message strand was synthesized with a 5′-biotin containing a 6-carbon (6C) spacer, and the complementary DNA strand was identical, except it did not contain a biotin moiety (Invitrogen). The sequence of the 72-nucleotide BTE oligonucleotide used is (message strand only, SalI linker sequences in lowercase): 5′-Bio-(6C)-tcgaCTTAATGACGGAAATAGATGtcgaCTTAATGACGGAAATAGATGtcgaCTTAATGACGGAAATAGATG-3′. Approximately 3 nmol of double-stranded (BTE)35′-biotinylated oligonucleotide were coupled to 20 mg of M-280 streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GH3 cells were grown in spinner culture at 37 °C in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 157 horse serum and 2.57 fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Tissue Culture Core Facility. Cells were grown to a density of 8–10 × 105 cells/ml and collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g. Nuclear extracts were prepared from a total of 40 liters of GH3 cells (24Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), with slight modifications, as described previously (17Schweppe R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). BTF was purified from ∼262 mg of GH3 nuclear extract derived from 40 liters of GH3 cells in four purification steps (Fig. 2). Ammonium sulfate powder (Fisher) was added to 50.5 ml of GH3NE on an ice bath at 4 °C, to give a final saturation of 507 ammonium sulfate. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 20.5 ml of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 7 mm KCl, 47 glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1× protease inhibitors) (Roche Applied Science). The 507 ammonium sulfate pellet and soluble fraction were dialyzed against binding buffer at 4 °C. The dialysate was cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 × g. Fractions were assayed for BTF binding activity by EMSA. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The 507 ammonium sulfate cut containing BTF activity was divided into five samples. Each sample was loaded onto a 5-ml Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and re-circulated at 4 °C for 20 min at 2 ml/min with a peristaltic pump. The flow-through was collected, and the column was washed with 10 ml of binding buffer at 1 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted with a 50-ml 70–800 mm KCl linear gradient using the FPLC, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected for each column. BTE binding activity eluted in two peaks, and the purification of peak 1 is the focus of this study because this peak contained unambiguous BTE binding activity. Peak 1 from five sequential heparin-Sepharose columns was pooled and dialyzed against binding buffer and then re-loaded onto the 5-ml heparin-Sepharose column in order to concentrate the sample. Heparin-bound proteins were step-eluted with binding buffer containing 0.55 m KCl, and the concentrated peak fraction 1 was dialyzed against binding buffer. The peak heparin-Sepharose fraction 1 (5.1 mg) was loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column (HR 5/5,Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed with 2 ml of binding buffer, and protein was eluted with 70–800 mm KCl linear gradient in 21 ml of binding buffer at 0.5 ml/min using an FPLC. Peak binding activity was present in fractions 38–41 (∼300 mm KCl). These fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 7 mm KCl binding buffer and clarified by centrifugation. Twenty mg of magnetic beads coupled to 3 nmol of double-stranded BTE3oligonucleotide was washed three times in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 47 glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, and 200 ॖg/ml insulin, 1× protease inhibitors, Roche Applied Science). Approximately one-half (∼335 ॖg) of the peak Mono Q fraction (∼700 ॖg) was purified with the (BTE)3-coupled magnetic beads in three sequential purifications. For each purification, 20 mg of (BTE)3-coupled magnetic beads was incubated with 40, 70, or 225 ॖg of the peak Mono Q fraction for 30 min at room temperature and rotated every 3–5 min. The purification was done sequentially because the exact capacity of the (BTE)3-coupled magnetic beads was not known. The beads containing bound protein were washed three times, for 5 min each, with 500 ॖl of binding buffer containing 100 mm KCl. For the last two washes, 15 ॖg of poly(dI-dC) was added. Proteins were step-eluted using 100-ॖl aliquots of binding buffer containing 0.2, 0.3, or 1 m KCl for 10 min each. The peak fractions (1 m KCl) of the three sequential (BTE)3-affinity magnetic bead purifications (40-, 75-, and 225-ॖg inputs) were combined. For gel extraction and tryptic digestion, the peak BTE affinity-purified fractions were pooled and boiled in 2× SDS-sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 27 SDS, and 10 mmdithiothreitol) and loaded onto a 1-mm thick, 17 SDS-107 polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with 0.57 Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) in 257 isopropyl alcohol and 107 acetic acid for 2 h and destained with 107 acetic acid for 2 h. Protein bands and a control “blank” piece were excised from the gel, and in-gel trypsin digests were performed as described previously (25Lewis T. Hunt J. Aveline L. Jonscher K. Louie D. Yeh J. Resing K. Ahn N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1343-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were extracted from gel slices, concentrated, and desalted as described previously (25Lewis T. Hunt J. Aveline L. Jonscher K. Louie D. Yeh J. Resing K. Ahn N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1343-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For the LCQ analysis, the desalted extracts were completely dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 5 ॖl of 0.17 formic acid. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE STR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in delayed extraction mode was used to identify the unknown proteins by peptide mass fingerprinting, as described previously (25Lewis T. Hunt J. Aveline L. Jonscher K. Louie D. Yeh J. Resing K. Ahn N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1343-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, one-tenth (0.5 ॖl) of each desalted extract was co-crystallized with matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid, Hewlett-Packard) on a gold-coated sample plate, and the monoisotopic masses of des-Arg1-bradykinin (904.47 Da) and Glu1-fibrinopeptide B (1570.67 Da) were used to calibrate the instrument. The sum of 150 acquisitions for each sample was used to identify the peptide masses for each unknown protein. Proteins were identified using the Profound program (prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound) searching the rodent, human, or eukaryotic NCBI nonredundant protein data bases. Liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry with a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan) coupled to a Magic 2002 high pressure liquid chromatography pump and stream splitter (Michrom BioResources) was used to obtain amino acid sequence, as described previously (25Lewis T. Hunt J. Aveline L. Jonscher K. Louie D. Yeh J. Resing K. Ahn N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1343-1354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptide fragmentation spectra were obtained for the 57-kDa protein as peptides eluted on a 100-ॖm (inner diameter) fused Silica C18 column (LC Packings) using an acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The amino acid sequences identified from the peptide fragmentation data were used to search the NCBI nonredundant protein data base using the Sequest software (Finnigan) (26Eng J. McCormack A. Yates III, J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5472) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of GH3NE (50 ॖg), the 507 ammonium sulfate cut (50 ॖg), the peak heparin-Sepharose (20 ॖg), Mono Q (8 ॖg), and pooled BTE-affinity fractions was performed as described previously (17Schweppe R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). UV cross-linking studies of these same peak fractions were performed as described previously (17Schweppe R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The BTE probe used for UV cross-linking has been detailed previously (17Schweppe R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Where indicated, competitor oligonucleotides were included at 400-fold molar excess. The expression plasmids pSG5c-Ets-1, pSG5c-Ets-2, pTLElk-1, and pTL2Net, and the luciferase reporter constructs pA3–425rPRLluc and pA3–36rPRLluc have been described previously (23Bradford A.

The minimal −36 rPRL promoters containing wild-type and mutant BTE inserts were constructed by inserting multiple copies of each double-stranded BTE oligonucleotide containing aSalI overhang into the SalI site of pA3–36luc, as described previously (23Bradford A. Conrad K. Tran P. Ostrowski M. Gutierrrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant BTE oligonucleotides used were the same as that used for EMSA as described above. The minimal promoters were sequenced by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center DNA Sequencing Facility. Adherent GH3 or GHFT1 pituitary cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 12.57 horse serum and 2.57 fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C in 57 CO2. GH3 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation, harvested, and luciferase/औ-galactosidase activities assayed as described previously (23Bradford A. Conrad K. Tran P. Ostrowski M. Gutierrrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with or without 2 ng/ml FGF-4, 6 h prior to harvest as described previously (10Schweppe R. Frazer-Abel A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Bradford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30852-30859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides directed against lamin A/C, GABPα, and GABPऔ1 were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dharmacon Research Inc.). The targeted sequences of GABPα and GABPऔ1 were 5′-AAGGAUGCUCGAGACUGUAUU-3′ and 5′-AACAUAUGGCAAGCCCUCAAU-3′, respectively. The sequence of the lamin A/C oligonucleotide was as described previously (32Elbashir S. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar). Adherent GH3 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 12-well plate. GH3 cells were transfected with 200 pmol of both GABPα and -औ1 oligonucleotides or 400 pmol of the lamin A/C oligonucleotide or no siRNA oligonucleotide using 10 ॖl of Effectine reagent (Qiagen). Cells were harvested in EB as described previously (10Schweppe R. Frazer-Abel A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Bradford A. J. Biol.

Blots were probed with antibodies against α-tubulin (Oncogene), GABPα (provided by Dr. Tom Kristie, National Institutes of Health), or prolactin (provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow at the National Hormone and Pituitary Program). Protein levels were determined using an Alpha Imager. The BTE is a key element of the proximal rPRL promoter that regulates both basal and growth factor-stimulated promoter activity (1Keech C.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) a specific protein complex (complex A) present in GH3 nuclear extract that binds to the BTE of the rPRL promoter. This previous characterization suggested that an Ets factor is a component of complex A. However, the identity of the functionally relevant factor(s) that bind to the BTE remains unclear. In order to identify precisely the endogenous protein(s) that bind(s) to the BTE of the rPRL promoter, we set up a large scale protein purification scheme to purify BTF from GH3 pituitary cells. The four-step purification scheme used to purify BTF is shown in Fig. 2. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 40 liters of GH3 cells and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, heparin-Sepharose and Mono Q chromatography, and BTE-affinity magnetic beads. The presence of BTF binding activity in each fraction was monitored by EMSA using a radiolabeled BTE probe. As an initial purification step, GH3 nuclear extract (GH3NE) was precipitated by a 507 saturated ammonium sulfate cut. BTF binding activity was enriched ∼1.75-fold in the 507 ammonium sulfate precipitate, and no detectable gel shift activity was present in the soluble fraction (Table I and data not shown). The 507 ammonium sulfate fraction was divided into five equal fractions, and each fraction was loaded sequentially onto a heparin-Sepharose column, and proteins were eluted using a 50-ml 70–800 mm linear KCl gradient. A representative protein elution profile and EMSA are shown in Fig.3. Gel shift analysis of the heparin-Sepharose purified fractions shows that BTF binding activity is present in the input but not the flow-through fractions (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). BTF binding activity eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column at two different salt concentrations, the first peak of eluting in fractions 20–26 (peak 1, ∼300 mm KCl) (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 6–12), and a second broader peak (peak 2) eluting at a higher salt in fractions 30–42 (peak 2, ∼500–600 KCl) (Fig. 3,A and B, lanes 17–29). Cumulative purification was ∼10-fold for peak 1 and ∼0.4-fold for peak 2 (Fig.3A and Table I). Peaks 1 and 2 from the heparin-Sepharose column were pooled separately. Further purification of peak 2 did not yield specific BTF binding activity, and Western blot analysis showed that GABP was not present in peak 2 (data not shown). The purification of peak 1 is the focus of this study.Table ISummary of BTF purificationPurification stepTotal protein1-aProtein concentrations were calculated by the Bio-Rad protein assay.Total activity1-bTotal activity was calculated by multiplying the PhosphorImager units present in 1 ॖl of the shifted extract by the total volume of the extract.Specific activity1-cSpecific activity was calculated by dividing the PhosphorImager units of the shifted band by the amount of protein (ॖg) present in the gel shift reaction.Purification factorYieldmgunitsunits/mg7GH3NE2622.9 × 1091.1 × 1071100(NH4)2SO41603.1 × 1091.9 × 1071.7106Heparin-Sepharose (Pk 1)65.4 × 1089.97 × 1079.119Mono Q0.71.2 × 1081.7 × 108154DNA affinity0.0005611-dProt"

In this context, oxidants have been associated with NF-κB activation, although the molecular source and mechanism of targeting have remained obscure. We found that RelA, essential for NF-κB activation by IL-1, was associated with the NADPH oxidase adapter protein p47phox in yeast two-hybrid, coprecipitation, and in vitro binding studies. RelA and p47-GFP also colocalized in endothelial cells in focal submembranous dorsoventral protrusions. Overexpression of p47phox synergized with IL-1औ in the activation of an artificial κB-luciferase reporter and specifically augmented IL-1औ-induced RelA transactivation activity. p47phox overexpression also greatly increased IL-1औ-stimulated RelA phosphorylation, whereas it had no effect on I-κB degradation or on RelA nuclear translocation or κB binding. The tandem SH3 domains of p47phox were found to associate with a proline-rich mid-region of RelA (RelA-PR) located between the Rel homology and transactivation domains. The RelA-PR peptide blocked interaction of p47phox and RelA, and ectopic expression of RelA-PR abrogated IL-1औ-induced transactivation of the NF-κB-dependent E-selectin promoter. Further, suppression of NADPH oxidase function through the inhibitor diphenylene iodonium, the superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin (MnTBAP), or expression of a dominant interfering mutant of a separate NADPH oxidase subunit (p67(V204A)) decreased IL-1औ-induced E-selectin promoter activation, suggesting that p47phox facilitates NF-κB activation through linkage with the NADPH oxidase. IL-1औ rapidly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IL-1 type I receptor-associated proteins, suggesting that oxidants may operate through inactivation of local protein-tyrosine phosphatases in the proximal IL-1औ signaling pathway leading to RelA activation.

A linear activation sequence following engagement of the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) has been intensely studied and involves binding of the MyD88 and Tollip adapters to the IL-1 receptor chains (1Burns K.

Despite articulation of this universal pathway, a number of details concerning NF-κB activation remain unresolved. In particular, numerous studies suggest an important role for endogenous oxidants in the activation of NF-κB by IL-1. IL-1 increases oxidant production, and strategies designed to diminish oxidant production or augment oxidant scavenging cause decreased IL-1-induced NF-κB activity (12Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 13Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25941-25950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and the involvement of oxidants in IL-1 signaling may be cell-specific (15Bowie A.G. Moynagh P.N.

In addition, the mechanism of endogenous oxidant involvement is unclear, because none of the signaling elements listed above present obvious redox-responsive switches. Further, the source of oxidants and the mechanism by which oxidants target the NF-κB pathway have not been identified. Human endothelial cells express a functional NADPH oxidase that appears to be essential for transmitting signals initiated by mechanical shear, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat, tumor necrosis factor, phorbol ester, and growth factors (17Wei Z.

Because of the diverse phenotypic responses invoked by these various stimuli, we recently suggested that one basis for signal specificity of reactive oxidants may be through spatial site direction of the NADPH oxidase to relevant signaling complexes. As an example, a two-hybrid screen using the full-length oxidase adapter p47phox yielded the signaling protein TRAF4 as a functional binding partner (22Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Gu Y. Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28051-28057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this latter screen, TRAF4 was the only cDNA recovered, perhaps because of the intramolecular masking of the core binding domains of p47 in the intact molecule. In the present study, we used a truncated p47phox lacking a purported autoinhibitory C terminus as a screening bait and recovered the NF-κB family member p65/RelA. Further evidence suggests the participation of p47phox in RelA phosphorylation and transactivation but not I-κB degradation or translocation of RelA into the nucleus. All of the PCR amplifications for subcloning or mutagenesis were performed with either PfuTurbo (Stratagene) or Pfx Platinum (Invitrogen). All of the new constructs were confirmed by sequencing. pGBKT7-p47, pGBKT7-p47(205–390), pGBKT7-p47(1–205), pGBKT7-p47(1–298), pCINF-p47, pGEX-p47, and p47-GFP were constructed as previously described (18Gu Y.

Full-length RelA was amplified between XhoI andXbaI sites from a HUVEC library and ligated directly into pCI-neo (Promega) to create pCIN-RelA. pNF-κB-luciferase was obtained from Clontech and consisted of four sequential κB consensus sites (GGGAATTTCC) upstream of the herpes simplex virus-TK TATA-like promoter. pRL-TK and pFR-luc were obtained from Promega and Stratagene, respectively. A plasmid expressing Gal4-RelA was the kind gift of Dr. M. Lienhard Schmitz. All of the RelA truncations were derived by PCR amplification of RelA segments between XhoI and XbaI sites with insertion of stop codons, cloning into pCR4-TOPO blunt (Invitrogen), and then subcloning into pCI-neo. pGEX-RelA-PR was constructed by amplification of RelA (301–431) between BamHI andEcoRI sites and ligation into pGEX-2TK. pELAM-luc was previously described (23Cota-Gomez A. Flores N.C. Cruz C. Casullo A. Aw T.Y. Ichikawa H. Schaack J. Scheinman R. Flores S.C. J. Biol.

The mutant was then subcloned into theXbaI and KpnI sites of pShuttle (Clontech) to create pSh-p67(V204A). Adenoviruses harboring wild type p47phox and lacZ were previously described (22Xu Y.C.

Equivalent expression of wild type p47phox and p47(W193R) was demonstrated by Western blot at an equal multiplicity of infection (not shown). lacZ transgene was expressed in >957 of HUVEC. A human endothelial λ phage Gal4-AD library was constructed as previously reported (22Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Gu Y. Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. J. Biol.

Transformants were selected and secondarily transformed with the endothelial library using lithium acetate. A high stringency screen was performed, requiring auxotrophic selection for bait vector (tryptophan), library vector (leucine), and both interaction reporters (histidine and adenine), in addition to lacZ expression (filter lift assay). Positive colonies were restreaked, and single clones were retested. Candidate library plasmids were passaged throughEscherichia coli, stably transformed into AH109, tested for autonomous transactivation, and mated to Y187 yeast harboring the bait vector, and the diploids were retested for auxotrophy andlacZ expression. Interactions between RelA and different p47phox domains were tested by mating Gal4-AD-RelA-transformed AH109 with Y187 expressing Gal4-BD fusions with various p47phoxtruncations and assessing quantitative औ-galactosidase expression. Briefly, the diploids were selected with leucine- and tryptophan-deficient media and replated under selection. Overnight liquid cultures of diploid colonies were diluted and grown to mid-log phase in selection medium, adjusted to identicalA600 readings, then washed twice, and resuspended in 0.3 ml of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4). 0.1 ml of cell suspension was then freeze-thawed three times using liquid nitrogen and vortexed with glass beads, and the supernatant was added to 0.7 ml of Z buffer with 0.277 औ-mercaptoethanol. Color was developed using 0.16 ml ofo-nitrophenyl औ-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z buffer) and stopped with 0.4 ml of 1 mNa2CO3. The tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the A420 was measured. Negative controls included Gal4-BD or Gal4-AD without fusions. BL21-RP E. coli were transformed with pGEX, pGEX-p47, or pGEX-p47(1–298) and induced at 37 °C for 3 h with isopropyl-औ-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were lysed, and GST fusions were captured on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie Blue PAGE. Full-length or truncated RelA was transcribed using the T7 promoter of pCI-neo and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using a kit (TnT quick coupled; Promega). Translated products were assessed on a gel using autoradiography and normalized prior to addition to the binding reaction. Binding, washing, and analysis were performed as described (22Xu Y.C.

Similar studies were performed in the presence of RelA-PR peptide by bacterial expression of GST-RelA (301–431), purification on GSH-Sepharose, and release of the peptide with thrombin cleavage. Phoenix-293 (Fx) cells were electroporated with pCINF-p47, expressing FLAG-tagged full-length p47phox. After 24 h, the cells were extracted at 4 °C for 30 min in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 17 Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmऔ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated once for 5 s, and centrifuged at 6000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were precleared with protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) and then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (clone M2, Sigma) or isotype control, collecting conjugates at 1500 × g between washes. The immunoblots were performed first using anti-RelA (Santa Cruz) and then anti-p47phox (gift of Dr. Bernard Babior). For coprecipitation of endogenous proteins, RelA was immunoprecipitated from HUVEC using mouse anti-RelA (Santa Cruz) followed by immunoblot using rabbit anti-p47phox and then rabbit anti-RelA. To assess tyrosine phosphorylation, HUVEC were transfected with pCIneo, pSh-p67(V204A), or pCIN-RelA-PR, stimulated with 2 ng/ml human IL-1औ (Peprotech) for varying times, and then lysed as above. IL-1RI was immunoprecipitated (rabbit polyclonal N-20, Santa Cruz) after adjusting for total protein, and an immunoblot for phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was performed. HUVEC were electroporated with p47-GFP with or without RelA-PR and then grown on fibronectin-coated slides. Following IL-1औ stimulation, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 37 formaldehyde in PBS, washed twice, and permeabilized in 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.57 Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were blocked with 37 bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with anti-RelA (Santa Cruz) at 1:200 in 17 bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes in 17 PBS, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (1:400) at room temperature for 1 h. After two washes in 17 bovine serum albumin and two washes in PBS, the cells were mounted with ProLong antifade (Molecular Probes), and the images acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV LSM 410 laser scanning system. For assessment of NF-κB activation, HUVEC were first infected with the appropriate adenovirus for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of 1:100, recovered overnight and then synchronized at the G1-S transition with thymidine. Six hours after thymidine release, the cells were electroporated with pNF-κB-luciferase and pRL-TK. 24 h later, the cells were stimulated with 2 ng/ml IL-1औ. The cells were lysed 6 h later, and both firefly and Renilla luciferase were assessed using a dual luciferase kit (Promega). All of the signals were normalized using the Renilla transfection control, which did not significantly change with transgene expression or IL-1औ stimulation. Activation of RelA was assessed by cotransfection of HUVEC with the Gal4-BD-RelA fusion, the Gal4-luciferase reporter pFR-luc, and pRL-TK. Transactivation of the Gal4 minimal promoter was assessed 6 h after IL-1औ addition and was normalized toRenilla luciferase. NF-κB activity was also assessed by transactivation of the E-selectin promoter. HUVEC were transfected after cell cycle synchronization using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with pELAM-luc and pRL-TK. Either pCIN-RelA (301–341), pSh-p67(V204A), or pCIneo were cotransfected. After 24 h, the cells were stimulated with IL-1औ (2 ng/ml) for 6 h, and the luciferase activity was measured. In some studies, HUVEC were treated with diphenylene iodonium (DPI; 10 ॖm) or MnTBAP (100 ॖm) for 30 min prior to IL-औ1 stimulation. HUVEC were infected with respective adenoviruses for 1 h as above and the following day were stimulated with IL-1औ for 30 min prior to lysis in cold lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 10 ॖg/ml pepstatin A) on ice for 15 min.

For supershift assays, the nuclear extracts were incubated with respective antibodies for 30 min prior to addition of the labeled probe. All of the supershift antibodies were from Santa Cruz. The samples were fractionated on a 47 acrylamide gel prior to autoradiography. After infection with adenoviruses, HUVEC were stimulated with IL-1औ (2 ng/ml) and lysed at various time intervals. Equal protein equivalents of lysate were loaded onto 127 PAGE gels and immunoblotted for I-κBα to assess degradation. For RelA translocation, HUVEC nuclei were isolated and extracted as above, and equal protein equivalents were immunoblotted with anti-RelA (Santa Cruz). After infection with adenoviruses, HUVEC were serum-starved overnight and then incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min. [32P]Orthophosphate (100 ॖCi/ml) and 17 fetal calf serum were then added, and the cells were incubated for another 4 h. After stimulation with IL-1औ (2 ng/ml) for 10 min, the cells were lysed on ice for 5 min in lysis buffer containing 0.17 SDS and 0.57 deoxycholate. The cells were sheared through a 23-gauge needle 10 times and pelleted at 13,000 × g for 15 min. After preclearing and normalization for protein, RelA was immunoprecipitated and washed four times in lysis buffer with SDS and deoxycholate, twice in lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and once in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0. One third of the immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted for RelA, and the remainder was analyzed by autoradiography. Oxidant production was assessed as the oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF; Molecular Probes) (18Gu Y. Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, HUVEC were cotransfected with pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech) and either pCIneo, pCIN-RelA (301–431), or pSh-p67(V204A). After 24 h, the cells were loaded with 10 ॖm DCF for 20 min, washed extensively, stimulated with IL-1औ (2 ng/ml) for 5 min, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The DCF fluorescence (FL1 channel) of DsRed-expressing cells (FL2 channel) was assessed. Separation of red and green channels was established using cells expressing DsRed, cells loaded with DCF, and cells with both or neither. To relieve autoinhibitory folding of the p47phox bait protein, we deleted the C-terminal 92 residues containing two proposed proline-rich motifs and all of the serines known to be phosphorylated in p47phox of stimulated phagocytes (25Johnson J.L.

This truncation appears to be equivalent to a phosphorylated full-length p47phox in opening core binding domains (26Ago T. Nunoi H. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33644-33653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Shiose A. Sumimoto H. J. Biol.

Upon screening the HUVEC GAL4-AD library, three clones were identified that encoded RelA in frame with the GAL4-AD. All three clones encoded residues 170–551, encompassing part of the N-terminal Rel homology domain, a mid-protein region of unknown function, and the C-terminal transactivation domains. Using a yeast mating technique, binding of RelA to p47(1–298) was confirmed (Fig.1a). In contrast, RelA did not bind to the full-length p47phox protein, consistent with masking of the RelA binding site by the C terminus of p47phox. Deletion analysis suggested binding of RelA to the tandem SH3 domains of p47phox (153–286) but not to the N-terminal PX domain (4–125) or C-terminal tail containing proline- and arginine-rich domains. Although each SH3 domain bound RelA in isolation, SH3a (153–219) bound its target with 2.3-fold greater avidity compared with SH3b (223–286) as measured by lacZexpression. The binding of SH3a to RelA appeared to depend on its SH3 surface and not some unrelated colocalized motif, because destruction of the tryptophan bridge (p47(153–219;R193)) (18Gu Y. Xu Y.C. Wu R.F.

Unexpectedly, SH3a when accompanied by the N-terminal half of the protein (1–205), and SH3b, when accompanied by the C terminus (205–390), did not bind RelA. Although it is thought that full-length p47phox in its native configuration involves intramolecular interactions between SH3a and the C-terminal tail (28de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as well as SH3b and the N-terminal PX domain (30Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), it is likely that binding function in these truncated derivatives is lost because of intramolecular masking of SH3a by the PX domain and SH3b by the C terminus. This would suggest that the binding domains of p47phox are not entirely functionally independent and may adopt alternate tertiary structures based on the specific truncation. RelA also bound GST-p47(1–298) in vitro (Fig.1b), suggesting a direct binding between proteins. The smaller, ∼54–58-kDa protein seen in this figure is consistent and specifically binds GST-p47(1–298), likely representing a partially translated or proteolyzed RelA fragment. Lack of RelA binding to the full-length GST-p47(1–390) is consistent with the yeast mating data. In whole cells, endogenous RelA specifically coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged full-length p47phox (Fig. 1c), suggesting that in mammalian cells the RelA-binding site of p47phox is at least partially exposed. In support of this interpretation, endogenous p47phox coprecipitated with endogenous RelA in unstimulated HUVEC, suggesting a preformed complex (Fig. 1d). Binding did not quantitatively increase following IL-1औ stimulation, suggesting a constitutive nature for this interaction in endothelial cells. Transactivation of an NF-κB consensus-luciferase reporter by IL-1औ was consistently low (1227 of control) in Ad-lacZ-infected HUVEC (Fig.2, a and b). This did not appear to be due to spurious effects of adenoviral infection, interference with the normalizing Renilla reporter, passage number, transfection technique, or low specific activity of IL-1औ (data not shown) and may suggest that transactivation of this artificial promoter construct in HUVEC by IL-1औ is fundamentally inefficient. Indeed, in a recent report, fluorocytometric enrichment of high responding HUVEC clones stably transfected with an NF-κB reporter was required to demonstrate response to IL-1औ (31Takehana K. Konishi A. Oonuki A. Noguchi M. Fujita K. Iino Y. Kobayashi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Despite this low efficiency, overexpression of p47phox, while having minimal effect alone, increased IL-1औ-stimulated NF-κB-luciferase activity 2-fold above control (Fig. 2b). Overexpression of the oxidase-inactive mutant p47(R193), which also would not be expected to bind RelA, had no effect on IL-1औ-induced NF-κB-luciferase activity. A similar pattern was observed for the transactivating activity of RelA specifically. The minimal induction of Gal4-RelA by IL-1औ was potentiated by p47phox overexpression (Fig.2c). In contrast to activation of RelA, its nuclear translocation and DNA binding did not appear to be affected by p47phoxoverexpression. IL-1औ increased NF-κB DNA binding in Ad-lacZ-infected HUVEC, and overexpression of p47phox did not alter either basal or IL-1औ-stimulated gel shift patterns (Fig. 3a). The nucleoproteins in both Ad-lacZ (not shown) and Ad-p47-infected HUVEC stimulated with IL-1औ (Fig. 3b) contained both RelA and p50 (NF-κB1)."

To investigate the role of SNAPc for TBP function at U6 promoters, TBP recruitment assays were performed using full-length TBP and a mini-SNAPc containing SNAP43, SNAP50, and a truncated SNAP190. Mini-SNAPc efficiently recruits TBP to the U6 TATA box, and two SNAPc subunits, SNAP43 and SNAP190, directly interact with the TBP DNA binding domain. Truncated SNAP190 containing only the Myb DNA binding domain is sufficient for TBP recruitment to the TATA box. Therefore, the SNAP190 Myb domain functions both to specifically recognize the proximal sequence element present in the core promoters of human snRNA genes and to stimulate TBP recognition of the neighboring TATA box present in human U6 snRNA promoters. The SNAP190 Myb domain also stimulates complex assembly with TBP and Brf2, a subunit of a snRNA-specific TFIIIB complex. Thus, interactions between the DNA binding domains of SNAP190 and TBP at juxtaposed promoter elements define the assembly of a RNA polymerase III-specific preinitiation complex.

The recruitment of a specific RNA polymerase to a given promoter is dictated by the nature of the preinitiation complex (1Paule M.R. White R.J.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar); however, the molecular determinants for RNA polymerase specificity are not known. One possibility is that recruitment of TBP1 complexes containing distinct cadres of TBP-associated factors (TAFs) may confer polymerase specificity. For example, the TBP complexes SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB are multiprotein TBP·TAF complexes that are required for transcription by RNA polymerases I, II, and III, respectively (for review, see Refs.5Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 44-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Meyers R.E. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell.

These various TBP·TAF complexes play crucial roles by serving as targets for regulatory proteins and providing specific promoter recognition functions. Once recruited to a promoter, TBP·TAF complexes further provide an important structural façade during preinitiation complex assembly to recruit other general transcription factors dedicated to transcription by a specific RNA polymerase. In contrast to the well characterized TBP complexes that function for transcription of most genes, how TBP is recruited to human small nuclear (sn) RNA gene promoters is understood less well. None of the aforementioned TBP·TAF complexes appears to function at these genes (8Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 9Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Human snRNA genes are unusual because they have similar promoters, and yet some snRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (e.g. U1) and others by RNA polymerase III (e.g. U6) (for review, see Refs. 10Hernandez N. McKnight S. Yamamoto K. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 281-313Google Scholar and 11Lobo S.M. Hernandez N.T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 127-159Google Scholar). Thus, these genes serve as an important model for understanding the mechanisms of polymerase specificity (12Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26733-26736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Each gene contains a proximal sequence element (PSE) in the core promoter which recruits the general transcription factor SNAPc (9Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which is also known as proximal sequence element transcription factor (13Murphy S. Yoon J.B. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3247-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or proximal sequence element binding protein (14Waldschmidt R. Wanandi I. Seifart K.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2595-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Substoichiometric levels of TBP copurify with SNAPc during the biochemical fractionation of SNAPc from HeLa cell nuclear extracts (15Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and fractions enriched for SNAPc restore U1 snRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II to HeLa cell extracts that have been immunodepleted of endogenous TBP (9Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, SNAPc may play an important role in recruiting TBP to the TATA-less promoters of RNA polymerase II-transcribed snRNA genes. In contrast, the TBP present in the SNAPc-enriched fractions does not support U6 transcription by RNA polymerase III (9Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). One key difference between RNA polymerase II- and III-transcribed snRNA genes is the presence of a TATA box in the core promoter of RNA polymerase III-transcribed snRNA genes. TBP binds to this TATA box only poorly but is stimulated by SNAPc. Furthermore, the combination of the PSE and TATA box directs transcription by RNA polymerase III, and mutation of either promoter element switches transcription to RNA polymerase II (16Das G. Hinkley C.S. Herr W. Nature. 1995; 374: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SNAPc-mediated recruitment of TBP or TBP complexes acting at the TATA box is a key step in assembling the specific preinitiation complex that preferentially recruits RNA polymerase III. Thus, depending upon the promoter context, SNAPc may recruit a different TBP complex that determines the type of RNA polymerase recruited to a snRNA promoter. For most RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes, the TFIIIB complex, which is composed of TBP with the tightly associated TFIIB-related factor (Brf1) and a loosely associated factor called Bdp1 (originally named B“) (18Willis I.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1337-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), nucleates preinitiation complex assembly (19Simmen K.A. Bernues J. Lewis J.D. Mattaj I.W.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcription of these genes depends upon other TFIIIB-like complexes that contain Brf1-related factors. Two different Brf-like factors have been proposed to function for human snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase III. One Brf-related factor, called Brf2 (originally named BRFU/TFIIIB50) (18Willis I.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1337-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), shows limited similarity to Brf1, including the zinc ribbon domain and the TFIIB-related repeats, and functions specifically for transcription of human U6 genes (30Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Teichmann M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14200-14205Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another related factor, called Brf1_v2 (originally named Brf2) (18Willis I.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1337-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), is an alternatively spliced form of Brf1 which contains the TFIIB-related repeat 2 and additional carboxyl-terminal sequences that are unique to Brf1_v2 and also acts to support human U6 transcription (32McCulloch V. Hardin P. Peng W. Ruppert J.M. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both Brf2 (33Cabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Brf1_v2 (32McCulloch V. Hardin P. Peng W. Ruppert J.M. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) can interact with TBP through the TFIIB-related repeat 2. Neither Brf2 nor Brf1_v2 appears to be tightly associated with TBP or Bdp1 in the absence of DNA binding by TBP (30Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32McCulloch V. Hardin P. Peng W. Ruppert J.M. Lobo-Ruppert S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4134-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, Brf2 does stimulate TBP binding to the TATA box in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), and it may make DNA contacts surrounding the TATA box (33Cabart P. Murphy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43056-43064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The circumstances whereby Brf2, Brf1_v2, or both factors are used for human U6 transcription are currently unclear. To understand how TBP is specifically recruited to human U6 snRNA gene promoters, we have examined those proteins within SNAPcwhich are important for interactions with TBP and for cooperative DNA binding of the U6 promoters by both SNAPc and TBP. We find that three subunits of SNAPc (SNAP43, SNAP45, and SNAP190) can interact individually with the TBP DNA binding domain. Thus, SNAPc may make extensive contacts with TBP. Further analysis of SNAP43 and SNAP190 indicate that the SNAP190 Myb DNA binding domain plays a pivotal role in TBP recruitment and stimulates assembly of a complex containing TBP and the TFIIIB factor Brf2. The juxtaposition of the PSE and TATA elements at human U6 promoters suggests that the DNA binding domains of SNAP190 and TBP are well positioned to facilitate these interactions during the early stages of preinitiation complex assembly. The unique architecture of SNAP190 and TBP at human U6 promoters thus may define whether RNA polymerase III-specific TFIIIB factors are specifically recruited to these genes. Inserts encoding amino- or carboxyl-terminal truncations of SNAPc proteins or human TBP were generated by PCR amplification and cloned into pET11c-derived vectors. GST-SNAP190 RaRbRcRd contains amino acids 283–518, and GST-SNAP190 RcRd contains amino acids 390–518. Internal deletions were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Stratagene. Proteins used in the EMSAs were expressed as GST fusions in Escherichia coliBL21-CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene). Proteins were purified from crude lysates on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and if necessary, the GST moiety was removed by digestion with thrombin. Proteins were purified further by ion exchange chromatography. Brf2 was expressed and purified as described previously (30Schramm L. Pendergrast P.S. Sun Y. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2650-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For Fig. 6, mini-SNAPc was assembled and purified by ion exchange chromatography prior to use in EMSA. Purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer D80 containing 20 mmHEPES pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 80 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, and 1 μm pepstatin A. GST pulldown assays were done essentially as described previously (34Hirsch H.A. Gu L. Henry R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9182-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mini-SNAPc was assembled for 2 h at room temperature using ∼200 ng of each individual wild-type or mutant SNAP43, SNAP50, and SNAP190 (1–505) protein. Approximately 3 μg of SNAP19 was included in reactions to assemble complexes containing SNAP190 (1–505) proteins with internal deletions. Approximately one-third of each assembly reaction was then used in EMSA using DNA probes containing a wild-type or mutant mouse U6 PSE with a wild-type or mutant human U6 TATA box as described previously (9Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All DNA binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl total volume. DNA binding reactions using only SNAPc were performed in a buffer containing 60 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 μg of pUC119 plasmid. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature after which 5,000 cpm of probe was added, and reactions were incubated an additional 20 min. Samples were fractionated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (39:1) in TGE running buffer (50 mmTris, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA). Reactions containing both SNAPc and TBP were performed in a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.07% Tween 20, 0.2 μg of poly(dG-dC), and 0.2 μg of pUC119 plasmid. Reactions with SNAP190 RcRd and TBP also contained 0.5 μl of fetal bovine serum and 50 mm NaF but lacked KCl. The samples were fractionated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (39:1) in TGEM running buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2). Reactions also containing Brf2 were performed in a buffer containing 10 mmHEPES pH 7.9, 20 mm Tris pH 8.4, 60 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 12 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of poly(dG-dC), and 0.2 μg of pUC119 plasmid. Reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice after which 5,000 cpm of probe was added, and reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were fractionated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (39:1) containing 1× TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mmboric acid, 2 mm EDTA) and 2.5% glycerol in 0.5 × TBE running buffer. Recruitment of TBP to the TATA box is a crucial early step in preinitiation complex assembly at human U6 snRNA promoters (for review, see Refs. 12Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26733-26736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar and 36Henry R.W. Ford E. Mital R. Mittal V. Hernandez N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This step is facilitated by SNAPc, which has two important roles in this process. First, interactions between SNAPc and TBP relieve negative regulation by the amino-terminal domain of TBP and allow the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain of TBP to bind efficiently to the TATA box. Second, cooperative interactions between SNAPc and TBP increase promoter occupancy by both SNAPc and TBP (35Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring SNAPc contains at least five proteins SNAP19, SNAP43, SNAP45, SNAP50, and SNAP190 (15Henry R.W.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5419-5426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a baculovirus-expressed mini-SNAPc with only three proteins, SNAP43, SNAP50, and SNAP190 containing amino acids 1–514 is sufficient for recruiting TBP to a U6 snRNA TATA box (43Mittal V. Ma B. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1807-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate further the role of SNAPc for TBP recruitment to human U6 promoters, mini-SNAPc containing SNAP43, SNAP50, and SNAP190 (1–505) was assembled from bacterially expressed proteins and tested for DNA binding ability and recruitment of TBP to the U6 TATA box. As shown in Fig. 1A, none of the individual bacterially expressed SNAPc proteins could effectively bind to DNA containing a wild-type PSE (lanes 2–4). Similarly, little DNA binding activity was observed for reactions containing pairwise combinations of SNAP50 plus SNAP190 (1–505), SNAP43 plus SNAP190 (1–505), or SNAP43 plus SNAP50 (lanes 5, 9, and 13, respectively). However, as increasing amounts of SNAP43 (lanes 6–8), SNAP50 (lanes 10–12), or SNAP190 (1–505) (lanes 14–16) were added to reactions containing the remaining two proteins, significant levels of DNA binding activity were observed. The minicomplex specifically recognizes the PSE because no DNA binding activity was observed on DNA probes containing a mutant PSE (lane 17). Therefore, efficient PSE-specific DNA binding activity requires all three proteins, SNAP43, SNAP50, and SNAP190 (1–505). To determine whether mini-SNAPc can efficiently recruit TBP to the U6 TATA box, EMSAs were performed with mini-SNAPcand full-length human TBP (Fig. 1B). As expected, full-length human TBP alone did not bind appreciably to a probe containing both a PSE and a TATA box (lane 2) or to a similar probe containing mutations in the TATA box (lane 18). None of the SNAPc proteins either alone (lanes 3–5) or in pairwise combination (lanes 6–8) showed significant DNA binding to a probe with a wild-type PSE. The combination of all three proteins (labeled mrSNAPc) resulted in significant DNA binding to the wild-type probe (lane 9) but not to a probe containing mutations in the PSE (data not shown). Recombinant human TBP was then added to these SNAPc proteins to examine their ability to recruit TBP to the U6 TATA box. When incubated with recombinant TBP, none of the SNAPc proteins either alone or in pairwise combination showed significant DNA binding to probes containing a wild-type PSE and either a wild-type (lanes 10–15) or mutant (lanes 19–24) TATA box. In contrast, mini-SNAPc efficiently recruited human TBP to a probe containing both a wild-type PSE and TATA box as evidenced by the formation of a complex that migrated more slowly than that observed with mini-SNAPc alone (compare lane 16 withlane 9). Recruitment of TBP by SNAPc was cooperative as evidenced by the dramatic increase in DNA binding by TBP in the presence of mini-SNAPc (compare the uppercomplex in lane 16 with lane 2). Mutations in the TATA box did not affect DNA binding by mini-SNAPc but abolished formation of the mini-SNAPc·TBP·DNA complex (lane 25). Thus, as demonstrated with recombinant mini-SNAPc expressed in insect cells by baculovirus infection (43Mittal V. Ma B. Hernandez N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1807-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), mini-SNAPc assembled from bacterially expressed proteins is able to recruit TBP to the U6 snRNA TATA box, and these interactions are dependent upon both the PSE and TATA box promoter elements. Furthermore, these results show that SNAP19, SNAP45, or other eukaryotic proteins that may associate with recombinant SNAPc are not required for either PSE-specific binding or TBP recruitment to the U6 TATA box. As a first step to determine which SNAPc proteins are required for TBP recruitment, interactions between individual SNAPcproteins and human TBP were analyzed by GST pulldown assays. Previously, it was demonstrated that the TBP COOH-terminal DNA binding domain and two regions of the NH2 terminus are important for cooperative DNA binding by SNAPc and TBP (35Mittal V. Hernandez N. Science. 1997; 275: 1136-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These regions from the NH2 terminus include amino acids 1–54 and the Q-rich region containing amino acids 55–95 (Fig.2A). Therefore, we also tested interactions between SNAPc proteins and TBP proteins that lacked these regions of the NH2 terminus. As shown in Fig.2B, three SNAPc subunits, SNAP190 (1–719), SNAP45, and SNAP43, interacted well with full-length GST-TBP (1–335) in these assays (lane 2), and these interactions were specific because no interaction was observed with GST protein (lane 5) or beads alone (lane 6). In similar assays, full-length SNAP190 (1–1469) also interacted well with full-length TBP (data not shown). Moreover, the DNA binding domain of TBP was sufficient for interactions with all three SNAPcproteins because no significant difference for interactions involving full-length GST-TBP (1–335) (lane 2), GST-TBP (96–335) (lane 3), or GST-TBP (159–335) (lane 4) was observed. These results suggest that TBP makes extensive contacts with SNAPc and that the COOH-terminal DNA binding domain of TBP is important for interactions with SNAPc. Although interactions involving both SNAP43 and SNAP45 with TBP have been described previously (15Henry R.W. Sadowski C.L. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Nature. 1995; 374: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Sadowski C.L. Henry R.W. Kobayashi R. Hernandez N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Yoon J.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the current observations reveal that a previously uncharacterized interaction between SNAP190 and TBP may contribute to SNAPc function for human snRNA gene transcription. Of the proteins present within mini-SNAPc, both SNAP43 and SNAP190 protein interacted well with TBP (Fig. 2B). To characterize further the interactions between SNAP43 and TBP, regions of SNAP43 which are important for mediating interactions with TBP were mapped by GST pulldown assays. SNAP43 proteins containing NH2- or COOH-terminal truncations were tested for interactions with GST-TBP (1–335) and also with GST-SNAP50. The data for separate experiments testing interactions between SNAP43 proteins and either GST-TBP or GST-SNAP50 are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively, and a summary of the results is shown in Fig.3C. As expected, significant interactions of full-length SNAP43 (1–368) with both GST-TBP and GST-SNAP50 were observed. Interestingly, SNAP43 containing only the NH2-terminal 168 amino acids (1–168) interacted well with SNAP50 but not with TBP. In contrast, the COOH-terminal region of SNAP43 containing amino acids 169–368 interacted well with both TBP and SNAP50. These interactions are specific because the SNAP43 proteins did not interact with GST protein (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3) or the beads alone (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 4). Ma and Hernandez (44Ma B. Hernandez N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5027-5035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) did not detect an interaction between SNAP50 and the COOH-terminal region of SNAP43 using coimmunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that this interaction is weak. These observations suggest that SNAP50 makes extensive interactions with at least two separate regions of SNAP43. Furthermore, a major region for TBP interaction with SNAP43 is contained within amino acids 169–368. To determine the contribution of SNAP43 for TBP recruitment to the U6 TATA box we then took advantage of the observation that both halves of SNAP43 could interact with SNAP50 and SNAP190 (1–505) (Fig.3B and data not shown) and could therefore potentially form a mini-SNAPc. First, the ability of each half of SNAP43 to form DNA-binding competent complexes with SNAP50 and SNAP190 (1–505) was tested using an EMSA, and the results are shown in Fig.3D. As with full-length SNAP43 (1–368) (lane 4), both SNAP43 (1–168) and SNAP43 (169–368) assembled into complexes capable of efficient DNA binding (lanes 7 and 10, respectively). In all cases, DNA binding by these complexes was PSE-specific because no DNA binding was observed using a probe with a mutant PSE (data not shown). These observations suggest that SNAP43 is essential for DNA binding by mini-SNAPc, but no single region of SNAP43 is critical. Thus, it appears that SNAP43 coordinates DNA binding by SNAP50 and SNAP190, and either half of SNAP43 is sufficient for this activity. In contrast to strong DNA binding by mini-SNAPc, full-length human TBP (1–335) was unable to bind DNA efficiently in these assays (lanes 2 and3). As expected, TBP is recruited to DNA efficiently by mini-SNAPc containing SNAP43 (1–368) (lanes 5and 6). Complexes assembled with SNAP43 containing either the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 1–168) or COOH-terminal region (amino acids 169–368) were capable of recruiting TBP to the U6 snRNA TATA box (lanes 8, 9 and11, 12, respectively). This result indicates that no single region of SNAP43 is essential for TBP recruitment to the TATA box under the conditions of this assay. This was unexpected in light of the results of the GST pulldown experiments in Fig. 3, A andB, and suggests that interactions other than those involving SNAP43 are sufficient for TBP recruitment to the U6 snRNA TATA box. Both SNAP43 and SNAP190 are capable of interacting with TBP; however, no single region of SNAP43 is essential for recruitment of TBP to the U6 TATA box, and thus it seems possible that interactions between SNAP190 and TBP are important for TBP recruitment. First, to determine whether SNAP190 (1–505) can interact with TBP, interactions between truncated SNAP190 proteins and GST-TBP were tested in GST pulldown experiments. Significant interactions between both SNAP190 (1–900) and SNAP190 (1–719) with GST-TBP (1–335) were observed (Fig.4A, lane 2). Importantly, SNAP190 (1–505) also interacted well with TBP. This interaction was reduced compared with that observed for longer versions of SNAP190, suggesting that amino acids 506–719 influence TBP recruitment, but it still was significantly greater than that observed for SNAP190 (1–164) (compare lane 2 with lane 1for each SNAP190 protein).

Here we report our analysis of a rare but recurring translocation, t(11;15)(q23;q14). This translocation has been described in a small subset of cases with both acute myeloblastic leukemia and ALL. Recent studies have shown that MLL is fused to AF15q14 in the t(11;15). Here we analyse a sample from another patient with this translocation and confirm the presence of an MLL-AF15q14 fusion. However, we have also identified and cloned another fusion transcript from the same patient sample. In this fusion transcript, MLL is fused to a novel gene, MLL partner containing FYVE domain (MPFYVE). Both MLL-AF15q14 and MLL-MPFYVE are in-frame fusion transcripts with the potential to code for novel fusion proteins. MPFYVE is also located on chromosome 15, approximately 170 kb telomeric to AF15q14. MPFYVE contains a highly conserved motif, the FYVE domain which, in other proteins, has been shown to bind to phosphotidyl-inositol-3 phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). The MLL-MPFYVE fusion may be functionally important in the leukemia process in at least some patients containing this translocation."

Knowledge of the distribution of different GABAA receptor subtypes, both anatomically and developmentally, is therefore essential for understanding the physiological actions of GABA and the pharmacological actions of drugs that act on different GABAA receptor subtypes. Cerebellar granule neurons are used for studying neuronal signaling and development because they have a relatively simple morphology and receive most of their inhibitory input from one cell type (for review, see Ref. 20Wisden W. Korpi E.R. Bahn S. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1139-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). When cultured in serum-based medium, cerebellar granule neurons express a wide range of receptors and develop stimulus-coupled glutamate release (21Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the developing cerebellum, granule neurons express GABAA receptor α2-, α3-, औ3-, γ1-, and γ2-subunit genes (5Laurie D.J. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4151-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These subunits are replaced in the adult cerebellum where α1, α6, औ2, औ3, γ2, and δ predominate (4Laurie D.J.

The α6 subunit is expressed almost exclusively in cerebellar granule neurons, where it marks neuronal maturation. A similar development evidently occurs in cultures of rat cerebellar granule neurons (e.g. Refs. 23Thompson C.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 52: 2037-2044Google Scholar, 24Mathews G.C.

It is well known that elevated extracellular K+concentrations or other calcium-elevating stimuli promote long term survival of rat cerebellar granule neurons in dissociated cultures (21Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological extracellular K+ concentration is ∼ 5 mm, but cerebellar granule neuronal cultures are often maintained in 25 mm K+ to enhance survival (21Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balazs R. Jorgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This use of chronic depolarization is questionable, because it affects the subunit gene expression of neurotransmitter receptors and, hence, the receptor composition and function.

Res. 1995; 28: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Gault L.M. Siegel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2391-2399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse (37Mellor J.R. Merlo D. Jones A. Wisden W. Randall A.D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2822-2833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cerebellar granule neurons. Kainate is sometimes used to eliminate GABAergic neurons from cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (38Schousboe A. Meier E. Drejer J. Hertz L. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 203-206Google Scholar). As a glutamate receptor agonist, it causes depolarization (39Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar), but its effect on GABAA receptor subunit expression is not as well described as that of K+. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of extracellular K+ and kainate on cell viability and on the expression of 13 different GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in cultures of mouse cerebellar granule neurons. The role of membrane potential in mediating the effects of K+ and kainate was assessed by correlating the effects on membrane potential and on mRNA expression. Finally, the relative contribution of the α6 subunit to receptor function was estimated from the sensitivity of the receptors to GABA and to the α6 selective antagonist furosemide (11Korpi E.R. Kuner T. Seeburg P.H. Lüddens H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared from 6–8-day-old NMRI mice (Taconic M&B) according to a procedure modified from Courtney et al. (40Courtney M.J. Åkerman K.E.O. Coffey E.T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4201-4211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Schousboe et al. (38Schousboe A. Meier E. Drejer J. Hertz L. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 203-206Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsin (0.25 mg/ml, Sigma)-dissociated and DNase (50 units/ml, Sigma)-treated cells were plated at ∼300,000 cells/cm2 in 35-mm Petri dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 31 mm glucose, 0.2 mm glutamine (Sigma), 4 ॖg/liter insulin (Sigma), 7.3 ॖm p-aminobenzoic acid (Sigma), and 50 units/ml penicillin (LEO Pharma). As appropriate, the medium was further supplemented with 20 mm KCl (to a final K+ concentration of 25 mm) and/or 50 ॖm kainate (Sigma). Culture medium was replaced after ∼24 h with the inclusion of 10 ॖm cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) to reduce non-neuronal proliferation; after this treatment the medium was not changed. The cells were cultured in a humidified 57 CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The cultures were used in experiments within 12 days in vitro (DIV). The amount of viable cells in the cerebellar granule neuron cultures was quantified using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described (41Jensen J.B. Schousboe A. Pickering D.S. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 32: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide is reduced to formazan by cells that have functional mitochondria; this process has been shown to correlate well with cell viability (42Mossman T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45027) Google Scholar). The cultures were tested at 7 and 12 DIV. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed as previously described (43Johansen F.F. Lambolez B. Audinat E. Bochet P. Rossier J. Neurochem. Int. 1995; 26: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cultures were tested at 7 and 12 DIV. Primers (TableI) for the GABAA receptor subunits α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, औ1, औ2, औ3, γ1, γ2, γ3, and δ were used. Briefly, RNA was isolated with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) after lysis of the cells, and the concentration and purification of RNA was measured on a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec4000, Pharmacia Biosciences). cDNA was synthesized using 0.25 ॖg of RNA, and 1 ॖl of the resulting mixture was used for PCR for each subunit. cDNA amplifications were performed in 42 cycles, and aliquots (15 of 100 ॖl in total) of the PCR products were taken from cycles 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42. Relative intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained bands on gels were measured using computer-assisted image analysis and compared with the 400-bp band of the molecular weight marker (100 Base-Pair-Ladder, Amersham Biosciences) added in fixed amount for all gels. Because the efficiency of the PCR amplification is primer-dependent, the relative intensities could not be compared between different subunit mRNAs.Table IThe GABAA receptor subunits and the primer sequences for their mRNASubunitSequencePrimerα15′-AGCTATACCCCTAACTTAGCCAGG-3′Up5′-AGAAAGCGATTCTCAGTGCAGAGG-3′Lowα25′-ACAAGAAGCCAGAGAACAAGCCAG-3′Up5′-GAGGTCTACTGGTAAGCTCTACCA-3′Lowα35′-CAACATAGTGGGAACCACCTATGC-3′Up5′-GGGGTTTGGGATTTTGGATGCTTC-3′Lowα45′-AAATGCAGCTGAGACTATCTCTGC-3′Up5′-AGACAGTCTGTATTTCCATCACGG-3′Lowα55′-CAAGAAGGCCTTGGAAGCAGCTAA-3′Up5′-TCTTACTTTGGAGAGGTAGCCCCT-3′Lowα65′-AAGCCCCCGGTAGCAAAGTCAAAA-3′Up5′-TTCCTGGCTGCAAACTACTCGACA-3′Lowऔ15′-CCTGGAAATCAGGAATGAGACCAG-3′Up5′-GGAGTCTAAACCGAACCATGAGAC-3′Lowऔ25′-TGAGATGGCCACATCAGAAGCAGT-3′Up5′-TCATGGGAGGCTGGAGTTTAGTTC-3′Lowऔ35′-GAAATGAATGAGGTTGCAGGCAGC-3′Up5′-CAGGCAGGGTAATATTTCACTCAG-3′Lowγ15′-CAGAGACAGGAAGCTGAAAAGCAA-3′Up5′-CGAAGTGATTATATTGGACTAAGC-3′Lowγ25′-CTTCTTCGGATGTTTTCCTCTAAG-3′Up5′-TTCGTGAGATTCAGCGAATAAGAC-3′Lowγ35′-CACCACGGTGCTAACCATGACCAC-3′Up5′-TCCTCATAGCAGCAGAAGAAGCTC-3′Lowδ5′-TGAGGAACGCCATTGTCCTCTTCT-3′Up5′-ACCACCGCACGTGGTACATGTAAA-3′Low Open table in a new tab Before recordings, the culture medium was exchanged for an extracellular recording solution (artificial balanced salt solution (ABSS)), and the Petri dish with cells was transferred to an inverted phase-contrast Zeiss Axiovert 10 microscope stage. The cells were constantly perfused with ABSS (0.5 ml/min) at room temperature from a gravity-fed 7-barrel perfusion pipette (List) ∼100 ॖm from the recorded neuron. By switching application from one barrel to another, the extracellular solution surrounding the neuron was exchanged with a time constant of ∼50 ms. Individual cerebellar granule neurons were approached with micropipettes of 3–5-megaohm resistance manufactured from 1.5-mm-outer-diameter glass (World Precision Instruments). Standard patch clamp technique (44Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar) in current or voltage clamp mode was used to record from neurons in the whole-cell configuration using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik). Whole-cell membrane currents and potentials were plotted on a low fidelity chart recorder during the experiment and stored on computer hard disk and video tape using a VR-100 digital data recorder (Instrutech). For recordings of the membrane potentials with extracellular K+ concentration = 5 mm (physiological K+), the cells were perfused with ABSS composed of 138.5 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.35. For recordings with extracellular K+ concentration = 25 mm (depolarizing K+) the concentration of NaCl was reduced to 118.5 mm, and the concentration of KCl was increased to 25 mm. Kainate was dissolved in ABSS to a final concentration of 50 ॖm, where indicated. The intrapipette solution contained 10 mm NaCl, 130 mm potassium gluconate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgATP, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Initially the cells were perfused with “physiological” ABSS containing 5 mm K+without kainate. The perfusion was then switched to ABSS with either 25 mm K+ or 50 ॖm kainate or both. After a new stable membrane potential was reached, the perfusion was switched back to physiological ABSS. Each of the depolarizing solutions was tested at least twice on each cell. Membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials. In experiments addressing the GABA concentration-response relationships or furosemide sensitivities, the ABSS contained 140 mmNaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.35. The intrapipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 1mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2mm MgATP, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. The neurons were voltage-clamped at −60 mV. The high intracellular Cl− concentration shifted the Cl− reversal potential to ∼0 mV and substantially increased the currents recorded at −60 mV. Series resistance was 657 compensated. GABA (Sigma) was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration at least 100× greater than that required for perfusion and diluted with ABSS. Furosemide (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and diluted with ABSS; the content of Me2SO in the final solution was at most 0.17 and had no effect of its own on membrane current. Different concentrations of GABA were applied for 5 s at 1-min intervals. Furosemide was preapplied for 10 s immediately before the application of a premixed solution of GABA and furosemide. Between drug applications the cell was perfused with ABSS. Membrane currents and potentials were analyzed using Pulse (HEKA Elektronik) and Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) software. Current responses were quantified by measuring the peak current during application of GABA or GABA plus furosemide. GABA concentration-response relationships were fitted to the equation,I=Imax×[GABA]nEC50n+[GABA]nEquation 1 where I is the peak membrane current induced by the GABA concentration, [GABA], Imax is the maximum peak current that GABA can induce, EC50 is the GABA concentration eliciting 507 of Imax, andn is the Hill coefficient. Data were described using mean and S.E. or 957 confidence intervals. Mean values were compared using either Student'st test or analysis of variance (ANOVA); when relevant, the Tukey test was used as a means of post-hoc multiple comparisons. Two-way ANOVA was used to separate the effects of two variables and determine their interaction. Probabilities (p) < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The term “occlusion” refers to situations where the effect due to simultaneous variation of two variables was smaller than the sum of the effects due to variation of each variable separately. Fig.1 shows the influence of the culture medium as well as the extracellular recording solution (ABSS) on the membrane potentials of the neurons. The same K+ and kainate concentrations were used for the culture media and extracellular recording solutions: 5 or 25 mm K+ and 0 or 50 ॖm kainate. A two-way ANOVA was used to estimate the effects of 1) culture medium and 2) extracellular recording solution on the membrane potential. At 2–3 DIV the membrane potential was independent of the culture medium but significantly dependent on the extracellular recording solution (p = 0.002). This dependence was further analyzed with a two-way ANOVA of the effects of 1) K+ concentration and 2) kainate concentration in the extracellular recording solution. Both K+ and kainate had highly significant depolarizing effects (p < 0.001 for both) and a significant interaction (p = 0.026), suggesting that the depolarizing effect of simultaneously increasing both K+ or kainate concentrations to 25 mm and 50 ॖm, respectively, was not as great as the sum of the depolarizations caused by increasing K+ or kainate separately (occlusion). Indeed, the combined effect of K+ and kainate did not differ significantly from the individual effects (total occlusion). After 7–8 DIV both culture medium and extracellular recording solution showed significant effects (p < 0.001 for both) without interaction, i.e. their effects were additive (two-way ANOVA). The effect of culture medium was further analyzed with two-way ANOVA. Increased K+ (p = 0.004) or kainate (p = 0.034) in the culture medium significantly hyperpolarized the membrane potentials without interaction. The effect of recording solution was also further analyzed. After 7–8 DIV (as at 2–3 DIV), both increased K+ (p < 0.001) and kainate (p < 0.001) concentrations were significantly depolarizing. The combined effect of increased K+ and kainate concentration was smaller than the sum of the individual effects (p < 0.001) but larger than any of the individual effects (p < 0.001, Tukey test), which were not significantly different. Thus, at this point the effects of K+ and kainate concentrations in the extracellular recording solution were only partially occluding. In conclusion, the immediate effects of increasing either K+ (from 5 to 25 mm) or the kainate concentrations (from 0 to 50 ॖm) in the extracellular recording solution were depolarizations of similar magnitude that were occluding and independent of the culture medium. Prolonged exposure to high K+ or kainate concentrations in the culture medium gave rise to hyperpolarization relative to cells grown in a physiological K+ concentration without kainate. This suggests that the neurons develop a compensatory hyperpolarizing mechanism when exposed to depolarizing conditions for an extended period. The membrane potentials of neurons in the different culture media may influence mRNA expression. These membrane potentials were estimated from measurements in extracellular recording solution with the same K+ and kainate concentration as in the culture medium (Fig.1, columns marked with a number sign). At 2–3 DIV elevated K+ concentration significantly depolarized the membrane potential (two-way ANOVA, p = 0.005); on the other hand, the kainate effect was not significant. After 7–8 DIV both K+ (p < 0.001) and kainate (p < 0.001) were significantly depolarizing, but their combined effect was smaller than the sum of the effects of increasing K+ or kainate separately (two-way ANOVA, p< 0.001); moreover, the combined effect was not significantly larger than the individual effects (total occlusion, Tukey test). No spontaneous synaptic potentials or currents were observed in any of the recorded neurons at 2–3 or 7–8 DIV. In addition, no action potentials were observed, even after depolarizations were induced with K+ or kainate. The survival of mouse cerebellar granule neurons in culture was strongly dependent on the concentration of K+in the culture medium as indicated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Fig. 2). 25 mmK+ significantly (p < 0.001) increased the viability of mouse cerebellar granule neurons in culture regardless of the presence or absence of kainate both at 7 and 12 DIV. At 7 DIV kainate significantly (p < 0.01) increased cell viability in cultures grown in 5 mm but not in 25 mm K+, indicating that the effects of K+ and kainate on viability were not additive. The effect of kainate on cell viability was not detectable after 12 DIV. Of the six GABAA receptor α subunit mRNAs tested for, the α1, α2, α5, and α6 mRNAs were expressed in detectable amounts, whereas α3 mRNA and α4 mRNA could not be detected. The level of α5 mRNA was significantly affected by K+and kainate (Fig. 3). At 7 DIV α5 expression was enhanced with 25 mm K+ in the culture medium relative to 5 mm K+(p < 0.001). At 12 DIV both high K+(p < 0.01) and kainate (p < 0.01) enhanced the expression of α5 to similar levels, but the combination of K+ and kainate did not further increase α5. The α6 mRNA was reciprocally affected (Fig. 3). At 7 DIV expression was significantly decreased in 25 mmK+ compared with 5 mm K+(p < 0.001). At 12 DIV both high K+(p < 0.05) and kainate (p < 0.05) inhibited α6 expression to the same extent and with additive effects. The expression of α1 and α2 mRNA was not significantly affected by the concentration of K+ or kainate in the culture media (results not shown). Of the three GABAA receptor औ subunit mRNAs studied, the औ2 and औ3 were expressed in significant quantities, whereas expression of औ1 was not detected. Elevation of the extracellular K+concentration to 25 mm significantly (p < 0.001) decreased the expression of औ2 mRNA in 7 DIV but not in 12 DIV cultures (Fig. 3). Kainate had no effect on neurons cultured for 7 days, but after 12 DIV it significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the expression of औ2 independently of the K+concentration. Expression of औ3 mRNA was not significantly affected by increased K+ or the addition of kainate (results not shown). Of the three GABAA receptor γ subunits, only γ2 was detected. The δ subunit mRNA was also found in significant amounts. Neither 25 mm K+ nor kainate had a significant effect on expression of γ2 mRNA or δ mRNA (results not shown). To investigate whether differences in mRNA expression between cultures were reflected in the functional properties of the derived membrane-bound receptors, we determined GABA concentration-response relationships resulting from the different culture conditions (Fig. 4). The EC50 values and Hill coefficients are listed in TableII. Neurons cultured for 10–12 DIV in 5 mm K+ without kainate had a significantly lower EC50 value than neurons cultured in 25 mmK+ without kainate (p = 0.005). The Hill coefficients were not significantly different from each other.Table IICharacteristics of GABA-induced currents in cerebellar granule neurons cultured in different mediaCulture mediumEC50 valueHill coefficientsॖm25 mmK+/kainate55 (47–64)0.97 (0.86–1.07)25 mm K+65 (51–84)0.85 (0.72–0.99)5 mmK+/kainate55 (42–72)0.89 (0.72–1.07)5 mmK+36 (27–48)2-aThe EC50 of neurons grown in 5 mmK+ without kainate was significantly smaller compared to neurons grown in 25 mm K+ without kainate (p = 0.005).0.73 (0.60–0.86)The values were estimated by non-linear regression analyses of the concentration-response relationships for GABA-induced peak currents shown in Fig. 4.

Recently, data base searching revealed a variant of CHODL (AK022689) with a different 5′ leader sequence derived from a new putative upstream alternative promoter (P2). The P2 promoter gives rise to at least three additional alternatively spliced isoforms, designated as CHODLf, CHODLfΔE, and CHODLΔE. Of all variants, the alternative exon E-splicing isoforms (CHODLfΔE/CHODLΔE) are expressed exclusively in the T lymphocyte lineage and are regulated during T lymphopoiesis. Peripheral T lymphocytes demonstrated a unique exon E-splicing pattern in comparison with end maturation stage thymocytes, suggesting its association with the post-thymic maturation of T cells. Since exon E encodes the transmembrane domain of CHODL, the exon E-skipping variant results in a non-transmembrane domain-containing isoform (CHODLfΔE/CHODLΔE) terminating in the QDEL sequence, thus suggesting different functional attributes of CHODL isoforms during the development of T cells. Double label immunofluoresence experiments demonstrated that the transmembrane-containing isoform (CHODLf) colocalizes with rBet1 to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus.

C-type lectins of animals are the most diverse family of animal lectins (1Kilpatrick D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). They are generally multidomain proteins in which carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; TM, transmembrane region; RT, reverse transcriptase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; APC, allophycocyanin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RFP, red fluorescent protein; aa, amino acids.1The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; TM, transmembrane region; RT, reverse transcriptase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PE, phycoerythrin; APC, allophycocyanin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RFP, red fluorescent protein; aa, amino acids. provide calcium-dependent sugar-binding activity. The C-type CRD has a common sequence module of 115–130 amino acid residues containing four cysteines that are perfectly conserved and involved in two disulfide bonds. Those C-type CRD domains have been found in various kind of proteins such as hepatic asialo-glycoprotein receptor (2Drickamer K. Mamon J.F. Binns G. Leung J.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 13120-13125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In general, animal lectins have a wide variety of functions. The principal function is to act as recognition molecules within the immune system and includes complement activation, recognition, and trafficking within the immune system, immune regulation (suppression or enhancement), and prevention of autoimmunity (1Kilpatrick D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Perhaps the best established functions outside the immune system are lysosomal enzyme transport by the phosphomannosyl receptors and the molecular chaperone role of calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum (7Ludwig T. LeBorgne R. Hoflack B. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8Helenius A. Trombetta S. Hebert D.N. Simon J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar).Recently, we have described the isolation and characterization of a novel C-type lectin, designated as chondrolectin (9Weng L. Smits P. Wauters J. Merregaert J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mouse chondrolectin gene (chodl) was first isolated from a subtracted library derived from tails of 4-day-old mice and therefore referred to as chondrolectin. The mouse and human gene structures are very similar, consisting of six exons and five introns (9Weng L. Smits P. Wauters J. Merregaert J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Weng L. Hübner R. Claessens A. Smits P. Wauters J. Tylzanowski P. Van Marck E. Merregaert J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). In both species, the open reading frame for chondrolectin encodes a type I membrane-associated polypeptide of 273 amino acids, containing an N-terminal signal sequence, a single CRD, a transmembrane region (TM), and an intracellular C terminus. Chondrolectin is structurally related to hamster layilin, a hyaluronan receptor (11Borowsky M.L. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Bono P. Rubin K. Higgins J. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, chondrolectin does not contain the functional talin binding site found in layilin. Furthermore, no specific interaction between chondrolectin and hyaluronan was detected by cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation (9Weng L. Smits P. Wauters J. Merregaert J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, chondrolectin is not likely to have the function of a hyaluronan receptor. The distribution of chondrolectin gene expression in normal human tissues is in general very low. RT-PCR analysis revealed preferential expression of chondrolectin in testis, prostate, and spleen, whereas immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the expression is mainly limited to vascular muscle of testis, smooth muscle of prostate stroma, heart muscle, skeletal muscle, crypts of small intestine, and red pulp of spleen (9Weng L. Smits P. Wauters J. Merregaert J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Although the physiological function of chondrolectin remains unknown at present, the identification of novel T cell-associated isoforms of chondrolectin is of particular interest, because many proteins that we regard as recognition or adhesion molecules within the immune system are now known to be lectins. For example, CD44 is a hyalectin-related C-type lectin and plays a role in lymphocyte recirculation; impaired homing to lymph nodes and thymus has been found in gene-targeted CD44-deficient mice (13Protin U. Schweighoffer T. Jochum W. Hilberg F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4917-4923PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we have identified three new members of the chondrolectin family that result from alternative promotor usage. All splicing variants described in the present study are derived from the distal alternative promoter and are differentially expressed in the T lymphocyte lineage. Two variants are devoid of the transmembrane domain (exon E of the human gene) and terminate in QDEL, a short sequence that is consistent with the motif for the endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. The transmembrane-containing isoform is localized in the ER/Golgi apparatus and is associated with T lymphocyte immaturity. Our results suggest that the alternative promoter usage could be a key mechanism controlling the expression of different chondrolectin isoforms with different biological function in T cell development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Antibodies—U937, a human histiocytic lymphoma cell line, and K562, a human erythro-myeloid leukemia cell line, were used as nonlymphoid cell sources. RAJI, a human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, was used as a source of B lymphocytes. JURKAT, MOLT-3, and HSB-2, human T cell lines derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and SUP-T1, a human T cell line derived from a T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, were used as a source of human T cells. Cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA) and cultured following the guidelines of the ATCC.Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (F(ab′)2 fragments) were purchased from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Supernatant of the 43A1 hybridoma (IgG3; kindly donated by Dr. H. J. Bühring (University of Tübingen, Germany)) was used as a source of anti-CD34 antibody (14Buhring H.J. Ullrich A. Schaudt K. Muller C.A. Busch F.W. Leukemia. 1991; 5: 854-860PubMed Google Scholar). All other monoclonal antibodies and conjugates (FITC, phycoerythrin (PE), and allophycocyanin (APC)) as well as isotype-matched control antibodies were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Erembodegem, Belgium). Mouse γ-globulins were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Antibodies (anti-rBet1, anti-Bcl-w, anti-LAMP1, and anti-KDEL) used for subcellular localization were purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). The anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and the anti-dsRED monoclonal antibody (Clontech) were used for Western blot analysis.Isolation and Preparation of Hematopoietic Cells—Bone marrow samples were aspirated by sternal puncture from hematologically normal patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Cells were collected into sterile tubes containing Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and heparin (100 units/ml; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), and the mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation over lymphocyte separation medium (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). Samples were obtained after informed consent according to the guidelines of the Medical Ethics Committee of the Antwerp University Hospital. Postnatal thymus was obtained from children 0–12 years of age undergoing corrective cardiac surgery. Those samples were obtained and used following the guidelines of the Medical Ethical Commission of the University Hospital of Ghent. Single cell suspensions were obtained by gentle disruption of the thymus in IMDM plus 10% FCS. Adult peripheral blood leukocytes were obtained after removing the red blood cells from a blood sample of a hemochromatosis patient by the NH4Cl lysis procedure.Flow Cytometric Cell Sorting—Freshly prepared adult bone marrow mononuclear cells were resuspended in IMDM at 107 cells/ml and incubated with 43A1 supernatant in a 1:10 dilution for 20 min at 4 °C, washed twice in IMDM supplemented with 10% FCS, and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse FITC (1:50 dilution) for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing twice in IMDM plus 10% FCS, the cells were incubated with mouse γ-globulins for 10 min and incubated with anti-CD38-PE for 20 min at 4 °C. After washing twice in IMDM plus 10% FCS, the cells were sorted on a FACStarPlus Cell Sorter (Becton Dickinson) equipped with a water-cooled argon ion laser (Coherent Innova Enterprise Laser), tuned to 488 nm at 170-milliwatt power. Cells with a low to medium forward scatter and a low side scatter, highly positive green (CD34) fluorescence, and an orange (CD38) fluorescence signal lower than the mean fluorescence plus 2 S.D. values of cells labeled with an irrelevant isotope-matched control antibody were retained as CD34+CD38– cells; cells with an orange fluorescence above this threshold were retained as CD34+CD38+ cells.CD34+ thymocytes were purified by positive selection with MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA), stained with CD1-FITC and CD34-APC, and sorted for CD34+CD1– or CD34+CD1+ progenitor cells by flow cytometry. To obtain immature single positive CD4 thymocytes, cells were stained with CD3-FITC and CD8-FITC and depleted with sheep anti-mouse IgG-coated beads (Dynabeads; Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway). The depleted cells were labeled with CD4-PE and sorted for CD4+CD8–CD3– thymocytes. To obtain CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes, CD4+CD8–CD3+ thymocytes, and CD4–CD8+CD3+ thymocytes, cells were stained with CD8-FITC, CD4-PE, and CD3-APC and subsequently sorted for the different populations.Lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes were sorted from peripheral blood based on the typical light scattering properties of the respective populations (i.e. low forward and orthogonal, intermediate forward and orthogonal, and intermediate forward and high orthogonal light scattering, respectively). T and B lymphocytes were further separated by fluorescence activated cell sorting after staining for CD3 (with anti-CD3-FITC) or CD19 (with anti-CD19-PE), respectively.The purity of the sorted cell populations was always checked and was at least 98%.PCR, Southern Blot, and RT-PCR—The expression from the distal and proximal promoters was analyzed using PCR and subsequent Southern blot analysis. Primer sets for transcripts of the distal and proximal promoters were designed. The S1 primer set, derived from the human CHODL cDNA (AF257472), was used for analyzing the expression of the proximal promoter: forward, 5′-cttcactggctttcctg; reverse, 5′-tacagttcatcttgcagatc. The S2 primer set, derived from the human CHODL homologue (AK022689), was used for analyzing the distal promoter: forward, 5′-aggctgcagagtcagagtc; reverse, 5′-tacagttcatcttgcagatc. First strand cDNAs of multiple human tissues (Clontech) were used as templates. The temperature profile for both PCRs was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min and 36 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The final cycle included an extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Resulting PCR products were fractionated on 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane, and subsequent Southern blot hybridization was performed according to a standard procedure (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.59Google Scholar). Probes for hybridization were PCR amplicons derived from primer sets S1in and S2in, which were internally located within the S1 and S2 PCR primer sets, respectively. S1in primers were as follows: forward, 5′-gcttgaagatggcagatcgtgg; reverse, tctgatgccattccttatacagatccag. S2in primers were as follows: forward, tcgctccacgcaacacctgc; reverse, tctgatgccattccttatacagatccag. The temperature profiles were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min and 36 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The final cycle included an extension at 72 °C for 10 min.The exon E-splicing pattern in multiple human tissues was analyzed using a primary PCR and nested PCR. The primers used were derived from the exon D and exon E of human CHODL separately: forward, 5′-aagctgaaagatgaattatttcg; reverse, 5′-atgtatcaccaaccaactgcc. The primers used for the nested PCR were internally adjacent to the primary primers: forward, 5′-ttctatggtactatatttgtgtg; reverse, 5′-acaggtgtaacatgaagcac. First strand cDNAs of multiple human tissues (Clontech) were used as templates. The temperature profile of the PCR reaction was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min and 36 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The final cycle included an extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The exon E-splicing pattern in human hematopoietic cell lines (HSB-2, SUP-T1, JURKAT, MOLT3, K562, RAJI, and U937) was analyzed using RT-PCR and subsequent nested PCR. First strand cDNA synthesis was primed by oligo(dT)12–18 and catalyzed by the RNase H derivative of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) after poly(A)+ RNA was extracted and selected using the QuickprepTM micro-mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). The PCR and subsequent nested PCR were carried out as described above.To more precisely define the expression of exon E-splicing variants in the K562, RAJI, and U937 cell lines, an RT-PCR analysis of the human β-actin mRNA (as the internal reference template) was performed. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-cgtgcgtgacattaaggagaag; reverse, 5′-agagaagtggggtggcttttag. The temperature profile of the PCR was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min and 36 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The final cycle included an extension at 72 °C for 10 min.All PCRs were carried out in 200-μl thin-walled tubes using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9600 apparatus. PCR products were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining. Primers mentioned above were synthesized by BIOSOURCE (Nivelles, Belgium).Cloning and Sequencing of CHODL Variants from Leukocytes— CHODL variants of leukocytes were amplified using PCR and nested PCR. Primer sets (S2 and S2in) and PCR conditions were described above. Nested PCR products were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Amplicons were visualized under UV light. Distinct bands were excised and subsequently cloned into pCR-script plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Clones designated as pUIA847, pUIA848, and pUIA849 were sequenced using the dye terminator method (Amersham Biosciences) by an automated ABI type 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).Construction of Fluorescent Protein-tagged CHODL Isoforms—Isoforms of CHODL were separately tagged with in-frame sequences of red fluorescent protein (RFP) and GFP. The coding sequences of variants were amplified from cloned splice variants. The primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-tcgctccacgcaacacctgc; reverse, 5′-actctcgagttaagcataatcaggaacatcataaggatatacttccatgccactttcttttctggtac or 5′-agtaaagcataatcaggaacatcataaggatacagttcatcttgcagatcctttgtg. The reverse primer contains 27 in-frame nucleotides encoding a hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA) to facilitate the recognition of this fusion protein by the anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody. The temperature profile of the PCRs was as follows: 95 °C for 3 min and 36 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The final cycle included an extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, and the amplicons were subcloned into the pCR-Script plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After confirmation of sequences, inserts of pCR-Script plasmids were excised with EcoRI and XbaI and subsequently ligated into the same restriction enzyme-digested pD-sRed1-N1/pEGFP-N1 vectors (Clontech). The resulting constructs RFP-CHODLf (pUIA850), GFP-CHODLΔE/GFP-CHODLΔfE (pUIA851/852) were verified by sequencing analysis. RFP-CHODLf consists of the exon E-containing isoform (CHODLf) followed by an in-frame RFP sequence. GFP-CHODLΔE and GFP-CHODLΔfE consist of the exon E-skipping isoform (CHODLΔE/CHODLΔfE) followed by an in-frame GFP sequence. FLAG-tagged CHODL was subcloned from CHODLf using following primers: forward, 5′-agcggccgcaatggcctacttccatg; reverse, 5′-actcgagttatacttccatgcc. The forward primer contains a restriction site which ligates to the in-frame flag sequence of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). This construct (pUIA 855) was verified by sequencing analysis.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Fluorescence Microscopy—COS1 cells were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 10 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After COS1 cells were passaged and subcultured on coverslips up to 50–70% confluence, they were transfected with a mixture of both constructs (RFP-CHODLf and GFP-CHODLΔE) using FUgene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cultured up to 72 h. Cells on coverslips were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with methanol for 10 min, and mounted on glass slides. For the immunofluorescent staining, the coverslips were incubated with the primary antibodies (rBet1/Bcl-w/LAMP1/KDEL, markers for ER-Golgi apparatus, mitochondrium, lysosome, and the KDEL receptor, respectively) and subsequently with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG antibodies. Fluorescent staining of transfected COS1 cells was viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DMRA) using 488-nm/570-nm filters for excitation of the green/red fluorochrome, respectively.Western Blot Analysis—Lysate of RFP-CHODLf- or GFP-CHODLΔE-transfected COS1 cells was dissolved in loading buffer, fractionated on a 4–24% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following the incubation with a 1:1000 anti-RFP (Clontech) or 1:500 anti-GFP (Sigma) monoclonal antibody overnight, membranes were stained by a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse/anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSEvidence for Transcription Initiation Upstream of the CHODL P1Promoter—Data base (GenBankTM/EMBL) searching with the CHODL sequence revealed several homologues (AF311699.1, AK014255, BC009418, AK022689). All of these cDNAs are derived from brain tissues. AK022689 displays high identity to the CHODL cDNA sequence but is different in its 5′-untranslated region. This CHODL variant codes for a protein of 232 amino acids (aa), since its start codon corresponds to the second ATG of CHODL, resulting in an isoform lacking the 41 first amino-terminal aa of CHODL. Analysis of its nucleotide sequence and comparison with the human genomic DNA sequences (16Hattori M. Fujiyama A. Taylor T.D. Watanabe H. Yada T. Park H.-S. Toyoda A. Ishii K. Totoki Y. Choi D.-K. Soeda E. Ohki M. Takagi T. Sakaki Y. Taudien S. et al.Nature. 2000; 405: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) of chromosome 21 revealed that AK022689 is derived from a promoter region ∼330 kb upstream of the CHODL P1 promoter. The existence of this transcript provides evidence for the usage of an alternative promoter for the CHODL gene (Fig. 1). Due to the low expression of CHODL, the expression from the proximal (P1) and distal (P2) promoters was analyzed using PCR and subsequent Southern blotting. Specific expression from the proximal (P1) promoter was detected in human adult colon, small intestine, thymus, and pancreas (Fig. 2A); specific expression from the distal (P2) promoter was detected in human adult leukocytes and placenta (Fig. 2B). Expression from both proximal (P1) and distal (P2) promoters was found in human adult prostate, spleen, and testis (Fig. 2, A and B). Neither expression from the distal promoter nor expression from the proximal promoter was detected in human adult ovary, brain, heart, liver, lung, and muscle. We detected significant molecular heterogeneity of the PCR products derived from the distal promoter (Fig. 2B). Subsequent cloning and sequencing of these PCR products revealed that this heterogeneity is the result of alternative splicing, suggesting the presence of variable CHODL isoforms.Fig. 2Tissue-specific expression of CHODL mRNA. The tissue specificity of promoter utilization was analyzed using PCR. First strand cDNA of multiple human tissues was used as template. Primer sets for analyzing the expression of the proximal (P1) and distal (P2) promoters were indicated separately (see Fig. 1) by single and double arrows. PCR products were fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and subsequently transferred to a Hybond-N membrane. Tissue expression was detected by a Southern blot as described under “PCR, Southern Blot, and RT-PCR.” Tissue-specific expression from the proximal promoter (Fig. 2A) and from the distal promoter (Fig. 2B) are shown. A is from Ref. 9Weng L. Smits P. Wauters J. Merregaert J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and is used for comparison purposes with B. Notice that the size of PCR products using primer set S2 is heterogeneous.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of CHODL Variants Expressed in Leukocytes—As noted above, we detected molecular heterogeneity in RT-PCR amplicons, suggesting the presence of different CHODL isoforms. This hypothesis was further tested by PCR analysis using primers flanking exon E, a putative transmembrane domain of CHODL. As shown in Fig. 3, this primer set amplified a PCR product (smaller than the expected one) unique for leukocytes, suggesting the existence of an alternative exon E-splicing variant. PCR and subsequent nested-PCR using primer sets (S2 and S2in) amplified three distinct amplicons from cDNA of leukocytes. Subsequent cloning and sequencing analysis revealed that they represent three novel variants of CHODL. The nucleotide sequence of three cDNAs has been submitted to GenBankTM/EMBL data base with accession numbers AF523313, AF523314, and AF523315. The first novel variant, CHODLf, contains an insertion of exon (exon 3) between exon 2 and exon B (Fig. 1). The second novel variant, CHODLfΔE, contains an insertion of exon 3 between exon 2 and exon B and skips exon E (Fig. 1). The third novel variant, CHODLΔE, does not contain exon 3 and skips exon E (Fig. 1). We failed to isolate 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end clones of these cDNAs and are not in a position to define the precise start of transcription and to determine whether or not they contain exon 1 of AK022689. Since the 5′ leader sequences of these novel variants contain an in-frame stop codon without additional in-frame ATG, variants with the insertion of exon 3 still share the same translation initiation site in exon B as variant AK022689 (i.e. the second ATG of the CHODL gene). Exon E is located within the coding region of CHODL and encodes the putative transmembrane region (9Weng L. Smits P. Wauters J. Merregaert J. Genomics. 2002; 80: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, alternative splicing of this exon results in a non-transmembrane-containing isoform of CHODL with an altered carboxyl-terminal sequence due to a frame shift (Fig. 4, A and B). The non-transmembrane-containing isoforms or soluble isoforms (designated as CHODLΔE/CHODLfΔE) consist of 236 aa with an approximate molecular mass of 27.38 kDa and a pI of 4.8 (see, on the World Wide Web, us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam) (Fig. 4B). A profile searching on ScanProsite (available on the World Wide Web at us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/scanprosite) revealed that CHODLΔE/CHODLfΔE contains a CRD motif (aa 1–138), three N-glycosylation sites (aa 45–48, 199–202, and 220–223), two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (aa 8–10 and 100–102), two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and one endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (QDEL) at the very C terminus end (aa 233–236).Fig. 3Identification of truncated CHODL transcripts in leukocytes. Exon E-splicing variant in human multiple tissues was detected using a primary PCR and subsequent nested PCR. The first strand cDNAs of several human tissues were used as templates, and the primers used are derived from exon D and exon F separately (see Fig. 1). The PCR products were fractionated on a 1% agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The amplicons in leukocytes were smaller than those of the other tissues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Deduced amino acid sequences of novel CHODL isoform.A, CHODL, CHODLf, and CHODLfΔE/CHODLΔE are shown schematically.

https://openalex.org/W2037634336,"The pH dependence of the redox potentials and kinetics for CO association and dissociation was determined between pH 3.0 and 13.0 at 25 °C for the wild-type Coprinus cinereus fungal peroxidase and for a site-directed mutant in which Asp245, which is H-bonded to Nδ of the imidazole of the proximal His183, was substituted with Asn. The determination of these functional properties allowed this information to be merged in a self-consistent fashion and to formulate for the first time a complete scheme employing the minimum number of groups required to describe the whole proton-linked behavior of both redox and ligand binding properties. The overall pH dependence can be accounted for by four redox- and ligand-linked groups. The proximal H-bond, which is strictly conserved in all peroxidases, will still be present in the site-specific mutant, but will no longer have an ionic character, and this event will bring about an alteration of redox equilibria and CO binding kinetics, envisaging a relevant role played by this H-bond also in modulating redox properties and ligand binding equilibria.

The importance of the protein moiety in controlling the functional behavior of the active site in hemoproteins is a widespread concept, even though different proteins seem to apply various strategies to accomplish this interrelationship. Thus, in the case of multimeric hemoproteins such as human hemoglobin, the functional control is mostly exerted through a ligand-linked quaternary conformational transition, which affects ligand binding kinetic and thermodynamic parameters in a ligand-dependent fashion (1Unzai S.

Class I refers to intracellular peroxidases of prokaryotic origin such as cytochrome c peroxidase. Class II includes secretory fungal peroxidases such as manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, and Coprinus cinereus peroxidase. Class III contains secretory plant peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase (16Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 383-393Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar).In the last few years, particular attention has been addressed toward fungal peroxidases, also favored by the x-ray resolution of the structural arrangement for several of them and by their potential industrial usefulness. Therefore, a detailed description of different functional aspects of this class of peroxidases may be of relevance for better insight into their structure-function relationship. In particular, analysis of the pH dependence of different functional properties provides information on the proton linkage relationships, which are relevant for the modulation of functional properties of the protein. Such an approach is very demanding with respect to analysis of individual functional features because it is constrained by the requirement of a general description with the minimum number of parameters. As a matter of fact, it is often difficult to reconcile data concerning spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and kinetic observations, which indeed reflect differing structural and functional aspects of the whole molecule.In this study, we analyzed some of the functional proton-linked equilibria and kinetics observed in the fungal peroxidase from C. cinereus (which is indistinguishable from the Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase; therefore, we will refer to CIP 1The abbreviation used is: CIP, C. cinereus peroxidase.1The abbreviation used is: CIP, C. cinereus peroxidase. also when referring to structural information taken from the crystal structure of A. ramosus peroxidase).

This study has focused on the role of Asp245 H-bonded to the proximal His183 in the redox and ligand binding properties as a function of pH. Analysis of CIP and the site-directed mutant D245N provided insight into the proton-linked equilibria in the oxidized and reduced forms, according to Scheme 1.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant wild-type CIP and the D245N mutant were both constructed and expressed in Aspergillus oryzae (24Welinder, K. G., and Andersen, M. B. (December 9, 1993) U. S. Patent WO93/24618Google Scholar), and the protein samples were purified and prepared as previously described (21Smulevich G. Neri F. Marzocchi M.P. Welinder K.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10576-10585Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reduced Fe(II) form was obtained by addition of a minimum volume of fresh sodium dithionite to a deoxygenated buffered solution.Cyclic voltammeter measurements were carried out using an AMEL 433 multipolarograph. All redox potentials reported here refer to the normal hydrogen electrode. Direct current cyclic voltammograms were run in different buffers (see below) at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. A pyrolytic graphite electrode (AMEL) was the working electrode; a saturated calomel electrode (+244 mV versus the normal hydrogen electrode at 25 °C; AMEL) was the reference electrode; and a platinum ring was the counter electrode. The pyrolytic graphite electrode was modified as follows. A suitable amount of tributylmethylphosphonium chloride polymer bound (polystyrene cross-linked with 1% divinylbenzene) to anion-exchange resin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 0.035% (w/v). 8 μl of this solution were then mixed with 12 μl of 1.6 mm CIP (or D245N) solution and deposited on the surface of a pyrolytic graphite electrode (2 mm diameter) previously polished using an alumina (0.3-μm particle size)/water slurry, followed by sonication in deionized water (25Ferri T. Poscia A. Santucci R. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1998; 44: 177-181Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The modified electrode was left to dry overnight under vacuum before measurements.CO binding kinetics were measured employing a rapid-mixing stopped-flow apparatus (SX.18 MV, Applied Photophysics Co., Salisbury, UK) with a 1-ms dead time. The protein was kept in one syringe in a deoxygenated solution (N2-flushed with the addition of sodium dithionite to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml) in very low ionic strength 1.0 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and it was mixed with a higher ionic strength buffer (final I = 0.15) at the desired pH value and concentration of CO. Progress curves were recorded at several wavelengths to follow both the formation of the CO adduct (at 423 nm) and the disappearance of the unliganded form (at 437 nm).CO dissociation kinetics were followed on a Jasco V-530 spectrophotometer recording the absorption spectrum in the 380–450 nm range. The protein was kept at pH 7.0 in 1.0 mm sodium phosphate buffer in the presence of slightly substoichiometric amounts of CO. The reaction started when the protein solution was mixed in a large excess of oxygenated reaction mixture at the desired pH (final I = 0.15) because the dissociation of CO was followed by a rapid oxidation of the peroxidase, which was detected by the change of the absorption spectrum.All experiments were performed at 25 °C in 1.0 mm CaCl2 employing the following buffer systems: 0.15 m sodium acetate (pH 4.0–5.5), 0.15 m sodium phosphate (pH 3.0–4.0 and 5.0–7.5), 0.15 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5–9.0), 0.15 m sodium borate (pH 8.5–9.5), 0.15 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.0–10.5), and 0.15 m sodium carbonate (pH 10.0–13.0). No buffer-dependent effects were observed at overlapping pH values.The pH dependence of the redox properties was analyzed according to Equation 1, Eobs=E0⋅∑i=0i=n∏r=0i⋅Kar(ox)⋅[H+]∑i=0i=n∏r=0i⋅Kar(red)⋅[H+]Eq. 1 where Eobs is the observed redox potential at a given pH value; E0 is the redox potential of the form present at very alkaline pH values; Ka(red) and Ka(ox) are the proton binding constants in the reduced and oxidized forms, respectively (such as Ka = 10pKa), outlining that, in Equation 1, Ka0·[H+] = 1; and n is the total number of protonating redox-linked groups. It must be pointed out that, in Equation 1, we use the formalism Ka to refer to the groups that are sequentially protonated as pH is lowered, as also depicted in Scheme 1; therefore, r follows this sequence, and r = 1 relates to the residue displaying the highest pKa value. Equation 1 indicates that only residues that change their pKa upon reduction (or oxidation) contribute to the pH dependence of the redox potential.The pH dependence of the CO binding second-order rate constant was analyzed according to Equation 2, kobs=∑i=0i=nki⋅∏r=0iKar(red)⋅[H+]∑i=0i=n∏r=0iKar(red)⋅[H+]Eq. 2 where kobs is the observed CO binding second-order rate constant at a given pH value, ki is the CO binding second-order rate constant of the ith-protonated species (i = 0–4), and all other symbols have the same meaning as described for Equation 1.RESULTSFig. 1 shows the pH dependence of the redox properties of the wild-type peroxidase from C. cinereus (CIP) (Fig. 1A) and of the site-directed mutant D245N (Fig. 1B), in which Asn was substituted for Asp245, which is H-bonded in CIP to the proximal His183. Least-squares fitting of experimental data was carried out according to Equation 1, employing n = 2, 3, or 4. Least-squares fitting of the pH dependence of the redox properties employing n = 2 was clearly inadequate for both CIP and D245N (Fig. 1, A and B, – - – -), whereas n = 4 appeared to be only slightly better than n = 3. For a phenomenological description of the pH dependence of the redox properties of CIP and D245N, n = 3 might be satisfactory, using as few parameters as possible. Data from fitting according to n = 3 and 4 are reported in Table I both for CIP and the D245N mutant.Fig. 1A, pH dependence of the redox potentials for CIP at 25 °C. —, nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data according to Equation 1 for n = 4 (values reported in Table I); – – –, nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data according to Equation 1 for n = 3; – - – -, nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data according to Equation 1 for n = 2.

Thus, a similar analysis of horseradish peroxidase (isoenzyme C) and manganese peroxidase showed that two redox-linked residues fully accounted for the pH dependence of the redox properties (19Santucci R. Bongiovanni C. Marini S. Del Conte R. Tien M. Banci L. Coletta M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 85-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ferri T. Poscia A. Santucci R. Bioelectrochem.

As in other peroxidases, all redox-linked groups observed in CIP displayed a decrease in pKa upon heme reduction, suggesting that the removal of one electron from the heme iron brings about a situation that renders less easy the protonation of these residues. Such a feature is likely referable to an electrostatic effect because Fe(II) is less positive than Fe(III), even though we cannot rule out redox-linked structural change(s) that induce a pKa shift in residues surrounding the heme pocket.To extend this analysis, we carried out a similar pH dependence investigation of CO binding kinetics, which yielded the information on the right side of Scheme 1. Fig. 2 shows the pH dependence of CO association, and Fig. 3 displays the pH dependence of the CO dissociation kinetics for CIP and the D245N mutant. In both cases, Equation 2 was employed for the analysis, even though it must be stressed that, in the case of the CO association process, the pKa values refer to the P(II) populations of Scheme 1, whereas for the CO dissociation process, pKa values refer to the PL(II) populations. In this way, the two types of kinetic information allow a complete description of the proton-linked modulation of the right side of Scheme 1. However, because for the CO association kinetics, the populations coming into play (i.e. P(II)) are in common with those involved in the redox process reported above (i.e. P(II) and P(III)), we also tried to merge these two facts into a self-consistent fitting procedure to obtain from the two sets of data a minimum number of protonating groups accounting for the whole proton-linked equilibria involving the P(III), P(II), and PL(II) species for both CO kinetics and redox processes (Scheme 1).Fig. 2A, pH dependence of the CO association rate constants for CIP (○) and D245N (×) at 25 °C. —, nonlinear least-squares fitting of the data according to Equation 2 employing the values reported in Table II for n = 2.

If we compare them with values reported in Table I for the pH dependence of the redox equilibria, we notice that there is a substantial overlap between the pKa2(red) value in Table I (for n = 3) and the pKa1 value in Table II (for n = 2). On the other hand, the value of pKa2 for the kinetic proton linkage appears to be irreconcilable with any of the pKa(red) values reported for n = 3 in Table I, whereas it is fairly close to the pKa4(red) value for n = 4. Altogether, these observations seem to indicate that there is a partial overlap between proton-linked residues modulating redox properties and CO association kinetic parameters, such that Scheme 1 with four protons (i.e. n = 4) could be required for a complete description of the linkage between protons, redox equilibria, and CO binding behavior.Table IIValues of kiand pKafor the pH dependence of the CO association kinetics for CIP and D245N from the independent least-squares fitting of the data according to Equation 2 employing n = 2 and/or imposing values of pKa(red) from the proton-linked redox behavior reported in Table I (n = 4).CIPD245Nn = 2k1 (M-1 s-1)(1.82 ± 0.21) × 105(3.25 ± 0.42) × 105k2 (M-1 s-1)(2.64 ± 0.28) × 104(1.82 ± 0.24) × 105k3 (M-1 s-1)(4.30 ± 0.51) × 104(3.69 ± 0.43) × 104pKa18.05 ± 0.178.08 ± 0.18pKa24.29 ± 0.186.41 ± 0.17n = 4k1 (M-1 s-1)(1.83 ± 0.20) × 105(3.24 ± 0.41) × 105k2 (M-1 s-1)(1.94 ± 0.22) × 105(3.30 ± 0.42) × 105k3 (M-1 s-1)(3.16 ± 0.33) × 104(1.53 ± 0.23) × 105k4 (M-1 s-1)(2.58 ± 0.27) × 104(3.55 ± 0.45) × 104k5 (M-1 s-1)(4.53 ± 0.54) × 104(3.74 ± 0.47) × 104pKa1(red)aFixed parameters.10.7510.12pKa2(red)aFixed parameters.8.247.97pKa3(red)aFixed parameters.6.106.12pKa4(red)aFixed parameters.4.214.31a Fixed parameters. Open table in a new tab However, to find out in a more quantitative fashion whether this is a reasonable assessment, we fitted the pH dependence of the CO association kinetics imposing the three pKa(red) values reported in Table I for n = 3 and allowing a free flotation of ki values (Equation 2). Fig. 2B (– – –), corresponding to what was obtained by least-squares fitting of data according to this procedure, shows that these values are inadequate to give a satisfactory description of the pH dependence of the CO association kinetics because the transition at lower pH values, corresponding to the value of pKa2 for n = 2 (Table II), is missed. On the other hand, imposing values of pKa(red) for n = 4 in Table I (for redox potentials) gives a very satisfactory fitting of the pH dependence of the CO association kinetics (Fig. 2B, —), supporting that four protons indeed are the minimum number required for the whole description of proton linkage for redox and kinetic properties, with two values overlapping (Table II for n = 4). As a self-consistent test, we also fitted the CO binding data employing Equation 2, leaving a free flotation of both ki and pKa(red) values and obtaining a set of parameters closely similar (within the uncertainty limits) to those reported in Table II for n = 4.A similar analysis was carried out for the pH dependence of the CO association kinetics of the D245N mutant; also in this case, two protonating groups were sufficient to give an independent description of the pH dependence (Fig. 2A and Table II for n = 2). Such pKa values were very close to two of those obtained by analysis of the pH dependence of the redox properties for n = 4 (viz. pKa2(red) and pKa3(red)) (Table I), but they were irreconcilable with the values obtained for the same analysis for n = 3 (Table I). This appears to be evident also comparing the fitting of the pH dependence of the CO association kinetics of D245N imposing pKa(red) values from the proton-linked behavior of redox potentials either for n = 3 (Fig. 2C, - - - -) and for n = 4 (Fig. 2C, —). Therefore, as observed for CIP, the global description of the proton linkage to the redox properties and CO association kinetics of D245N requires four protonating groups, two of which are overlapping.For the pH dependence of the CO dissociation kinetics (reported in Fig. 3) that lead to the determination of pKL(red) (Scheme 1), we followed a conceptually similar approach, even though it must be stressed that, in this case, our constraint was different from that used for the CO association kinetics because we have no independent determination of pKL(red) values. The constraint is instead related to the fact that the values of the association and dissociation kinetic constants at each protonation stage i and i – 1 (and thus the corresponding equilibrium constants) must be consistent with the values of pKa1(red) and pKL1(red) so as to obey mass conservation law within each thermodynamic square (Scheme 1), as for the following relationship (Equation 3). (ki−1(off)/ki(off))⋅10pKL1=(ki−1(on)/ki(on))⋅10pKa1Eq. 3 In this way, the pH dependence of the redox equilibria and the CO association and dissociation kinetic rate constants all become functionally interrelated through a set of proton linkage relationships, giving rise to a complete description of the modulation of the whole system. Therefore, to be consistent with what was already determined for the proton linkage of the redox and CO association kinetic behavior, analysis of the pH dependence of the CO dissociation kinetics was limited to the search for a set of five dissociation rate constants (corresponding to the 0–4 protonated species) and four pKL(red) values that altogether obey the mass law constraints described above. Despite the large number of parameters involved, the limitations imposed turned out to be fairly restrictive, as essentially only one solution was found for CIP and D245N that satisfactorily described the pH-dependent behavior of their CO dissociation kinetics (Fig. 3 and Table III).Table IIIKinetic rate constants and protonation parameters for the CO dissociation from CIP and D245NCIPD245Nk1 (s-1)(7.73 ± 0.63) × 10-3(6.73 ± 0.57) × 10-3k2 (s-1)(7.73 ± 0.36) × 10-3(6.73 ± 0.31) × 10-3k3 (s-1)(1.18 ± 0.27) × 10-4(2.73 ± 0.54) × 10-4k4 (s-1)(3.29 ± 0.09) × 10-5(1.38 ± 0.18) × 10-5k5 (s-1)(1.14 ± 0.07) × 10-4(3.41 ± 1.03) × 10-5pKL1(red)10.78 ± 0.1710.13 ± 0.17pKL2(red)9.27 ± 0.149.02 ± 0.19pKL3(red)6.64 ± 0.156.84 ± 0.17pKL4(red)4.06 ± 0.153.94 ± 0.16 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe overall description of the pH dependence of the redox properties and CO association and dissociation kinetics of CIP can be fully accounted for by the redox- and ligand-linked protonation of four groups, and this behavior is depicted in Schemes 2 and 3 for CIP and D245N, respectively. An important observation is that, unlike for other peroxidases investigated up to now, the observed pH dependence cannot be accounted for by only two redox-linked groups, suggesting that CIP shows a different environment of the heme pocket compared with other peroxidases, bringing about a variation of the protonation properties of residues that affect the redox properties, with the involvement of additional redox-linked group(s). However, it must be stressed that it is the first time (at least to our knowledge) that an attempt has been undertaken to merge in a systematic way the redox, ligand binding, and proton linkage information on a peroxidase. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that such an investigation on other peroxidases will give a similar outcome.Scheme 2Overall redox-, ligand-, and proton-linked equilibria of CIP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Scheme 3Overall redox-, ligand-, and proton-linked equilibria of D245N.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In particular, a comparative study has been carried out between wild-type cytochrome c peroxidase and the side-directed mutant D235N for CO association and dissociation kinetics (27Miller M.A. Coletta M.
