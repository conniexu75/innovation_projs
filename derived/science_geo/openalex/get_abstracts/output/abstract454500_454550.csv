https://openalex.org/W2009901470,"Light can be coupled into propagating electromagnetic surface waves at a metal-dielectric interface known as surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). This process has traditionally faced challenges in the polarization sensitivity of the coupling efficiency and in controlling the directionality of the SPPs. We designed and demonstrated plasmonic couplers that overcome these limits using polarization-sensitive apertures in a gold film. Our devices enable polarization-controlled tunable directional coupling with polarization-invariant total conversion efficiency and preserve the incident polarization information. Both bidirectional and unidirectional launching of SPPs are demonstrated. The design is further applied to circular structures that create radially convergent and divergent SPPs, illustrating that this concept can be extended to a broad range of applications."

Congreve et al. (p. 334 ) have developed a method to harvest the excess energy in carbon-based absorbers through a process termed “singlet fission.” In this process, high-energy photons propel two current carriers, rather than just one, by populating a singlet state that spontaneously divides into a pair of triplet states. Although it works in a functioning organic solar cell, the efficiency needs improving."
https://openalex.org/W1963630241,"The discovery of a living coelacanth specimen in 1938 was remarkable, as this lineage of lobe-finned fish was thought to have become extinct 70 million years ago. The modern coelacanth looks remarkably similar to many of its ancient relatives, and its evolutionary proximity to our own fish ancestors provides a glimpse of the fish that first walked on land. Here we report the genome sequence of the African coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae. Through a phylogenomic analysis, we conclude that the lungfish, and not the coelacanth, is the closest living relative of tetrapods. Coelacanth protein-coding genes are significantly more slowly evolving than those of tetrapods, unlike other genomic features. Analyses of changes in genes and regulatory elements during the vertebrate adaptation to land highlight genes involved in immunity, nitrogen excretion and the development of fins, tail, ear, eye, brain and olfaction. Functional assays of enhancers involved in the fin-to-limb transition and in the emergence of extra-embryonic tissues show the importance of the coelacanth genome as a blueprint for understanding tetrapod evolution. Genome sequencing and phylogenomic analysis show that the lungfish, not the coelacanth, is the closest living relative of tetrapods, that coelacanth protein-coding genes are more slowly evolving than those of tetrapods and lungfish, and that the genes and regulatory elements that underwent changes during the vertebrate transition to land reflect adaptation to a new environment. The African coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) attracted international attention when a specimen was netted off the South African coast in 1938, as coelacanths were thought to have gone extinct 70 million years ago. Now its genome has been sequenced. Phylogenomic analysis resolves the long-standing question of which lobe-finned fish is the closest living relative of the land vertebrates — it is the lungfish, and not the coelacanth. The protein-coding genes of the coelacanth are slowly evolving, which perhaps explains how similar today's coelacanth looks to its 300-million-year-old fossil ancestors. Examination of changes in genes and regulatory elements shows the importance of factors including brain and fin development, immunity and nitrogen excretion in the adaptation of vertebrates to land."
https://openalex.org/W2019950361,"Controlling Light Propagation Surface plasmons are light-induced collective electronic excitations in a metal that offer the possibility of manufacturing optoelectronic devices at nanometer scale. Before such shrinking can be achieved, the propagation direction and lifetime of the plasmonic excitations have to be controlled (see the Perspective by Miroshnichenko and Kivshar ). Rodríguez-Fortuño et al. (p. 328 ) show how this is done using polarized light. Alternatively, using an array of metallic nanoantennae (in this case, slits) patterned into a thin gold film, Lin et al. (p. 331 ) present a further improvement on current plasmonic coupling schemes that has the potential to encode information contained in both the intensity and polarization of light."
https://openalex.org/W1984066495,"TET proteins oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). 5fC and 5caC are excised by mammalian DNA glycosylase TDG, implicating 5mC oxidation in DNA demethylation. Here, we show that the genomic locations of 5fC can be determined by coupling chemical reduction with biotin tagging. Genome-wide mapping of 5fC in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) reveals that 5fC preferentially occurs at poised enhancers among other gene regulatory elements. Application to Tdg null mESCs further suggests that 5fC production coordinates with p300 in remodeling epigenetic states of enhancers. This process, which is not influenced by 5hmC, appears to be associated with further oxidation of 5hmC and commitment to demethylation through 5fC. Finally, we resolved 5fC at base resolution by hydroxylamine-based protection from bisulfite-mediated deamination, thereby confirming sites of 5fC accumulation. Our results reveal roles of active 5mC/5hmC oxidation and TDG-mediated demethylation in epigenetic tuning at regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2047156688,"Massive present-day early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies probably gained the bulk of their stellar mass and heavy elements through intense, dust-enshrouded starbursts--that is, increased rates of star formation--in the most massive dark-matter haloes at early epochs. However, it remains unknown how soon after the Big Bang massive starburst progenitors exist. The measured redshift (z) distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long been suspected to be biased low in z owing to selection effects, as confirmed by recent findings of systems with redshifts as high as ~5 (refs 2-4). Here we report the identification of a massive starburst galaxy at z = 6.34 through a submillimetre colour-selection technique. We unambiguously determined the redshift from a suite of molecular and atomic fine-structure cooling lines. These measurements reveal a hundred billion solar masses of highly excited, chemically evolved interstellar medium in this galaxy, which constitutes at least 40 per cent of the baryonic mass. A 'maximum starburst' converts the gas into stars at a rate more than 2,000 times that of the Milky Way, a rate among the highest observed at any epoch. Despite the overall downturn in cosmic star formation towards the highest redshifts, it seems that environments mature enough to form the most massive, intense starbursts existed at least as early as 880 million years after the Big Bang."
https://openalex.org/W2066938323,"A single nuclear spin holds the promise of being a long-lived quantum bit or quantum memory, with the high fidelities required for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We show here that such promise could be fulfilled by a single phosphorus (31P) nuclear spin in a silicon nanostructure. By integrating single-shot readout of the electron spin with on-chip electron spin resonance, we demonstrate the quantum non-demolition, electrical single-shot readout of the nuclear spin, with readout fidelity better than 99.8% - the highest for any solid-state qubit. The single nuclear spin is then operated as a qubit by applying coherent radiofrequency (RF) pulses. For an ionized 31P donor we find a nuclear spin coherence time of 60 ms and a 1-qubit gate control fidelity exceeding 98%. These results demonstrate that the dominant technology of modern electronics can be adapted to host a complete electrical measurement and control platform for nuclear spin-based quantum information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2036662877,"TET dioxygenases successively oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in mammalian genomes to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). 5fC/5caC can be excised and repaired to regenerate unmodified cytosines by thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) and base excision repair (BER) pathway, but it is unclear to what extent and at which part of the genome this active demethylation process takes place. Here, we have generated genome-wide distribution maps of 5hmC/5fC/5caC using modification-specific antibodies in wild-type and Tdg-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In wild-type mouse ESCs, 5fC/5caC accumulates to detectable levels at major satellite repeats but not at nonrepetitive loci. In contrast, Tdg depletion in mouse ESCs causes marked accumulation of 5fC and 5caC at a large number of proximal and distal gene regulatory elements. Thus, these results reveal the genome-wide view of iterative 5mC oxidation dynamics and indicate that TET/TDG-dependent active DNA demethylation process occurs extensively in the mammalian genome."

Much of this is preserved in soils and sediments for thousands of years. However, the estimated production rate of charcoal is significantly larger than that of decomposition, and Jaffe et al.

https://openalex.org/W2008575045,"Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) results from a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1. This repeat is thought to elicit toxicity as RNA, yet disease brains contain ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions, a pathologic hallmark of protein-mediated neurodegeneration. We explain this paradox by demonstrating that CGG repeats trigger repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated (RAN) translation of a cryptic polyglycine-containing protein, FMRpolyG. FMRpolyG accumulates in ubiquitin-positive inclusions in Drosophila, cell culture, mouse disease models, and FXTAS patient brains. CGG RAN translation occurs in at least two of three possible reading frames at repeat sizes ranging from normal (25) to pathogenic (90), but inclusion formation only occurs with expanded repeats. In Drosophila, CGG repeat toxicity is suppressed by eliminating RAN translation and enhanced by increased polyglycine protein production. These studies expand the growing list of nucleotide repeat disorders in which RAN translation occurs and provide evidence that RAN translation contributes to neurodegeneration."

(p. 1215 , published online 18 April) monitored a population of red squirrels and found that both natural and artificially induced increases in the number of conspecific calls increased the growth rate of pups because of increased glucocorticoid levels in the mother. The density stress experienced by mothers thus appears to stimulate them to produce pups that will grow faster and hopefully outcompete the many other pups expected to be produced in the dense population."

Mersch et al. (p. 1090 , published online 18 April) tracked individual ant movements and interactions to show that their precise social organization results from temporal changes in the spatial location of workers. As they aged, ants largely progressed from being nurses located near the queen, to nest cleaners who move throughout the colony, and finally to foragers moving in and out at the colony edges."

https://openalex.org/W2009108898,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease, characterized by motor neuron (MN) death, for which there are no truly effective treatments. Here, we describe a new small molecule survival screen carried out using MNs from both wild-type and mutant SOD1 mouse embryonic stem cells. Among the hits we found, kenpaullone had a particularly impressive ability to prolong the healthy survival of both types of MNs that can be attributed to its dual inhibition of GSK-3 and HGK kinases. Furthermore, kenpaullone also strongly improved the survival of human MNs derived from ALS-patient-induced pluripotent stem cells and was more active than either of two compounds, olesoxime and dexpramipexole, that recently failed in ALS clinical trials. Our studies demonstrate the value of a stem cell approach to drug discovery and point to a new paradigm for identification and preclinical testing of future ALS therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2139436623,"The posterior septum consisting of the triangular septum (TS) and the bed nucleus of the anterior commissure (BAC) is predominantly linked with the medial habenula (MHb) and has been implicated in the control of anxiety and fear responses. However, its anatomical and functional linkage has largely remained elusive. We established a transgenic mouse model in which the TS and BAC projection neurons were visualized by GFP fluorescence and selectively eliminated by immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting. The linkage between the TS/BAC and the MHb constitutes two parallel pathways composed of the TS-ventral MHb, the core part of the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), and the BAC-dorsal MHb, the peripheral part of the IPN. Ablation of the TS and BAC projection neurons selectively impaired anxiety and enhanced fear responses and learning, respectively. Inputs from the TS and BAC to the MHb are thus segregated by two parallel pathways and play specialized roles in controlling emotional behaviors."

The x-ray crystal structure of the α-TTP–PIP complex suggested that PIP binding opens the lid of the α-tocopherol–binding pocket to facilitate the release of α-tocopherol. Thus, PIP binding to α-TTP at the target membrane may facilitate the release of α-tocopherol in the hydrophobic pocket of α-TTP to the lipid bilayer of the target membrane, providing a mechanism for the transfer of lipids from the lipid-transfer protein to the target membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2135737750,"In bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants the Trk, Ktr and HKT ion transporters are key components of osmotic regulation, pH homeostasis and resistance to drought and high salinity. These ion transporters are functionally diverse: they can function as Na+ or K+ channels and possibly as cation/K+ symporters. They are closely related to potassium channels both at the level of the membrane protein and at the level of the cytosolic regulatory domains. Here we describe the crystal structure of a Ktr K+ transporter, the KtrAB complex from Bacillus subtilis. The structure shows the dimeric membrane protein KtrB assembled with a cytosolic octameric KtrA ring bound to ATP, an activating ligand. A comparison between the structure of KtrAB–ATP and the structures of the isolated full-length KtrA protein with ATP or ADP reveals a ligand-dependent conformational change in the octameric ring, raising new ideas about the mechanism of activation in these transporters. This study reports the X-ray crystal structure of a Ktr K+ transporter; the structure of this KtrAB complex reveals how the dimeric membrane protein KtrB interacts with the cytosolic octameric KtrA regulatory protein. K+ is essential for many physiological processes and must be concentrated in all living cells for their survival. In bacteria, K+ uptake is mediated and regulated by SKT (superfamily of K+ transporter) proteins. Two papers in this issue of Nature examine the structure and function of SKT proteins from different sub-families. Ming Zhou and colleagues present the electrophysiological and structural characterization of the complex formed by TrkH and its associated RCK protein, TrkA. Their study suggests a mechanism by which ATP-induced conformational changes in TrkA augment TrkH's activity. Joo Morais-Cabral and colleagues determined the X-ray crystal structure of a Ktr K+ transporter; the structure of this KtrAB complex reveals how the dimeric membrane protein KtrB interacts with the cytosolic octameric KtrA regulatory protein."

https://openalex.org/W2140470674,"We previously found that BDNF-dependent retrograde trafficking is impaired in AD transgenic mouse neurons. Utilizing a novel microfluidic culture chamber, we demonstrate that Aβ oligomers compromise BDNF-mediated retrograde transport by impairing endosomal vesicle velocities, resulting in impaired downstream signaling driven by BDNF/TrkB, including ERK5 activation, and CREB-dependent gene regulation. Our data suggest that a key mechanism mediating the deficit involves ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme that functions to regulate cellular ubiquitin. Aβ-induced deficits in BDNF trafficking and signaling are mimicked by LDN (an inhibitor of UCH-L1) and can be reversed by increasing cellular UCH-L1 levels, demonstrated here using a transducible TAT-UCH-L1 strategy. Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport. Further, our results support the idea that in AD, Aβ may down-regulate UCH-L1 in the AD brain, which in turn impairs BDNF/TrkB-mediated retrograde signaling, compromising synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival."
https://openalex.org/W1996002552,"TrkH belongs to a superfamily of K(+) transport proteins required for growth of bacteria in low external K(+) concentrations.

TrkH assembles with TrkA, a cytosolic protein comprising two RCK (regulate the conductance of K(+)) domains, which are found in certain K(+) channels and control their gating. However, fundamental questions on whether TrkH is an ion channel and how it is regulated by TrkA remain unresolved. Here we show single-channel activity of TrkH that is upregulated by ATP via TrkA. We report two structures of the tetrameric TrkA ring, one in complex with TrkH and one in isolation, in which the ring assumes two markedly different conformations. These results suggest a mechanism for how ATP increases TrkH activity by inducing conformational changes in TrkA."

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although lipid-lowering drugs have had great success, they fail to protect more than half of patients from cardiovascular events (1Wenner Moyer M. The search beyond statins.Nat.

However, recent de-orphanization of CXCR7 as a new high affinity receptor for SDF-1 places many cellular functions previously attributed to CXCR4 in question (9Burns J.M. Summers B.C. Wang Y.

Studies in gene knock-out mice indicate that CXCR4, but not CXCR7, is required for hematopoiesis (10Sierro F. Biben C. Martínez-Muñoz L. Mellado M. Ransohoff R.M. Li M. Woehl B. Leung H. Groom J.

Our previous work, along with others, showed that in ApoE-null mice or humans with atherosclerosis, plasma SDF-1 level is significantly lower than normal (13Shen J. Chandrasekharan U.M. Ashraf M.Z. Long E. Morton R.E. Liu Y. Smith J.D. DiCorleto P.E. Lack of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 protects ApoE-null mice against atherosclerosis.Circ.

In contrast, SDF-1 is not detected in healthy arteries, but is highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques (4Abi-Younes S. Sauty A. Mach F. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. Luster A.D. The stromal cell-derived factor-1 chemokine is a potent platelet agonist highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques.Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a potential “healthy” SDF-1 gradient across the vascular wall, which is reversed in atherosclerosis. Intrigued by these considerations, we were interested in exploring whether CXCR7 expression may follow the same pattern of change as its agonist SDF-1 in the context of atherosclerosis. Thus, the principle objective of this study was to determine whether CXCR7 is expressed in macrophage-enriched atherosclerotic plaques, and if so, which macrophage signaling pathways are specifically activated by CXCR7. Secondly, we sought to determine whether CXCR7 induction promotes macrophage phagocytosis. Human THP-1 monocytic cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (HyClone, Thermo) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Thermo), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Lonza) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For the induction of cell differentiation, THP-1 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS with 40 nm PMA for 48 h or otherwise indicated times. Alternatively, THP-1 cells were stimulated for 24 h with IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ml) or with IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) and LPS (1 μg/ml). The non-adherent cells were removed by aspiration. Before agonist stimulation, differentiating THP-1 macrophages were starved for 10 h in RPMI 1640 without FBS, and this starvation did not change CXCR7 mRNA expression as compared with non-starved cells (data not shown). Potential endogenous SDF-1 secreted by macrophages was minimized by changing the starvation medium 2 h before the end of starvation. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors or antagonists for 40 min before stimulation. To obtain polarized human macrophages, blood primary monocytes were differentiated into M1 or M2 phenotype by treatment of the cells with the following different reagents for 48 h: IFN-γ (100 ng/ml)+LPS (1 μg/ml), M-CSF (20 ng/ml)+LPS(1 μg/ml), GM-CSF (50 ng/ml)+ LPS(1 μg/ml), IL-4 (20 ng/ml), or IL-13 (20 ng/ml). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from Buffy Coat (Biological Specialty Corp) by density-gradient centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma). The investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki for use of human tissue or subjects, and was approved by Auburn University, Office of Human Subjects Research. Untouched human primary monocytes were purified by negative selection using a Dynabeads kit (Invitrogen), yielding an average 98% purity. Freshly isolated monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics and used in experiments after being stabilized for at least 2 h. Unless otherwise specified in the figures or figure legends, all human primary macrophages were induced into M1 phenotype by IFN-γ (100 ng/ml)+LPS (1 μg/ml) for 2∼3 days before cell signaling and phagocytosis assays. The total RNA and DNA were extracted from THP-1 cells, human primary monocytes and THP-1-derived macrophages according to manufacturer's protocol for the RNeasy and DNeasy kits, respectively (Qiagen). For the synthesis of the first strand of cDNA, 1 μg of total RNA after DNase (Ambion) treatment was reverse-transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA samples were then amplified by PCR using 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The PCR amplification was performed with jump start for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 thermal cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 56 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose ethidium bromide gel, and the bands were visualized with ultraviolet light as we previously reported (13Shen J. Chandrasekharan U.M. Ashraf M.Z. Long E. Morton R.E. Liu Y. Smith J.D. DiCorleto P.E. Lack of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 protects ApoE-null mice against atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR was carried out using an iCycler iQ5 detection system (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green reagents (Applied Biosystems), as we previously described (13Shen J. Chandrasekharan U.M. Ashraf M.Z. Long E. Morton R.E. Liu Y. Smith J.D. DiCorleto P.E. Lack of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 protects ApoE-null mice against atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The PCR mixture (20 μl) contained 0.5 μm concentration of each primer, 4 μl of water, 10 μl of SYBR Green mixture, and 5 μl of cDNA. The samples were placed and sealed in 96-well plates with the following reaction condition: initial PCR activation step (5 min at 95 °C), and cycling steps (denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 60 °C, extension for 2 min at 72 °C; 40 cycles). An internal control, GAPDH, was amplified in separate wells. The threshold cycle (Ct) value and the efficiency of PCR amplification for each set of primers were determined using the accompanying software. We used the comparative cycle threshold ΔΔCt method for relative quantification of gene expression. The sequences of primers are: human CXCR4: Forward: 5′-CACTTCAGATAACTACACCG-3′, and Reverse: 5′-ATCCAGACGCCAACATAGAC-3′; human CXCR7: Forward: 5′-TGGTCAGTCTCGTGCAGCAC-3′, and Reverse: 5′-GCCAGCAGACAAGGAAGACC-3′; human GAPDH: Forward: 5′-TCAACAGCGACACCCACTCC-3′, and Reverse: 5′-TGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTTG-3′. After stimulation for indicated times, cells were lysed, and standard Western blotting was performed as previously described (13Shen J. Chandrasekharan U.M. Ashraf M.Z. Long E. Morton R.E. Liu Y. Smith J.D. DiCorleto P.E. Lack of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 protects ApoE-null mice against atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The individual primary antibodies used were: mouse monoclonal anti-hCXCR7 (clone 11G8, R&D Systems; clone 9C4, MBL; clone 8F11-M16, BioLegend), mouse monoclonal anti-hCXCR4 (clone 12G5, R&D Systems), anti-p-ERK, anti-p-p38, anti-p-JNK, and anti-p-AKT (1:1000, Cell Signaling). Equal protein loading was verified by stripping off the original antibodies and re-probing the membranes with the primary antibody β-actin, GAPDH, tubulin, or total ERK1/2, p38, or JNK (1:1000). THP-1 cells and primary human blood monocytes were seeded in 8-chamber glass slides (Nunc) with or without differentiation into macrophages. After 48 h, the medium was aspirated, and cells were fixed for 10 min in cold methanol. The fixed cells were washed with PBS three times and blocked with 3% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-hCXCR7 antibody (1:100, 11G8) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 90 min at room temperature in darkness. For negative controls, cells were incubated with non-immune IgG in place of the specific primary antibody or just the FITC-conjugated secondly antibody. Images with fluorescent signals in random fields were acquired and captured using an AMG EVOS® digital inverted multi-functional microscope (AMG) as we previously reported (13Shen J.

For determining cell surface CXCR4, CXCR7, CXCR3, CD36, and CD206 (macrophage mannose receptor), cells were washed twice with flow cytometry staining buffer and suspended in the same buffer to a final concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml. Then, 25-μl cell aliquots were transferred for Fc receptor blocking with human IgG for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with PE-conjugated anti-human CXCR7 (11G8), fluorescein-conjugated anti-human CXCR4 (12G5), PE-conjugated anti-human CXCR3 (BD Pharmingen), FITC-conjugated anti-human CD36 (BioLegend), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-human CD206 (BioLegend), or non-immune IgG isotype controls at 10 μg/ml on ice for 30 min in darkness and then rinsed with cold buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS). For intracellular staining of CD68, cells were washed twice with flow cytometry staining buffer and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde. After two washes, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS buffer plus 0.5 μg/ml FITC-labeled anti-human CD68 (BioLegend). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature in darkness, cells were washed again before analysis. After rinsing, all cells were resuspended in the same buffer for flow analysis in the Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer®. ApoE-deficient mice and genetically matched C57BL/6 normal control mice (Jackson Laboratory) with same ages and genders were employed in this study as we previously described.(13Shen J.

All mice were maintained in a facility free of well-defined pathogens under the supervision of the Biological Resource Unit at Auburn University. All animal protocols were approved by Auburn Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee; and the investigation conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health. We fed mice with normal chow diet for 16 weeks and then evaluated atherosclerotic lesions in aortic sinus by oil red O staining as reported previously.(13Shen J. Chandrasekharan U.M. Ashraf M.Z.

Res. 2010; 106: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) The mouse hearts and aorta were perfused, dissected, and subjected to determination of atherosclerosis, as previously described (13Shen J. Chandrasekharan U.M. Ashraf M.Z. Long E. Morton R.E. Liu Y. Smith J.D. DiCorleto P.E. Lack of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 protects ApoE-null mice against atherosclerosis.Circ.

Briefly, mice requiring aortic tissue analysis were euthanized by deep anesthesia with ketamine/xylaxine (170 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, peritoneal injection once) prior to intracardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The hearts were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium and frozen, after which serial sections (10 μm) were taken from the aortic sinus. Images were obtained of the sections following staining with oil red O (counterstaining with H&E). The CXCR7-positive and F4/80-positive areas were determined in 4 sections from each mouse, using 80-μm intervals between the sections; the results were confirmed in three ApoE-null and control mice. Mouse aortic sections were fixed in cold methanol for 10 min and rinsed twice in PBS. Sections were blocked with 5% horse serum at room temperature for 1 h. The anti-F4/80 or sheep anti-mouse CXCR7 antibody (R&D Systems, Catalogue number: AF4227) or isotype control Abs were added to the sections at 10 μg/ml and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h. Sections were rinsed thoroughly in PBS and incubated with Dylight 488-conjugated anti-rat IgG or NL637-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (R&D Systems) for 45 min. Sections were then counterstained with H&E and oil red O, rinsed thoroughly in PBS and cover slipped with Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector laboratories), as previously reported. (13Shen J. Chandrasekharan U.M. Ashraf M.Z. Long E. Morton R.E. Liu Y. Smith J.D. DiCorleto P.E. Lack of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 protects ApoE-null mice against atherosclerosis.Circ.

To knockdown the CXCR7 and CXCR4 receptors, THP-1 cells were transfected with the four sequence SMART pools (ON-TARGET plus CXCR7 siRNA: L-013212−00−0005; ON-TARGET plus CXCR4 siRNA: L-005139-00-0005; or ON-TARGET plus Non-targeting scramble control siRNA: D-001810-10−05, Dharmacon) by electroporation using the Lonza Nucleofector technology (4D-Nucleofector®). We followed an optimized protocol reported recently by Schnoor et al. (36Schnoor M. Buers I. Sietmann A. Brodde M.F. Hofnagel O. Robenek H. Lorkowski S. Efficient non-viral transfection of THP-1 cells.J. Immunol. Methods. 2009; 344: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) Briefly, a human Monocyte Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) was used for the transfection and the number of THP-1 cells was 2.5 × 106 per transfection cuvette. THP-1 cells were recovered 4 h after transfection in Human Monocyte Nucleofector Medium (Lonza) supplemented with 20% FBS. Transfected cells per cuvette were transferred into single well of 6-well plates containing 1.5 ml fresh Human Monocyte Nucleofector Medium supplemented as described above and containing PMA 40 nm or “IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) + LPS (1 μg/ml)” for macrophage differentiation for 24∼48 h. Real-time RT-PCR assay and Western blotting were performed to confirm the decrease or suppression of CXCR7/4 mRNA and protein expression respectively after 24∼48 h post-transfection. For cell stimulation, transfected and differentiating cells were starved at least for 8 h before stimulated by SDF-1, I-TAC, or TC14012 for the indicated times. Macrophage phagocytic activity was measured using the Vybrant Phagocytosis Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and Dil-ac-LDL uptake assay (Invitrogen). Briefly, human monocytes were differentiated into macrophages in 96-well plate by incubation with “100 ng/ml IFNγ + 1 μg/ml LPS” for 48 h, after which cells were starved for 10 h. The cells in four replicates were stimulated with agonists for 2 h with or without pre-treatment with inhibitors. The cells were further incubated with heat-inactivated, fluorescein-labeled Escherichia coli K-12 BioParticles for 2 h, after which extracellular fluorescence was quenched by trypan blue and phagocytic activity was quantified by measuring fluorescence intensity of the uptaken particles emission at 520 nm with an excitation at 485 nm using a microplate reader (FLUOstar). To determine cellular uptake of acetylated-LDL, the same experimental procedure for E. coli phagocytosis was used as described above with the following modifications: 1) fluorescein-labeled E. coli K-12 BioParticles were replaced by Dil-ac-LDL (10 μg/ml); 2) trypan blue quenching was replaced by three times PBS washing; and 3) the red fluorescence intensity was determined in the Varioskan Flash Multimode Plate Reader (fluorescence Ex/Em: 554/571). The negative controls were prepared by adding vehicles and fluorescence labeled probes without cells; and macrophages without stimulation were used as positive controls. Results were expressed as the percentage of increase compared with positive controls after deduction of negative controls as suggested by the kit instructions. Recombinant human SDF-1a, I-TAC, M-CSF, GM-CSF, TNFα, IL-4, IL13, and IFN-γ were purchased from R&D System. AMD3100 was obtained from EMD chemicals, TC14012 and PMA from Tocris Bioscience. The CXCR3-selective antagonist Compound 6c was purchased from Axon Medchem. DNA primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, and LPS from Sigma. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The means of two groups were compared using Student's t test (unpaired, two tailed), and one-way analysis of variance was used for comparison of more than 2 groups with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were repeated at least three times. To investigate whether CXCR7 is induced during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, THP-1 cells were treated with PMA, a well-established macrophage inducer. As expected, THP-1 cells acquired a macrophage-like morphology after stimulation by PMA (40 nm) for 48 h (Fig. 1A). Macrophage differentiation was confirmed by up-regulated CD68 and CD36 (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR analysis showed that undifferentiated THP-1 cells expressed high level of CXCR4, but not CXCR7 mRNA; however, PMA treatment induced CXCR7 mRNA expression, with a simultaneous down-regulation of CXCR4 mRNA (Fig. 1C). Real-time PCR assay confirmed that CXCR7 mRNA was induced as early as 2 h in response to PMA, reached maximal level at 24∼48 h, and then declined to a level still significantly higher than that of time-controlled undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the same differentiation protocol suppressed CXCR4 mRNA expression more than 50% in the observation window (Fig. 1D). To determine whether CXCR7 up-regulation in THP-1 cells is limited to the reagent PMA, we treated the cells with alternative differentiation factors that are more pathologically relevant. Fig. 1E shows that CXCR7 mRNA was similarly induced in response to IFN-γ+LPS, but not to IFN-γ+M-CSF. A similar pattern of CXCR4/7 mRNA expression change was observed in human primary monocytes when they were differentiated into M1 and M2 macrophages with a more robust induction of CXCR7 mRNA in M1 cells than in M2 cells (Fig. 1F). Immunofluorescent assay showed that CXCR7 protein was expressed in macrophages differentiated from primary monocytes after 48 h treatment with IFN-γ+LPS, but it was not detected in primary human monocytes (Fig. 2A). Of notes, no positive staining was observed once CXCR7 monoclonal antibody was replaced by its IgG control antibody or when only FITC-conjugated secondary antibody was used (Fig. 2A). To confirm whether CXCR7 is expressed on cell surface, we performed flow cytometry assays. Fig. 2, B & C show that CXCR7 was not expressed in THP-1 cells or in primary monocytes; however, upon differentiation by IFN-γ+LPS for 48 h, cell surface CXCR7 antigen was significantly increased in THP-1 macrophages or in macrophages differentiated from primary cells. In contrast, cell surface CXCR4 antigen decreased during this differentiation process as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2C). We found a similar change when the percentages of CXCR4-positive or CXCR7-positive cells were determined (Fig. 3, A & B). In addition, we observed that M1 polarization of primary macrophages exhibited more CXCR7 antigen than did M2 polarization (Fig. 3, C & D). Our Western blotting assay further showed that during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, CXCR7 total protein was detected by three different specific mouse monoclonal antibodies, (15Berahovich R.D. Penfold M.E. Schall T.J. Nonspecific CXCR7 antibodies.Immunol. Lett. 2010; 133: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) whereas CXCR4 protein level was down-regulated (Fig. 2D). To assess the in vivo relevance of our finding, we extended our observation to ApoE-null mice with atherosclerotic lesions. Immunofluorescent analysis on serial sections of mouse aorta from ApoE-null mice showed that CXCR7 protein was expressed in the atherosclerotic lesions (Fig. 4A). In addition, CXCR7 protein"
https://openalex.org/W2039382895,"Type I interferon (IFN-α/β) binds to cell surface receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 and triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. This response is a crucial component in innate immunity in that it establishes an ""antiviral state"" in cells and protects them against further damage. Previous work demonstrated that, compared with their differentiated counterparts, pluripotent human cells have a much weaker response to cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and are only able to produce a minimal amount of IFN-β. We show here that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) also exhibit an attenuated response to IFN-β. Even though all known type I IFN signaling components are expressed in these cells, STAT1 phosphorylation is greatly diminished upon IFN-β treatment. This attenuated response correlates with a high expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). Upon differentiation of hESCs into trophoblasts, cells acquire the ability to respond to IFN-β, and this is accompanied by a significant induction of STAT1 phosphorylation as well as a decrease in SOCS1 expression. Furthermore, SOCS1 knockdown in hiPSCs enhances their ability to respond to IFN-β. Taken together, our results suggest that an attenuated cellular response to type I IFNs may be a general feature of pluripotent human cells and that this is associated with high expression of SOCS1."
https://openalex.org/W2063998080,"The development of nonhormonal treatment of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) has been hampered by a lack of clear understanding of the mechanisms leading to keratinocyte (KC) detachment and death in pemphigus. In this study, we sought to identify changes in the vital mitochondrial functions in KCs treated with the sera from PV patients and healthy donors. PV sera significantly increased proton leakage from KCs, suggesting that PV IgGs increase production of reactive oxygen species. Indeed, measurement of intracellular reactive oxygen species production showed a drastic increase of cell staining in response to treatment by PV sera, which was confirmed by FACS analysis. Exposure of KCs to PV sera also caused dramatic changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential detected with the JC-1 dye. These changes can trigger the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis. Although sera from different PV patients elicited unique patterns of mitochondrial damage, the mitochondria-protecting drugs nicotinamide (also called niacinamide), minocycline, and cyclosporine A exhibited a uniform protective effect. Their therapeutic activity was validated in the passive transfer model of PV in neonatal BALB/c mice. The highest efficacy of mitochondrial protection of the combination of these drugs found in mitochondrial assay was consistent with the ability of the same drug combination to abolish acantholysis in mouse skin. These findings provide a theoretical background for clinical reports of the efficacy of mitochondria-protecting drugs in PV patients. Pharmacological protection of mitochondria and/or compensation of an altered mitochondrial function may therefore become a novel approach to development of personalized nonhormonal therapies of patients with this potentially lethal autoimmune blistering disease."
https://openalex.org/W1484463029,"KLF4 is a member of the Kruppel-like factor family of transcriptional regulators. KLF4 has been shown to be required for normal terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, but the molecular mechanism whereby KLF4 regulates genes associated with the differentiation process has not been studied. In the present study, we explore the impact of KLF4 on expression of involucrin, a gene that is specifically expressed in differentiated keratinocytes. KLF4 overexpression and knockdown studies show that involucrin mRNA and protein level correlates directly with KLF4 level. Moreover, studies of mutant KLF4 proteins indicate that transcriptionally inactive forms do not increase involucrin expression. PKCδ is a regulator of keratinocyte differentiation that increases expression of differentiation-associated target genes, including involucrin. Overexpression of KLF4 augments the PKCδ-dependent increase in involucrin expression, whereas KLF4 knockdown attenuates this response. The KLF4 induction of human involucrin (hINV) promoter activity is mediated via KLF4 binding to a GC-rich element located in the hINV promoter distal regulatory region, a region of the promoter required for in vivo involucrin expression. Mutation of the GC-rich element, an adjacent AP1 factor binding site, or both sites severely attenuates the response. Moreover, loss of KLF4 in an epidermal equivalent model of differentiation results in loss of hINV expression. These studies suggest that KLF4 is part of a multiprotein complex that interacts that the hINV promoter distal regulatory region to drive differentiation-dependent hINV gene expression in epidermis."

https://openalex.org/W2139451188,"Regulation of mtDNA expression is critical for controlling oxidative phosphorylation capacity and has been reported to occur at several different levels in mammalian mitochondria. LRPPRC (leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein) has a key role in this regulation and acts at the post-transcriptional level to stabilize mitochondrial mRNAs, to promote mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylation, and to coordinate mitochondrial translation. However, recent studies have suggested that LRPPRC may have an additional intramitochondrial role by directly interacting with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase POLRMT to stimulate mtDNA transcription. In this study, we have further examined the intramitochondrial roles for LRPPRC by creating bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice with moderately increased LRPPRC expression and heterozygous Lrpprc knock-out mice with moderately decreased LRPPRC expression. Variation of LRPPRC levels in mice in vivo, occurring within a predicted normal physiological range, strongly affected the levels of an unprocessed mitochondrial precursor transcript (ND5-cytochrome b) but had no effect on steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts or de novo transcription of mtDNA. We further assessed the role of LRPPRC in mitochondrial transcription by performing size exclusion chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments in human cell lines and mice, but we found no interaction between LRPPRC and POLRMT. Furthermore, addition of purified LRPPRC to a recombinant human in vitro transcription system did not activate mtDNA transcription. On the basis of these data, we conclude that LRPPRC does not directly regulate mtDNA transcription but rather acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of mammalian mtDNA expression."

It is produced from the conversion of l-arginine to l-citrulline and NO by a family of nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs), of which there are three isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS), 3The abbreviations used are: nNOS, neuronal nitric oxide synthase; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; CM, cytokine mixture; l-NAME, l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mTORC2, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; ODQ, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor. inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS). nNOS and eNOS are expressed constitutively in neurons and endothelial cells, respectively, and iNOS is induced in several cell types (2Bredt D.S.

The induction of iNOS is involved in the regulation of immunity, the clearance of pathogens, and the pathogenesis of several conditions (8Bogdan C. Röllinghoff M. Diefenbach A.

Is iNOS beginning to smoke?.Cell. 2011; 147: 257-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cytokines are one of the main inducers of iNOS expression. In mice, the proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1, and IFNγ act together to induce very high levels of iNOS in many cell types (10Stuehr D.J. Cho H.J. Kwon N.S. Weise M.F. Nathan C.F.

U.S.A. 1991; 88: 7773-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Pathogen-derived molecules, such as lipopolysaccharide, also stimulate iNOS expression (11Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. Promoter of the mouse gene encoding calcium-independent nitric oxide synthase confers inducibility by interferon γ and bacterial lipopolysaccharide.J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In contrast to mice, expression of iNOS in humans is relatively restricted to certain cell types, and controversy exists regarding differences between the regulation of human and mouse expression of this enzyme (12Schneemann M. Schoedon G. Species differences in macrophage NO production are important.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). iNOS expression has been documented in macrophages from patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, although neither bacterial components nor the combination of TNF, IL-1, and IFNγ induces substantial levels of iNOS expression in cultured human macrophages (13Nicholson S.

Also, evaluation of human iNOS gene promoter activity in transgenic mice expressing human iNOS promoter enhanced GFP has shown extensive species-specific distinctions in expression patterns of iNOS under both basal and inflammatory settings (16Yu Z.

Physiol. 2005; 288: F214-F220Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These findings highlight the importance of defining mechanisms regulating iNOS expression specifically in human cells to provide insight into human physiology and pathology. Inducible expression of iNOS has been defined in only a handful of primary human cell types such as astrocytes, hepatocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells (17Lee S.C. Brosnan C.F. Cytokine regulation of iNOS expression in human glial cells.Methods. 1996; 10: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Billiar T.R. Hoffman R.A. Geller D.A.

Med. 1992; 176: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Certain human cell lines have also been instrumental in defining the role of signaling pathways in the regulation of human iNOS expression. The cytokines TNF, IL-1, and IFNγ act in synergy to induce human iNOS gene expression through the coordinated activation of NF-κB, JAK-STAT1, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK pathways (19Taylor B.S. de Vera M.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8445-8452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibits cytokine-induced human iNOS gene promoter activity, although the effect of this signaling pathway on post-transcriptional regulation of iNOS levels has not been examined (23Kristof A.S. Fielhaber J. Triantafillopoulos A. Nemoto S. Moss J. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent suppression of the human inducible nitric-oxide synthase promoter is mediated by FKHRL1.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23958-23968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras is also involved in the induction of iNOS in some cell types, although how Ras interacts with other signaling pathways in this setting is incompletely defined (24Pahan K. Liu X. McKinney M.J. Wood C. Sheikh F.G. Raymond J.R. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p21ras inhibits induction of nitric oxide synthase and activation of nuclear factor-κB in primary astrocytes.J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2288-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of NO are mediated largely by the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and by protein S-nitrosylation. Activation of sGC by NO initiates cGMP signaling pathways by converting GTP to cGMP (25Tennyson A.G. Lippard S.J. Generation, translocation, and action of nitric oxide in living systems.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1211-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NO also directly modifies proteins by S-nitrosylation, which is a post-translational modification that involves the covalent addition of a nitroso moiety onto cysteines to form S-nitrosocysteine. This type of protein modification regulates the enzymatic properties of a large number of proteins and has recently been suggested to have similar biological significance as protein phosphorylation (26Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Protein S-nitrosylation: purview and parameters.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Lander et al.

However, very little is known about how this modification of Ras affects cell biology. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a 289-kDa serine threonine protein kinase that regulates cell size, proliferation, survival, and metabolism (29Powell J.D. Delgoffe G.M. The mammalian target of rapamycin: linking T cell differentiation, function, and metabolism.Immunity. 2010; 33: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, mTOR forms two complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. Activation of mTORC1 supports cell growth by increasing protein translation and lipid biosynthesis through activation of p70 S6 kinase and the translation initiation factor eIF-4E BP1. mTORC2 promotes proliferation and survival, at least in part, by inhibiting activity of the transcription factors Foxo1 and Foxo3a (30Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3589-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). The Akt and mTOR pathways are tightly linked as Akt can activate mTORC1 and this kinase is activated downstream of mTORC2 (31Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. TSC2 is phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt and suppresses mTOR signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar, 32Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sengupta S.

Cell. 2006; 22: 159-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar). iNOS expression is tightly controlled by feedback mechanisms that fine-tune its expression. The nature of NO-mediated feedback regulation of iNOS expression is cell- and context-dependent. NO, either provided exogenously by NO donors or synthesized endogenously, has been reported to act as part of a negative feedback loop to down-regulate iNOS expression (33Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). iNOS-derived NO can also inhibit iNOS enzymatic function through post-translational modifications (35Albakri Q.A. Stuehr D.J. Intracellular assembly of inducible NO synthase is limited by nitric oxide-mediated changes in heme insertion and availability.J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14766-14771Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast to negative regulation, NO positively regulates iNOS expression in certain rodent cell types and in human cells, but the mechanisms by which this positive feedback occurs is poorly understood (37Mühl H.

We showed previously that iNOS-derived NO augments human allogeneic immune responses (41Choy J.C. Wang Y. Tellides G. Pober J.S.

Transplant. 2009; 9: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and, in the current study, we define a positive feedback mechanism by which iNOS-derived NO amplifies iNOS protein expression in human cells. Pharmacological inhibition of iNOS activity attenuated iNOS protein expression, and the addition of exogenous NO was sufficient to rescue iNOS levels. Potentiation of iNOS expression by NO was due to S-nitrosylation of Ras, which increased iNOS levels through supporting the sustained activation of Akt. This NO-mediated augmentation of iNOS protein levels also involved activation of the mTOR pathway, as demonstrated by the attenuation of iNOS protein levels by rapamycin. Altogether, our findings highlight an important regulatory process controlling the expression of iNOS in human cells and identify a novel role of Ras S-nitrosylation in this process. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were purchased from ATCC and cultured in F-12K medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Primary human astrocytes were purchased from Lonza, cultured as above in ABM medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with the AGM SingleQuot Kit (Lonza), and used between passages 4 and 12 for experiments. Primary bronchial epithelial cells were also purchased from Lonza, cultured in BEGM with the associated supplements, and used between passages 2 and 6. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM + 10% FCS. All experiments were performed at least three times. For all experiments using A549 cells, confluent cells were incubated in basal medium in the absence of serum for 24 h prior to cytokine treatment. Primary cells were not serum-starved. To induce iNOS, cells were treated with a cytokine mixture (CM) of recombinant human IL-1α (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), recombinant human TNFα (PeproTech), and recombinant human IFNγ (Invitrogen) for the indicated times. iNOS activity was inhibited by incubating cells with 1400W (50 μm unless indicated otherwise; Sigma-Aldrich) or l-NAME (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) 1 h prior to cytokine stimulation. Nitric oxide was added using the slow release NO donor NOC-18 (Calbiochem). Inhibition of signaling pathways was achieved by incubating cells with the pharmacological inhibitors FPT inhibitor II (100 μm; Calbiochem), LY294002 (50 μm; Calbiochem), Akt inhibitor VII (50 μm, Calbiochem), PD98059 (50 μm; Cayman Chemicals), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor (20 μm; Calbiochem), and PP2 (20 μm; Calbiochem). sGC was inhibited using 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ; Cayman Chemicals), and the mTOR pathway was inhibited with rapamycin (50 nm; LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA).

Data were acquired on an ABI 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). NO production was measured by quantifying the accumulation of nitrite in culture supernatants as described previously (41Choy J.C. Wang Y. Tellides G. Pober J.S.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using a NO-specific chemiluminescence analyzer (Sievers, Boulder, CO). A549 cells were harvested by trypsinization, and 1 × 106 cells were transfected with 6 μg of wild type or 6 μg of C118S Ras plasmid using an Amaxa nucleofector as per the manufacturer's instructions (Lonza) and as described previously (45Liu A.C. Lee M. McManus B.M. Choy J.C.

Following transfection, cells were rested in 6-well tissue culture plates for 24 h and then used for experiments. The biotin switch method to measure S-nitrosylation was performed using the S-nitrosylation protein detection assay kit (Cayman Chemicals) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Following the biotin switch assay, Ras was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal Ras antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), and the immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted for biotin using an HRP-conjugated monoclonal biotin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and a rabbit polyclonal Ras antibody (EMD Millipore). Immunoblot images were quantified by densitometry using the National Institutes of Health ImageJ software, and protein expression data were normalized to β-actin levels. Unless otherwise indicated, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. obtained in at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were made with a Student's t test or with analysis of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference test. Statistically significant differences were defined as p < 0.05. To study the impact of iNOS-derived NO on the feedback regulation of human iNOS expression, A549 cells were stimulated with CM composed of TNFα (10 ng/ml), IL-1α (10 ng/ml), and IFNγ (50 ng/ml). This stimulus is known to optimally induce the expression of iNOS (19Taylor B.S. de Vera M.E. Ganster R.W. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Morris Jr., S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Multiple NF-κB enhancer elements regulate cytokine induction of the human inducible nitric oxide synthase gene.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15148-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The induction of iNOS expression was evident in CM-treated cells as early as 3–4 h after stimulation and continued to increase until 6 h after stimulation, which was the last time point examined (Fig. 1A). CM also induced the production of NO that was concomitant with the induction of iNOS expression. NO levels were significantly increased at 4 h after stimulation and continued to increase thereafter (Fig. 1B). Also, NO production in response to CM was completely prevented by the iNOS inhibitor 1400W (data not shown). The role of iNOS activity in regulating iNOS protein levels was studied by treating cells with the iNOS inhibitor 1400W or the pan-NOS inhibitor l-NAME followed by examination of iNOS protein expression by immunoblot 6 h later. The inhibition of iNOS activity using either inhibitor significantly reduced CM-induced iNOS protein levels (Fig. 1C). To confirm that NO produced by iNOS was involved in the augmentation of iNOS protein levels, the NO donor NOC-18 was added to cells at the same time as iNOS inhibition with 1400W. The addition of exogenous NO in this manner prevented the reduction in iNOS expression caused by pharmacological inhibition, indicating that iNOS-derived NO stimulates a positive feedback pathway that amplifies iNOS protein levels (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, inhibition of iNOS activity did not affect iNOS mRNA levels, indicating a specific effect of NO in the amplification of protein levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism (Fig. 1E). Other studies have shown in mouse cells that iNOS-derived NO can inhibit iNOS expression (33Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Sherman M.P. Ignarro L.J.

Nitric oxide inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is possible that NO has pleiotropic effects on cell signaling and that the effect of iNOS-derived NO may be different in humans and mice (12Schneemann M. Schoedon G. Species differences in macrophage NO production are important.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As such, the effect of iNOS activity on the feedback regulation of iNOS expression in a mouse cell line was examined. Stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells with LPS + IFNγ induced iNOS expression and, in contrast to our observation in human cells but consistent with previous studies examining mouse macrophages (33Griscavage J.M.

The role of iNOS activity in regulating iNOS protein levels was also examined in primary cells. Primary human astrocytes stimulated with CM express iNOS with maximal levels apparent at 24 h after stimulation (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our findings in A549 cells, inhibition of iNOS activity with 1400W dose-depen"
https://openalex.org/W1963731728,"This article develops a novel approach and algorithmic tools for the modeling and survivability analysis of networks with heterogeneous nodes, and examines their application to space-based networks. Space-based networks (SBNs) allow the sharing of spacecraft on-orbit resources, such as data storage, processing, and downlink. Each spacecraft in the network can have different subsystem composition and functionality, thus resulting in node heterogeneity. Most traditional survivability analyses of networks assume node homogeneity and as a result, are not suited for the analysis of SBNs. This work proposes that heterogeneous networks can be modeled as interdependent multi-layer networks, which enables their survivability analysis. The multi-layer aspect captures the breakdown of the network according to common functionalities across the different nodes, and it allows the emergence of homogeneous sub-networks, while the interdependency aspect constrains the network to capture the physical characteristics of each node. Definitions of primitives of failure propagation are devised. Formal characterization of interdependent multi-layer networks, as well as algorithmic tools for the analysis of failure propagation across the network are developed and illustrated with space applications. The SBN applications considered consist of several networked spacecraft that can tap into each other's Command and Data Handling subsystem, in case of failure of its own, including the Telemetry, Tracking and Command, the Control Processor, and the Data Handling sub-subsystems. Various design insights are derived and discussed, and the capability to perform trade-space analysis with the proposed approach for various network characteristics is indicated. The select results here shown quantify the incremental survivability gains (with respect to a particular class of threats) of the SBN over the traditional monolith spacecraft. Failure of the connectivity between nodes is also examined, and the results highlight the importance of the reliability of the wireless links between spacecraft (nodes) to enable any survivability improvements for space-based networks."
https://openalex.org/W1976355917,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) confers agrochemical compatibility to fungal cells-based mycoinsecticdes but mechanisms involved in MDR remain poorly understood for entomopathogenic fungi, which have been widely applied as biocontrol agents against arthropod pests. Here we characterized the functions of five ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which were classified to the subfamilies ABC-B (Mdr1), ABC-C (Mrp1) and ABC-G (Pdr1, Pdr2 and Pdr5) and selected from 54 full-size ABC proteins of Beauveria bassiana based on their main domain architecture, membrane topology and transcriptional responses to three antifungal inducers. Disruption of each transporter gene resulted in significant reduction in resistance to four to six of eight fungicides or antifungal drugs tested due to their differences in structure and function. Compared with wild-type and complemented (control) strains, disruption mutants of all the five transporter genes became significantly less tolerant to the oxidants menadione and H2O2 based on 22−41% and 10−31% reductions of their effective concentrations required for the suppression of 50% colony growth at 25°C. Under a standardized spray, the killing actions of ΔPdr5 and ΔMrp1 mutants against Spodoptera litura second-instar larvae were delayed by 59% and 33% respectively. However, no significant virulence change was observed in three other delta mutants. Taken together, the examined five ABC transporters contribute differentially to not only the fungal MDR but antioxidant capability, a phenotype rarely associated with ABC efflux pumps in previous reports; at least some of them are required for the full virulence of B. bassiana, thereby affecting the fungal biocontrol potential. Our results indicate that ABC pump-dependent MDR mechanisms exist in entomopathogenic fungi as do in yeasts and human and plant pathogenic fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2063163739,"The Drosophila humoral innate immune response fights infection by producing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) through the microbe-specific activation of the Toll or the Imd signaling pathway. Upon systemic infection, the production of AMPs is both positively and negatively regulated to reach a balanced immune response required for survival. Here, we report the function of the dRYBP (drosophila Ring and YY1 Binding Protein) protein, which contains a ubiquitin-binding domain, in the Imd pathway. We have found that dRYBP contributes to the negative regulation of AMP production: upon systemic infection with Gram-negative bacteria, Diptericin expression is up-regulated in the absence of dRYBP and down-regulated in the presence of high levels of dRYBP. Epistatic analyses using gain and loss of function alleles of imd, Relish, or skpA and dRYBP suggest that dRYBP functions upstream or together with SKPA, a member of the SCF-E3-ubiquitin ligase complex, to repress the Imd signaling cascade. We propose that the role of dRYBP in the regulation of the Imd signaling pathway is to function as a ubiquitin adaptor protein together with SKPA to promote SCF-dependent proteasomal degradation of Relish. Beyond the identification of dRYBP as a novel component of Imd pathway regulation, our results also suggest that the evolutionarily conserved RYBP protein may be involved in the human innate immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2010632677,"Exogenous low-intensity electrical stimulation has been used for treatment of various intractable diseases despite the dearth of information on the molecular underpinnings of its effects. Our work and that of others have demonstrated that applied electrical stimulation at physiological strength or mild electrical stimulation (MES) activates the PI3K-Akt pathway, but whether MES activates other molecules remains unknown. Considering that MES is a form of physiological stress, we hypothesized that it can activate the tumor suppressor p53, which is a key modulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis in response to cell stresses. The potential response of p53 to an applied electrical current of low intensity has not been investigated. Here, we show that p53 was transiently phosphorylated at Ser-15 in epithelial cells treated with an imperceptible voltage (1 V/cm) and a 0.1-ms pulse width. MES-induced p53 phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor and transfection of dominant-negative mutants of p38, MKK3b, and MKK6b, implying the involvement of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, MES treatment enhanced p53 transcriptional function and increased the expression of p53 target genes p21, BAX, PUMA, NOXA, and IRF9. Importantly, MES treatment triggered G2 cell cycle arrest, but not cell apoptosis. MES treatment had no effect on the cell cycle in HCT116 p53(-/-) cells, suggesting a dependence on p53. These findings identify some molecular targets of electrical stimulation and incorporate the p38-p53 signaling pathway among the transduction pathways that MES affects."

The two approved classes of RT inhibitors are nucleoside analog (NRTI) and non-nucleoside analog (NNRTI) RT inhibitors. Phosphorylated NRTIs compete with natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), bind to the polymerase active site, and cause chain termination of the growing DNA strand. Binding of NNRTIs to a hydrophobic pocket near the polymerase active site results in inhibition of nucleotide incorporation without directly competing with the substrate (1Basavapathruni A.

These findings point to a highly flexible ATP-binding site that can accommodate this ligand in various orientations in both pre- and post-translocational conformations. We conclude that the bound ATP compromises dissociation of INDOPY-1 from a post-translocated complex. The heterodimeric (p66/p51) HIV-1 RT enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (21Le Grice S.F. Grüninger-Leitch F. Rapid purification of homodimer and heterodimer HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by metal chelate affinity chromatography.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange procedure. WT RT refers to the wild-type enzyme (HXB2 strain). TAM1 RT contains mutations M41L, D67N, L210W, and T215Y. TAM2 RT contains mutations D67N, K70R, T215F, and K219Q. “Remodeled TAMs” RT harbors mutations K70G, V75T, L228R, and K219R. Oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and purchased from IDT with the exception of RNA template PBS-250 that was synthesized through in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (22Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Comparison of deoxyoligonucleotide and tRNA(Lys-3) as primers in an endogenous human immunodeficiency virus-1 in vitro reverse transcription/template-switching reaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14672-14680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA primer was either synthesized with a fluorescent Cy5 or Alexa488 label at its 5′-end or 32P-radiolabeled with [γ-32]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas) (13Marchand B. Götte M. Site-specific footprinting reveals differences in the translocation status of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Implications for polymerase translocation and drug resistance.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Alexa555 quencher dUTP was purchased from Invitrogen. The RT inhibitor INDOPY-1 was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Division of AIDS NIAID, National Institutes of Health), and Tibotec BVBA is the reagent contributor. Natural and modified nucleotides were purchased from Fermentas and TriLink, respectively (chemical structures are provided in supplemental Fig. 1). A 3-fold excess of DNA template (C1-A, 5′-GTAACTAGAGATCCCTCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAGAAT) was hybridized to 50 nm of a fluorescently labeled DNA primer (8aT_Cy5, 5′-Cy5-TTCTGACTAAAAGGGTCTGAGGGAT). DNA·RNA hybrids were formed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 50 mm NaCl. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min followed by a gradual decrease to room temperature. The hybrid was then incubated with 50 nm HIV-1 RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, as well as varying amounts of ATP and increasing concentrations of INDOPY-1 (0–18 μm). Nucleotide incorporation was initiated with the addition of 6 mm MgCl2 and 100 nm dCTP at 37 °C and was allowed to proceed for 5 min. Samples were resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and analyzed with a phosphorimager instrument (Amersham Biosciences) using Quantity One and ImageQuant software. A 2-fold molar excess of PBS-250 RNA template was hybridized to 50 nm of 5′-radiolabeled PBS-28 DNA primer (5′-CTTTCAGGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCACTG). The hybrid was then incubated with 125 nm RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 μm of each dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. DNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of 6 mm MgCl2 in the absence or presence of inhibitor and NTPs at 37 °C. DNA synthesis was stopped at defined time points by the addition of formamide loading dye. Samples were subsequently resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Similar conditions were employed for monitoring AZT-MP excision whereby 50 nm DNA primer·template were incubated with 250 nm RT and 10 μm AZP-TP in the presence of 0.5 μm dNTPs and 3.5 mm pyrophosphatase-treated ATP. Reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then initiated with 6 mm MgCl2. AZT-MP excision and DNA synthesis rescue was measured at various time points up to 90 min. DNA synthesis was visualized on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. 50 nm DNA·DNA hybrid (primer, PPT-24Cy5 5′-Cy5-ACTTTTTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGAT; template, PPT-57 5′-CGTTGGGAGTGAATTAGCCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGA) was incubated with 5-fold molar excess of WT RT enzyme in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and increasing concentrations of INDOPY-1 (0–4 μm). The stability of enzyme binding to the nucleic acid substrate was assessed in the absence or presence of ATP by the addition of 1.5 μg/μl heparin trap. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and visualized on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. 40 nm of the DNA template containing an Alexa-488 fluorescent dye at the 5′ terminus (5′-Alexa488-AGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGA) was hybridized to a 3-fold molar excess of DNA primer (5′-TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGG). The hybrid was then incubated with 1 nm RT in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 80 mm KCl, 0.025% CHAPS, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT. 200 nm of nucleotide mix containing dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and a modified dUTP were added along with INDOPY-1 (0–30 μm). The modified dUTP contains an Alexa555 quencher, which upon incorporation quenches excitation by Alexa488 present on the DNA template (23Cauchon E. Falgueyret J.P. Auger A. Melnyk R.A. A high throughput continuous assay for screening and characterization of inhibitors of HIV reverse-transcriptase DNA polymerase activity.J. Biomol. Screen. 2011; 16: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The signal was monitored over a period of 60 min using SPECTRAmax M5 fluorometer where reductions in Alexa488 emission signals are indicative of increased DNA polymerization. Translocation of the enzyme relative to the nucleic acid substrate was monitored using Fe2+ site-specific footprinting techniques as described previously (13Marchand B. Götte M. Site-specific footprinting reveals differences in the translocation status of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Implications for polymerase translocation and drug resistance.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Götte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. Temporal coordination between initiation of HIV (+)-strand DNA synthesis and primer removal.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 nm of primer (PPT-20 5′-TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACT) was hybridized to 50 nm DNA template PPT-57 (5′-CGTTGGGAGTGAATTAGCCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAGTGGCTAAGA) containing a radiolabel at the 5′ terminus. The DNA hybrid was then incubated with 750 nm RT (WT or mutant) in a buffer containing 120 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7, 20 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 with and without 1 mm ATP as indicated. The samples were then incubated with a concentration gradient of INDOPY-1 and treated with Fe2+ after a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. Samples were resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Standard deviations for all datasets were calculated through GraphPad Prism software. Briefly, the sum of the square of the difference between each value and the mean was divided by n − 1. The square root of this value represents the standard deviation as calculated by the software. Binding models were generated using the crystal structure of the HIV-1 RT/chain-terminated primer·template·dTTP ternary complex (PDB code 1RTD) (25Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Structure of a covalently trapped catalytic complex of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase: implications for drug resistance.Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). The dTTP substrate present at the active site of the 1RTD structure was removed prior to INDOPY-1 docking. ATP was subsequently docked to the structural model with INDOPY-1 present in the active site. The structure of INDOPY-1 was constructed in ChemDraw (CambridgeSoft Corp.), energy-minimized for 100 cycles under default parameters using Chimera, and saved as a PDB file. The structures of the protein and the small molecule were prepared for docking using AutoDockTools 1.5.4. Subsequently, the docking was performed using AutoDock Vina. Modeling of ATP binding in the context of INDOPY-1 was performed using the same protein crystal structure as above; however, the coordinates for the best candidate pose for INDOPY-1 binding were this time introduced into the PDB file of the protein. Molecular graphics images were produced using the UCSF Chimera package from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (supported by National Institutes of Health Grant P41 RR-01081). The N terminus of RT (amino acids 25–314) of HIV-1 clones containing the TAM1, TAM2, and remodeled TAM mutations (26Ehteshami M. Götte M. Effects of mutations in the connection and RNase H domains of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase on drug susceptibility.AIDS Rev. 2008; 10: 224-235PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified, digested, and ligated using the previously described NRT-vector system (27van Maarseveen N.M. Huigen M.C. de Jong D Smits AM Boucher CA Nijhuis M A novel real time PCR assay to determine relative replication capacity for HIV-1 protease variants and/or reverse transcriptase variants.J. Virol. Methods. 2006; 133: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Clones were verified by sequence analysis. To generate recombinant viruses, RT molecular clones were transfected in 293T cells. For this, 5–6 × 106 293 T cells were seeded the day prior to transfection to achieve 90–95% confluence on the day of transfection. For transfection, 10 μg of plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two days after transfection, recombinant virus was harvested. 50% tissue culture infective dose was determined by end point dilution in MT2 cells or human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Drug susceptibility was determined by a multiple cycle cell-killing assay (28Boucher C.A. Keulen W. van Bommel T. Nijhuis M. de Jong D. de Jong M.D. Schipper P. Back N.K. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug susceptibility determination by using recombinant viruses generated from patient sera tested in a cell-killing assay.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2404-2409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MT-2 cells (5 × 104 in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium and 10% FBS per well) were plated in 96-well microplates. Recombinant virus and reference virus were inoculated for 5 days on a single 96-well plate in the presence of drug dilutions. All viruses were inoculated at multiple multiplicities of infection to adjust for any differences in viral replication capacity (RC). Fold change values were calculated by dividing the mean 50% effective concentration for a recombinant virus by that of the HXB2 reference strain. Fold changes are averages of at least two separate experiments. Drug susceptibility was also analyzed in donor PBMCs. Here, activated PBMCs were infected with a recombinant virus or reference strain using a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 (PBMC titration) incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, after which cells were washed twice. Subsequently, 0.2 × 106 cells/well were plated into a 96-well plate with increasing drug concentrations. p24 was analyzed on days 0 and 7. We monitored single nucleotide incorporations with purified HIV-1 RT in the presence of increasing concentrations of INDOPY-1. This assay revealed an IC50 value of ∼2.5 μm in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2A). In the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of 3 mm ATP (29Smith A.J. Meyer P.R. Asthana D. Ashman M.R. Scott W.A. Intracellular substrates for the primer-unblocking reaction by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase: detection and quantitation in extracts from quiescent- and activated-lymphocyte subpopulations.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we determined an IC50 value of ∼0.25 μm. IC50 values for INDOPY-1 are shown as a function of increasing concentrations of ATP, which demonstrates a dose-dependent effect of the enhancer molecule. We next asked whether the enhancement of inhibition was specific to the nucleotide base of ATP. To address this issue, we monitored multiple nucleotide incorporations on a heteropolymeric template. In the absence of inhibitor, the full-length DNA product appeared within 7 min (Fig. 2B). Saturating concentrations of 6 μm INDOPY-1 reduced the amount of DNA product observed over the same period of time. When DNA synthesis was compared in the presence of INDOPY-1 and 3 mm ATP, UTP, GTP, or CTP, we found that ATP showed the strongest enhancement of inhibition. GTP showed subtle but visible increases in inhibition, whereas pyrimidines UTP and CTP do not seem to act as enhancers. In the absence of INDOPY-1, the presence of NTPs showed only subtle effects on DNA synthesis (data not shown). These findings suggest that the base moiety represents an important structural element in enhancing the inhibitory effects of NcRTIs. We monitored inhibition of DNA synthesis and its enhancement in the presence of derivatives of ATP with mod"
