https://openalex.org/W2053116646,"Epigenetic regulators represent a promising new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), silences gene expression via its histone methyltransferase activity. We found that the oncogenic function of EZH2 in cells of castration-resistant prostate cancer is independent of its role as a transcriptional repressor. Instead, it involves the ability of EZH2 to act as a coactivator for critical transcription factors including the androgen receptor. This functional switch is dependent on phosphorylation of EZH2 and requires an intact methyltransferase domain. Hence, targeting the non-PRC2 function of EZH2 may have therapeutic efficacy for treating metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2031896201,"Long Noncoding RNAs The past 5 years have uncovered thousands of long (&gt;100 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) outpacing our understanding of their functions and mechanisms in regulating the genome. Lee (p. 1435 ) reviews the known and suspected means by which these intriguing molecules control gene expression locally and at great distances, considers potential universal roles for lncRNAs, and warns that classifying these intriguing molecules may be quite challenging given their diversity. The very long noncoding RNA, Airn , silences the Igf2r (insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor) imprinted gene cluster in mammals. Latos et al. (p. 1469 ) show in mouse cells that, rather than recruiting enzymes that modify histones to repress the locus, it is the act of transcription of Airn (and not the Airn gene product) that results in the silencing."

Basset et al. (p. 1481 , see the cover) now provide more reliable estimates of total arthropod species richness in a tropical rainforest in Panama. Intensive sampling of a half hectare of forest yielded just over 6000 arthropod species. Scaling up this result to the whole forest suggests that the total species diversity lies between 17,000 and 40,000 species."
https://openalex.org/W1992002089,"Progress in the development of asymmetric Heck couplings of arenes and acyclic olefins has been limited by a tenuous understanding of the factors that dictate selectivity in migratory insertion and β-hydride elimination. On the basis of key mechanistic insight recently garnered in the exploration of selective Heck reactions, we report here an enantioselective variant that delivers β-, γ-, or δ-aryl carbonyl products from acyclic alkenol substrates. The catalyst system imparts notable regioselectivity during migratory insertion and promotes the migration of the alkene's unsaturation toward the alcohol to ultimately form the ketone product. The reaction uses aryldiazonium salts as the arene source, yields enantiomeric products from opposite starting alkene configurations, and uses a readily accessible ligand. The racemic nature of the alkenol substrate does not bias the enantioselection."
https://openalex.org/W2086774531,"Gold Cluster Catalysis A variety of gold salts and complexes have been used to catalyze different organic reactions. Often, the catalytic rates for these reactions are similar. Oliver-Meseguer et al. (p. 1452 ; see the Perspective by Hashmi ) observed an induction period for the onset of catalysis of organic reactions, such as the ester-assisted hydration of alkynes, for different gold salts and complexes. Mass spectrometry and absorption spectroscopy revealed that small gold clusters (three to ten atoms) formed during these induction periods and are likely to represent the active catalysts. The catalytic reaction rates could be extremely high—up to 10 5 turnovers of the catalyst per hour."
https://openalex.org/W2076118717,"The formation of repetitive structures (such as stripes) in nature is often consistent with a reaction-diffusion mechanism, or Turing model, of self-organizing systems. We used mouse genetics to analyze how digit patterning (an iterative digit/nondigit pattern) is generated. We showed that the progressive reduction in Hoxa13 and Hoxd11-Hoxd13 genes (hereafter referred to as distal Hox genes) from the Gli3-null background results in progressively more severe polydactyly, displaying thinner and densely packed digits. Combined with computer modeling, our results argue for a Turing-type mechanism underlying digit patterning, in which the dose of distal Hox genes modulates the digit period or wavelength. The phenotypic similarity with fish-fin endoskeleton patterns suggests that the pentadactyl state has been achieved through modification of an ancestral Turing-type mechanism."

However, these processes tend to be slow and inefficient. Sobczak et al. (p. 1458 ) examined the folding process with an intercalating fluorescence dye to measure the formation of double-stranded DNA in folding processes or single-stranded DNA in unfolding. Reaction conditions were identified that sped up folding by orders of magnitude and increased yields of the 3D nanoscale objects to nearly 100%."

Blazars are a class of active galaxies powered by accretion onto central black holes with masses a million to a billion times that of the Sun. Nemmen et al. (p. 1445 ) show that, despite tremendous differences in luminosity and black hole mass, the relativistic jets produced in GRBs and blazars follow the same correlation between the kinetic power carried by the accelerated particles and the energy radiated away in the jet, suggesting that there may be a single mechanism for producing relativistic jets."
https://openalex.org/W1981106431,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in converting nicotinamide to NAD(+), essential for cellular metabolism, energy production, and DNA repair. NAMPT has been extensively studied because of its critical role in these cellular processes and the prospect of developing therapeutics against the target, yet how it regulates cellular metabolism is not fully understood. In this study we utilized liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to examine the effects of FK866, a small molecule inhibitor of NAMPT currently in clinical trials, on glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and serine biosynthesis in cancer cells and tumor xenografts. We show for the first time that NAMPT inhibition leads to the attenuation of glycolysis at the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step due to the reduced availability of NAD(+) for the enzyme. The attenuation of glycolysis results in the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates before and at the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step, promoting carbon overflow into the pentose phosphate pathway as evidenced by the increased intermediate levels. The attenuation of glycolysis also causes decreased glycolytic intermediates after the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step, thereby reducing carbon flow into serine biosynthesis and the TCA cycle. Labeling studies establish that the carbon overflow into the pentose phosphate pathway is mainly through its non-oxidative branch. Together, these studies establish the blockade of glycolysis at the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step as the central metabolic basis of NAMPT inhibition responsible for ATP depletion, metabolic perturbation, and subsequent tumor growth inhibition. These studies also suggest that altered metabolite levels in tumors can be used as robust pharmacodynamic markers for evaluating NAMPT inhibitors in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W1984373254,"Spots to Remember Scent marking is an essential component of communication for most mammals. Individuals remember the location of scent marks and regularly revisit marked sites, presumably to assess the condition and status of the animal doing the marking. It is known that individuals can follow odor or pheromone gradients to locate another individual, but relocating scent marks is a much more difficult task given the small amount of volatile compounds deposited, and their static nature. Roberts et al. (p. 1462 ) show that a nonvolatile component of male urine, the protein pheromone darcin, stimulates spatial preference and learning in mice. Female mice preferred locations where male urine (or synthesized darcin) had been found, and remembered these spatial locations for 2 weeks post-exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2070731236,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 is a Ser/Thr kinase, tonically active in resting cells but inhibited by phosphorylation of an N-terminal Ser residue (Ser21 in GSK3α and Ser9 in GSK3β) in response to varied external stimuli. Recent work suggests that GSK3 functions as a negative regulator of platelet function, but how GSK3 is regulated in platelets has not been examined in detail. Here, we show that early thrombin-mediated GSK3 phosphorylation (0–30 s) was blocked by PKC inhibitors and largely absent in platelets from PKCα knock-out mice. In contrast, late (2–5 min) GSK3 phosphorylation was dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. Similarly, early thrombin-mediated inhibition of GSK3 activity was blocked in PKCα knock-out platelets, whereas the Akt inhibitor MK2206 reduced late thrombin-mediated GSK3 inhibition and largely prevented GSK3 inhibition in PKCα knock-out platelets. More importantly, GSK3 phosphorylation contributes to platelet function as knock-in mice where GSK3α Ser21 and GSK3β Ser9 were mutated to Ala showed a significant reduction in PAR4-mediated platelet aggregation, fibrinogen binding, and P-selectin expression, whereas the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 enhanced these responses. Together, these results demonstrate that PKCα and Akt modulate platelet function by phosphorylating and inhibiting GSK3α/β, thereby relieving the negative effect of GSK3α/β on thrombin-mediated platelet activation.Background: The constitutively active kinase GSK3β is a negative regulator of thrombin-stimulated platelet function.Results: Interfering with PKCα and Akt blocked thrombin-mediated GSK3α/β phosphorylation and reduced platelet function.Conclusion: PKCα and Akt phosphorylate GSK3α/β resulting in reduced GSK3α/β activity and increased thrombin-mediated platelet function.Significance: This study shows a novel mechanism by which GSK3α/β is regulated and contributes to platelet function.

Significance: This study shows a novel mechanism by which GSK3α/β is regulated and contributes to platelet function. When a blood vessel becomes damaged, platelets quickly adhere to the newly exposed extracellular matrix and become activated through GPVI signaling, resulting in the exposure of fibrinogen binding sites on integrin αIIbβ3 and granule secretion. A subset of platelets will also expose phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane, nucleating the formation of the prothrombinase complex and subsequent thrombin generation. Thrombin is a potent platelet agonist that cleaves the protease-activated receptors (PARs) 3The abbreviations used are: PARprotease-activated receptorbis-trisbis(2-hydroxyethyl)iminotris(hydroxymethyl)methaneGSK3glycogen synthase kinase 3PEphycoerythrinPMAphorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate. PAR1 and PAR4 on the platelet surface thereby further activating and recruiting platelets to the site of injury. The PAR receptors are G protein-coupled receptors, which, upon cleavage of the receptor, activate the phospholipase C pathway, leading to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Of these, the PKC isoforms PKCα and PKCβ play nonredundant roles in granule secretion and thrombus formation (1Konopatskaya O. Gilio K. Harper M.T. Zhao Y. Cosemans J.M. Karim Z.A. Whiteheart S.W.

In addition to activation of the phospholipase C pathway, many platelet agonists also activate class I phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinases, which phosphorylate PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane leading to an increase in the signaling molecule PI(3,4,5)P3. Human and mouse platelets express all class I PI3K isoforms (PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ), and the use of genetic models and isoform-specific inhibitors has revealed that PI3Kβ plays a predominant role in platelet function, in particular, downstream of GPVI and integrin αIIbβ3 (4Garcia A.

In addition to a role for PI3K in agonist-stimulated platelet function, it has recently become apparent that several platelet primers, such as TPO, IGF-1, and GAS6, also mediate their potentiating effect on platelet function through a PI3K-dependent pathway (7Pasquet J.M.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 potentiates platelet activation via the IRS/PI3Kα pathway.Blood. 2007; 110: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One of the most studied pathways downstream of PI3K is Akt (aka protein kinase B), a Ser/Thr kinase involved in cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism (10Hers I. Vincent E.E. Tavaré J.M. Akt signalling in health and disease.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 1515-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K results in an increase in PI(3,4,5)P3, which recruits the PH domain-containing kinases PDK1 and Akt to the membrane where PDK1 phosphorylates Akt on Thr308 in the T-loop. Akt is subsequently phosphorylated by mTORC2 on Ser473, resulting in maximal Akt activity (11Moore S.J. Hunter R.W. Hers I. mTORC2-mediated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation is not required for Akt1 activity in human platelets.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24533-24560Google Scholar). Studies on various Akt transgenic mice suggest that Akt activation contributes to integrin activation, granule secretion, and thrombosis (12Woulfe D. Jiang H. Morgans A. Monks R. Birnbaum M.

How Akt regulates platelet function is still an active area of research. Although numerous substrates for Akt have been described, only a few have definitively been identified in human platelets so far; the proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) (11Moore S.J.

Although PDE3A was initially reported to be an Akt substrate (16Zhang W. Colman R.W. Thrombin regulates intracellular cyclic AMP concentration in human platelets through phosphorylation/activation of phosphodiesterase 3A.Blood. 2007; 110: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the availability of improved reagents allowed us to demonstrate that PDE3A activity is regulated mainly by PKC in human platelets (17Hunter R.W.

GSK3 was the first Akt substrate to be identified by its ability to phosphorylate and inhibit the activity of glycogen synthase (21Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

It has been challenging, however, to demonstrate a direct link among Akt, GSK3α/β phosphorylation, and changes in platelet function. Indeed, GSK3 is a promiscuous substrate, which can be phosphorylated by several kinases including PKC (23Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J.

The aim of the present study was therefore to elucidate the role of GSK3α and GSKβ phosphorylation in platelet function and identify the signaling pathways involved.

Alternatively, platelets were extracted with an equal volume of ice-cold (i) radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) IGEPAL CA-630, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 40 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μm microcystin-LR, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μg/ml each pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin) for immunoprecipitation of Akt or (ii) Triton X-100 extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 40 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm benzamidine, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm microcystin-LR, and 2 μg/ml each pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin) for activity assays. Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 was immunoprecipitated from radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysates by incubation with anti-Akt1 (B1), anti-Akt2 (antiserum 1.1), or anti-Akt3 (L47B1) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed with extraction buffer prior to elution with 2× NuPAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% bis-tris gels as described previously (17Hunter R.W. Mackintosh C. Hers I. Protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PDE3A regulate cAMP levels in human platelets.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12339-12348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Samples were transferred to PVDF membrane, blocked with blocking buffer (Sigma), and subjected to immunoblotting. Akt and GSK3 activity were measured as described previously (33Hers I. Tavaré J.M. Denton R.M. The protein kinase C inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (GF 109203x) and IX (Ro 31-8220) are potent inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity.FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 was immunoprecipitated from platelet lysates by incubation with anti-Akt1 (B1), anti-Akt2 (antiserum 1.1), or anti-Akt3 (L47B1). Immune complexes were washed and resuspended in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm DTT) in the presence of 50 μm ATP (2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 0.5 mg/ml RPRAATF peptide, and 2.5 μm PKA inhibitor (IP-20). GSK3 activity in cell lysates was measured in assay buffer in the presence of 50 μm ATP (2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 0.71 mg/ml RRAAEELDSRAGS(P)PQL, and 2.5 μm PKA inhibitor (IP-20). Assays were terminated after a 30-min incubation at 30 °C by spotting onto P81 phosphocellulose filter paper. Filters were washed with 0.75% orthophosphoric acid before measuring the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP by Cherenkov counting. Akt activity results are expressed as pmol of phosphate incorporated per 108 platelets. For GSK3 activity LiCl (50 mm) was used to distinguish and correct for nonspecific activity; therefore, activity is expressed as a percentage of basal LiCl inhibitable activity. Washed platelets (2 × 108/ml) were incubated with vehicle (0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide) or the indicated compounds for 15 min. Agonist-stimulated aggregation and dense granule secretion were simultaneously monitored using a luciferin/luciferase reagent (Chronolume) in a Chronolog 590–2A aggregometer 37 °C under stirring conditions. Integrin αIIbβ3 activation was assessed using fibrinogen labeled with fluorescein as described previously (34Xia Z. Wong T. Liu Q. Kasirer-Friede A. Brown E. Frojmovic M.M. Optimally functional fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled fibrinogen for quantitative studies of binding to activated platelets and platelet aggregation.Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). α-Granule secretion was assessed as P-selectin exposure with PE-labeled anti-P-selectin. Platelets (2 × 107/ml) were incubated with vehicle (0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide) or the indicated compounds for 15 min before stimulation in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml FITC-fibrinogen and PE-labeled anti-P-selectin for 10 min. Nonspecific binding of FITC-fibrinogen was determined in the presence of 1 mm EDTA. Samples were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD LSR II (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed and fitted using GraphPad Prism 4.02 software. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent observations. Concentration-response curves were fitted with a four-parameter logistic equation. Differences in best-fit parameters between data sets were determined by F test where the null hypothesis states that both data sets can be fitted using the same parameters. Data presented with statistical analysis were tested using either a paired Student's t test (aggregation/ATP secretion data) or two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni multiple comparison post hoc test (quantification blots/GSK3 activity data). To obtain insight into the phosphorylation and regulation of GSK3 downstream of PAR receptors, we initially performed time course studies with thrombin, the PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN, and the PAR4 agonist peptide AYPGKF. Fig. 1, A and B, demonstrates that GSK3β becomes rapidly phosphorylated upon stimulation with thrombin and SFLLRN, respectively, whereas it is more delayed in response to AYPGKF (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, thrombin/PAR1-mediated GSK3β phosphorylation correlated with the onset of phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 and the PKC substrate pleckstrin. In contrast, Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was more delayed (Fig. 1, A and B) and correlated closely with phosphorylation of the Akt substrate PRAS40. These data are in agreement with our previous findings that Akt Ser473 phosphorylation is essential for Akt2 activity and phosphorylation of PRAS40 but dispensable for Akt1 activity and phosphorylation of GSK3β (11Moore S.J. Hunter R.W. Hers I. mTORC2-mediated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation is not required for Akt1 activity in human platelets.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24533-24560Google Scholar). Interestingly, the kinetic differences in Akt, GSK3, and pleckstrin phosphorylation between PAR1/thrombin and PAR4 suggests that PAR1 is responsible for the rapid Akt Thr308, GSK3, and pleckstrin phosphorylation by thrombin in human platelets. This is supported by the finding that the PAR1 antagonist SCH79797, prevented early thrombin-mediated Akt Thr308, GSK3, and pleckstrin phosphorylation (data not shown). In addition to expressing Akt1 and Akt2, a recent study suggested that human and mouse platelets also express Akt3 (14O'Brien K.A. Stojanovic-Terpo A. Hay N. Du X. An important role for Akt3 in platelet activation and thrombosis.Blood. 2011; 118: 4215-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we confirm these findings and show expression of Akt3 in both human and mouse platelets using two different anti-Akt3 antibodies (Fig. 1D). Note that Akt3 is picked up in double washed, but not single washed, human platelets, suggesting that residual albumin may interfere with antibody recognition. Mouse brain extract has been used as a positive control (Fig. 1D). To directly correlate Akt isoform phosphorylation status with kinase activity, we subsequently immunoprecipitated Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 isoforms followed by immunoblotting and in vitro kinase activity assays. Fig. 1E shows that Akt1 is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on Thr308 in response to SFLLRN, whereas Ser473 phosphorylation is more delayed. In vitro kinase studies demonstrated that Akt1 activity correlated with the rapid phosphorylation of Thr308. In contrast, Akt2 activation was slower, correlating with concomitant phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 (Fig. 1F, numbering of Akt1 phosphorylation sites is used for simplicity; these correspond to Thr309 and Ser474 in Akt2). Note that Akt2 Ser473 phosphorylation results in a band shift, demonstrating that maximal phosphorylation of Akt2 occurs at the later time point (5 min), where a single band was detected in the pThr308 blot. In contrast to Akt1 and Akt2, we were unable to detect Akt3 Thr308 phosphorylation and only weak Akt3 Ser473 phosphorylation in response to the PAR1 peptide, with no concurrent increase in Akt3 activity (Fig. 1G). Similar results were found using an alternative Akt3 antibody (62A8) for immunoprecipitation (data not shown), demonstrating that Akt3 is not activated under these conditions. As Akt3 has previously been implicated in thrombin-stimulated GSK3β phosphorylation in mouse platelets (14O'Brien K.A. Stojanovic-Terpo A. Hay N. Du X. An important role for Akt3 in platelet activation and thrombosis.Blood. 2011; 118: 4215-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we performed similar experiments using thrombin and the PAR4 peptide AYPGKF on human and mouse platelets. Although thrombin and AYPGKF induced Ser473 phosphorylation in both human and mouse platelets, we were unable to detect any Akt3 Thr308 phosphorylation, suggesting that Akt3 is unlikely to be involved in thrombin-mediated GSK3α/β phosphorylation. The SFLLRN time course studies suggested that Akt1 might be involved in GSK3 phosphorylation at early time points, whereas both Akt1 and Akt2 may be involved at later time points. Because Akt isoform-specific inhibitors are not available, we investigated the role of Akt in GSK3 phosphorylation by incubating platelets with the allosteric Akt inhibitor MK2206. This compound dose-dependently inhibited thrombin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and activity with maximal inhibition at 500 nm (Fig. 2, A and B). MK2206 completely blocked GSK3α/β phosphorylation after a 5-min stimulation with SFLLRN (Fig. 2, C and D), which is in agreement with our previous studies using the related compound Akti-1/2 (35Hunter R.W. Harper M.T. Hers I. The PKB inhibitor Akti-1/2 potentiates PAR1-mediated platelet function independently of its ability to block PKB.J. Thromb.

https://openalex.org/W2079863341,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physiological process that plays important roles in tumor metastasis, ""stemness,"" and drug resistance. EMT is typically characterized by the loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased expression of EMT-associated transcriptional repressors, including ZEB1 and ZEB2. The miR-200 family and miR-205 prevent EMT through suppression of ZEB1/2. p53 has been implicated in the regulation of miR-200c, but the mechanisms controlling miR-205 expression remain elusive. Here we report that the p53 family member and p63 isoform, ΔNp63α, promotes miR-205 transcription and controls EMT in human bladder cancer cells. ΔNp63α, E-cadherin and miR-205 were coexpressed in a panel of bladder cancer cell lines (n = 28) and a cohort of primary bladder tumors (n = 98). Stable knockdown of ΔNp63α in the ""epithelial"" bladder cancer cell line UM-UC6 decreased the expression of miR-205 and induced the expression of ZEB1/2, effects that were reversed by expression of exogenous miR-205. Conversely, overexpression of ΔNp63α in the ""mesenchymal"" bladder cancer cell line UM-UC3 induced miR-205 and suppressed ZEB1/2. ΔNp63α knockdown reduced the expression of the primary and mature forms of miR-205 and the miR-205 ""host"" gene (miR-205HG) and decreased binding of RNA Pol II to the miR-205HG promoter, inhibiting miR-205HG transcription. Finally, high miR-205 expression was associated with adverse clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients. Together, our data demonstrate that ΔNp63α-mediated expression of miR-205 contributes to the regulation of EMT in bladder cancer cells and identify miR-205 as a molecular marker of the lethal subset of human bladder cancers."

Most trials have involved vaccines for influenza A (H5N1), A (H7N7) or A (H9N2). Objective To evaluate dosage-related safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated influenza A (H7N7) vaccine in humans. Design One hundred twenty-five healthy young adults were randomized to receive two doses intramuscularly of placebo or 7.5, 15, 45 or 90 µg of HA of an inactivated subunit influenza A (H7N7) vaccine (25 per group), four weeks apart. Reactogenicity was evaluated closely for one week and for any adverse effect for six months after each dose. Serum hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibody responses were determined four weeks after each dose and at six months. Results Reactogenicity evaluations indicated the vaccinations were well tolerated. Only one subject developed a ≥4-fold serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody response and a final titer of ≥1∶40 four weeks after dose two and only five subjects developed a neutralizing antibody rise and a final titer of ≥1∶40 in tests performed at a central laboratory. Four of the five were given the 45 or 90 µg HA dosage. A more sensitive HAI assay at the study site revealed a dose-response with increasing HA dosage but only 36% in the 90 µg HA group developed a ≥4-fold rise in antibody in this test and only one of these achieved a titer of ≥1∶32. Conclusion This inactivated subunit influenza A (H7N7) vaccine was safe but poorly immunogenic in humans. Trials Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00546585"

Many pathogens use multiple strategies to target a single event in the disease process, confounding the identification of the important determinants of virulence. We developed a genetic screening strategy called insertional mutagenesis and depletion (iMAD) that combines bacterial mutagenesis and RNA interference, to systematically dissect the interplay between a pathogen and its host. We used this technique to resolve the network of proteins secreted by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila to promote intracellular growth, a critical determinant of pathogenicity of this organism. This strategy is broadly applicable, allowing the dissection of any interface between two organisms involving numerous interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2047543869,"Colon cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths in Western countries and is associated with diets high in red meat. Heme, the iron-porphyrin pigment of red meat, induces cytotoxicity of gut contents which injures surface cells leading to compensatory hyperproliferation of crypt cells. This hyperproliferation results in epithelial hyperplasia which increases the risk of colon cancer. In humans, a high red-meat diet increases Bacteroides spp in feces. Therefore, we simultaneously investigated the effects of dietary heme on colonic microbiota and on the host mucosa of mice. Whole genome microarrays showed that heme injured the colonic surface epithelium and induced hyperproliferation by changing the surface to crypt signaling. Using 16S rRNA phylogenetic microarrays, we investigated whether bacteria play a role in this changed signaling. Heme increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes in colonic contents. This shift was most likely caused by a selective susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria to heme cytotoxic fecal water, which is not observed for Gram-negative bacteria, allowing expansion of the Gram-negative community. The increased amount of Gram-negative bacteria most probably increased LPS exposure to colonocytes, however, there is no appreciable immune response detected in the heme-fed mice. There was no functional change in the sensing of the bacteria by the mucosa, as changes in inflammation pathways and Toll- like receptor signaling were not detected. This unaltered host-microbe cross-talk indicates that the changes in microbiota did not play a causal role in the observed hyperproliferation and hyperplasia."

https://openalex.org/W2043254412,"The size of nanocrystals provides a limitation on dislocation activity and associated stress-induced deformation. Dislocation-mediated plastic deformation is expected to become inactive below a critical particle size, which has been proposed to be between 10 and 30 nanometers according to computer simulations and transmission electron microscopy analysis. However, deformation experiments at high pressure on polycrystalline nickel suggest that dislocation activity is still operative in 3-nanometer crystals. Substantial texturing is observed at pressures above 3.0 gigapascals for 500-nanometer nickel and at greater than 11.0 gigapascals for 20-nanometer nickel. Surprisingly, texturing is also seen in 3-nanometer nickel when compressed above 18.5 gigapascals. The observations of pressure-promoted texturing indicate that under high external pressures, dislocation activity can be extended down to a few-nanometers-length scale."
https://openalex.org/W2092545763,"NetB is a pore-forming toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens and has been reported to play a major role in the pathogenesis of avian necrotic enteritis, a disease that has emerged due to the removal of antibiotics in animal feedstuffs. Here we present the crystal structure of the pore form of NetB solved to 3.9 Å. The heptameric assembly shares structural homology to the staphylococcal α-hemolysin. However, the rim domain, a region that is thought to interact with the target cell membrane, shows sequence and structural divergence leading to the alteration of a phosphocholine binding pocket found in the staphylococcal toxins. Consistent with the structure we show that NetB does not bind phosphocholine efficiently but instead interacts directly with cholesterol leading to enhanced oligomerization and pore formation. Finally we have identified conserved and non-conserved amino acid positions within the rim loops that significantly affect binding and toxicity of NetB. These findings present new insights into the mode of action of these pore-forming toxins, enabling the design of more effective control measures against necrotic enteritis and providing potential new tools to the field of bionanotechnology."

In this study, we describe the combined use of GPS data logger information obtained from free-ranging birds, and environmental information recorded by unmanned aerial systems (UASs). As a case study, we studied habitat selection of a small raptorial bird, the lesser kestrel Falco naumanni, foraging in a highly dynamic landscape. After downloading spatio-temporal information from data loggers attached to the birds, we programmed the UASs to fly and take imagery by means of an onboard digital camera documenting the flight paths of those same birds shortly after their recorded flights. This methodology permitted us to extract environmental information at quasi-real time. We demonstrate that UASs are a useful tool for a wide variety of wildlife studies."
https://openalex.org/W2142798802,"Polycomb group protein BMI1 plays an important role in cellular homeostasis by maintaining a balance between proliferation and senescence. It is often overexpressed in cancer cells and is required for self-renewal of stem cells. At present, very little is known about the signaling pathways that regulate the expression of BMI1. Here, we report that BMI1 autoactivates its own promoter via an E-box present in its promoter. We show that BMI1 acts as an activator of the WNT pathway by repressing Dickkopf (DKK) family of WNT inhibitors. BMI1 mediated repression of DKK proteins; in particular, DKK1 led to up-regulation of WNT target c-Myc, which in turn further led to transcriptional autoactivation of BMI1. Thus, a positive feedback loop connected by the WNT signaling pathway regulates BMI1 expression. This positive feedback loop regulating BMI1 expression may be relevant to the role of BMI1 in promoting cancer and maintaining stem cell phenotype."

Significance: Mechanistic link between tethering complex and coiled tether established. Vesicular transport sorts proteins between organelles, thereby ensuring their distinct biochemical compositions. This requires that vesicles carrying different cargoes are delivered to the appropriate target compartment. Vesicle tethering is believed to play a critical role in determining targeting specificity (1Ungar D. Oka T. Krieger M. Hughson F.M.

Vesicle transport within the Golgi is a particularly useful system for studying the targeting specificity and tethering of vesicles. The mammalian Golgi typically consists of four to eight cisternae, each of these containing a unique set of modifying enzymes. Most of the transport through the Golgi is believed to occur by cisternal maturation (9Emr S. Glick B.S. Linstedt A.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Luini A. Malhotra V. Marsh B.J. Nakano A. Pfeffer S.R.

The golgin coiled-coil proteins of the Golgi apparatus.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: a005256Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The questions remain: what are the molecular details of these golgin-Rab interactions during tethering, and how do interactions between Rabs and golgins lead to a specific vesicle targeting reaction? The central coordinator for retrograde vesicle tethering at the Golgi is the multisubunit conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex (8Miller V.J. Ungar D.

Yet, lobe A (subunits 1–4) is necessary for maintaining proteins in the early/medial Golgi, and lobe B (subunits 5–8) is needed primarily for the targeting of late-Golgi processing enzymes (27Oka T.

Given that the only protein motifs in COG are predicted coiled coils (32Whyte J.R. Munro S. Vesicle tethering complexes in membrane traffic.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a plausible molecular function for COG is to act as a protein interaction hub. Indeed, the yeast ortholog was found in a direct physical interaction with the Rab Ypt1p and the vesicle coat COPI (33Suvorova E.S. Duden R. Lupashin V.V. The Sec34/Sec35p complex, a Ypt1p effector required for retrograde intra-Golgi trafficking, interacts with Golgi SNAREs and COPI vesicle coat proteins.J.

Interaction of Golgin-84 with the COG complex mediates the intra-Golgi retrograde transport.Traffic. 2010; 11: 1552-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Development of a general model for COG mediated tethering is hampered by the lack of knowledge about the full set of protein interactions that the complex is involved in. We therefore determined the map of interactions between the complex and other proteins implicated in vesicle tethering. A number of Rabs, golgins, and subunits of the COPI coat combinatorially interact with different COG subunits. Upon further functional dissection of a subset of these interactions we discovered a network between COG, the Rabs1 and 6, and different regions of the golgin TMF. Since we also find that TMF binds to Golgi membranes cleared of COPI, and its COG interacting regions dominantly inhibit protein glycosylation, we propose a model in which interactions between a tethering complex and a coiled coil tether could jointly reel in the vesicle in preparation for fusion. By using a subset of the available combinatorial interactions this proposed mechanism suggests how vesicle targeting specificity could guide protein sorting within the cell. For immunoblotting affinity-purified anti-Cog4 (1:300), anti-His-HRP (1:10000, Sigma), anti-GST (1:1000, Invitrogen monoclonal), anti-Cog3 (1:2000, 40, monoclonal), affinity-purified anti-TMF (1:500, Lowe laboratory), anti-HA.11 (1:500, Covance monoclonal), anti-GFP (1:2000, Invitrogen monoclonal), and anti-myc (1:1000, Cell Signaling monoclonal) were used. The anti-Cog4 antibodies (Oka et al., 27Oka T. Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Krieger M.

The anti TMF antibodies were raised against GST-tagged head and tail regions in sheep, and affinity purified against these same proteins. Serum was pre-cleared against GST before affinity purification against immunogen. Anti-HA 3F10 (Roche) or anti-GFP (Invitrogen) was used for immunoprecipitation. For immunofluorescence mouse monoclonal anti-GalNAcT2 (1:5, tissue culture supernatant, kind gift from H. Clausen), anti-GFP (1:500, Invitrogen polyclonal), anti-Rab6 (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C19), anti-βCOP (1:3000, MAD, T.E. Kreis laboratory) were used. COG subunits, golgins, and Rabs were expressed as Gal4 binding or activation domain fusion proteins from pGAD/pGBD/pGBDU plamids (66James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for highly efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rab binding domain fusion proteins contained mutations to lock the protein in the active (T) or inactive (D) conformation (67Li G. Stahl P.D.

Pairs of fusion constructs were introduced into yeast (genotype: trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ) by mating of haploid single transformants (Fig. 1A) or pairwise co-transformation (Figs. 1B and 2 A and C). Cells were subsequently scored for growth on selective media, typically following 1 week of incubation at 30 °C or 2 weeks at 14 °C. For COPI subunits the pACT2 vector was used.FIGURE 2COG-golgin and COG-COPI interactions.

Rab30 lacked the C-terminal 19 amino acids to aid solubility (PDB structure 2EW1). After harvesting, cells were lysed in GST-lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4 with additional protease inhibitors) and the lysate cleared by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 15 min). Glutathione-agarose (Clontech) equilibrated with GST-lysis buffer was added and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pre-blocked with 0.1% BSA for COG binding experiments. The beads were washed with GST-lysis buffer before pull-down experiments. For GST-Rabs, beads were washed with nucleotide buffer (20 mm Hepes, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) with 1 mm nucleotide and 10 mm EDTA, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then incubated for 30 min in the same buffer lacking EDTA. Nucleotide loading was confirmed by reverse phase HPLC analysis. 60 μg of recombinant His6-Cog4 purified from insect cells (Richardson et al., 43Richardson B.C. Smith R.D. Ungar D. Nakamura A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were added. For GST-TMF fragments, the beads were incubated with either His6-Rab1(T), His6-Rab1(D), or partially purified COG. His6-Rab1a was purified in GTP or GDP locked mutant forms from E. coli using Ni2+-chelate chromatography, dialyzed into GST-lysis buffer, then incubated with 1 mm of the appropriate nucleotide and 5 mm EDTA for 1.5 h. Subsequently 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm of nucleotide were added, and following 30 min of incubation the Rab sample mixed with TMF-fragment containing beads. For all GST pull-downs, after 1 h of incubation at 4 °C with rotation and washing with nucleotide buffer, bound proteins were eluted into SDS-PAGE buffer. All samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using the Immobilon HRP substrate (Millipore) and the Syngene GeneGenius ECL imaging system. GFP-TMF expression plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged Cog1 using the GeneCellin transfection reagent (BioCellChallenge). For COG-COPI co-immunoprecipitations YFP-βCOP and HA-Cog2 (Sohda et al., 2007) were co-transfected into HeLa cells. After 36–48 h, cells were washed with IP buffer (20 mm Hepes, 110 mm KOAc, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) then scraped into 1 ml of IP lysis buffer (IP buffer with 1% Triton X-100). All steps were performed at room temperature. The cell slurry was rotated for 30 min prior to 30 min of centrifugation. The lysate obtained was incubated with 1.5 μl anti-HA 3F10 (0.1 μg/μl) or the equivalent amount of IgG for 1 h, then 10 μl of pre-equilibrated HiTrap Protein G beads (GE Healthcare) were added for a further 25 min. Beads were washed four times with buffer (IP buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100) and the bound proteins eluted with SDS-PAGE buffer, followed by immunoblot analysis. Hela cells grown on coverslips were fixed 72 h after transfection for lectin or 16–30 h after transfection for immunofluorescence staining. BFA treatment was performed for 5 min using 5 μg/ml BFA immediately prior to fixation. Cells washed with PBS were fixed using MES-buffered ice cold methanol (90% methanol, 10 mm MES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) for 5 min at −20 °C before washing with PBS. For lectin-staining cells were blocked for 1 h in P-L (PBS with 0.1% BSA) and incubated with 10 μg/ml GNL-FITC (Vector labs) in P-L for 1 h. For immunofluorescence cells were blocked in P-B buffer (PBS with 0.5% (w/v) saponin, 2% (w/v) BSA, 2% (v/v) goat serum) for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody in P-B for 1 h, washed in PBS and then incubated with Alexa-488 and/or 568 labeled secondary antibodies (1:400, Invitrogen) in P-B for 1 h. All coverslips were washed with PBS, and water before mounting for microscopy. Lectin-stained cells were imaged with a Leica IRB epifluorescence microscope, other imaging was done using confocal microscopy on an Olympus BX60 upright microscope. For Rab6 RNAi a SMARTpool oligo mix (Dharmacon) was transfected using oligofectamine. For mitochondrial localization experiments fluorescently tagged chimeras of full-length COG proteins were generated using pmCherry-C1-ActA. HeLa cells were co-transfected with COG and Rab constructs, fixed 20 h after transfection and imaged with the 63× oil 1.4 NA objective of a LSM510 Zeiss Laser inverted microscope outfitted with confocal optics. COG is a large hetero-oligomeric complex whose tethering function in the cell likely involves a series of protein interactions. The main aim of our study was to generate a full interaction map of COG that can later form the basis for functional dissection of retrograde vesicle tethering at the Golgi. Rab GTPases are involved in all steps of vesicle transport, and several tethering complexes (including COG) have been shown to interact with Rabs (33Suvorova E.S. Duden R. Lupashin V.V.

Using a directed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach we tested the interactions between COG subunits and 14 Rab-GTPases. 10 interactions involving three COG subunits (4, 5, and 6) and seven Rabs (1a, 2a, 4a, 6a, 14, 30, 36) were found of the 184 possible combinations (Fig. 1A). All observed interactions were with Rabs locked in the active conformation (T) as opposed to the inactive (D) conformation. Encouraged by these initial results, we extended our survey to test a more complete set of 57 constitutively active mammalian Rabs (42Haas A.K. Yoshimura S. Stephens D.J. Preisinger C. Fuchs E.

This experiment used increased stringency of detection, and revealed additional interactions with Rab1b, 6b, 10, 39, and 41. Combining the results, and rejecting interactions that were positive in one but negative in the other experiment, we identify 8 interactions: Cog4 with Rab30; Cog5 with Rab2a and 39; and Cog6 with Rab1a, 1b, 6a, 6b, and 41. Except for the previously reported Rab1a, 6a and 30 interactions (37Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ishibashi K. Itoh T.

In all cell types, both histones and DNA can undergo enzymatic modifications, including histone methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and DNA methylation, all of which are intimately linked to transcription and other biological processes (14Wu H.

In ES cells, genome-wide surveys of histone marks indicate that ES cell chromatin features higher levels of histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3/H4 acetylation, accompanied by lower levels of H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), compared with the chromatin status of differentiated cells (11Meshorer E.

Moreover, facultative heterochromatin (marked by H3K27me3) is preferred over constitutive heterochromatin (marked by H3K9me3) to allow more permissive transcription (22Ram E.V. Meshorer E. Transcriptional competence in pluripotency.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 2793-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Indeed, bivalent domains, marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in ES cells, have been proposed as a poised state for developmentally important genes (23Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M.

Multiple chromatin modifying enzymes, epigenetic regulators, and transcription factors interact to establish an open chromatin state. Notably, in ES cells, examples include histone methyltransferases, histone demethylases, and histone acetyltransferases, recruited by transcription factors such as canonical stem cell factors (e.g. Oct4 and Nanog) and c-Myc (7Gaspar-Maia A.

For example, Kdm4c, a histone demethylase that catalyzes the removal of the H3K9me3 mark, regulates global H3K9me3 levels and is required for maintained pluripotency in mouse ES cells (27Loh Y.H.

In addition, chromatin-remodeling proteins such as Chd1 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1) play an essential role in maintaining open chromatin and pluripotency in ES cells (7Gaspar-Maia A. Alajem A. Meshorer E. Ramalho-Santos M. Open chromatin in pluripotency and reprogramming.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Genome-wide localization analysis of Chd1 shows its strong correlation with enrichment of Pol II and H3K4me3 but not bivalent domains in ES cells (26Gaspar-Maia A. Alajem A. Polesso F. Sridharan R.

Chd7, another Chd family member, co-localizes with Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and p300 at enhancers of actively transcribed genes, indicating a likely role for Chd7 in promoting open chromatin in ES cells (29Schnetz M.P.

Although it is clear that a multitude of chromatin remodeling proteins participate in the dynamic process of histone mark establishment and regulation, the mechanisms that maintain high H3K4me3 and low H3K9me3 in ES cells remain unclear.

The in vivo relevance of these findings has yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis of affinity-purified H3K4me3 complexes in HeLa cells reveals that the chromodomain of CHD1 can directly bind the H3K4me3 mark and forms a complex with Ash2L, suggesting that CHD1 function may depend on the H3K4me3 mark generated by the Ash2L-containing MLL complex (41Sims 3rd, R.J.

However, a direct role of Ash2l in regulating an open chromatin and ES cell self-renewal remains to be determined. mixed lineage leukemia quantitative PCR knockdown. In this study, we investigated the function of Ash2l in ES cell maintenance. We found that depletion of Ash2l by siRNAs resulted in a loss of pluripotency manifested by changes in morphology and gene expression profiles. In addition, Ash2l RNAi-treated cells displayed reduced global H3K4me3 and increased H3K9me3, suggesting possible coordination between these two histone marks for maintaining open chromatin. Whole-genome ChIP-seq analysis revealed multiple potential targets of Ash2l that may participate in open chromatin regulation. These findings indicate that Ash2l is required for ES cell pluripotency and the global, active chromatin modifications associated with ES cells. Furthermore, our work suggests that a regulatory network of specific epigenetic factors interact and sustain the open chromatin state of ES cells. AB2.2 mouse embryonic stem cells (passage 18, kindly provided by Darwin Core Facility, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) were grown in ES cell medium with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) either on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts as feeder cells or with LIF in the absence of feeder cells. The following antibodies were used: anti-Ash2l (A300–112A and A300–489A, Bethyl Laboratories; sc-81184, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-Oct4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-HP1α (2616, Cell Signaling Technology); anti-histone H3 (ab1791, Abcam), anti-H3K4me2 (07-030, Upstate); anti-H3K4me3 (ab8580, Abcam); and anti-H3K9me3 (ab8898, Abcam). ChIP experiments were performed as described previously (42Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y. Gu P. Xin H. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Wong J. Cooney A.J. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nanog and Oct4 associate with unique transcriptional repression complexes in embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Mouse ES cells (80–90% confluence) were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde before lysis and sonication. The resulting extract was precleared (50 μl of protein A beads, 10 μl of IgG, 10 μl of 5% BSA, and 5 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of the appropriate antibodies plus 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads, 1 μl of BSA (5%), and 25 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA. Beads were then washed to elute the bound complexes for reverse cross-linking and DNA purification. ES cells were plated in gelatin-coated 24-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) in 500 μl of ES cell medium. Approximately 40 pmol of Stealth RNAiTM siRNAs (Invitrogen) were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Total RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was performed using iScript Select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI StepOnePlus real-time PCR system and SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen). The siRNA sequences used were as follows: Ash2l KD1, 5′-CAAGAAGGCCAGAAGUGAUCCUUUA; Ash2l KD2, 5′-UGGAGACCUUUACAGAGCCUGCUUA; and control KD, 5′-UUCCUCUCCACGCGCAGUACAUUUA. Cells plated on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 min) and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 (10 min) at room temperature, followed by blocking with 3% normal goat serum, before primary and secondary antibody incubation. Primary antibodies used are: anti-Ash2l (sc-81184, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Oct4 (sc-5279, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-H3K9me3 (ab8898, Abcam), and anti-HP1α (2616, Cell Signaling Technology). FITC and Texas Red conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used to stain DNA. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a TE200 microscope (Nikon, New York, NY) equipped with a CoolSNAP-fx CCD camera. Two independent genome-wide Ash2l ChIP-seq experiments were performed essentially as described previously (43Yang D. Xiong Y. Kim H. He Q. Li Y. Chen R. Songyang Z. Human telomeric proteins occupy selective interstitial sites.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). IgG ChIP-seq served as negative control. Alignment of short reads to the mouse genome (mm9) was carried out using SOAP (44Li R. Yu C. Li Y. Lam T.W. Yiu S.M. Kristiansen K. Wang J. SOAP2: an improved ultrafast tool for short read alignment.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1966-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (2865) Google Scholar), allowing for a maximum of two mismatches. Reads that produced no initial hits were repeatedly remapped with successive removal of the last 10 bp (whenever necessary) until the reads reached <25 bp. All reads that were uniquely aligned were further analyzed (supplemental Table S1). Peak detection was performed with model-based analysis of ChIP-seq (version 1.40) (45Zhang Y. Liu T. Meyer C.A. Eeckhoute J. Johnson D.S. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C. Myers R.M. Brown M. Li W. Liu X.S. Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS).Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (8539) Google Scholar) using default parameters (p = 1 × 10−5). For two-sample ChIP-seq analysis, model-based analysis of ChIP-seq linearly scales the control sample for comparison with Ash2l ChIP-seq samples. Model-based analysis of ChIP-seq first uses high-confidence fold enrichment (default 32) peaks to model shift size and then detects peaks with a significant tag enrichment compared with background (Poisson distribution, p = 1 × 10−5). About 45% binding regions and >68% binding genes were found to overlap in the two independent Ash2l ChIP-Seq experiments. To ensure the quality of binding sites, only peaks detected in both ChIP-Seq experiments were further annotated. Peak annotation was carried out with mouse genomic sequences (mm9). Gene locus information was extracted based on UCSC exon locus annotation and BioMart (version 61). For exon annotation, the longest transcript was taken as the representative for each gene. Sites of peaks were assigned based on their relative location to gene loci. For example, peaks within −2 kb to +1 kb from transcriptional start sites were defined as promoters. Peaks outside of promoters but within ±10 kb of transcriptional start sites or termination sequences were designated as 5′-UTR or 3′-UTR. Distal regions were peaks >10 kb upstream or downstream of 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR, respectively. All remaining peaks were classified as unknown or not defined. Annotation follows the order of promoters, exons, introns, 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR, and distal regions. Gene Ontology (biological processes) and KEGG pathway analysis were performed using DAVID bioinformatics resources (46Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. DAVID: Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probabilities were evaluated by Bonferroni correction, and values of ≤0.001 were considered significant. Genomic sequences that were up to 200 nt up- or downstream from the top 200 predicted binding sites (ranked by enrichment) were used for motif search with the multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation (MEME) and motif alignment and search tool (MAST) software (47Bailey T.L.

https://openalex.org/W2033637248,"Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathological processes of ischemic brain damage. Many antioxidants have been shown to protect against cerebral ischemia injury by inhibiting oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E), an ecdysteroid hormone, exhibits antioxidative effects. For the work described in this paper, we used an in vitro oxidative damage model and an in vivo ischemic model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to investigate the neuroprotective effects of 20E and the mechanisms related to these effects. Treatment of cells with H2O2 led to neuronal injury, intracellular ROS/RNS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, cellular antioxidant potential descent, an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and an elevation of intracellular [Ca2+], all of which were markedly attenuated by 20E. Inhibition of the activation of the ASK1-MKK4/7-JNK stress signaling pathway and cleaved caspase-3 induced by oxidative stress were involved in the neuroprotection afforded by 20E. In addition, 20E reduced the expression of iNOS protein by inhibition of NF-κB activation. The neuroprotective effect of 20E was also confirmed in vivo. 20E significantly decreased infarct volume and the neurological deficit score, restored antioxidant potential and inhibited the increase in MDA and TUNEL-positive and cleaved caspase-3-positive cells in the cerebral cortex in MCAO rats. Together, these results support that 20E protects against cerebral ischemia injury by inhibiting ROS/RNS production and modulating oxidative stress-induced signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2070585499,"Background Research into the etiology of breast cancer has recently focused on the role of the immunity and inflammation. Interleukin-23 and its receptor (IL23R) guide T cells towards the Th17 phenotype. IL23R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with digestive system cancers. To evaluate the influences of IL23R gene polymorphisms on the risk of sporadic breast cancer, a case-control study was conducted in Chinese Han women. Methodology and Principal Findings We genotyped two tag SNPs (rs10889677 in the 3′-UTR region and nonsynonymous variants rs1884444 in exon 2) in IL23R gene of 491 breast cancer patients and 502 matched healthy controls. The genotypes were determined using the SNaPshot technique. The differences in the genotypic distribution between breast cancer patients and healthy controls were analyzed with the Chi-square test for trends. For rs10889677 in IL23R, the frequencies of the AA genotype and the A allele were statistical significant higher in breast cancer patients than in controls (P = 0.0084 and P = 0.0171, respectively), whereas the C allele was associated with an earlier age of breast cancer onset (50.6 years for AA, 48.7 years for AC and 46.0 years for CC (P = 0.0114)) in case-only study. The clinical features analysis demonstrated significant associations between rs1884444 in IL23R and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2) and tumor size status. Conclusions and Significance Our results suggest that a miRNA binding site SNP in the 3′-UTR region of the IL23R gene may be associated with the risk of breast cancer and contribute to the early development of breast cancer in Chinese women."
https://openalex.org/W2116834967,"Knowledge of the scale of dispersal and the mechanisms governing gene flow in marine environments remains fragmentary despite being essential for understanding evolution of marine biota and to design management plans. We use the limpets Patella ulyssiponensis and Patella rustica as models for identifying factors affecting gene flow in marine organisms across the North-East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. A set of allozyme loci and a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I were screened for genetic variation through starch gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing, respectively. An approach combining clustering algorithms with clinal analyses was used to test for the existence of barriers to gene flow and estimate their geographic location and abruptness. Sharp breaks in the genetic composition of individuals were observed in the transitions between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and across southern Italian shores. An additional break within the Atlantic cluster separates samples from the Alboran Sea and Atlantic African shores from those of the Iberian Atlantic shores. The geographic congruence of the genetic breaks detected in these two limpet species strongly supports the existence of transpecific barriers to gene flow in the Mediterranean Sea and Northeastern Atlantic. This leads to testable hypotheses regarding factors restricting gene flow across the study area."
https://openalex.org/W2166679709,"Remyelination has to occur to fully regenerate injured spinal cords or brain tissues. A growing body of evidence has suggested that exogenous cell transplantation is one promising strategy to promote remyelination. However, direct injection of neural stem cells or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to the lesion site may not be an optimal therapeutic strategy due to poor viability and functionality of transplanted cells resulted from the local hostile tissue environment. The overall objective of this study was to engineer an injectable biocompatible hydrogel system as a supportive niche to provide a regeneration permissive microenvironment for transplanted OPCs to survive, functionally differentiate, and remyelinate central nervous system (CNS) lesions. A highly biocompatible hydrogel, based on thiol-functionalized hyaluronic acid and thiol-functionalized gelatin, which can be crosslinked by poly-(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), was used. These hydrogels were optimized first regarding cell adhesive properties and mechanical properties to best support the growth properties of OPCs in culture. Transplanted OPCs with the hydrogels optimized in vitro exhibited enhanced survival and oligodendrogenic differentiation and were able to remyelinate demyelinated axons inside ethidium bromide (EB) demyelination lesion in adult spinal cord. This study provides a new possible therapeutic approach to treat CNS injuries in which cell therapies may be essential."
https://openalex.org/W2013528653,"Screening for pathogenic mutations in breast and ovarian cancer genes such as BRCA1/2, CHEK2 and RAD51C is common practice for individuals from high-risk families. However, test results may be ambiguous due to the presence of unclassified variants (UCV) in the concurrent absence of clearly cancer-predisposing mutations. Especially the presence of intronic or exonic variants within these genes that possibly affect proper pre-mRNA processing poses a challenge as their functional implications are not immediately apparent. Therefore, it appears necessary to characterize potential splicing UCV and to develop appropriate classification tools. We investigated 30 distinct BRCA1 variants, both intronic and exonic, regarding their spliceogenic potential by commonly used in silico prediction algorithms (HSF, MaxEntScan) along with in vitro transcript analyses. A total of 25 variants were identified spliceogenic, either causing/enhancing exon skipping or activation of cryptic splice sites, or both. Except from a single intronic variant causing minor effects on BRCA1 pre-mRNA processing in our analyses, 23 out of 24 intronic variants were correctly predicted by MaxEntScan, while HSF was less accurate in this cohort. Among the 6 exonic variants analyzed, 4 severely impair correct pre-mRNA processing, while the remaining two have partial effects. In contrast to the intronic alterations investigated, only half of the spliceogenic exonic variants were correctly predicted by HSF and/or MaxEntScan. These data support the idea that exonic splicing mutations are commonly disease-causing and concurrently prone to escape in silico prediction, hence necessitating experimental in vitro splicing analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2023548150,"In this study, we investigated the effect of glutamine (Gln) supplementation on the signaling pathways regulating protein synthesis and protein degradation in the skeletal muscle of rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. The expression levels of key regulatory proteins in the synthetic pathways (Akt, mTOR, GSK3 and 4E-BP1) and the degradation pathways (MuRF-1 and MAFbx) were determined using real-time PCR and Western blotting in four groups of male Wistar rats; 1) control, non-supplemented with glutamine; 2) control, supplemented with glutamine; 3) diabetic, non-supplemented with glutamine; and 4) diabetic, supplemented with glutamine. Diabetes was induced by the intravenous injection of 65 mg/kg bw STZ in citrate buffer (pH 4.2); the non-diabetic controls received only citrate buffer. After 48 hours, diabetes was confirmed in the STZ-treated animals by the determination of blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dL. Starting on that day, a solution of 1 g/kg bw Gln in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was administered daily via gavage for 15 days to groups 2 and 4. Groups 1 and 3 received only PBS for the same duration. The rats were euthanized, and the soleus muscles were removed and homogenized in extraction buffer for the subsequent measurement of protein and mRNA levels. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in the muscle Gln content in the diabetic rats, and this level increased toward the control value in the diabetic rats receiving Gln. In addition, the diabetic rats exhibited a reduced mRNA expression of regulatory proteins in the protein synthesis pathway and increased expression of those associated with protein degradation. A reduction in the skeletal muscle mass in the diabetic rats was observed and was alleviated partially with Gln supplementation. The data suggest that glutamine supplementation is potentially useful for slowing the progression of muscle atrophy in patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2084146166,"Computational small molecule docking into comparative models of proteins is widely used to query protein function and in the development of small molecule therapeutics. We benchmark RosettaLigand docking into comparative models for nine proteins built during CASP8 that contain ligands. We supplement the study with 21 additional protein/ligand complexes to cover a wider space of chemotypes. During a full docking run in 21 of the 30 cases, RosettaLigand successfully found a native-like binding mode among the top ten scoring binding modes. From the benchmark cases we find that careful template selection based on ligand occupancy provides the best chance of success while overall sequence identity between template and target do not appear to improve results. We also find that binding energy normalized by atom number is often less than -0.4 in native-like binding modes."
https://openalex.org/W2080642318,"Although Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was initially regarded as a disorder exclusive to childhood, nowadays its prevalence in adulthood is well established. The development of novel techniques for quantifying the thickness of the cerebral mantle allows the further exploration of the neuroanatomical profiles underlying the child and adult form of the disorder. To examine the cortical mantle in children and adults with ADHD, we applied a vertex-wise analysis of cortical thickness to anatomical brain MRI scans acquired from children with (n = 43) and without ADHD (n = 41), as well as a group of adult neurotypical individuals (n = 31), adult patients with a history of stimulant treatment (n = 31) and medication-naïve adults with ADHD (n = 24). We observed several clusters of reduced laminar cortical thickness in ADHD patients in comparison to neurotypical individuals. These differences were primarily located in the dorsal attention network, including the bilateral inferior and superior parietal cortex and a section of the frontal cortex (centered on the superior frontal and precentral gyrus bilaterally). Further laminar thickness deficits were observed in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and medial occipital cortex. The deficits in the cortical surface were especially pronounced in the child sample, while adult patients showed a more typical laminar thickness across the cerebral mantle. These findings show that the neuroanatomical profile of ADHD, especially the childhood form of the disorder, involves robust alterations in the cortical mantle, which are most prominent in brain regions subserving attentional processing."
https://openalex.org/W1973730002,"The methyl-cytosine binding domain 2 (MBD2)-nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex recognizes methylated DNA and silences expression of associated genes through histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodeling functions. Our previous structural work demonstrated that a coiled-coil interaction between MBD2 and GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A (GATAD2A/p66α) proteins recruits the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD4/Mi2β) to the NuRD complex and is necessary for MBD2-mediated DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing in vivo (Gnanapragasam, M. N., Scarsdale, J. N., Amaya, M. L., Webb, H. D., Desai, M. A., Walavalkar, N. M., Wang, S. Z., Zu Zhu, S., Ginder, G. D., and Williams, D. C., Jr. (2011) p66α-MBD2 coiled-coil interaction and recruitment of Mi-2 are critical for globin gene silencing by the MBD2-NuRD complex. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 108, 7487-7492). The p66α-MBD2 interaction differs from most coiled-coils studied to date by forming an anti-parallel heterodimeric complex between two peptides that are largely monomeric in isolation. To further characterize unique features of this complex that drive heterodimeric specificity and high affinity binding, we carried out biophysical analyses of MBD2 and the related homologues MBD3, MBD3-like protein 1 (MBD3L1), and MBD3-like protein 2 (MBD3L2) as well as specific mutations that modify charge-charge interactions and helical propensity of the coiled-coil domains. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses show that the individual peptides remain monomeric in isolation even at 300 μM in concentration for MBD2. Circular dichroism analyses demonstrate a direct correlation between helical content of the coiled-coil domains in isolation and binding affinity for p66α. Furthermore, complementary electrostatic surface potentials and inherent helical content of each peptide are necessary to maintain high-affinity association. These factors lead to a binding affinity hierarchy of p66α for the different MBD2 homologues (MBD2 ≈ MBD3 > MBD3L1 ≈ MBD3L2) and suggest a hierarchical regulatory model in tissue and life cycle stage-specific silencing by NuRD complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2076009769,"Background The ratio of habitat generalists to specialists in birds has been suggested as a good indicator of ecosystem changes due to e.g. climate change and other anthropogenic perturbations. Most studies focusing on this functional component of biodiversity originate, however, from temperate regions. The Eurasian Arctic tundra is currently experiencing an unprecedented combination of climate change, change in grazing pressure by domestic reindeer and growing human activity. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we monitored bird communities in a tundra landscape harbouring shrub and open habitats in order to analyse bird habitat relationships and quantify habitat specialization. We used ordination methods to analyse habitat associations and estimated the proportions of specialists in each of the main habitats. Correspondence Analysis identified three main bird communities, inhabiting upland, lowland and dense willow shrubs. We documented a stable structure of communities despite large multiannual variations of bird density (from 90 to 175 pairs/km2). Willow shrub thickets were a hotspot for bird density, but not for species richness. The thickets hosted many specialized species whose main distribution area was south of the tundra. Conclusion/Significance If current arctic changes result in a shrubification of the landscape as many studies suggested, we would expect an increase in the overall bird abundance together with an increase of local specialists, since they are associated with willow thickets. The majority of these species have a southern origin and their increase in abundance would represent a strengthening of the boreal component in the southern tundra, perhaps at the expense of species typical of the subarctic zone, which appear to be generalists within this zone."
https://openalex.org/W2017960220,"Mannan-binding lectin (MBL), a lectin homologous to C1q, greatly facilitates C3/C4-mediated opsonophagocytosis of Candida albicans (C. albicans) by human neutrophils, and has the capacity to bind to CR1 (CD35) expressed on circulating neutrophils. The intracellular pool of neutrophil Dectin-1 plays a critical role in stimulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through recognition of β-1,3-glucan component of phagocytized zymosan or yeasts. However, little is known about whether MBL can mediate the opsonophagocytosis of Candida albicans by neutrophils independent of complement activation, and whether MBL-mediated opsonophagocytosis influence the intracellular expression of Dectin-1 and ROS production. Here we showed that the inhibited phagocytic efficiency of neutrophils as a result of blockage of Dectin-1 was compensated by exogenous MBL alone in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expressions of Dectin-1 at mRNA and intracellular protein levels were significantly up-regulated in neutrophils stimulated by MBL-pre-incubated C. albicans, while the expression of surface Dectin-1 remained almost unchanged. Nevertheless, the stimulated ROS production in neutrophils was partly and irreversibly inhibited by blockage of Dectin-1 in the presence of exogenous MBL. Confocal microscopy examination showed that intracellular Dectin-1 was recruited and co-distributed with ROS on the surface of some phagocytized yeasts. The β-1,3-glucanase digestion test further suggested that the specific recognition and binding site of human Dectin-1 is just the β-1,3-glucan moiety on the cell wall of C. albicans. These data demonstrate that MBL has an ability to mediate the opsonophagocytosis of Candida albicans by human neutrophils independent of complement activation, which is coupled with intracellular Dectin-1-triggered ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W2150200554,"Intracellular calcium overload plays a critical role in numerous pathological syndromes such as heart failure, brain ischemia, and stroke. Hyperactivation of the acid-sensing ion channels including degenerin/epithelial amiloride-sensitive sodium (DEG/ENaC) channels has been shown to elevate intracellular calcium and cause subsequent neuronal cell death that is independent of the canonical Egl-1/Ced-9/Ced-4/Ced-3 apoptotic pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans. In mammalian cells, hyperactivation of the DEG/ENaC channels can also lead to cell death, although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we use a tetracycline-inducible system to express the hyperactivation mutant of a mammalian DEG/ENaC channel protein, MDEG G430F, in murine kidney epithelial cells deficient in the key mitochondrial apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. Remarkably, expression of MDEG G430F induces increased intracellular calcium, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cell death. The MDEG G430F-induced cell death is blocked by the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (acetoxymethyl ester), ROS scavengers, and the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (where z and fmk are benzyloxycarbonyl and fluoromethyl ketone). Mechanistically, the intracellular calcium overload and ROS increase lead to the inhibition of proteasomal and autophagic protein degradation, which promotes the accumulation of protein aggregates containing caspase-8 and subsequent caspase-8 activation. As protein aggregation upon the inhibition of proteasomal and autophagic degradation pathways is mediated by the ubiquitin-binding protein SQSTM1/p62 and the autophagy-related protein LC3, silencing of p62 and LC3 protects cells from MDEG G430F-induced cell death. Our results uncover a new mechanism of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis induced by intracellular calcium overload that is dependent on the autophagy-related proteins LC3 and p62 upon hyperactivation of DEG/ENaC channels."
https://openalex.org/W1978241680,"Although the female gametophyte in angiosperms consists of just seven cells, it has a complex biological network. In this study, female gametophyte microarray data from Arabidopsis thaliana were integrated into the Arabidopsis interactome database to generate a putative interaction map of the female gametophyte development including proteome map based on biological processes and molecular functions of proteins. Biological and functional groups as well as topological characteristics of the network were investigated by analyzing phytohormones, plant defense, cell death, transporters, regulatory factors, and hydrolases. This approach led to the prediction of critical members and bottlenecks of the network. Seventy-four and 24 upregulated genes as well as 171 and 3 downregulated genes were identified in subtracted networks based on biological processes and molecular function respectively, including novel genes such as the pathogenesis-related protein 4, ER type Ca(2+) ATPase 3, dihydroflavonol reductase, and ATP disulfate isomerase. Biologically important relationships between genes, critical nodes, and new essential proteins such as AT1G26830, AT5G20850, CYP74A, AT1G42396, PR4 and MEA were found in the interactome's network. The positions of novel genes, both upregulated and downregulated, and their relationships with biological pathways, in particular phytohormones, were highlighted in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2091589636,"Precipitation of alpha chymotrypsin in the simultaneous presence of ammonium sulphate and t-butanol (three phase partitioning) resulted in preparations which showed self aggregation of the enzyme molecules. Precipitation with increasing amounts of ammonium sulphate led to increasing size of aggregates. While light scattering estimated the hydrodynamic diameter of these aggregates in the range of 242–1124 nm; Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) gave the value as 130–462 nm. Scanning electron microscopy and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 showed extensive aggregation in these preparations. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the aggregates had irregular shapes. All the aggregates had about 3× higher catalytic activity than the native enzyme. These aggregates did not differ in λmax of fluorescence emission which was around 340 nm. However, all the aggregates showed higher fluorescence emission intensity. Far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism also showed no significant structural changes as compared to the native molecule. Interestingly, HPLC gel filtration (on a hydroxylated silica column) gave 14 nm as the diameter for all preparations. Light scattering of preparations in the presence of 10% ethylene glycol also dissociated the aggregates to monomers of 14 nm. Both these results indicated that hydrophobic interactions were the driving force behind this aggregation. These results indicate: (1) Even without any major structural change, three phase partitioning led to protein molecules becoming highly prone to aggregation. (2) Different methods gave widely different estimates of sizes of aggregates. It was however possible to reconcile the data obtained with various approaches. (3) The nature of the gel filtration column is crucial and use of this technique for refolding and studying aggregation needs a rethink."

Methods Self-reported physical activity and health-related fitness tests were administered before and after a 9-month intervention in 24 boys and 20 girls aged 8 to 11 years. Individuals’ perceptions of strength, speed and agility were assessed using the Perceived Physical Ability Scale, while body image was measured using Collins’ Child Figure Drawings. Results Findings showed that body mass index, physical activity, performances on throwing and weight-bearing tasks, perceived physical ability and body image significantly improved after treatment among obese children. Gender differences were found in the correlational analyses, showing a link between actual and perceived physical abilities in boys, but not in girls. For the specific measurement interval of this study, perception of physical ability was an antecedent and not a potential consequence of physical activity. Conclusions Results indicate that a multi-component activity program not based merely on a dose-effect approach enhances adherence of the participants and has the potential to increase the lifelong exercise skills of obese children. Rather than focusing entirely on diet and weight loss, findings support the inclusion of interventions directed toward improving perceived physical ability that is predictive of subsequent physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2166871675,"Traditional k-means and most k-means variants are still computationally expensive for large datasets, such as microarray data, which have large datasets with large dimension size d. In k-means clustering, we are given a set of n data points in d-dimensional space Rd and an integer k. The problem is to determine a set of k points in Rd, called centers, so as to minimize the mean squared distance from each data point to its nearest center. In this work, we develop a novel k-means algorithm, which is simple but more efficient than the traditional k-means and the recent enhanced k-means. Our new algorithm is based on the recently established relationship between principal component analysis and the k-means clustering. We provided the correctness proof for this algorithm. Results obtained from testing the algorithm on three biological data and six non-biological data (three of these data are real, while the other three are simulated) also indicate that our algorithm is empirically faster than other known k-means algorithms. We assessed the quality of our algorithm clusters against the clusters of a known structure using the Hubert-Arabie Adjusted Rand index (ARIHA). We found that when k is close to d, the quality is good (ARIHA>0.8) and when k is not close to d, the quality of our new k-means algorithm is excellent (ARIHA>0.9). In this paper, emphases are on the reduction of the time requirement of the k-means algorithm and its application to microarray data due to the desire to create a tool for clustering and malaria research. However, the new clustering algorithm can be used for other clustering needs as long as an appropriate measure of distance between the centroids and the members is used. This has been demonstrated in this work on six non-biological data."
https://openalex.org/W1975075402,"Gemcitabine (2,2-difluorodeoxycytidine, dFdC) is a prodrug widely used for treating various carcinomas. Gemcitabine exerts its clinical effect by depleting the deoxyribonucleotide pools, and incorporating its triphosphate metabolite (dFdC-TP) into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis. This process blocks the cell cycle in the early S phase, eventually resulting in apoptosis. The incorporation of gemcitabine into DNA takes place in competition with the natural nucleoside dCTP. The mechanisms of indirect competition between these cascades for common resources are given with the race for DNA incorporation; in clinical studies dedicated to singling out mechanisms of resistance, ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and human equilibrative nucleoside transporter1 (hENT1) have been associated to efficacy of gemcitabine with respect to their roles in the synthesis cascades of dFdC-TP and dCTP. However, the direct competition, which manifests itself in terms of inhibitions between these cascades, remains to be quantified. We propose an algorithmic model of gemcitabine mechanism of action, verified with respect to independent experimental data. We performed in silico experiments in different virtual conditions, otherwise difficult in vivo, to evaluate the contribution of the inhibitory mechanisms to gemcitabine efficacy. In agreement with the experimental data, our model indicates that the inhibitions due to the association of dCTP with dCK and the association of gemcitabine diphosphate metabolite (dFdC-DP) with RR play a key role in adjusting the efficacy. While the former tunes the catalysis of the rate-limiting first phosphorylation of dFdC, the latter is responsible for depletion of dCTP pools, thereby contributing to gemcitabine efficacy with a dependency on nucleoside transport efficiency. Our simulations predict the existence of a continuum of non-efficacy to high-efficacy regimes, where the levels of dFdC-TP and dCTP are coupled in a complementary manner, which can explain the resistance to this drug in some patients."

Knowledge of the profiles of immune cells associated with the physiopathology of pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is scarce. We conducted a longitudinal, prospective study, both in Benin and Tanzania, including ∼1000 pregnant women in each site with systematic follow-up at scheduled antenatal visits until delivery. We used ex vivo flow cytometry to identify peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) profiles that are associated with PAM and anaemia, determining the phenotypic composition and activation status of PBMC in selected sub-groups with and without PAM both at inclusion and at delivery in a total of 302 women. Both at inclusion and at delivery PAM was associated with significantly increased frequencies both of B cells overall and of activated B cells. Infection-related profiles were otherwise quite distinct at the two different time-points. At inclusion, PAM was associated with anaemia, with an increased frequency of immature monocytes and with a decreased frequency of regulatory T cells (Treg). At delivery, infected women presented with significantly fewer plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC), more myeloid DC expressing low levels of HLA-DR, and more effector T cells (Teff) compared to uninfected women. Independent associations with an increased risk of anaemia were found for altered antigen-presenting cell frequencies at inclusion, but for an increased frequency of Teff at delivery. Our findings emphasize the prominent role played by B cells during PAM whenever it arises during pregnancy, whilst also revealing signature changes in other circulating cell types that, we conclude, primarily reflect the relative duration of the infections. Thus, the acute, recently-acquired infections present at delivery were marked by changes in DC and Teff frequencies, contrasting with infections at inclusion, considered chronic in nature, that were characterized by an abundance of immature monocytes and a paucity of Treg in PBMC."

https://openalex.org/W1991793721,"Background Memory disturbances, in particular episodic verbal memory dysfunction, are the most frequent cognitive impairment observed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The use of self-reported outcomes for evaluating treatment and managing care of these subjects has been questioned. The aim of this study was to provide new evidence about the suitability of self-reported outcomes for use in this impaired population by exploring the internal structure, reliability and external validity of a specific quality of life (QoL) instrument, the Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life questionnaire (MusiQoL). Methods Design: cross-sectional study. Inclusion criteria: MS patients of any disease subtype. Data collection: sociodemographic (age, gender, marital status, education level, and occupational activity) and clinical data (MS subtype, Expanded Disability Status Scale, disease duration); QoL (MusiQoL and SF36); and memory performance (Grober and Buschke test). In accordance with the French norms of the memory test, non-impaired and impaired populations were defined for short- and long-delay free composites and for short- and long-delay total composites. For the 8 populations, psychometric properties were compared to those reported from the reference population assessed in the validation study. Principal Findings One hundred and twenty-four consecutive patients were enrolled. The analysis performed in the impaired populations showed that the questionnaire structure adequately matched the initial structure of the MusiQoL. The unidimensionality of the dimensions was preserved, and the internal/external validity indices were close to those of the reference population. Conclusions/Significance Our study suggests that memory dysfunction did not compromise the reliability or validity of the self-reported QoL questionnaires."
https://openalex.org/W2011613440,"Adult regenerative myogenesis is central for restoring normal tissue structure and function after muscle damage. In muscle repair after injury, as in severe myopathies, damaged and necrotic fibers are removed by infiltrating inflammatory cells and then replaced by muscle stem cells or satellite cells, which will fuse to form new myofibers. Extracellular proteolysis mediated by uPA-generated plasmin plays a critical role in controlling inflammation and satellite-cell-dependent myogenesis. α-enolase has been described as plasminogen receptor in several cell types, where it acts concentrating plasmin proteolytic activity on the cell surface. In this study, we investigated whether α-enolase plasminogen receptor plays a regulatory role during the muscular repair process. Inhibitors of α-enolase/plasminogen binding: MAb11G1 (a monoclonal antibody against α-enolase) and ε-aminocaproic acid, EACA (a lysine analogue) inhibited the myogenic abilities of satellite cells-derived myoblasts. Furthermore, knockdown of α-enolase decreased myogenic fusion of myoblasts. Injured wild-type mice and dystrophic mdx mice were also treated with MAb11G1 and EACA. These treatments had negative impacts on muscle repair impairing satellite cell functions in vitro in agreement with blunted growth of new myofibers in vivo. Furthermore, both MAb11G1 and EACA treatments impaired adequate inflammatory cell infiltration and promoted extracellular matrix deposition in vivo, which resulted in persistent degeneration. These results demonstrate the novel requirement of α-enolase for restoring homeostasis of injured muscle tissue, by controlling the pericellular localization of plasmin activity."

In ex vivo mammary explants from MMTV-p130Cas transgenic mice, we show that p130Cas impairs the functional interplay between Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Estrogen Receptor (ER) during mammary gland development. Indeed, we demonstrate that p130Cas over-expression upon the concomitant stimulation with EGF and estrogen (E2) severely impairs mammary morphogenesis giving rise to enlarged multicellular spherical structures with altered architecture and absence of the central lumen. These filled acinar structures are characterized by increased cell survival and proliferation and by a strong activation of Erk1/2 MAPKs and Akt. Interestingly, antagonizing the ER activity is sufficient to re-establish branching morphogenesis and normal Erk1/2 MAPK activity. Overall, these results indicate that high levels of p130Cas expression profoundly affect mammary morphogenesis by altering epithelial architecture, survival and unbalancing Erk1/2 MAPKs activation in response to growth factors and hormones. These results suggest that alteration of morphogenetic pathways due to p130Cas over-expression might prime mammary epithelium to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2007705174,"Type III secretion system is a virulent factor for many pathogens, and is thought to play multiple roles in the development cycle and pathogenesis of chlamydia, an important human pathogen. However, due to the obligate intracellular parasitical nature of chlamydiae and a lack of convenient genetic methodology for the organisms, very limited approaches are available to study the chlamydial type III secretion system. In this study, we explored the reconstitution of a chlamydial type III secretion in Escherichia coli.We successfully cloned all 6 genomic DNA clusters of the chlamydial type III secretion system into three bacterial plasmids. 5 of the 6 clusters were found to direct mRNA synthesis from their own promoters in Escherichia coli transformed with the three plasmids. Cluster 5 failed to express mRNA using its own promoters. However, fusion of cluster 5 to cluster 6 resulted in the expression of cluster 5 mRNA. Although only two of the type III secretion system proteins were detected transformed E. coli due to limited antibody availability, type III secretion system-like structures were detected in ultrathin sections in a small proportion of transformed E. coli.We have successfully generated E. coli expressing all genes of the chlamydial type III secretion system. This serves as a foundation for optimal expression and assembly of the recombinant chlamydial type III secretion system, which may be extremely useful for the characterization of the chlamydial type III secretion system and for studying its role in chlamydial pathogenicity."

We generated a transgenic mouse model containing a >100-kb 5' region of human CYP19A1 gene connected to a luciferase reporter gene. The luciferase activity in mouse tissues mimicked the CYP19A1 gene expression pattern in humans. Interestingly, the reporter gene activity was 16 and 160 times higher in the urinary bladder and seminal vesicles, respectively, as compared with the activity in the testis. Accordingly, CYP19A1 gene and P450arom protein expression was detected in those human tissues. Moreover, the data revealed that the expression of CYP19A1 gene is driven by promoters PII, I.4, and I.3 in the seminal vesicles, and by promoters PII and I.4 in the urinary bladder. Furthermore, the reporter gene expression in the seminal vesicles was androgen dependent: Castration decreased the expression ∼20 times, and testosterone treatment restored it to the level of an intact mouse. This reporter mouse model facilitates studies of tissue-specific regulation of the human CYP19A1 gene, and our data provide evidence for seminal vesicles as important sites for estrogen production in males."
https://openalex.org/W1969426526,"New-generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) tend to replace traditional AEDs as the first-line choice for epilepsy. However, whether this change results in better outcome, especially in China, remains unknown.Two broad spectrum AEDs, the traditional drug of sustained-release formulation of valproate (SRVPA) and the new-generation drug of topiramate, were compared in patients with epilepsy as monotherapy in this multi-centre, observational cohort study from 2000 to 2011. The primary outcome was time to treatment failure. The secondary outcomes included time to first seizure, time to 12-month remission, and time to 24-month remission. Drug tolerability was assessed. Cox proportional hazard models (95% confidence interval [CI]) were used to analyse the relative risks expressed as hazard ratios (HR). Of the 1008 recruited patients, 519 received SRVPA and 489 received topiramate. SRVPA was better than topiramate (28.3% vs. 41.5%; HR = 0.62, [95% CI 0.49-0.77]; p<0.0001) in primary outcome, and in time to first seizure (56.1% vs. 69.3%; HR = 0.73, [95% CI 0.62-0.86]; p = 0.0002). No significant difference was observed between two groups in time to 12-month remission (52.6% vs. 42.5%; HR = 1.01, [95% CI 0.84-1.23]; p = 0.88) and time to 24-month remission (34.7% vs. 25.2%; HR = 1.11, [95% CI 0.88-1.42]; p = 0.38). 36 patients (6.9%) in SRVPA group and 37 patients (7.6%) in topiramate group presented treatment failure associated with intolerable adverse events, there was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.70).The SRVPA is more suitable than topiramate for Chinese epileptic patients, and our results support the viewpoint that traditional AEDs should be the first-line choice for epilepsy rather than new-generation AEDs."
https://openalex.org/W1991341535,"The aim of this study was to describe gender differences in patients operated on for TOF and to define the impact of pregnancy in late post-surgical follow-up in women.In this research, we studied 145 patients after correction of TOF: 66 male, 79 women, 41 of which reported history of 68 pregnancies, means age 37±10 years, age at operation 7±8 years, mean duration of post-surgical follow-up 30±7 years. Selected variables were compared according to sex and according to history of pregnancy with statistical tests.Men had more severe hemodynamic impairment and a higher number of cardiac reoperations than females. 41% of patients had at least one complication during pregnancy; there were 16 (67%) abortions and 39 (74%) Caesarian delivers; the recurrence of congenital heart defect was 10%. After pregnancy, there was a shift from first to second functional class: unique pregnancy determined no differences in term of morpho-functional ventricular features compared to nulliparous, but they complained fatigue and palpitation and echocardiographyc dysfunction. Left ventricular dysfunction and QRS duration at ECG were independent predictors of ventricular arrhythmias in all patients.There were no gender-specific differences in patients operated on for TOF using ventriculotomy. Pregnancy is an event in these patients at risk for the newborn, in terms of miscarriage, prematurity, and recurrence of birth defects, and for the mother in terms of ventricular dysfunction and electrical instability. At least a single pregnancy does not appear to significantly modify the natural history of post-surgical patients operated on for TOF."
https://openalex.org/W2045555645,"Objective The Bristol heart inquiry in the United Kingdom (UK) highlighted the lack of standards for evaluating surgical performance and quality. In 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) proposed six standardised metrics for surgical surveillance. This is the first study to collect and analyse such metrics from a cohort of National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, helping to determine their feasibility and utility in measuring surgical performance, its impact on public health and mortality, and for tracking surgical trends over time. Methods Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOI) requests for WHO standardised surgical metrics were made to 36 NHS Trusts in England during July to November 2010. Additional data on Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio (HSMR), Patient Safety Score and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) volume and mortality was obtained from Dr Foster Health and The Guardian Newspaper. Analysis was performed using mixed-effect logistic regression. Results 30/36 trusts responded (83%). During 2005–9, 5.4 million operations were performed with a 24.2% increase in annual number of operations. This rising volume within hospitals was associated with lower mortality ratios. A 10% increase in operative volume was associated with a lower day of surgery death rate (DDR OR = 0.94, p = 0.056) and post-operative inpatient 30-day mortality (PDR30 OR = 0.93, p = 0.001). For every 10,000 more operations that an NHS Trust does, a 4% drop in PDR30 mortality was achieved. A 10% increase in the volume of elective AAAs was associated with lower elective AAA (OR = 0.96, p = 0.032) and emergency AAA (OR = 0.95, p = 0.009) PDR30 mortality. Lower DDR mortality was noted for emergency AAA mortality (OR = 0.95, p = 0.025) but not elective AAAs (OR = 0.97, p = 0.116). Conclusion Standarised surgical metrics can provide policy makers and commissioners with valuable summary data on surgical performance allowing for statistical process control of a complex intervention. This study has shown their collection is feasible albeit using FOI and the first to show a statistically significant volume-outcome relationship for surgery as a whole within hospitals. It adds weight to the argument that patients are safer in larger hospitals or those that become larger by growing their patient base. Together with other measures, such metrics can help build a picture of surgical surveillance in the UK and potentially lead us to safer surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2065256186,"In the recent worldwide campaign for the global biodiversity inventory via DNA barcoding, a simple and easily used measure of confidence for assigning sequences to species in DNA barcoding has not been established so far, although the likelihood ratio test and the bayesian approach had been proposed to address this issue from a statistical point of view. The TDR (Two Dimensional non-parametric Resampling) measure newly proposed in this study offers users a simple and easy approach to evaluate the confidence of species membership in DNA barcoding projects. We assessed the validity and robustness of the TDR approach using datasets simulated under coalescent models, and an empirical dataset, and found that TDR measure is very robust in assessing species membership of DNA barcoding. In contrast to the likelihood ratio test and bayesian approach, the TDR method stands out due to simplicity in both concepts and calculations, with little in the way of restrictive population genetic assumptions. To implement this approach we have developed a computer program package (TDR1.0beta) freely available from ftp://202.204.209.200/education/video/TDR1.0beta.rar."
