However, its involvement in mitigation of heavy metal stress in plants remains elusive. In this study, we examined the effect of Ca (50 mM) in controlling cadmium (Cd) uptake in mustard (Brassica juncea L.) plants exposed to toxic levels of Cd (200 mg L−1 and 300 mg L−1). The Cd treatment showed substantial decrease in plant height, root length, dry weight, pigments and protein content. Application of Ca improved the growth and biomass yield of the Cd-stressed mustard seedlings. More importantly, the oil content of mustard seeds of Cd-stressed plants was also enhanced with Ca treatment. Proline was significantly increased in mustard plants under Cd stress, and exogenously sprayed Ca was found to have a positive impact on proline content in Cd-stressed plants. Different concentrations of Cd increased lipid peroxidation but the application of Ca minimized it to appreciable level in Cd-treated plants. Excessive Cd treatment enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase, which were further enhanced by the addition of Ca. Additionally, Cd stress caused reduced uptake of essential elements and increased Cd accumulation in roots and shoots. However, application of Ca enhanced the concentration of essential elements and decreased Cd accumulation in Cd-stressed plants. Our results indicated that application of Ca enables mustard plant to withstand the deleterious effect of Cd, resulting in improved growth and seed quality of mustard plants."
https://openalex.org/W2013149980,"Non-small-cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Chemotherapies such as the topoisomerase II (TopoII) inhibitor etoposide effectively reduce disease in a minority of patients with this cancer; therefore, alternative drug targets, including epigenetic enzymes, are under consideration for therapeutic intervention. A promising potential epigenetic target is the methyltransferase EZH2, which in the context of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is well known to tri-methylate histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and elicit gene silencing. Here we demonstrate that EZH2 inhibition has differential effects on the TopoII inhibitor response of non-small-cell lung cancers in vitro and in vivo. EGFR and BRG1 mutations are genetic biomarkers that predict enhanced sensitivity to TopoII inhibitor in response to EZH2 inhibition. BRG1 loss-of-function mutant tumours respond to EZH2 inhibition with increased S phase, anaphase bridging, apoptosis and TopoII inhibitor sensitivity. Conversely, EGFR and BRG1 wild-type tumours upregulate BRG1 in response to EZH2 inhibition and ultimately become more resistant to TopoII inhibitor. EGFR gain-of-function mutant tumours are also sensitive to dual EZH2 inhibition and TopoII inhibitor, because of genetic antagonism between EGFR and BRG1. These findings suggest an opportunity for precision medicine in the genetically complex disease of non-small-cell lung cancer."

However, little is known about the microbiome in early cystic fibrosis lung disease and the relationship between the microbiomes from different niches in the upper and lower airways. Therefore, in this cross-sectional study, we examined the relationship between the microbiome in the upper (nose and throat) and lower (sputum) airways from children with cystic fibrosis using next generation sequencing. Our results demonstrate a significant difference in both α and β-diversity between the nose and the two other sampling sites. The nasal microbiome was characterized by a polymicrobial community while the throat and sputum communities were less diverse and dominated by a few operational taxonomic units. Moreover, sputum and throat microbiomes were closely related especially in patients with clinically stable lung disease. There was a high inter-individual variability in sputum samples primarily due to a decrease in evenness linked to increased abundance of potential respiratory pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection exhibited a less diverse sputum microbiome. A high concordance was found between pediatric and adult sputum microbiomes except that Burkholderia was only observed in the adult cohort. These results indicate that an adult-like lower airways microbiome is established early in life and that throat swabs may be a good surrogate in clinically stable children with cystic fibrosis without chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in whom sputum sampling is often not feasible."

Our objective was to determine the association of EDC exposure with earlier age of menopause. Methods Cross-sectional survey using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2008 (n = 31,575 females). Eligible participants included: menopausal women >30 years of age; not currently pregnant, breastfeeding, using hormonal contraception; no history of bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy. Exposures, defined by serum lipid and urine creatinine-adjusted measures of EDCs, data were analyzed: > 90th percentile of the EDC distribution among all women, log-transformed EDC level, and decile of EDC level. Multi linear regression models considered complex survey design characteristics and adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, body mass index. EDCs were stratified into long (>1 year), short, and unknown half-lives; principle analyses were performed on those with long half-lives as well as phthalates, known reproductive toxicants. Secondary analysis determined whether the odds of being menopausal increased with EDC exposure among women aged 45–55 years. Findings This analysis examined 111 EDCs and focused on known reproductive toxicants or chemicals with half-lives >1 year. Women with high levels of β-hexachlorocyclohexane, mirex, p,p’-DDE, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptachlorodibenzofuran, mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners −70, −99, −105, −118, −138, −153, −156, −170, and −183 had mean ages of menopause 1.9 to 3.8 years earlier than women with lower levels of these chemicals. EDC-exposed women were up to 6 times more likely to be menopausal than non-exposed women. Conclusions This study of a representative sample of US women documents an association between EDCs and earlier age at menopause. We identified 15 EDCs that warrant closer evaluation because of their persistence and potential detrimental effects on ovarian function. Earlier menopause can alter the quantity and quality of a woman’s life and has profound implications for fertility, human reproduction, and our global society."

We analyzed the impact of winter heating on aerosol loadings over China using the MODIS-Aqua Collection 6 aerosol product from 2004–2012. Absolute humidity (AH) and planetary boundary layer height (PBL) -adjusted aerosol optical depth (AOD*) was constructed to reflect ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. GIS analysis, standard statistical tests, and statistical modeling indicate that winter heating is an important factor causing increased PM2.5 levels in more than three-quarters of central and eastern China. The heating season AOD* was more than five times higher as the non-heating season AOD*, and the increase in AOD* in the heating areas was greater than in the non-heating areas. Finally, central heating tend to contribute less to air pollution relative to other means of household heating."
https://openalex.org/W2077090733,"Introduction Pregnancy is generally viewed as a time of fulfillment and joy; however, for many women it can be a stressful event. In South Asia it is associated with cultural stigmas revolving around gender discrimination, abnormal births and genetic abnormalities. Methodology This cross-sectional study was done at four teaching hospitals in Lahore from February, 2014 to June, 2014. A total of 500 pregnant women seen at hospital obstetrics and gynecology departments were interviewed with a questionnaire consisting of three sections: demographics, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). Pearson’s chi-squared test, bivariate correlations and multiple linear regression were used to analyze associations between the independent variables and scores on the HADS and SPS. Results Mean age among the 500 respondents was 27.41 years (5.65). Anxiety levels in participants were categorized as normal (145 women, 29%), borderline (110, 22%) or anxious (245, 49%). Depression levels were categorized as normal (218 women, 43.6%), borderline (123, 24.6%) or depressed (159, 31.8%). Inferential analysis revealed that higher HADS scores were significantly associated with lower scores on the SPS, rural background, history of harassment, abortion, cesarean delivery and unplanned pregnancies (P < .05). Social support (SPS score) mediated the relationship between the total number of children, gender of previous children and HADS score. Women with more daughters were significantly more likely to score higher on the HADS and lower on the SPS, whereas higher numbers of sons were associated with the opposite trends in the scores (P < .05). Conclusion Because of the predominantly patriarchal sociocultural context in Pakistan, the predictors of antenatal anxiety and depression may differ from those in developed countries. We therefore suggest that interventions designed and implemented to reduce antenatal anxiety and depression should take into account these unique factors."
https://openalex.org/W2146464863,"Erythropoietin (EPO) primarily regulates red blood cell formation, and EPO serum levels are increased on hypoxic stress (e.g., anemia and altitude). In addition to anemia, recent discoveries suggest new therapeutic indications for EPO, unrelated to erythropoiesis. We investigated the skeletal role of EPO using several models of overexpression (Tg6 mice) and EPO administration (intermittent/continuous, high/low doses) in adult C57B16 female mice. Using microcomputed tomography, histology, and serum markers, we found that EPO induced a 32%-61% trabecular bone loss caused by increased bone resorption (+60%-88% osteoclast number) and reduced bone formation rate (-19 to -74%; P < 0.05 throughout). EPO targeted the monocytic lineage by increasing the number of bone monocytes/macrophages, preosteoclasts, and mature osteoclasts. In contrast to the attenuated bone formation in vivo, EPO treatment in vitro did not inhibit osteoblast differentiation and activity, suggesting an indirect effect of EPO on osteoblasts. However, EPO had a direct effect on preosteoclasts by stimulating osteoclastogenesis in isolated cultures (+60%) via the Jak2 and PI3K pathways. In summary, our findings demonstrate that EPO negatively regulates bone mass and thus bears significant clinical implications for the potential management of patients with endogenously or therapeutically elevated EPO levels.—Hiram-Bab, S., Liron, T., Deshet-Unger, N., Mittelman, M., Gassmann, M., Rauner, M., Franke, K., Wielockx, B., Neumann, D., Gabet, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2095389529,"Coenzyme Q (Q or ubiquinone) is a redox active lipid composed of a fully substituted benzoquinone ring and a polyisoprenoid tail and is required for mitochondrial electron transport. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Q is synthesized by the products of 11 known genes, COQ1–COQ9, YAH1, and ARH1. The function of some of the Coq proteins remains unknown, and several steps in the Q biosynthetic pathway are not fully characterized. Several of the Coq proteins are associated in a macromolecular complex on the matrix face of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and this complex is required for efficient Q synthesis. Here, we further characterize this complex via immunoblotting and proteomic analysis of tandem affinity-purified tagged Coq proteins. We show that Coq8, a putative kinase required for the stability of the Q biosynthetic complex, is associated with a Coq6-containing complex. Additionally Q6 and late stage Q biosynthetic intermediates were also found to co-purify with the complex. A mitochondrial protein of unknown function, encoded by the YLR290C open reading frame, is also identified as a constituent of the complex and is shown to be required for efficient de novo Q biosynthesis. Given its effect on Q synthesis and its association with the biosynthetic complex, we propose that the open reading frame YLR290C be designated COQ11."
https://openalex.org/W2131762882,"Bicuspid aortic valves calcify at a significantly higher rate than normal aortic valves, a process that involves increased inflammation. Because we have previously found that bicuspid aortic valve experience greater stretch, we investigated the potential connection between stretch and inflammation in human aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs). Microarray, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and protein assays performed on AVICs exposed to cyclic stretch showed that stretch was sufficient to increase expression of interleukin and metalloproteinase family members by more than 1.5-fold. Conditioned medium from stretched AVICs was sufficient to activate leukocytes. microRNA sequencing and qPCR experiments demonstrated that miR-148a-3p was repressed in both stretched AVICs (43% repression) and, as a clinical correlate, human bicuspid aortic valves (63% reduction). miR-148a-3p was found to be a novel repressor of IKBKB based on data from qPCR, luciferase, and Western blot experiments. Furthermore, increasing miR-148a-3p levels in AVICs was sufficient to decrease NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling and NF-κB target gene expression. Our data demonstrate that stretch-mediated activation of inflammatory pathways is at least partly the result of stretch-repression of miR-148a-3p and a consequent failure to repress IKBKB. To our knowledge, we are the first to report that cyclic stretch of human AVICs activates inflammatory genes in a tissue-autonomous manner via a microRNA that regulates a central inflammatory pathway.—Patel, V., Carrion, K., Hollands, A., Hinton, A., Gallegos, T., Dyo, J., Sasik, R., Leire, E., Hardiman, G., Mohamed, S.

https://openalex.org/W1998751386,"Sharks are top predators in many marine ecosystems and can impact community dynamics, yet many shark populations are undergoing severe declines primarily due to overfishing. Obtaining species-specific knowledge on shark spatial ecology is important to implement adequate management strategies for the effective conservation of these taxa. This is particularly relevant concerning highly-mobile species that use wide home ranges comprising coastal and oceanic habitats, such as tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier. We deployed satellite tags in 20 juvenile tiger sharks off northeastern Brazil to assess the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on depth and temperature usage. Sharks were tracked for a total of 1184 d and used waters up to 1112 m in depth. The minimum temperature recorded equaled 4°C. All sharks had a clear preference for surface (< 5 m) waters but variability in depth usage was observed as some sharks used mostly shallow (< 60 m) waters whereas others made frequent incursions into greater depths. A diel behavioral shift was detected, with sharks spending considerably more time in surface (< 10 m) waters during the night. Moreover, a clear ontogenetic expansion in the vertical range of tiger shark habitat was observed, with generalized linear models estimating a ~4-fold increase in maximum diving depth from 150- to 300-cm size-classes. The time spent in the upper 5 m of the water column did not vary ontogenetically but shark size was the most important factor explaining the utilization of deeper water layers. Young-of-the-year tiger sharks seem to associate with shallow, neritic habitats but they progressively move into deeper oceanic habitats as they grow larger. Such an early plasticity in habitat use could endow tiger sharks with access to previously unavailable prey, thus contributing to a wider ecological niche."
https://openalex.org/W2084287306,"Actin microridges form labyrinth like patterns on superficial epithelial cells across animal species. This highly organized assembly has been implicated in mucus retention and in the mechanical structure of mucosal surfaces, however the mechanisms that regulate actin microridges remain largely unknown. Here we characterize the composition and dynamics of actin microridges on the surface of zebrafish larvae using live imaging. Microridges contain phospho-tyrosine, cortactin and VASP, but not focal adhesion kinase. Time-lapse imaging reveals dynamic changes in the length and branching of microridges in intact animals. Transient perturbation of the microridge pattern occurs before cell division with rapid re-assembly during and after cytokinesis. Microridge assembly is maintained with constitutive activation of Rho or inhibition of myosin II activity. However, expression of dominant negative RhoA or Rac alters microridge organization, with an increase in distance between microridges. Latrunculin A treatment and photoconversion experiments suggest that the F-actin filaments are actively treadmilling in microridges. Accordingly, inhibition of Arp2/3 or PI3K signaling impairs microridge structure and length. Taken together, actin microridges in zebrafish represent a tractable in vivo model to probe pattern formation and dissect Arp2/3-mediated actin dynamics in vivo."

In this study, Foxf2 requirements in murine smooth muscle cells were examined using a conditional knock-out approach. We generated novel Foxf2-floxed mice, which we bred to smMHC-Cre-eGFP mice to generate a mouse line with Foxf2 deleted specifically from smooth muscle. These mice exhibited growth retardation due to reduced intestinal length as well as inflammation and remodeling of the small intestine. Colons of Tg(smMHC-Cre-eGFP+/−);Foxf2−/− mice had expansion of the myenteric nerve plexus and increased proliferation of smooth muscle cells leading to thickening of the longitudinal smooth muscle layer. Foxf2 deficiency in colonic smooth muscle was associated with increased expression of Foxf1, PDGFa, PDGFb, PDGF receptor α, and myocardin. FOXF2 bound to promoter regions of these genes indicating direct transcriptional regulation. Foxf2 repressed Foxf1 promoter activity in co-transfection experiments. We also show that knockdown of Foxf2 in colonic smooth muscle cells in vitro and in transgenic mice increased myocardin/serum response factor signaling and increased expression of contractile proteins.

Using in situ hybridization, embryonic Foxf2 expression has been found in the mesenchyme of the oral cavity, limb buds, genitalia, CNS, eyes, lung, prostate, ear, and placenta as well as the lamina propria region and smooth muscle of the developing GI tract (21.Aitola M.

Wang T. Johansson B.R. Miura N. Carlsson P. Foxf1 and Foxf2 control murine gut development by limiting mesenchymal Wnt signaling and promoting extracellular matrix production.Development. 2006; 133: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); however, postnatal Foxf2 expression and signaling remain poorly characterized. Studies have shown alterations in Foxf2 expression in prostate cancer (23.van der Heul-Nieuwenhuijsen L. Dits N. Van Ijcken W. de Lange D. Jenster G. The FOXF2 pathway in the human prostate stroma.Prostate. 2009; 69: 1538-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that Foxf2 decreases the size and frequency of colonic polyps in colon adenoma (24.Nik A.M. Reyahi A. Pontén F. Carlsson P.

Foxf2 has been further shown to mediate cardiac metabolism (25.Philip-Couderc P. Tavares N.I. Roatti A. Lerch R. Montessuit C. Baertschi A.J. Forkhead transcription factors coordinate expression of myocardial KATP channel subunits and energy metabolism.Circ. Res. 2008; 102: e20-e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and a W174R amino acid substitution has been shown to cause anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis in the eye (Foxf2W174R) (26.McKeone R. Vieira H. Gregory-Evans K. Gregory-Evans C.Y. Denny P. Foxf2: a novel locus for anterior segment dysgenesis adjacent to the Foxc1 gene.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e25489Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, molecular mechanisms for Foxf2 signaling in smooth muscle cells have not been previously elucidated due to lack of mouse models allowing conditional inactivation of Foxf2. In this study, we generated a novel Foxf2-floxed (Foxf2fl) mouse line to investigate the importance of Foxf2 in smooth muscle cells. By breeding these mice with smooth muscle myosin heavy chain-Cre mice (smMHC-Cre-eGFP) (27.Xin H.B. Deng K.Y. Rishniw M. Ji G. Kotlikoff M.I. Smooth muscle expression of Cre recombinase and eGFP in transgenic mice.Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 10: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we were able to efficiently delete Foxf2 from mature smooth muscle in the gut. Tg(smMHC-Cre-eGFP+/−);Foxf2−/− mice were viable and fertile. Juvenile mice showed no difference in size or morphology; however, adult Tg(smMHC-Cre-eGFP+/−);Foxf2−/− mice were significantly smaller in stature and had a significant decrease in the length of the GI tract (both large and small intestine). Adult mice had focal inflammatory regions in the small intestine and a significant increase in thickness of the smooth muscle and enteric neuron layers in the colon. We used colon smooth muscle from Tg(smMHC-Cre-eGFP+/−);Foxf2−/− mice and cultured Foxf2−/− smooth muscle cells to demonstrate that Foxf2 regulates the PDGF pathway and physically interacts with myocardin to inhibit SRF signaling in visceral smooth muscle cells. A LoxP site was inserted into the Foxf2 promoter via the Foxf2-targeting vector and the PGK-gb2 LoxP/FRT-flanked neomycin (neo) cassette was placed into the first intron (Fig. 1D). Electroporation of mouse ES cells (C57Bl/6 × 129/SVEV) with the Foxf2fl-targeting vector, following neo (G418) selection, was performed at the inGenious Targeting Laboratory (Stony Brook, NY). PCR analysis with multiple primer sets identified ES cells with the appropriate Foxf2fl-targeted locus. Foxf2fl ES cells were subsequently used to generate chimeric mice by injection into mouse blastocysts. Mice containing the Foxf2fl-targeted allele were determined by PCR amplification with primers flanking the LoxP sequence located in the Foxf2 promoter (P1 and P2) (Table 1) and primers located in the 3′ region of the Foxf2fl allele (P3 and P4). Chimeric mice were bred with C57Bl/6 mice in the animal facility at Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation to produce Foxf2fl/+ mice. The neo cassette was deleted by breeding Foxf2fl/+ mice with ACT-FLP1 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) (Fig. 1D). The loss of neo in Foxf2fl/+ mice was confirmed by PCR using P5 and P6 primers (Table 1) and sequencing of the Foxf2 locus using mouse tail DNA. Foxf2fl/+ mice were backcrossed to generate viable Foxf2fl/fl mice that were bred into the C57Bl/6 background for 10 generations. Deletion of the Foxf2fl alleles from visceral smooth muscle was accomplished through breeding with smooth muscle myosin heavy chain-Cre-eGFP (smMHC-Cre-eGFP) transgenic mice (C57Bl/6) (27.Xin H.B.

Colons and small intestines were separated at this time. Luminal contents were manually forced out by gentle manipulation with forceps. Tissues destined for immunohistochemistry were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde at this time. Tissues for whole organ RNA were placed in RNA-STAT-60. To enrich the smooth muscle layer of the colon, colons were split along their length and laid flat with the smooth muscle side down. A scalpel was then used to scrape away the epithelium and other layers leaving behind a smooth muscle enriched segment that was then placed in RNA-STAT-60 for RNA isolation or used for enzymatic digestion to prepare a single cell suspension as described previously (18.Hoggatt A.M.

https://openalex.org/W1976434062,"Introduction MicroRNAs play an important role in many human malignancies; so far, their expression remains to be studied in upper urinary tract urothelial cancer (UUTUC). Materials and Methods The expression of eleven microRNAs (miR-10a, miR-21, miR-96, miR-135, miR-141, miR-182, miR-200b, miR-205, miR-429, miR-520b, miR-1244) formerly shown to be upregulated in urothelial bladder cancer were studied in corresponding normal and cancerous tissue samples of patients undergoing nephroureterectomy for UUTUC. Upregulated microRNAs were then measured in serum samples of patients with UUTUC and patients with non-malignant urological diseases to evaluate their potential as non-invasive biomarkers for UUTUC. Results MicroRNA expression allowed differentiation of normal and cancerous tissue: miR-21, miR-96, miR-135, miR-141, miR-182, miR-205, miR-429 and miR-520b were significantly overexpressed. Furthermore, miR-205 was upregulated in poorly differentiated UUTUC. The analysis of circulating RNA in serum demonstrated an increase of miR-141 in patients with UUTUC; receiver operator characteristic analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.726 for miR-141 as a diagnostic biomarker. Furthermore, we observed lower levels of miR-10a and miR-135 in UUTUC patients. Conclusions MicroRNA expression is altered in UUTUC. The analysis of circulating miR-141 may be useful to identify patients with UUTUC."

It was aimed at supporting the regular and correct intake of medication. Demographic and health-related data were collected via an online questionnaire. This study analyzed captured data.App-related activities of 1799 users (1708 complete data sets) were recorded. 69% (1183/1708) applied ""Medication Plan"" for more than a day. 74% were male (872/1183), the median age 45 years. Variance analysis showed a significant effect of the users' age with respect to duration of usage (p = 0.025). While the mean duration of use was only 23.3 days for users younger than 21 years, for older users, there was a substantial increase over all age cohorts up to users of 60 years and above (103.9 days). Sex and educational status had no effect. ""Daily usage intensity"" was directly associated with an increasing number of prescribed medications and increased from an average of 1.87 uses per day and 1 drug per day to on average 3.71 uses per day for users stating to be taking more than 7 different drugs a day (p<0.001). Demographic predictors (sex, age and educational attainment) did not affect usage intensity.Users aged 60+ as well as those with complicated therapeutic drug regimens relied on the service we provided for more than three months on average.

https://openalex.org/W2002788486,"The newly recognized Konservat-Lagerstätte of Ettling (Bavaria), field site of the Jura-Museum Eichstätt (JME), is unique among Late Jurassic plattenkalk basins (Solnhofen region) in its abundant, extremely well preserved fossil vertebrates, almost exclusively fishes. We report actinopterygians (ginglymodins, pycnodontiforms, halecomorphs, aspidorynchiforms, “pholidophoriforms,” teleosts); turtles; and non-vertebrates (echinoderms, arthropods, brachiopods, mollusks, jellyfish, sponges, biomats, plants) in a current faunal list. Ettling has yielded several new fish species (Bavarichthys incognitus; Orthogonikleithrus hoelli; Aspidorhynchus sanzenbacheri; Macrosemimimus fegerti). Upper and lower Ettling strata differ in faunal content, with the lower dominated by the small teleost Orthogonikleithrus hoelli (absent from the upper layers, where other prey fishes, Leptolepides sp. and Tharsis sp., occur instead). Pharyngeal and stomach contents of Ettling fishes provide direct evidence that Orthogonikleithrus hoelli was a primary food source during early Ettling times. Scarcity of ammonites and absence of vampyromorph coleoids at Ettling differ markedly from the situation at other nearby localities in the region (e.g., Eichstätt, Painten, Schamhaupten, the Mörnsheim beds), where they are more common. Although the exact biochronological age of Ettling remains uncertain (lack of suitable index fossils), many Ettling fishes occur in other plattenkalk basins of Germany (e.g., Kelheim) and France (Cerin) dated as Late Kimmeridgian to Early Tithonian (eigeltingense horizon), suggesting a comparable geologic age. The Ettling deposits represent an independent basin within the larger Upper Jurassic “Solnhofen Archipelago”, a shallow subtropical sea containing scattered islands, sponge-microbial and coral reefs, sandbars, and deeper basins on a vast carbonate platform along the northern margin of the Tethys Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2133546663,"While embodied approaches of cognition have proved to be successful in explaining concrete concepts and words, they have more difficulties in accounting for abstract concepts and words, and several proposals have been put forward. This work aims to test the Words As Tools proposal, according to which both abstract and concrete concepts are grounded in perception, action and emotional systems, but linguistic information is more important for abstract than for concrete concept representation, due to the different ways they are acquired: while for the acquisition of the latter linguistic information might play a role, for the acquisition of the former it is instead crucial. We investigated the acquisition of concrete and abstract concepts and words, and verified its impact on conceptual representation. In Experiment 1, participants explored and categorized novel concrete and abstract entities, and were taught a novel label for each category. Later they performed a categorical recognition task and an image-word matching task to verify a) whether and how the introduction of language changed the previously formed categories, b) whether language had a major weight for abstract than for concrete words representation, and c) whether this difference had consequences on bodily responses. The results confirm that, even though both concrete and abstract concepts are grounded, language facilitates the acquisition of the latter and plays a major role in their representation, resulting in faster responses with the mouth, typically associated with language production. Experiment 2 was a rating test aiming to verify whether the findings of Experiment 1 were simply due to heterogeneity, i.e. to the fact that the members of abstract categories were more heterogeneous than those of concrete categories. The results confirmed the effectiveness of our operationalization, showing that abstract concepts are more associated with the mouth and concrete ones with the hand, independently from heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2171311847,"Acute responses to intense stressors can give rise to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD diagnostic criteria include trauma exposure history and self-reported symptoms. Individuals who meet PTSD diagnostic criteria often meet criteria for additional psychiatric diagnoses. Biomarkers promise to contribute to reliable phenotypes of PTSD and comorbidities by linking biological system alterations to behavioral symptoms. Here we have analyzed unbiased plasma metabolomics and other stress effects in a mouse model with behavioral features of PTSD. In this model, C57BL/6 mice are repeatedly exposed to a trained aggressor mouse (albino SJL) using a modified, resident-intruder, social defeat paradigm. Our recent studies using this model found that aggressor-exposed mice exhibited acute stress effects including changed behaviors, body weight gain, increased body temperature, as well as inflammatory and fibrotic histopathologies and transcriptomic changes of heart tissue. Some of these acute stress effects persisted, reminiscent of PTSD. Here we report elevated proteins in plasma that function in inflammation and responses to oxidative stress and damaged tissue at 24 hrs post-stressor. Additionally at this acute time point, transcriptomic analysis indicated liver inflammation. The unbiased metabolomics analysis showed altered metabolites in plasma at 24 hrs that only partially normalized toward control levels after stress-withdrawal for 1.5 or 4 wks. In particular, gut-derived metabolites were altered at 24 hrs post-stressor and remained altered up to 4 wks after stress-withdrawal. Also at the 4 wk time point, hyperlipidemia and suppressed metabolites of amino acids and carbohydrates in plasma coincided with transcriptomic indicators of altered liver metabolism (activated xenobiotic and lipid metabolism). Collectively, these system-wide sequelae to repeated intense stress suggest that the simultaneous perturbed functioning of multiple organ systems (e.g., brain, heart, intestine and liver) can interact to produce injuries that lead to chronic metabolic changes and disorders that have been associated with PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2021050982,"Inflammation in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a prominent, but incompletely characterized feature in early stages of the disease. The goal of these studies was to determine the circulating levels, clinical correlates and biological effects of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA), a marker of inflammation, in patients with SSc. Circulating levels of SAA were determined by multiplex assays in serum from 129 SSc patients and 98 healthy controls. Correlations between SAA levels and clinical and laboratory features of disease were analyzed. The effects of SAA on human pulmonary fibroblasts were studied ex vivo. Elevated levels of SAA were found in 25% of SSc patients, with the highest levels in those with early-stage disease and diffuse cutaneous involvement. Significant negative correlations of SAA were found with forced vital capacity and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. Patients with elevated SAA had greater dyspnea and more frequent interstitial lung disease, and had worse scores on patient-reported outcome measures. Incubation with recombinant SAA induced dose-dependent stimulation of IL-6 and IL-8 in normal lung fibroblasts in culture. Serum levels of the inflammatory marker SAA are elevated in patients with early diffuse cutaneous SSc, and correlate with pulmonary involvement. In lung fibroblasts, SAA acts as a direct stimulus for increased cytokine production. These findings suggest that systemic inflammation in SSc may be linked to lung involvement and SAA could serve as a potential biomarker for this complication."
https://openalex.org/W1989262406,"In a previous study, six virulent bacteriophages PAK_P1, PAK_P2, PAK_P3, PAK_P4, PAK_P5 and CHA_P1 were evaluated for their in vivo efficacy in treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections using a mouse model of lung infection. Here, we show that their genomes are closely related to five other Pseudomonas phages and allow a subdivision into two clades, PAK_P1-like and KPP10-like viruses, based on differences in genome size, %GC and genomic contents, as well as number of tRNAs. These two clades are well delineated, with a mean of 86% and 92% of proteins considered homologous within individual clades, and 25% proteins considered homologous between the two clades. By ESI-MS/MS analysis we determined that their virions are composed of at least 25 different proteins and electron microscopy revealed a morphology identical to the hallmark Salmonella phage Felix O1. A search for additional bacteriophage homologs, using profiles of protein families defined from the analysis of the 11 genomes, identified 10 additional candidates infecting hosts from different species. By carrying out a phylogenetic analysis using these 21 genomes we were able to define a new subfamily of viruses, the Felixounavirinae within the Myoviridae family. The new Felixounavirinae subfamily includes three genera: Felixounalikevirus, PAK_P1likevirus and KPP10likevirus. Sequencing genomes of bacteriophages with therapeutic potential increases the quantity of genomic data on closely related bacteriophages, leading to establishment of new taxonomic clades and the development of strategies for analyzing viral genomes as presented in this article."
https://openalex.org/W2092860021,"Recent work has suggested that punishment is detrimental because punishment provokes retaliation, not cooperation, resulting in lower overall payoffs. These findings may stem from the unrealistic assumption that all players are equal: in reality individuals are expected to vary in the power with which they can punish defectors. Here, we allowed strong players to interact with weak players in an iterated prisoner's dilemma game with punishment. Defecting players were most likely to switch to cooperation if the partner cooperated: adding punishment yielded no additional benefit and, under some circumstances, increased the chance that the partner would both defect and retaliate against the punisher. Our findings show that, in a two-player game, cooperation begets cooperation and that punishment does not seem to yield any additional benefits. Further work should explore whether strong punishers might prevail in multi-player games."
https://openalex.org/W1993316345,"During the last few years theoretical works have shed new light and proposed new hypotheses on the mechanisms which regulate the spatio-temporal behaviour of phytoplankton communities in marine pelagic ecosystems. Despite this, relevant physical and biological issues, such as effects of the time-dependent mixing in the upper layer, competition between groups, and dynamics of non-stationary deep chlorophyll maxima, are still open questions. In this work, we analyze the spatio-temporal behaviour of five phytoplankton populations in a real marine ecosystem by using a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion-taxis model. The study is performed, taking into account the seasonal variations of environmental variables, such as light intensity, thickness of upper mixed layer and profiles of vertical turbulent diffusivity, obtained starting from experimental findings. Theoretical distributions of phytoplankton cell concentration was converted in chlorophyll concentration, and compared with the experimental profiles measured in a site of the Tyrrhenian Sea at four different times (seasons) of the year, during four different oceanographic cruises. As a result we find a good agreement between theoretical and experimental distributions of chlorophyll concentration. In particular, theoretical results reveal that the seasonal changes of environmental variables play a key role in the phytoplankton distribution and determine the properties of the deep chlorophyll maximum. This study could be extended to other marine ecosystems to predict future changes in the phytoplankton biomass due to global warming, in view of devising strategies to prevent the decline of the primary production and the consequent decrease of fish species."
https://openalex.org/W99737864,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the only current anabolic treatment for osteoporosis in the United States. PTH stimulates expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) in bone. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD-dependent deacetylase, participates in a variety of human diseases. Here we identify a role for SIRT1 in the action of PTH in osteoblasts. We observed increased Mmp13 mRNA expression and protein levels in bone from Sirt1 knock-out mice compared with wild type mice. PTH-induced Mmp13 expression was significantly blocked by the SIRT1 activator, resveratrol, in osteoblastic UMR 106-01 cells. In contrast, the SIRT1 inhibitor, EX527, significantly enhanced PTH-induced Mmp13 expression. Two h of PTH treatment augmented SIRT1 association with c-Jun, a component of the transcription factor complex, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and promoted SIRT1 association with the AP-1 site of the Mmp13 promoter. This binding was further increased by resveratrol, implicating SIRT1 as a feedback inhibitor regulating Mmp13 transcription. The AP-1 site of the Mmp13 promoter is required for PTH stimulation of Mmp13 transcriptional activity. When the AP-1 site was mutated, EX527 was unable to increase PTH-stimulated Mmp13 promoter activity, indicating a role for the AP-1 site in SIRT1 inhibition. We further showed that SIRT1 deacetylates c-Jun and that the cAMP pathway participates in this deacetylation process. These data indicate that SIRT1 is a negative regulator of MMP13 expression, SIRT1 activation inhibits PTH stimulation of Mmp13 expression, and this regulation is mediated by SIRT1 association with c-Jun at the AP-1 site of the Mmp13 promoter.

It is critical for endochondral ossification and bone formation because Mmp13 knock-out mice have delayed endochondral bone formation, vascularization of their primary ossification centers, and ossification (7.Inada M.

We and others found that the AP-1 transcription complex is essential to the process of PTH stimulation of Mmp13 gene expression. In response to PTH, Mmp13 gene transcription was significantly attenuated by mutation of AP-1 binding sites (12.Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C.

HDACs are a class of enzymes that remove acetyl groups from an ϵ-N-acetyl lysine amino acid on a histone, thus regulating gene expression. SIRT1 is one of the class III HDACs, being an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase. Mammals have seven sirtuins (SIRT1–7) (16.Guarente L. Sirtuins, aging, and medicine.N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 364: 2235-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Of the seven sirtuins, SIRT1 has been the most investigated. SIRT1 targets not only histones but also a variety of other proteins. Sirtuins have been identified as a family of antiaging genes and have been shown to increase lifespan in lower organisms. SIRT1 activity declines with age (17.Massudi H. Grant R. Braidy N. Guest J. Farnsworth B. Guillemin G.J. Age-associated changes in oxidative stress and NAD+ metabolism in human tissue.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e42357Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), suggesting the association of SIRT1 with age-related diseases. One of the age-related diseases is bone loss. Therefore, it is likely that SIRT1 functions in bone. Indeed, SIRT1 is expressed in osteoblasts (18.Edwards J.R. Perrien D.S. Fleming N. Nyman J.S.

These observations are the compelling systematic biological rationale for our focus on SIRT1 in bone. In the present study, we determined the function of SIRT1 in the action of PTH stimulation of MMP13 transcription in osteoblasts. We propose that SIRT1 negatively regulates this process. Indeed, we found that SIRT1 activation blocked, whereas SIRT1 inhibition or deletion enhanced, PTH stimulation of Mmp13 mRNA. This regulation is in part mediated by SIRT1 association with Jun at the AP-1 site of the Mmp13 promoter. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of New York University and Ottawa Health Research Center Institute. One-month-old wild type C57BL/6 mice were utilized to isolate primary osteoblasts from cortical bone chips, and nine mice were utilized in these experiments. Sirt1-deficient mice on C57BL/6 genetic background were kindly provided by Dr. Michael W. McBurney at Ottawa Health Research Center Institute. RNA extractions were from frozen femurs of 2.5–7-month-old Sirt1+/+ and Sirt1−/− male and female mice (25.McBurney M.W. Yang X. Jardine K. Hixon M. Boekelheide K. Webb J.R. Lansdorp P.M. Lemieux M. The mammalian SIR2α protein has a role in embryogenesis and gametogenesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 38-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Four Sirt1+/+ and 10 Sirt1−/− mice were utilized for RNA analysis. Two mice per group were utilized for histology and protein extraction, respectively. Histology sections and protein extractions were from femora and tibiae of 3-month-old female Sirt1+/+ and Sirt1−/− mice. Primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were isolated from 1-month-old Sirt1 osteoblast-specific knock-out (Sirt1Ob−/−) and control Sirt1flox/flox (Sirt1fl/fl) male mice. Sirt1Ob−/− and Sirt1fl/fl mice for experiments are offspring from a breeding unit of Sirt1fl/fl (female) and Col1a12.3kb-CreTg/−;Sirt1fl/fl (male) transgenic mice. Col1a12.3kb-CreTg/−;Sirt1fl/fl were offspring from a breeding pair of Col1a12.3kb-CreTg/−;Sirt1fl/+ (male) and Sirt1fl/fl (female); Col1a12.3kb-CreTg/−;Sirt1fl/+ were from a breeding pair of Col1a12.3kb-CreTg/Tg (male) and Sirt1fl/fl (female). The Col1a12.3kb-Cre mice were kindly provided by Dr. Jennifer Westendorf (Mayo Clinic), and the 2.3-kb Col1a1 promoter is selectively expressed in committed osteoblasts (26.Liu F. Woitge H.W.

All mice were on a C57BL/6 genetic background. Genotyping was performed using tail DNA with three primers: flox, 5′-GGT TGA CTT AGG TCT TGT CTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGT CCC TTG TAA TGT TTC CC-3′ (reverse); Sirt1, 5′-GCCCATTAAAGCAGTATGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATGTAATCTCAACCTTGAG-3′ (reverse); and Cre, 5′-AAC CTG AAG ATG TTC GCG AT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACC GTC AGT ACG TGA GAT ATC-3′ (reverse). Total RNA was extracted from the metaphyseal region of the femurs or from cultured cells utilizing TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA (0.3 μg) was reverse transcribed with TaqMan® Reverse Transcription Reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix in a Mastercycler® ep realplex instrument (Eppendorf). Relative mRNA expression was calculated using a formula reported previously (28.Pfaffl M. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25420) Google Scholar). The levels of mRNAs were normalized to β-actin and then expressed as relative mRNA values. The mouse-specific primers were as follows: β-actin, 5′-TCC TCC TGA GCG CAA GTA CTC T-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGG ACT CAT CGT ACT CCT GCT T-3′ (reverse); Mmp13, 5′-GCC CTG ATG TTT CCC ATC TA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTT TGG GAT GCT TAG GGT TG-3′ (reverse); osteocalcin, 5′-TAGTGAACAGACTCCGGCGCTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTAGGCGGTCTTCAAGCCAT-3′ (reverse); bone sialoprotein, 5′-ACACCCCAAGCACAGACTTTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCTCGTCGCTTTCCTTCACT-3′ (reverse). The rat osteoblastic UMR 106-01 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary osteoblasts were isolated from bone chips of femora/tibiae of 1-month-old male wild type mice and were cultured in α-MEM plus 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 100-mm dishes. At confluence, the cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well of 6-well plates. After reaching 90% confluence, cells were changed to medium with 0% FBS and treated with 10 μm EX527 or vehicle overnight. The next day, cells were treated with 10−8 m PTH or vehicle for 2 h before total protein was extracted or 4 h before RNA extraction. Resveratrol was added to the cells alone or together with PTH post-serum starvation. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. BMSCs isolated from 1-month-old male Sirt1Ob−/− and control Sirt1flox/flox (Sirt1fl/fl) mice were plated in 6-well plates at 107 cells/well. BMSCs were grown in proliferation medium (α-MEM plus 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) for 12 days and then switched to osteoblast differentiation medium (α-MEM plus 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10−8 m dexamethasone, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 8 mm β-glycerophosphate) for 10 days. Cells were changed to medium with 0% FBS overnight before EX527 (1 μm) and PTH (10−8 m) treatment. After 4 h of treatment, RNAs were extracted and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. For luciferase assays, UMR 106-01 cells were plated in 12-well plates overnight before transfecting with either wild type Mmp13 promoter construct (100 ng/well in 12-well plates) or Mmp13 promoter construct with mutation of the AP-1 site (12.Selvamurugan N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were serum-deprived overnight. Cells were then either pretreated with resveratrol for 2 h or with EX527 overnight before PTH (10−8 m for resveratrol experiments, 10−9 m for EX527 experiments, rat PTH(1–34); Sigma) treatment for 6 h. Our previous studies have shown that 10−8 m PTH elicits the maximal stimulation of Mmp13 gene expression (6.Scott D.K. Brakenhoff K.D. Clohisy J.C. Quinn C.O. Partridge N.C.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2153-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Because we expected an enhancement of Mmp13 gene expression after co-treatment with PTH and SIRT1 inhibitor, we decided to use 10−9 m PTH in the EX527 experiment. The cell lysates were harvested and analyzed immediately for luciferase activity with the luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and an OptiCompII luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc., Hamden, CT). Luciferase activity was normalized to the amount of protein, which was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. UMR 106-01 cells were treated with medium (control) or PTH (10−8 m) and/or resveratrol (4.5 μm) for 4 h. The cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with medium containing 0.8% formaldehyde solution. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors and 1 mm formaldehyde and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. The samples were then sonicated to reduce the DNA length to 0.5–1 kbp. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted 10-fold in buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). For PCR analysis, aliquots (1:100) of total chromatin were saved before immunoprecipitation. Prior to chromatin precipitation, the samples were precleared with 80 μl of a 25% (v/v) suspension of DNA-coated protein A/G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibody (anti-SIRT1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) or with IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a negative control for ChIP analysis overnight at 4 °C. For ChIP-reChIP assays, the immunoprecipitated complexes obtained by ChIP with anti-c-Jun antibody (Cell Signaling) were eluted in ChIP elution buffer and then diluted 5-fold and subjected to the ChIP procedure with anti-SIRT1 (Abcam) or IgG as negative control. Then the DNA was subjected to PCR with primers −84/−2 that amplified the AP-1 site of the rat Mmp13 promoter, 5′-ACTCACTAGGAAGTGAACAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCCAGGGCAAGCATTCTCTA-3′ (reverse) (13.Boumah C.E.

Data are shown as -fold change compared with the IgG control samples. For protein immunoprecipitation, UMR 106-01 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes. After reaching 90% confluence, cells were serum-deprived overnight. The cells were then treated with 10−8 m PTH for 4 h. At the end of the culture, whole cell lysates were harvested with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) and were incubated in RIPA buffer for 15 min at 4 °C before centrifuging for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were measured in the supernatants by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The lysates were precleared with IgG for 30 min at 4 °C, and then equal amounts of protein lysates were incubated with anti-c-Jun antibody (0.5 μg of antibody/1 mg of total protein; BD Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The lysates were then incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h before centrifugation at 2,500 rpm at 4 °C to pull down the immunoprecipitation complexes. The beads were washed with RIPA buffer three times and were then boiled in SDS loading buffer for 5 min. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dried milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-SIRT1 (1:2,000; Abcam) or anti-c-Jun (1:2,000; BD Biosciences). Membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min at room temperature. Blots were developed with Super Signal reagents (Thermo Scientific). For c-Jun acetylation experiments, HEK293 cells were plated overnight and then transfected with c-Jun with Sirt1 or vector FLAG plasmids. p300 plasmids were co-transfected to increase c-Jun acetylation (29.Zhang J. Lee S.-M. Shannon S. Gao B. Chen W. Chen A. Divekar R. McBurney M.W. Braley-Mullen H. Zaghouani H. Fang D. The type III histone deacetylase Sirt1 is essential for maintenance of T cell tolerance in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3048-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To detect c-Jun acetylation in UMR osteoblastic cells, cells were transfected with c-Jun together with p300 on the second day of cell plating. Two hundred ng of each plasmid was transfected in 10-mm culture dishes. All transfections were facilitated with GeneJammer Transfection Reagent (Agilent Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions. Sirt1 and vector FLAG plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Paolo Sassone-Corsi (University of California). p300 plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Deyu Fang (Northwestern University) and c-Jun was from Dr. Michael J. Birrer (Massachusetts General Hospital). Seventy-two h post-transfection, cells were changed to serum-free medium, which additionally contained the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (Sigma) at 400 nm and the SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide (Sigma) at 20 mm. The next day, cells were treated with 8-bromo-cAMP (0.2 mm; Sigma) for 2 h for HEK cells or 10−8 m PTH or vehicle for 2 h for UMR cells, and whole cell lysates were harvested with RIPA buffer. RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) was freshly made and had 1 mm DTT (Sigma), 400 nm trichostatin A, and 10 mm nicotinamide. Supernatants were precleared with IgG at 4 °C for 15 min and then incubated with anti-c-Jun antibody (0.5 μg of antibody/1 mg of total protein; BD Biosciences) for 1 h, followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, dissolved with 4× Laemmli's buffer, and boiled for 5 min. After SDS-PAGE fractionation and transfer to PVDF membranes, they were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dried milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with acetylated lysine antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling). Blots were developed with SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). Membranes were then blotted with anti-c-Jun (1:2000; BD Biosciences). To detect MMP13 protein in bone, Western blots were performed with protein extracted from the whole bones of femur and tibia (including marrow) from 3-month-old female mice (n = 2). Membranes were first blotted with the MMP13 antibody (Abcam), and then blots were reprobed with β-actin antibody (Cell Signaling). Western blot bands were analyzed by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For histological analysis, femora and tibiae were harvested from 3-month-old female Sirt1+/+ and Sirt1−/− mice. Samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and decalcified in 10% EDTA, pH 7.5, for 4 weeks at 4 °C. Samples were soaked in 10% sucrose for 2 h, 20% sucrose for 6 h, and then 30% sucrose overnight; embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound; and frozen. The sections (10 μm) were cut longitudinally to the femur and tibia. To evaluate the localization and protein levels of MMP13, we performed immunohistochemical staining by the ABC staining system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The sections were washed with PBS and then immersed in methanol containing 1% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were then blocked with 2% blocking serum and then with anti-MMP13 rabbit antibody (Abcam) at 4 °C overnight. Sections were then washed three times and incubated with biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG at room temperature for 30 min. Control reactions were performed by omitting primary antibody. Sections were mounted with Cytoseal 60"
https://openalex.org/W2002875742,"Coral reefs have evolved with a crucial symbiosis between photosynthetic dinoflagellates (genus Symbiodinium) and their cnidarian hosts (Scleractinians). Most coral larvae take up Symbiodinium from their environment; however, the earliest steps in this process have been elusive. Here we demonstrate that the disaccharide trehalose may be an important signal from the symbiont to potential larval hosts. Symbiodinium freshly isolated from Fungia scutaria corals constantly released trehalose (but not sucrose, maltose or glucose) into seawater, and released glycerol only in the presence of coral tissue. Spawning Fungia adults increased symbiont number in their immediate area by excreting pellets of Symbiodinium, and when these naturally discharged Symbiodinium were cultured, they also released trehalose. In Y-maze experiments, coral larvae demonstrated chemoattractant and feeding behaviors only towards a chamber with trehalose or glycerol. Concomitantly, coral larvae and adult tissue, but not symbionts, had significant trehalase enzymatic activities, suggesting the capacity to utilize trehalose. Trehalase activity was developmentally regulated in F. scutaria larvae, rising as the time for symbiont uptake occurs. Consistent with the enzymatic assays, gene finding demonstrated the presence of a trehalase enzyme in the genome of a related coral, Acropora digitifera, and a likely trehalase in the transcriptome of F. scutaria. Taken together, these data suggest that adult F. scutaria seed the reef with Symbiodinium during spawning and the exuded Symbiodinium release trehalose into the environment, which acts as a chemoattractant for F. scutaria larvae and as an initiator of feeding behavior- the first stages toward establishing the coral-Symbiodinium relationship. Because trehalose is a fixed carbon compound, this cue would accurately demonstrate to the cnidarian larvae the photosynthetic ability of the potential symbiont in the ambient environment. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a chemical cue attracting the motile coral larvae to the symbiont."
https://openalex.org/W2006879001,"Nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase NadD is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of the NAD cofactor, which has been implicated as a target for developing new antimycobacterial therapies. Here we report the crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis NadD (MtNadD) at a resolution of 2.4 Å. A remarkable new feature of the MtNadD structure, compared with other members of this enzyme family, is a 310 helix that locks the active site in an over-closed conformation. As a result, MtNadD is rendered inactive as it is topologically incompatible with substrate binding and catalysis. Directed mutagenesis was also used to further dissect the structural elements that contribute to the interactions of the two MtNadD substrates, i.e. ATP and nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). For inhibitory profiling of partially active mutants and wild type MtNadD, we used a small molecule inhibitor of MtNadD with moderate affinity (Ki ∼ 25 μm) and antimycobacterial activity (MIC80) ∼ 40–80 μm). This analysis revealed interferences with some of the residues in the NaMN binding subsite consistent with the competitive inhibition observed for the NaMN substrate (but not ATP). A detailed steady-state kinetic analysis of MtNadD suggests that ATP must first bind to allow efficient NaMN binding and catalysis. This sequential mechanism is consistent with the requirement of transition to catalytically competent (open) conformation hypothesized from structural modeling. A possible physiological significance of this mechanism is to enable the down-regulation of NAD synthesis under ATP-limiting dormancy conditions. These findings point to a possible new strategy for designing inhibitors that lock the enzyme in the inactive over-closed conformation.

https://openalex.org/W1969189095,"Background Mutations in the ABL kinase domain and SH3-SH2 domain of the BCR/ABL gene and amplification of the Philadelphia chromosome are the two important BCR/ABL dependent mechanisms of imatinib resistance. Here, we intended to study the role played by TKI, imatinib, in selection of gene mutations and development of chromosomal abnormalities in Indian CML patients. Methods Direct sequencing methodology was employed to detect mutations and conventional cytogenetics was done to identify Philadelphia duplication. Results Among the different mechanisms of imatinib resistance, kinase domain mutations (39%) of the BCR/ABL gene were seen to be more prevalent, followed by mutations in the SH3-SH2 domain (4%) and then BCR/ABL amplification with the least frequency (1%). The median duration of occurrence of mutation was significantly shorter for patients with front line imatinib than those pre-treated with hydroxyurea. Patients with high Sokal score (p = 0.003) showed significantly higher incidence of mutations, as compared to patients with low/intermediate score. Impact of mutations on the clinical outcome in AP and BC was observed to be insignificant. Of the 94 imatinib resistant patients, only 1 patient exhibited duplication of Philadelphia chromosome, suggesting a less frequent occurrence of this abnormality in Indian CML patients. Conclusion Close monitoring at regular intervals and proper analysis of the disease resistance would facilitate early detection of resistance and thus aid in the selection of the most appropriate therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2051881177,"The transition from terrestrial ancestry to a fully pelagic life profoundly altered the body systems of cetaceans, with extreme morphological changes in the skull and feeding apparatus. The Oligocene Epoch was a crucial time in the evolution of cetaceans when the ancestors of modern whales and dolphins (Neoceti) underwent major diversification, but details of dental structure and evolution are poorly known for the archaeocete-neocete transition. We report the morphology of teeth and ultrastructure of enamel in archaeocetes, and fossil platanistoids and delphinoids, ranging from late Oligocene (Waitaki Valley, New Zealand) to Pliocene (Caldera, Chile). Teeth were embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned in cross and longitudinal planes, polished, etched, and coated with gold palladium for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. SEM images showed that in archaeocetes, squalodontids and Prosqualodon (taxa with heterodont and nonpolydont/limited polydont teeth), the inner enamel was organized in Hunter-Schreger bands (HSB) with an outer layer of radial enamel. This is a common pattern in most large-bodied mammals and it is regarded as a biomechanical adaptation related to food processing and crack resistance. Fossil Otekaikea sp. and delphinoids, which were polydont and homodont, showed a simpler structure, with inner radial and outer prismless enamel. Radial enamel is regarded as more wear-resistant and has been retained in several mammalian taxa in which opposing tooth surfaces slide over each other. These observations suggest that the transition from a heterodont and nonpolydont/limited polydont dentition in archaeocetes and early odontocetes, to homodont and polydont teeth in crownward odontocetes, was also linked to a marked simplification in the enamel Schmelzmuster. These patterns probably reflect functional shifts in food processing from shear-and-mastication in archaeocetes and early odontocetes, to pierce-and-grasp occlusion in crownward odontocetes, with the implication of less demanding feeding biomechanics as seen in most extant odontocetes."
https://openalex.org/W2056261530,"This study is the first to partially quantify the potential economic benefits that a vaccine, effective at protecting cattle against malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), could accrue to pastoralists living in East Africa. The benefits would result from the removal of household resource and management costs that are traditionally incurred avoiding the disease. MCF, a fatal disease of cattle caused by a virus transmitted from wildebeest calves, has plagued Maasai communities in East Africa for generations. The threat of the disease forces the Maasai to move cattle to less productive grazing areas to avoid wildebeest during calving season when forage quality is critical. To assess the management and resource costs associated with moving, we used household survey data. To estimate the costs associated with changes in livestock body condition that result from being herded away from wildebeest calving grounds, we exploited an ongoing MCF vaccine field trial and we used a hedonic price regression, a statistical model that allows estimation of the marginal contribution of a good's attributes to its market price. We found that 90 percent of households move, on average, 82 percent of all cattle away from home to avoid MCF. In doing so, a herd's productive contributions to the household was reduced, with 64 percent of milk being unavailable for sale or consumption by the family members remaining at the boma (the children, women, and the elderly). In contrast cattle that remained on the wildebeest calving grounds during the calving season (and survived MCF) remained fully productive to the family and gained body condition compared to cattle that moved away. This gain was, however, short-lived. We estimated the market value of these condition gains and losses using hedonic regression. The value of a vaccine for MCF is the removal of the costs incurred in avoiding the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1977012174,"Cancer cell motility is a key phenomenon regulating invasion and metastasis. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays a major role in cellular adhesion and metastasis of various cancers. The relationship between dietary supplementation of calcium and colon cancer has been extensively investigated. However, the effect of calcium (Ca2+) supplementation on calpain-FAK-motility is not clearly understood. We sought to identify the mechanism of FAK cleavage through Ca2+ bound lactate (CaLa), its downstream signaling and role in the motility of human colon cancer cells. We found that treating HCT116 and HT-29 cells with CaLa immediately increased the intracellular Ca2+ (iCa2+) levels for a prolonged period of time. Ca2+ influx induced cleavage of FAK into an N-terminal FAK (FERM domain) in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylated FAK (p-FAK) was also cleaved in to its p-N-terminal FAK. CaLa increased colon cancer cells motility. Calpeptin, a calpain inhibitor, reversed the effects of CaLa on FAK and pFAK cleavage in both cancer cell lines. The cleaved FAK translocates into the nucleus and modulates p53 stability through MDM2-associated ubiquitination. CaLa-induced Ca2+ influx increased the motility of colon cancer cells was mediated by calpain activity through FAK and pFAK protein destabilization. In conclusion, these results suggest that careful consideration may be given in deciding dietary Ca2+ supplementation to patient undergoing treatment for metastatic cancer."

Our results show that the more proficient children are in understanding spatial locatives the more they are able to learn pathways, retrieve them after a delay and represent them on a map when landmarks are present in the environment. These findings suggest that spatial language is crucial when individuals rely on sequences of landmarks to drive their navigation towards a given goal but that it is not involved when navigational representations based on the geometrical shape of the environment or the coding of body movements are sufficient for memorizing and recalling short pathways."

In this study, three multiplex PCR assays able to specifically detect these 21 serogroups were developed and validated. For this purpose, the O-antigen gene clusters of E. coli O5 and O76 were fully sequenced, their associated genes were identified on the basis of homology, and serogroup-specific primers were designed. After preliminary evaluation, these two primer pairs were proven to be highly specific and suitable for the development of PCR assays for O5 and O76 serogroup identification. Specific primers were also designed for serogroups O15, O45, O55, O91, O104, O113, O118, O123, O128, O146, O157, O165, O172, and O177 based on previously published sequences, and previously published specific primers for serogroups O26, O103, O111, O121, and O145 were also included. These 21 primer pairs were shown to be specific for their target serogroup when tested against E. coli type strains representing 169 known O-antigen forms of E. coli and Shigella and therefore suitable for being used in PCR assays for serogroup identification. In order to validate the three multiplex PCR assays, 22 E. coli strains belonging to the 21 covered serogroups and 18 E. coli strains belonging to other serogroups were screened in a double-blind test and their sensitivity was determined as 1 ng chromosomal DNA. The PCR assays developed in this study could be a faster, simpler, and less expensive strategy for serotyping of the most clinically relevant STEC strains in both clinical microbiology and public health laboratories, and so their development could benefit for clinical diagnosis, epidemiological investigations, surveillance, and control of STEC infections."
https://openalex.org/W2005449455,"The amygdala has been regarded as a key substrate for emotion processing. However, the engagement of the left and right amygdala during the early perceptual processing of different emotional faces remains unclear. We investigated the temporal profiles of oscillatory gamma activity in the amygdala and effective connectivity of the amygdala with the thalamus and cortical areas during implicit emotion-perceptual tasks using event-related magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found that within 100 ms after stimulus onset the right amygdala habituated to emotional faces rapidly (with duration around 20–30 ms), whereas activity in the left amygdala (with duration around 50–60 ms) sustained longer than that in the right. Our data suggest that the right amygdala could be linked to autonomic arousal generated by facial emotions and the left amygdala might be involved in decoding or evaluating expressive faces in the early perceptual emotion processing. The results of effective connectivity provide evidence that only negative emotional processing engages both cortical and subcortical pathways connected to the right amygdala, representing its evolutional significance (survival). These findings demonstrate the asymmetric engagement of bilateral amygdala in emotional face processing as well as the capability of MEG for assessing thalamo-cortico-limbic circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2068603497,"During injury, cells are vulnerable to apoptosis from a variety of stress conditions including DNA damage causing double-stranded breaks. Without repair, these breaks lead to aberrations in DNA replication and transcription, leading to apoptosis. A major response to DNA damage is provided by the protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) that is capable of commanding a plethora of signaling networks for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and even apoptosis. A key element in the DNA damage response is the mobilization of activating proteins into the cell nucleus to repair damaged DNA. BRAT1 is one of these proteins, and it functions as an activator of ATM by maintaining its phosphorylated status while also keeping other phosphatases at bay. However, it is unknown how BRAT1 is trafficked into the cell nucleus to maintain ATM phosphorylation. Here we demonstrate that Ndfip1-mediated ubiquitination of BRAT1 leads to BRAT1 trafficking into the cell nucleus. Without Ndfip1, BRAT1 failed to translocate to the nucleus. Under genotoxic stress, cells showed increased expression of both Ndfip1 and phosphorylated ATM. Following brain injury, neurons show increased expression of Ndfip1 and nuclear translocation of BRAT1.

Following traumatic injury or stroke, neurons in affected brain tissues undergo apoptosis, whereas others adopt defense strategies to stay alive (1Loane D.J. Faden A.I. Neuroprotection for traumatic brain injury: translational challenges and emerging therapeutic strategies.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 31: 596-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Neuronal apoptosis occurs mostly in tissues surrounding the damaged core and can continue for days during the secondary phase of injury. During this phase, cytotoxic factors are released in response to glutamate excitotoxicity, inflammation, and hypoxia. The injury process also dramatically increases DNA damage and production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in excess redox activity and oxidative stress (2Lewén A. Matz P. Chan P.H. Free radical pathways in CNS injury.J. Neurotrauma. 2000; 17: 871-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The resulting free radicals inflict damage to cell membranes and produce detrimental reactions with proteins, lipids, and DNA, resulting in cell death (3Hall E.D. Andrus P.K. Yonkers P.A. Brain hydroxyl radical generation in acute experimental head injury.J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A central line of defense to sudden DNA damage and oxidative stress is activation of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) protein for DNA repair. This kinase is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase family of Ser/Thr-protein kinases and a key player in redox homeostasis and the DNA damage response (4Ditch S. Paull T.T. The ATM protein kinase and cellular redox signaling: beyond the DNA damage response.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 15-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Following double-strand DNA breaks and oxidation, ATM is recruited and activated by cell sensor proteins, including the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex for DNA repair by homologous end joining (5You Z.

ATM mobilization and activation at sites of broken DNA requires the participation of multiple sensor proteins. Aside from the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex, a number of other sensor proteins have been identified including TP53BP1 (p53-binding protein 1), BRCA1 (breast cancer type 1), and MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1) (6Shiloh Y.

Given the importance of the DNA damage response following injury, we set out to investigate whether or not Ndfip1 is a participant in the ATM-mediated DNA repair response. All procedures were approved by the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health Animal Ethics Committee and in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting in vivo experiments. C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were obtained from the Animals Resource Center of Australia. All animals were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle in temperature-controlled rooms (22 °C) and allowed free access to standard chow and water. The method for TBI induction has been previously described (11Goh C.P. Putz U. Howitt J. Low L.H. Gunnersen J. Bye N. Morganti-Kossmann C. Tan S.S.

HEK293T cells and MEFs were transfected with the appropriate constructs using Effectene transfection reagent kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The procedures for the production of lentiviral particles containing Ndfip1-Flag and inducible cell lines (HEK293T and SH-SY5Y) sensitive to 4-hydroxytamoxifen for Ndfip1-Flag expression has been described (9Howitt J.

For production of HEK293T cells capable of responding to doxycyline for expressing Flag-Ndfip1, we used the pF TRE3G PGK puro vector (gift of David Vaux, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia). Human Ndfip1 cDNA flanked with BamHI and NheI restriction sites was generated by PCR with the forward primer 5′-CG CGG ATC CAT GGC GTT GGC GTT GGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCT AGC TAG CTT AAT AAA TAA AGA GAA CTC TGG TC-3′. The purified Ndfip1 PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and NheI restriction enzyme and cloned into the pF TRE3G PGK puro vector and sequence-verified. To generate lentiviral particles, packaging constructs pCMV ðR8.2 and VSVg and the relevant lentiviral plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293T cells using Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Supernatants were harvested at 100,000 × g. HEK293T cells were infected with viral supernatant for 24 h. Infected cells were selected using puromycin (2 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and tested for Flag-Ndfip1 expression following exposure to doxycycline (2 ng/ml). To induce DNA damage, the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO and added to the medium to final concentrations of 2 and 20 μm for 2 h. Control experiments showed that DMSO alone had no effect on any of the parameters measured. MEFs were grown in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells-well in DMEM. Etoposide (2 μm) was added to the medium for 24 h followed by 100 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After aspirating off the medium, 200 μl of DMSO was added and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before colorimetry. The absorbance of the dye was measured at 550 nm. Three separate assays were conducted for each experimental condition. To visualize protein binding, plasmids were created for bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) of Venus using N-terminal (VN) and C-terminal (VC) reporter fragments as previously described (14Li Y.

To create a BRAT1-VC155–238 construct, human BRAT1 cDNA flanked with EcoRI and BglII restriction sites was generated by PCR with the forward primer 5′-CCC GAA TTC ATG GAC CCA GAA TGC GCC CA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TAG AGA TCT GTA GCA GTC GGC CTC GTC CC-3′. The purified BRAT1 PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and BglII restriction enzymes and cloned into pBiFC-VC155 (addgene Plasmid 22011). To create a Strep-Flag-BRAT1 construct, human BRAT1 cDNA flanked with NheI restriction sites was generated by PCR with the forward primers 5′-TCT AGC TAG CAT GGA CCC AGA ATG CGC CCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCC GCT AGC GCT CAG TAG CAG TCG GC-3′. The purified BRAT1 PCR fragment was digested with NheI restriction enzymes and cloned into Strep-Flag pcDNA3 vector (gift of Christian Gloeckner (Institute of Human Genetics, Munich-Neuherberg, Germany). To map binding of BRAT1 with Ndfip1, BRAT1 deletion mutant constructs were generated using Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs) with the following primers: BRAT1 Δ1–100 forward, 5′-AGT TCG AGA AAG GAG CTA GCG GGC TCT TTG GGG AGC CAG G-3′; BRAT1 Δ1–200 forward, 5′-AGT TCG AGA AAG GAG CTA GCC ACG TTG AAG AGT CCT TGT G-3′; and BRAT1 reverse, 5′-CGC CAA CGC CAT GCT AGC GCT CAG TAG CAG TCG GCC TCG T-3′.

HEK293T and SH-SY5Y cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS) with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini; Roche) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were cleared of insoluble debris by centrifugation at 21,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of lysate was measured using detergent-compatible protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation experiments, Strep-Tactin (Qiagen) beads were used for precipitate SF-Ndfip1 and SF-BRAT1. For each immunoprecipitation assay, beads were washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer before elution using the manufacturer's instructions. For the ubiquitination assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with His-Ubiquitin, SF-Ndfip1, HA-BRAT1, Flag-Nedd4-1, Flag-Nedd4-2, and Flag-Itch alone or in combination. Twenty-four hours after transfection, lysates were immunoprecipitated with HisLink beads (Promega) under denaturing condition using 6 m guanidine HCl and N-ethylamaleimide to inhibit deubiquitinase enzymes. Beads were washed three times using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer before elution using 300 mm imidazole. Eluted fractions were suspended in Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels followed by transfer onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk in TBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Blots were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C followed by appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were exposed using ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). Alternatively, gel imaging system ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad) was used to visualize the blot. Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-Ndfip1 (1:2000), rabbit polyclonal anti-BRAT1 (1:500, Abcam), purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Nedd4-2 (1:1000, Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-Nedd4-1 (1:1,000; BD), mouse monoclonal anti-Itch (1:1,000; BD), mouse monoclonal anti-ATM (1:1,000; Abcam), rabbit monoclonal anti-pATM (1:1,000; Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-pH2AX (1:1,000), Millipore, mouse monoclonal anti–β-actin (1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich), and mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich). The HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies used were goat polyclonal anti-rabbit (1:10,000; Millipore) and goat polyclonal anti-mouse (1:15,000; Millipore). Mice were euthanized (sodium pentobarbitone, 80 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) by transcardial perfusion of PBS (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (PB). The brains were cryoprotected in 20% sucrose in 0.1 m PB at 4 °C overnight and followed by embedding in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) before coronal sectioning with a cryostat (12 μm). Perfusion-fixed sections were washed with 0.1 m PB, antigens were retrieved with sodium citrate buffer (10 mm sodium citrate), permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m PB, and then blocked with 10% FCS in 0.1% Triton X-100 with 0.1 m PB. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight followed by appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted on slides using ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PB for 15 min. Permeabilization was carried out with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m PB and then blocked with 10% FCS in 0.1% Triton X-100 with 0.1 m PB. The cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight followed by appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then mounted on slides using ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies used were: rat monoclonal anti-Ndfip1 (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti-BRAT1, (1:500; Abcam), and mouse monoclonal anti-Flag M2 (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies were: Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, Molecular Probes), and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes). Imaging was performed on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope. MEFs on coverslips were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, MEFs were washed once with 0.1 m PB and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After fixation, the coverslips were incubated for 5 min with 0.1 m PB phalloidin marker (50 μg/ml) before a final wash in 0.1 m PB. Coverslips were then mounted on slides using ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Imaging was performed on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope. The fluorescence intensity of the nuclear BiFC signal for each cell was measured using ImageJ. A minimum of 15 cells from two independent experiments were conducted. All data were analyzed using Prism software and presented as means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. For measure of statistical significance, a minimal p < 0.05 cutoff was employed. BRAT1 was initially identified in a screen of interacting proteins for Ndfip1 in HEK293T cells using tandem affinity purification of proteins bound to Strep-Flag-Ndfip1 (SF-Ndfip1), followed by mass spectrometry analysis. 4L.-H.

To confirm the interaction between BRAT1 and Ndfip1, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was performed following overexpression of HA-BRAT1 and SF-Ndfip1 in HEK293T cells. The results showed that co-IP with Strep-Tactin-coated beads produced the correctly sized band for HA-BRAT1 (Fig. 1A), whereas the reverse pulldown with Strep-Flag-BRAT1 (SF-BRAT1) also revealed a specific band for Ndfip1-mCherry (Fig. 1B). Previous reports had shown that Ndfip1 is a cytoplasmic protein (8Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J.

Thus, we investigated the whereabouts of the interaction between Ndfip1 and BRAT1 using BiFC with the Venus reporter protein. Ndfip1 was fused with the N-terminal fragment of Venus protein (Ndfip1-VN1–173) and BRAT1 fused with a complementary C-terminal fragment of Venus (BRAT1-VC155–238) (Fig. 1C). Following co-expression of these plasmids in MEFs, the BiFC fluorescent signal was observed in the cytoplasm, confirming their interaction in this cellular location (Fig. 1D, top panels). A control experiment using BimL, a protein that is not known to interact with BRAT1, did not yield a BiFC signal (BimL-VN1–173 and BRAT1-VC155–238) (Fig. 1D, bottom panels). In aggregate, these experiments suggest that Ndfip1 and BRAT1 interact in the cytoplasm. To further identify the responsible domain in BRAT1, we performed a series of co-IP experiments using deletion mutants. Initially, we performed a pulldown assay with a mutant form of BRAT1 (c.638_639insA) (BRAT1 IMut) that previously was reported to be associated with lethal neonatal rigidity and seizure syndrome (18Puffenberger E.G. Jinks R.N. Sougnez C. Cibulskis K. Willert R.A. Achilly N.P. Cassidy R.P. Fiorentini C.J. Heiken K.F. Lawrence J.J. Mahoney M.H. Miller C.J. Nair D.T. Politi K.A. Worcester K.N. Setton R.A.

Genetic mapping and exome sequencing identify variants associated with five novel diseases.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e28936Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of BRAT1 c.638_639insA produced a frameshift from amino acid 231 resulting in premature termination at amino acid 401 and a reduced molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig. 2A). The co-IP was performed by overexpression of SF-BRAT1 IMut and Ndfip1-mCherry in HEK293T cells. As controls, wild-type SF-BRAT1 and an empty vector were used. The results showed binding of Ndfip1-mCherry with both wild-type SF-BRAT1 and SF-BRAT1 IMut (Fig. 2B). This would suggest that the binding site for BRAT1 might lie upstream of amino acid 231. To identify this, deletion mutants of BRAT1 with varying lengths of N-terminal truncations were produced, and co-IP experiments with Ndfip1-mCherry were performed as before (Fig. 2C). The results showed that SF-BRAT1 Δ1–100 (B1) was able to bind to Ndfip1-mCherry, but SF-BRAT1 Δ1–200 (B2) was not, indicating that the putative binding site was likely to be contained between amino acids 100–200. BRAT1 has been shown to be an important mediator of the DNA damage response (7Aglipay J.A. Martin S.A. Tawara H. Lee S.W. Ouchi T.

A ubiquitination assay was performed by overexpression of His-ubiquitin and HA-BRAT1 in HEK293T cells, with and without Ndfip1, and Nedd4 family E3 ligases. Ubiquitinated proteins were precipitated from lysates under denaturing conditions to prevent nonspecific binding. The immunoprecipitate of ubiquitinated proteins was probed using anti-BRAT1 antibodies to assess BRAT1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3). The results showed that expression of BRAT1 alone was not sufficient for ubiquitination of the protein (Fig. 3, lane 1). When co-expressed with E3 ubiquitin ligases, but in the absence of Ndfip1, BRAT1 showed only a small degree of ubiquitination by members of the Nedd4 E3 ligases (Nedd4-1, Nedd4-2, and Itch; lanes 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Interestingly, Itch was more effective (compared with Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2) in promoting the ubiquitination of BRAT1 (Fig. 3, ∼96-kDa bands in lane 4). With the addition of Ndfip1 in the assay (lanes 5–8), the ubiquitination of BRAT1 was dramatically enhanced by all three E3 ligases, particularly more so by Itch (lane 8). Indeed, Ndfip1 alone (lane 5) demonstrated increased ubiquitination of BRAT1, presumably by recruiting endogenous E3 ligases present in HEK293T cells (9Howitt J. Lackovic J. Low L.H. Naguib A.

https://openalex.org/W2077617161,"Autoimmune diseases arise from the loss of tolerance to self, and because the etiologies of such diseases are largely unknown, symptomatic treatments rely on anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Tolerogenic treatments that can reverse disease are preferred, but again, often thwarted by not knowing the responsible auto-antigens (auto-Ags). Hence, a viable alternative to stimulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) is to induce bystander tolerance. Colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) has been shown to evoke bystander immunity and to hasten Ag-specific Treg development independent of auto-Ag. To translate in treating human autoimmune diseases, the food-based Lactococcus was engineered to express CFA/I fimbriae, and Lactococcus-CFA/I fermented milk fed to arthritic mice proved highly efficacious. Protection occurred via CD39+ Tregs producing TGF-β and IL-10 to potently suppress TNF-α production and neutrophil influx into the joints. Thus, these data demonstrate the feasibility of oral nutraceuticals for treating arthritis, and potency of protection against arthritis was improved relative to that obtained with Salmonella-CFA/I."
https://openalex.org/W2014221662,"Pax genes encode developmental regulatory proteins that specify cell lineages and tissues in metazoans. Upon binding to DNA through the conserved paired domain, Pax proteins can recruit both activating and repressing complexes that imprint distinct patterns of histone methylation associated with either gene activation or silencing. How the switch from Pax-mediated activation to repression is regulated remains poorly understood. In this report, we identify the phosphatase PPM1B as an essential component of the Groucho4 repressor complex that is recruited by Pax2 to chromatin. PPM1B can dephosphorylate the Pax2 activation domain and displace the adaptor protein PTIP, thus inhibiting H3K4 methylation and gene activation. Loss of PPM1B prevents Groucho-mediated gene repression. Thus, PPM1B helps switch Pax2 from a transcriptional activator to a repressor protein. This can have profound implications for developmental regulation by Pax proteins and suggests a model for imprinting specific epigenetic marks depending on the availability of co-factors.

To early predict the prognosis of the patients may prevent the complications and improve the survival. This study was aimed to develop a new prognostic index to estimate the survival related to HBV-ACLF.Consecutive patients with HBV-ACLF were included in a prospective observational study. Serum Cystatin C concentrations were measured by using the particle-enhanced immunonephelometry assay. All of the patients were followed for at least 3 months. Cox regression analysis was carried out to identify which factors were predictive of mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the efficacy of the variates for early predicting mortality.Seventy-two patients with HBV-ACLF were recruited between January 2012 and January 2013. Thirty patients died (41.7%) during 3-months followed up. Cox multivariate regression analysis identified serum cystatin C (CysC) and total bilirubin (TBil) were independent factors significantly (P < 0.01) associated with survival. Our results further showed that new prognostic index (PI) combining serum CysC with TBil was a good indicator for predicting the mortality of patients with HBV-ACLF. Specifically, the PI had a higher accuracy than the CTP, MELD, or MELD-Na scoring for early prediction short-term survival of HBV-ACLF patients with normal levels of serum creatinine (Cr). The survival rate in low risk group (PI < 3.91) was 94.3%, which was markedly higher than those in the high-risk group (PI ≥ 3.91) (17.4%, P < 0.001).We developed a new prognostic index combining serum CysC with TBil which early predicted the short-term mortality of HBV-ACLF patients."
https://openalex.org/W1966406979,"Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary heart disease (CHD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are major healthcare problems in Kuwait. The present study was designed to determine the prevalence of MetS, and to estimate the 10-year risk for developing T2DM and CHD among the general population in Kuwait. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was undertaken in 1800 individuals without diabetes or a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). They were selected from six governorates using two stage convenience sampling. The questionnaire was developed using the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISK), Framingham Risk Score [FRS] and the 2009 Joint Statement criteria for diagnosis of MetS as a framework. Descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used. Results The response rate was 89.4%. More than half (60.8%; 95% CI: 58.4–63.2) of responders were either overweight or obese. One hundred and ninety seven (12.2%) subjects had blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Almost three-in-ten (28.3%: 26.2–30.6) subjects had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels ≥ 5.6 mmol/l, of whom 86.0% and 14.0% had impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and screen detected T2DM, respectively. MetS was present in 512 (31.8%; 29.5–34.2) respondents. Just under one third (n = 481; 29.9%; 27.7–32.2) of participants were at moderate, high, or very high risk of developing T2DM, while 283 (17.6%: 15.8–19.6) were at moderate/high 10-year risk of developing CHD. Approximately one-in-ten (8.5%; 7.2–9.9) subjects were at moderate/high/very high 10-year risk of developing both T2DM/CHD. T2DM risk was higher for females compared to males (p < 0.001); however, the pattern was reversed in terms of the risk of developing CHD or T2DM/CHD. The risk of developing T2DM, CHD, or T2DM/CHD was greater among those aged ≥ 45 years, and those having MetS (p<0.001). Conclusions The current findings highlight the need for multifaceted interventions for prevention."

This study aimed at characterizing the impact of HBSP on cellular signaling pathways in vitro and on liver pathogenesis in transgenic (Tg) mice. By RT-qPCR array, NF-κB-inducible genes appeared modulated in HepG2 cells transduced with a HBSP-encoding lentivirus. Using luciferase and Western blot assays, we observed a decreased activation of the NF-κB pathway in HBSP-expressing cells following TNF-α treatment, as illustrated by lower levels of phosphorylated IκB-α. Meanwhile, the level of phosphorylated JNK increased together with the sensitivity to apoptosis. The contrasting effects on JNK and IκB-a activation upon TNF-α stimulation matched with a modulated maturation of TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) kinase, assessed by 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by HBSP was confirmed in the liver of HBSP Tg mice and associated with a significant decrease of chemically induced chronic liver inflammation, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, HBSP contributes to limit hepatic inflammation during chronic liver disease and may favor HBV persistence by evading immune response.—Pol, J.

https://openalex.org/W1984371396,"E74-like factor 5 (Elf5) has been associated with tumor suppression in breast cancer. However, its role in urothelial cancer (UC) is completely unknown. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and methylation specific PCR (MSP) were done to detect Elf5 expression level and its promoter methylation. Results revealed that low expression of Elf5 on protein and mRNA levels were associated with tumor progression, early relapse and poor survival. In vitro, down-regulation of Elf5 can increase epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Aberrant Elf5 methylation was identified as major mechanism for Elf5 gene silence. Accordingly, restoration of Elf5 by infection or demethylating treatment effectively reversed EMT processes. In conclusion, we identified Elf5 as a novel biomarker of UC on several biological levels and established a causative link between Elf5 and EMT in UC."
https://openalex.org/W2081279079,"Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage renal disease in the world. Although tremendous efforts have been made, scientists have yet to identify an ideal animal model that can reproduce the characteristics of human diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we hypothesize that taurine insufficiency is a critical risk factor for development of diabetic nephropathy associated with diabetes mellitus. This hypothesis was tested in vivo in TauT heterozygous (TauT+/-) and homozygous (TauT-/-) knockout in C57BL/6 background mice. We have shown that alteration of the TauT gene (also known as SLC6A6) has a substantial effect on the susceptibility to development of extensive diabetic kidney disease in both TauT+/- and TauT-/-mouse models of diabetes. These animals developed histological changes characteristic of human diabetic nephropathy that included glomerulosclerosis, nodular lesions, arteriosclerosis, arteriolar dilation, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining of molecular markers of smooth muscle actin, CD34, Ki67 and collagen IV further confirmed these observations. Our results demonstrated that both homozygous and heterozygous TauT gene deletion predispose C57BL/6 mice to develop end-stage diabetic kidney disease, which closely replicates the pathological features of diabetic nephropathy in human diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W1965199018,"Background International collaborative research is a mechanism for improving the development of disease-specific therapies and for improving health at the population level. However, limited data are available to assess the trends in research output related to orphan diseases. Methods and Findings We used bibliometric mapping and clustering methods to illustrate the level of fragmentation in myeloma research and the development of collaborative efforts. Publication data from Thomson Reuters Web of Science were retrieved for 2005–2009 and followed until 2013. We created a database of multiple myeloma publications, and we analysed impact and co-authorship density to identify scientific collaborations, developments, and international key players over time. The global annual publication volume for studies on multiple myeloma increased from 1,144 in 2005 to 1,628 in 2009, which represents a 43% increase. This increase is high compared to the 24% and 14% increases observed for lymphoma and leukaemia. The major proportion (>90% of publications) was from the US and EU over the study period. The output and impact in terms of citations, identified several successful groups with a large number of intra-cluster collaborations in the US and EU. The US-based myeloma clusters clearly stand out as the most productive and highly cited, and the European Myeloma Network members exhibited a doubling of collaborative publications from 2005 to 2009, still increasing up to 2013. Conclusion and Perspective Multiple myeloma research output has increased substantially in the past decade. The fragmented European myeloma research activities based on national or regional groups are progressing, but they require a broad range of targeted research investments to improve multiple myeloma health care."
https://openalex.org/W2043671672,"To assess the prognostic value of 12-months N-Terminal Pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) levels on adverse cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary heart disease.NT-proBNP concentrations were measured at baseline and at 12-months follow-up in participants of cardiac rehabilitation (median follow-up 8.96 years). Cox-proportional hazards models evaluated the prognostic value of log-transformed NT-proBNP levels, and of 12-months NT-proBNP relative changes on adverse cardiovascular events adjusting for established risk factors measured at baseline.Among 798 participants (84.7% men, mean age 59 years) there were 114 adverse cardiovascular events. 12-months NT-proBNP levels were higher than baseline levels in 60 patients (7.5%) and numerically more strongly associated with the outcome in multivariable analysis (HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.33-2.05] vs. HR 1.41 [95% CI 1.12-1.78], with a net reclassification improvement (NRI) of 0.098 [95% CI 0.002-0.194] compared to NRI of 0.047 [95% CI -0.0004-0.133] for baseline NT-proBNP levels. A 12-month 10% increment of NT-proBNP was associated with a HR of 1.35 [95% CI 1.12-1.63] for the onset of an adverse cardiovascular event. Subjects with a 12-month increment of NT-proBNP had a HR of 2.56 [95% CI 1.10-5.95] compared to those with the highest 12-months reduction.Twelve-months NT-proBNP levels after an acute cardiovascular event are strongly associated with a subsequent event and may provide numerically better reclassification of patients at risk for an adverse cardiovascular event compared to NT-proBNP baseline levels after adjustment for established risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W1979012469,"CHEK2 is a protein kinase that is involved in cell-cycle checkpoint control after DNA damage. Germline mutations in CHEK2 gene have been associated with increase in breast cancer risk. The aim of this study is to identify the CHEK2 gene germline mutations among high-risk breast cancer patients and its contribution to the multiethnic population in Malaysia. We screened the entire coding region of CHEK2 gene on 59 high-risk breast cancer patients who tested negative for BRCA1/2 germline mutations from UKM Medical Centre (UKMMC), Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) and Hospital Putrajaya (HPJ). Sequence variants identified were screened further in case-control cohorts consisting of 878 unselected invasive breast cancer patients (180 Malays, 526 Chinese and 172 Indian) and 270 healthy individuals (90 Malays, 90 Chinese and 90 Indian). By screening the entire coding region of the CHEK2 gene, two missense mutations, c.480A>G (p.I160M) and c.538C>T (p.R180C) were identified in two unrelated patients (3.4%). Further screening of these missense mutations on the case-control cohorts unveiled the variant p.I160M in 2/172 (1.1%) Indian cases and 1/90 (1.1%) Indian control, variant p.R180C in 2/526 (0.38%) Chinese cases and 0/90 Chinese control, and in 2/180 (1.1%) of Malay cases and 1/90 (1.1%) of Malay control. The results of this study suggest that CHEK2 mutations are rare among high-risk breast cancer patients and may play a minor contributing role in breast carcinogenesis among Malaysian population."
https://openalex.org/W2007986411,"To determine if molybdenum (Mo) is a chemical stressor, fingerling and juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to waterborne sodium molybdate (0, 2, 20, or 1,000 mg l-1 of Mo) and components of the physiological (plasma cortisol, blood glucose, and hematocrit) and cellular (heat shock protein [hsp] 72, hsp73, and hsp90 in the liver, gills, heart, and erythrocytes and metallothionein [MT] in the liver and gills) stress responses were measured prior to initiation of exposure and at 8, 24, and 96 h. During the acute exposure, plasma cortisol, blood glucose, and hematocrit levels remained unchanged in all treatments. Heat shock protein 72 was not induced as a result of exposure and there were no detectable changes in total hsp70 (72 and 73), hsp90, and MT levels in any of the tissues relative to controls. Both fingerling and juvenile fish responded with similar lack of apparent sensitivity to Mo exposure. These experiments demonstrate that exposure to waterborne Mo of up to 1,000 mg l(-1) did not activate a physiological or cellular stress response in fish. Information from this study suggests that Mo water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life are highly protective of freshwater fish, namely rainbow trout."
https://openalex.org/W2053542681,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are the most polymorphic genes in vertebrates and encode molecules that play a crucial role in pathogen resistance. As a result of their diversity, they have received much attention in the fields of evolutionary and conservation biology. Here, we described the genetic variation of MHC class II B (MHCIIB) exon 2 in a wild population of Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), which has suffered a dramatic decline in population over the last three decades across its ranges in the face of heavy exploitation and habitat loss. Twenty-four distinct alleles were found in 73 S. humiae specimens. We found seven shared alleles among four geographical groups as well as six rare MHCIIB alleles. Most individuals displayed between one to five alleles, suggesting that there are at least three MHCIIB loci of the Hume's pheasant. The dN ⁄ dS ratio at putative antigen-binding sites (ABS) was significantly greater than one, indicating balancing selection is acting on MHCIIB exon 2. Additionally, recombination and gene conversion contributed to generating MHCIIB diversity in the Hume's pheasant. One to three recombination events and seventy-five significant gene conversion events were observed within the Hume's pheasant MHCIIB loci. The phylogenetic tree and network analysis revealed that the Hume's pheasant alleles do not cluster together, but are scattered through the tree or network indicating a trans-species evolutionary mode. These findings revealed the evolution of the Hume's pheasant MHC after suffering extreme habitat fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2023707548,"Previous studies have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid from patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) leads to pronounced vasoconstriction in isolated arteries. We hypothesized that only cerebrospinal fluid from SAH patients with vasospasm would produce an enhanced contractile response to endothelin-1 in rat cerebral arteries, involving both endothelin ETA and ETB receptors.Intact rat basilar arteries were incubated for 24 hours with cerebrospinal fluid from 1) SAH patients with vasospasm, 2) SAH patients without vasospasm, and 3) control patients. Arterial segments with and without endothelium were mounted in myographs and concentration-response curves for endothelin-1 were constructed in the absence and presence of selective and combined ETA and ETB receptor antagonists. Endothelin concentrations in culture medium and receptor expression were measured.Compared to the other groups, the following was observed in arteries exposed to cerebrospinal fluid from patients with vasospasm: 1) larger contractions at lower endothelin concentrations (p<0.05); 2) the increased endothelin contraction was absent in arteries without endothelium; 3) higher levels of endothelin secretion in the culture medium (p<0.05); 4) there was expression of ETA receptors and new expression of ETB receptors was apparent; 5) reduction in the enhanced response to endothelin after ETB blockade in the low range and after ETA blockade in the high range of endothelin concentrations; 6) after combined ETA and ETB blockade a complete inhibition of endothelin contraction was observed.Our experimental findings showed that in intact rat basilar arteries exposed to cerebrospinal fluid from patients with vasospasm endothelin contraction was enhanced in an endothelium-dependent manner and was blocked by combined ETA and ETB receptor antagonism. Therefore we suggest that combined blockade of both receptors may play a role in counteracting vasospasm in patients with SAH."
https://openalex.org/W1964972072,"High rate of fetal mortality in ruminant somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) pregnancies is due, at least in part, to immune-mediated abortion of fetuses. In the present study, goat uterine leukocytes were isolated by Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) coated magnetic beads, and with majority being were CD56+CD16- in phenotype with low levels of perforin and Granzyme B expression. The responses of the isolated cells to SCNT and in vitro fertilization (IVF) embryos conditioned mediums containing hormone steroids were compared by measuring their phenotype and cytokines expression. The results showed there was a 2-fold increase in the numbers of isolated uterine leukocytes after incubation with different conditioned mediums for 120 h. However, significantly lower percentage and absolute numbers of uterine CD56+CD16- leukocytes incubated with SCNT conditioned mediums were detected as compared with those incubated with IVF conditioned mediums (P < 0.05). The group treated with progesterone (P4) or the combination of P4 and 17β-estradiol (E2) were associated with significantly higher percentage and absolute numbers of CD56+CD16- cells as compared with those treated with E2 alone (P < 0.05). Furthermore, in the presence of steroids, the isolated leukocytes incubated with SCNT conditioned mediums associated with greater levels of IFN-γ secretion and expression, as well as lesser levels of VEGF, as compared with those treated with IVF conditioned mediums (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SCNT embryos have a profound effect on the phenotype expression of goat uterine DBA+ leukocytes, as well as the secretion and expression of IFN-γ and VEGF by these cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2007101563,"Background Maintenance of T cell immune homeostasis is critical for adequate anti-tumor immunity. The transcription factor Ikaros is essential for lymphocyte development including T cells. Alterations in Ikaros expression occur in blood malignancies in humans and mice. In this study, we investigated the role of Ikaros in regulating T cell immune balance in pancreatic cancer mouse models. Methodology and Principal Findings Using our Panc02 tumor-bearing (TB) mouse model, western blot analysis revealed a reduction in Ikaros proteins while qRT-PCR showed no differences in Ikaros mRNA levels in TB splenocytes compared to control. Treatment of naïve splenocytes with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132, stabilized Ikaros expression and prevented Ikaros downregulation by Panc02 cells, in vitro. Western blot analyses showed a reduction in protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein kinase CK2 expression in TB splenocytes while CK2 activity was increased. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed altered punctate staining of Ikaros in TB splenocytes. Flow cytometry revealed a significant decrease in effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cell percentages but increased CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in TB splenocytes. Similar alterations in T cell percentages, as well as reduced Ikaros and CK2 but not PP1 expression, were observed in a transgenic, triple mutant (TrM) pancreatic cancer model. Ikaros expression was also reduced in enriched TB CD3+ T cells. MG132 treatment of naïve CD3+ T cells stabilized Ikaros expression in the presence of Panc02 cells. Western blots showed reduced PP1 and CK2 expression in TB CD3+ T cells. Conclusions/Significance The results of this study suggest that the pancreatic tumor microenvironment may cause proteasomal degradation of Ikaros, possibly via dysregulation of PP1 and CK2 expression and activity, respectively. This loss of Ikaros expression may contribute to an imbalance in T cell percentages. Ikaros may potentially be a therapeutic target to restore T cell homeostasis in pancreatic cancer hosts, which may be critical for effective anti-tumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2011596027,"Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the effects of Cyclosporin A (CsA) on the fate of stem cells, including cardiomyogenic differentiation. Therefore, we investigated the effects and the molecular mechanisms behind the actions of CsA on cell lineage determination of P19 cells. CsA induced cardiomyocyte-specific differentiation of P19 cells, with the highest efficiency at a concentration of 0.32 μM during embryoid body (EB) formation via activation of the Wnt signaling pathway molecules, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and Wnt8a, and the cardiac mesoderm markers, Mixl1, Mesp1, and Mesp2. Interestingly, cotreatment of P19 cells with CsA plus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) during EB formation significantly increases cardiac differentiation. In contrast, mRNA expression levels of hematopoietic and endothelial lineage markers, including Flk1 and Er71, were severely reduced in CsA-treated P19 cells. Furthermore, expression of Flk1 protein and the percentage of Flk1+ cells were severely reduced in 0.32 μM CsA-treated P19 cells compared to control cells. CsA significantly modulated mRNA expression levels of the cell cycle molecules, p53 and Cyclins D1, D2, and E2 in P19 cells during EB formation. Moreover, CsA significantly increased cell death and reduced cell number in P19 cells during EB formation. These results demonstrate that CsA induces cardiac differentiation but inhibits hemato-endothelial differentiation via activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, followed by modulation of cell lineage-determining genes in P19 cells during EB formation."
