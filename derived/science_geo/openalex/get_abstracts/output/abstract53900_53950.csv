https://openalex.org/W1534933987,"Abstract Transport of amino acids into 3T3 and Py3T3 (polyoma virus-transformed 3T3 cells) was measured at pre- and post-confluent stages of their growth on glass coverslips. The 3T3 line is from mouse embryo and selected because of its strong contact inhibition. These cells, respectively, are and are not sensitive to density-dependent inhibition of growth, a phenomenon characterized by inhibition of cell multiplication soon after cells reach confluency on a solid substratum. The nonmetabolizable amino acids α-aminoisobutyric acid and cycloleucine (1-aminocyclopentane 1-carboxylic acid) were accumulated about 30% less rapidly by confluent than by nonconfluent 3T3 cells. 3T3 cells grown in a medium containing a high concentration of serum failed to exhibit either density-dependent inhibition of growth or reduction in the transport of aminoisobutyric acid upon attainment of confluency. The rates of accumulation of metabolizable amino acids such as glutamic acid, glutamine, and arginine were not lower in confluent than in nonconfluent 3T3 cells. No differences between confluent and nonconfluent Py3T3 cells in rates of accumulation of either metabolizable or nonmetabolizable amino acids were observed. Py3T3 cells accumulated α-aminoisobutyric acid, cycloleucine, and glutamine about twice as rapidly as nonconfluent 3T3 cells, but glutamic acid and arginine were accumulated at the same rate by both 3T3 and Py3T3 cells. The growth regulation apparently exemplified by density-dependent inhibition of growth in vitro seems not to be due to general alterations in membrane permeability and transport."
https://openalex.org/W1561188729,"Flavin and pyridine nucleotide fluorescence was continuously monitored from the surface of the hemoglobin-free, perfused rat liver with the use of a new double fluorometer. In response to anoxia or after addition of inhibitors of the respiratory chain, the fluorescence intensity excited at 436 mµ decreased, while that excited at 366 mµ increased, representing reduction of flavin and pyridine nucleotides, respectively. Subsequent reoxidation of pyridine nucleotides in the cytosol by the addition of pyruvate was not accompanied by a change in flavin fluorescence. Maximal flavin reduction could be achieved by complete inhibition of the respiratory chain in the presence of oxygen. Titration with acetoacetate showed that mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides were in equilibrium with the fluorescent flavoproteins. Microsomal oxidation-reduction reactions appeared to be reflected by small changes in pyridine nucleotide fluorescence, but not by changes of flavin fluorescence. It is concluded, therefore, that the flavin signal is predominantly due to mitochondrial flavoproteins with approximately equal contributions from flavin pools located on both the substrate and the oxygen side of the rotenone block. The continuous monitoring of flavin and pyridine nucleotide fluorescence as an experimental approach for studies of compartmentation of oxidation-reduction systems is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1527858178,"A simple and direct method for assaying cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate in isolated adipose cells is described. The method consists in measuring the formation and accumulation of cyclic AMP-8-14C by cells which have been previously labeled with adenine-8-14C. By use of the described assay, the known effects of a variety of hormones on adipose cell cyclic AMP levels have been confirmed. Thus, it was shown that (a) cyclic AMP formation, stimulated by norepinephrine or corticotropin, was evident before lipolysis providing theophylline was also present; (b) in the absence of theophylline, norepinephrine induced lipolysis without elevating cyclic AMP levels; (c) in the absence of norepinephrine, theophylline also induced lipolysis without elevating cyclic AMP levels; and (d) the synergistic effect of theophylline (or puromycin) and norepinephrine on induction of lipolysis was less marked than the corresponding synergistic effect of theophylline (or puromycin) and norepinephrine on elevating cyclic AMP levels. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclic AMP exists in different intracellular compartments, only one of which, comprising a small fraction of total cellular cyclic AMP, is involved in activation of the hormone-sensitive lipase. By use of the new assay, the decrease in cyclic AMP levels in adipocytes induced by insulin and prostaglandin E1 has also been confirmed. On the other hand, several proteases which mimic insulin action in isolated adipose cells have been shown in the present studies to be without effect on cyclic AMP levels. Further, polyene antibiotics, such as Filipin and pimaricin, which also mimic insulin action in vitro, lowered cellular cyclic AMP levels and markedly increased the levels observed in the medium. The effects of Filipin on (a) facilitating cyclic AMP leakage, (b) stimulating glucose utilization, and (c) inhibiting hormone-induced lipolysis were all counteracted by the presence of cholesterol in the incubation medium."

https://openalex.org/W1535540896,"Abstract The DPNH dehydrogenase of the mitochondrial electron transport system has been obtained in a highly purified, soluble form after resolution of DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase (Complex I) particles by chaotropic agents. The enzyme contains 1 mole of flavin mononucleotide, 4 g atoms of iron, and 4 moles of acid-labile sulfide per 70,000 g. The soluble, but not the particle-bound, enzyme behaves as a diaphorase and catalyzes the unspecific reduction of quinones and ferric compounds such as menadione, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, coenzymes Q, ferricyanide, and cytochrome c. Mercurials inhibit all the reductase activities of the soluble dehydrogenase, and DPNH (g10-4 m) inhibits its menadione and coenzyme Q reductase activities. The structure and function of DPNH dehydrogenase in both the soluble and the particle-bound form are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1482429795,"A procedure is described for a 450-fold purification of 5-phosphoribosyl α-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase from cells of Salmonella typhimurium LT-2. A sedimentation coefficient (s20, w) of 17.7 was estimated for the enzyme by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Some general properties of the enzyme are described. PRPP synthetase has a specific and apparently absolute requirement for high levels of inorganic phosphate for PRPP synthesis. Saturation curves for phosphate are bimodal, which suggests multiple effects of the anion on the system. Phosphate appears to have a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme, since removal of phosphate by dialysis or dilution inactivates the enzyme. The enzyme requires a divalent cation such as Mg++ or Mn++ for activity. Kinetic studies indicate that the active substrate is the Mg-ATP complex, and that the divalent cation also activates the system in some other way, possibly by activating the enzyme. The PRPP synthetase reaction was demonstrated to be reversible. The equilibrium constant for the reaction in the direction of PRPP synthesis at pH 7.5 and 37° was determined to be 28.6, which corresponds to a standard free energy (ΔF‡) of −2.0 ± 0.5 kcal per mole for the reaction. The standard free energy of hydrolysis of PRPP to ribose 5-phosphate and inorganic pyrophosphate was estimated to be −7.0 ± 0.5 kcal per mole."
https://openalex.org/W1524334976,"The pyrophosphate (PPi) exchange reaction catalyzed by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase is identical with the polymerization reaction in its requirements for a template, strict specificity in base pairing, and a 3′-hydroxyl-terminated primer strand. However, in contrast to polymerization, appreciable exchange is obtained in the absence of a full complement of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Inhibition of synthesis by PPi as measured by the difference between PPi release and nucleotide incorporation from deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, can be accounted for by PPi exchange. The PPi exchange reaction appears to represent the removal by PPi of the newly incorporated nucleotide prior to its complete stabilization by the entry of the next triphosphate. The degradation of DNA by PPi (pyrophosphorolysis) appears to differ from the PPi exchange reaction in that it is inhibited by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, attains a steady state plateau, and has a lower pH optimum and a slower rate. Some of these differences may depend on the requirement that progressive pyrophosphorolysis places on progressive movement of the DNA chain relative to the enzyme. The results are discussed in relation to the mechanism of the PPi exchange reaction and to all polymerase functions in a model with a single active center for the enzyme."

At the same time there was a marked increase in total ADP-ribosylation activity. A molecule which was apparently identical to the derived subunit in size and activity was detected in partially purified preparations of toxin.
https://openalex.org/W1541484709,"The binding of arsenite, cyanide, or methanol by chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase, milk xanthine oxidase, and rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase results in characteristic alterations in the absorption spectra of these enzymes. The coincidence between the kinetics of inhibition of all three enzymes and the rate of development of characteristic difference spectra has been established. These difference spectra have afforded a useful tool for investigating the binding sites of these inhibitors. The results indicate that all three ligands bind to the molybdenum component at the active center of each enzyme. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of native and arsenite- and cyanide-treated xanthine dehydrogenase have provided more definitive evidence for the binding of these inhibitors to enzymic molybdenum."
https://openalex.org/W1572554603,"Abstract Bioluminescence centered at about 490 nm occurs in the bacterial luciferase system upon the oxidation of reduced flavin mononucleotide by molecular oxygen. Although excited FMN is the apparent candidate for the emitting molecule, the color of its fluorescence, which is centered at about 525 nm, does not correspond to that of the bioluminescence. In the experiments reported here flavins differing in their fluorescence emission were tested with bacterial luciferase. All were found to be active with the enzyme to a greater or lesser extent, and to result in a shift in the color of the emitted light. However, this shift did not parallel in any case the corresponding shift in the fluorescence emission of the compound. The results could not be readily explained in terms of solvent polarity effects. Although no specific molecular species can be designated as the excited state, it seems likely that it is a luciferase-bound complex and that it involves flavin."
https://openalex.org/W1557876024,"Abstract The induction of cytochrome oxidase in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis was studied by following the time course of elaboration of (a) hemeprotein (or hemeproteins) having heme a as prosthetic group, measured spectrophotometrically at 605 mµ, and (b) the cytochrome oxidase activity, measured in cell-free extracts. The kinetics of induction was investigated after removal of inducer (air) and after the separate addition of cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, and acriflavine at different times during respiratory adaptation. The following results were obtained. 1. Anaerobically grown cells harvested from early stationary phase form hemeprotein a and cytochrome oxidase activity at a constant rate from the onset of aeration. Hemeprotein a reaches its maximal inducible level after 2 hours, whereas cytochrome oxidase activity is at a maximum after 3 hours of aeration. These levels are 33 to 37% of those of aerobically grown cells. The enzyme of induced or aerobically grown cells exhibits the same Km with respect to ferrocytochrome c. 2. Cells induced for periods up to 25 min possess the capacity to form additional cytochrome oxidase activity upon further incubation in the absence of air, whereas cells induced for longer periods are unable to do so. Cycloheximide added prior to aeration prevents the expression of this capacity, but chloramphenicol and acriflavine are without effect. 3. Separate addition of cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, and acriflavine prior to aeration allows the formation of different amounts of hemeprotein a and cytochrome oxidase activity. The amount of inhibitor-resistant synthesis of hemeprotein a is greater than that of cytochrome oxidase activity, and the kinetics of these syntheses varies with the inhibitor used. 4. Cells undergoing respiratory adaptation exhibit the capacity to form additional cytochrome oxidase activity upon further incubation with cycloheximide. This capacity is seen only during the 1st hour of induction, and its expression is inhibited by chloramphenicol. Conversely, cells induced for periods longer than 80 min can form additional cytochrome oxidase when further incubated with chloramphenicol, and the expression of this capacity is blocked by cycloheximide. During the 1st 80 min of induction, the cells can synthesize additional amounts of hemeprotein a when further incubated with either cycloheximide or chloramphenicol. 5. Cells induced for periods longer than 40 min form additional cytochrome oxidase when further incubated with acriflavine, and the expression of this capacity is inhibited by cycloheximide (between 60 and 100 min) and by chloramphenicol (between 40 and 80 min). 6. Cycloheximide inhibits the induction of cytochrome c, anaerobic growth, and incorporation of 14C-leucine into the proteins of adapting yeast, whereas chloramphenicol and acriflavine are not inhibitory."
https://openalex.org/W1509766635,"Abstract It is suggested that a regulatory superstructure of sophisticated interactions exerted between metabolic pathways acts to reinforce and modify the basic allosteric controls operating within specific pathways. Examples are cited to illustrate that small molecules may act as regulatory signals for enzymes that are located in different, apparently remote, metabolic pathways. (a) Regulatory interactions operating between the terminal branches of the biosynthetic pathway for aromatic amino acids are summarized as the simplest examples of the phenomenon. (b) Prephenate dehydratase, an enzyme of phenylalanine synthesis, was not only inhibited by phenylalanine but was also activated by either leucine or methionine. The activation was noncompetitive and independent of the competitive inhibition exerted by phenylalanine. Nutritional experiments with amino acid analogues verified the reality of these relationships in vivo. Data in vitro and in vivo lead to the conclusion that the activation of prephenate dehydratase by leucine or methionine is primarily significant under conditions of low phenylalanine (inhibitor) concentration. (c) A number of observations demonstrated regulatory influences of histidine upon the biosynthesis of tryptophan. A hypothesis is tendered which focuses upon 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, a metabolite that is common to the synthesis of both tryptophan and histidine, as the key entity relating the two pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1924474214,"Abstract Brain glycogen synthetase (UDP glucose:α-1,4 glucan α-4-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.11) and properties of the enzyme that may be related to regulating glycogenesis in this organ were investigated. The enzyme from cerebral tissue was found to exist in at least the two forms distinguishable in other tissues, one dependent (D form) upon and another independent (I form) of glucose 6-phosphate for activity when uridine diphosphate glucose concentration is saturating. The occurrence and requirements of a synthetase-I-kinase and synthetase-D-phosphatase catalyzing the I to D and D to I interconversions, respectively, were also established. To aid in defining the metabolic significance of the different forms of brain synthetase, the changes occurring when glycogenesis was altered in vivo by hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, anoxia, and steroid treatment were studied. Enhanced glycogen deposition following glucose administration and increased glucose-14C incorporation into glycogen induced by hydrocortisone were not accompanied by increases in synthetase-I activity. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia, but not the hormone when coadministered with glucose, led to increases (3-fold) in percentage of total activity in the I form. Anoxia resulting from decapitation also produced relatively rapid increases (3- to 4-fold) in I form activity. Kinetic analyses showed that apparent Km values for UDP glucose of the I form from hypoglycemic and anoxic brains were 3- to 5-fold greater than for comparable activity in cerebral tissue from untreated animals. Possible mechanisms for controlling glycogenesis in brain were discussed in the light of these results. It was proposed that a species of the I form of brain synthetase may provide a suppressive role rather than the facilitatory role recognized in other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W205811246,"Abstract The purified Escherichia coli DNA polymerase contains a single sulfhydryl group which reacts with Hg(II) to produce either a monomer containing a single mercury atom or a dimer of two protein molecules joined by a mercury atom. Both forms retain full polymerase and exonuclease activities, implying that the sulfhydryl group is relatively exposed and not essential for enzymatic activity. The acylating agent, N-carboxymethylisatoic anhydride, reacts with an observed maximum of 11 sites on the enzyme to form a highly fluorescent derivative with altered functional properties. Only 0.2% of the original polymerase activity but 920% of the exonuclease activity are observed at pH 7.4 with DNA as primer or substrate. Measurements of release of inorganic pyrophosphate and binding of triphosphates indicate that the predominant effect of this acylating agent is to cause a marked reduction in the affinity for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate substrates, but concomitant changes in the interaction of the enzyme with polynucleotides are probably also involved. The data are discussed in terms of a model in which the several activities of the enzyme are catalyzed at the same active center, which is differentiated into physically distinct sites."
https://openalex.org/W1505094425,"Ferredoxins from Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium acidi urici, Peptostreptococcus elsdenii, spinach, and parsley, and high potential iron protein from Chromatium were titrated to full reduction with sodium dithionite. The changes in the spectra showed that the bacterial ferredoxins accepted two reducing equivalents; the plant ferredoxins and high potential iron protein accepted only one reducing equivalent. The titration curves for the bacterial ferredoxins and parsley ferredoxin showed a variable lag phase during which there was no net loss in absorption. When C. acidi urici and C. pasteurianum ferredoxins were titrated with dithionite in the presence of 2,2′-bipyridyl, the iron complex tris-(2,2′-bipyridyl)-Fe(II) was formed during the lag phase, suggesting that in this part of a titration contaminating ferric iron was reduced to ferrous iron."
https://openalex.org/W1519698734,"Abstract The g = 1.94 electron paramagnetic resonance signal of xanthine oxidase intensifies rapidly below 77° K and is found to resemble markedly that of spinach ferredoxin. At very low temperatures a new resonance is observed in the reduced protein at g = 2.11 and tentatively ascribed to a second type of iron chromophore. The time dependence of flavin and molybdenum during titration with substrate is complex and substantially confirms the earlier results of Bray. The iron signal does not exhibit this peculiar behavior. The development of the g = 1.94 iron signal on titration with reductants shows that maximum signal intensity is achieved with approximately 3 to 3.5 moles of xanthine and 4 moles of dithionite, in reasonable agreement with the spectrophotometric experiments reported earlier. At maximum development we account for approximately 2 electrons in the g = 1.94 and g = 2.11 signals at low temperatures. This value decreases to 1.1 electrons as the temperature is raised and the contribution of the g = 2.11 species disappears. On reduction with substrate, approximately half of the maximum intensity of these signals is attained very rapidly, the remaining development being slow. A measurement of the line width of the flavin radical yields a value of 19.4 gauss, strongly suggesting that the flavin is the blue or neutral species. The circular dichroism spectra of oxidized and reduced enzyme are recorded and the many similarities to simple non-heme iron proteins like spinach ferredoxin and adrenodoxin are discussed. Reaction with xanthine and glycolaldehyde under anaerobic conditions results in approximately half of the total circular dichroism change occurring very rapidly, the remaining changes being slow. A kinetic study of the reaction of xanthine oxidase in solution with the reducing substrate o-phenanthroline reveals that (a) the initial increase in flavin radical parallels the increase in absorbance at 620 mµ, thus supporting the identification of the flavin as the neutral species and (b) similar kinetic data are observed for the flavin and molybdenum (electron paramagnetic resonance) and the iron (absorbance, circular dichroism)."

The structures of these oligosaccharides were shown to be 2-O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-d-galactose and O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 2)-d-galactose.
https://openalex.org/W1483535685,"Abstract Purification of an inducible oxygenase that opens the pyridine ring during the metabolic degradation of Vitamin B6 by a soil bacterium is described. The enzyme is shown to catalyze Reaction 1, and is readily assayed by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 mµ resulting from utilization of DPNH and disappearance of the hydroxypyridine. The [see PDF for equation] crystalline oxygenase is homogeneous by disc gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation, has a sedimentation coefficient (s020, w) of 7.3 S and a molecular weight (by sedimentation equilibrium) of 166,000, and contains 2 moles of FAD per mole. Activity is lost on resolution with acidic ammonium sulfate and can be completely restored with FAD; FMN is inactive. Crystalline preparations of constant FAD content vary in activity from 90 to 300 arbitrary units per mg for reasons still unknown. The oxygenase is highly sensitive to oxidation and to sulfhydryl reagents, but not to chelating agents, and is stabilized by high concentrations of mercaptoethanol (0.1%) and glycerol (50%). Under anaerobic conditions, the FAD-enzyme is reduced to FADH2-enzyme by DPNH, NaBH4, or Na2S2O4; admission of oxygen reoxidizes the enzyme slowly, whereas on addition of oxygen and Compound I rapid reoxidation of the enzyme occurs and the open chain product appears. No spectrophotometrically detectable intermediate is observed either anaerobically or aerobically, and the available evidence indicates that the reaction proceeds in a concerted fashion via a ternary complex of oxygenase, DPNH, and Compound I. When Reaction 1 is conducted in the presence of 18O2, the isotope is incorporated predominantly into the acetyl group, but also into the newly formed carboxyl group of the product. Thus, the enzyme is best classified as a dioxygenase, although some 18O from H218O also is incorporated into the product. A reaction mechanism consistent with these results is presented which also accounts for the deviation of this labeling pattern from that observed with dioxygenases which cleave aromatic rings without concomitant reduction. TPNH is almost as effective as DPNH in Reaction 1. Of several pyridine analogues tested, only 5-pyridoxic acid replaces Compound I as a substrate; it is very much less active in this capacity. An apparently similar oxygenase from another pseudomonad cleaves 5-pyridoxic acid in preference to Compound I, and is specific for TPNH as the second substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1531720912,"Abstract The inhibitor response properties of the mitochondrial DPNH dehydrogenase have been studied with both the particle-bound and the soluble forms of the enzyme. Electron transfer from the particle-bound DPNH dehydrogenase to the respiratory chain is inhibited by barbiturates, Demerol, rotenone, and piericidin A, whereas the activities of the soluble enzyme are essentially unaffected by these inhibitors. In contrast, the ferricyanide reductase, as well as other diaphorase activities, of the soluble DPNH dehydrogenase is inhibited by mercurials, whereas the bound dehydrogenase appears to be protected against such mercurial attack. o-Phenanthroline interacts with the soluble dehydrogenase, inhibits its activities, and causes the release of labile sulfide from the enzyme. However, other bidentate iron chelators such as bathophenanthroline sulfonate and Tiron do not inhibit the enzyme but interact with it and protect it against inhibition by o-phenanthroline. These studies have indicated that in DPNH dehydrogenase the complex among iron, labile sulfide groups, and cysteine sulfur residues must have a tetrahedral structure. Adenosine phosphates inhibit DPNH dehydrogenase in the same manner as does DPN, but adenosine, nicotinamide mononucleotide, and NMNH are not inhibitory. Guanidinium compounds activate the soluble DPNH dehydrogenase, but inhibit the coenzyme Q reductase activity of the particulate DPNH-coenzyme Q reductase (Complex I). The activating effect of guanidinium compounds on the soluble dehydrogenase is associated not only with an increase in the value of Vmax, but also with a substantial decrease in the value of Kmdpnh (3-fold at 50 mm guanidine)."

The purified preparation hydrolyzes denatured DNA, rRNA, and the 3′-phosphoester linkage of 3′-AMP at similar rates. The preparation exhibits no appreciable 5′-nucleotidase, phosphodiesterase, or phosphomonoesterase activity. The three enzyme activities have remained associated throughout a variety of purification procedures including chromatography on several ion-exchange resins, gel filtration, and polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis at pH 9.5 and 8.3. The ratios of the three activities remain essentially constant throughout all of these procedures. The three enzyme activities exhibit a great degree of similarity with respect to the following properties: (a) pH optima, (b) requirement for Zn++ and sulfhydryl compounds at pH 4.5, (c) rate of destruction of activity by sulfhydryl compounds at pH 8, (d) stability to storage, (e) effects of temperature and duration of heating, (f) reactivation on heating between 65° and 70°, (g) effect of N-bromosuccinimide, (h) effect of metal cations, and (i) effect of inhibitors and EDTA.

https://openalex.org/W1666686972,"Abstract ADP-C5H4(CH3)4N(·)/—O (ADP-R·) is a paramagnetic analogue of NAD in which the unpaired electron is located in a region which corresponds to the pyridine N-ribose C1 bond of the coenzyme. Studies of the effect of ADP-R· on the longitudinal nuclear relaxation rate (1/T1) of the protons of have previously shown this analogue to form binary complexes with liver alcohol dehydrogenase and to form a ternary enzyme-ADP-R·-ethanol complex. By the same technique, ternary complexes are shown here with acetaldehyde and isobutyramide. The dissociation constants of all ternary complexes are in reasonable agreement with those reported for the respective kinetically active species. All of the ternary complexes are less effective in relaxing protons than is the binary e-ADP-R· complex, suggesting that ethanol, acetaldehyde, and isobutyramide displace molecules which are hydrogen-bonded to the paramagnetic nitroxide group of enzyme-bound ADP-R·. This is directly shown by the effect of e-ADP-R· on the transverse relaxation rates (1/T2) of the protons of ethanol, acetaldehyde, and isobutyramide. In the absence of enzyme, high concentrations of ADP-R· (5 mm) increase 1/T2 of the protons of ethanol. Its effect on the methylene protons is g3 times its effect on the methyl protons. The complex of ADP-R· with liver alcohol dehydrogenase at much lower concentrations (∼0.2 mm) relaxes the protons of ethanol and the effect on the methyl protons is 8 to 23 times greater than the effect on the methylene protons, suggesting that the enzyme reorients the ethanol with reference to the unpaired electron of ADP-R· in the ternary complex. Depending on conditions, the enzyme enhances the effect of ADP-R· on 1/T2 of the methylene protons by a factor of 1.5 to 13.4 and on the methyl protons by a factor of 16 to 148. The e-ADP-R· complex is comparably effective in relaxing the protons of acetaldehyde and of isobutyramide, indicating that the unpaired electron is very near the bound substrates and inhibitor in the respective ternary complexes. All of these effects are reversed by the addition of excess NADH. The temperature dependence of 1/T2 of the methyl protons of ethanol in the presence of the enzyme-ADP-R ·-ethanol complex can be fit by two rate processes: 1/τm, the rate of chemical exchange of ethanol molecules into the ternary complex, and 1/T2m, the relaxation rate of ethanol molecules which are in the ternary complex. From 1/τm, the exchange rate of ethanol into the ternary complex is 610 sec-1 at 25° which is two orders of magnitude faster than the maximum turnover number of the alcohol dehydrogenase reaction. Lower limits of 770 sec-1 and 180 sec-1 are set on the exchange rates of acetaldehyde and isobutyramide into their ternary complexes. From the dipolar contributions to 1/T2m, the average distances between the unpaired electron of enzyme-bound ADP-R · and the protons of the bound substrates and inhibitors, calculated from the Solomon-Bloembergen equation, are: ethanol (methyl), 3.6 A; ethanol (methylene), 4.1 A; acetaldehyde (aldehyde), 3.1 A; isobutyramide (methyl), ≤3.9 A. It is concluded that substrates bind to liver alcohol dehydrogenase on the water side of the bound coenzymes and directly overlie the ribosidic bond to pyridine. Structures consistent with the calculated distances permit molecular contact between the hydrogen-donating and hydrogen-accepting positions of the substrates and the coenzymes and, therefore, support the direct transfer of hydrogen between them. Although hydrogen transfer by way of stacked pyridine and indole rings can be excluded, though the participation of tryptophan in an edge to edge structure with the pyridine ring cannot be excluded."

https://openalex.org/W1649931350,"Abstract Lipopolysaccharide of wild type Salmonella typhimurium is believed to contain O side chains, whose reducing terminal sugar, galactose, is linked to the R core. Two oligosaccharides were isolated by periodate oxidation, NaBH4 reduction, and mild acid hydrolysis of such a lipopolysaccharide. They were also isolated from the lipopolysaccharide of a mutant synthesizing very short O side chains each containing only one repeat unit, but not from that of a mutant totally lacking O side chains. The degradation of a lipopolysaccharide, which was synthesized partially in vitro and contained 14C only in the reducing terminal galactose residue of the O side chain, also resulted in the isolation of these two oligosaccharides, labeled with 14C. These results indicate that the oligosaccharides were derived from the linkage region between the O side chain and R core. Moreover, one of the oligosaccharides was identified as O-d-galactosyl-O-d-glucosyl-(1 → 2)-glyceraldehyde; the other appeared to be a cyclic acetal formed from the former oligosaccharide and glycerol. These and other results show that the reducing terminal galactose of O side chains is not linked to the nonreducing terminal sugar of the R core, i.e. N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, but to a glucose residue within the R core, through a 1 → 4 linkage if the sugars are in pyranose forms. This glucose in turn is linked, through a 1 → 2 linkage, to a galactose residue in the R core."

(b) DPNH oxidation proceeds through a fast, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (QO)-sensitive and a slow, QO-insensitive path. Succinate oxidation, which is slow, is not QOsensitive. These results suggest a main branch of electron transport including a flavoprotein, reduced by DPNH, and a second branch consisting of flavoproteins and cytochrome b(559), reduced by DPNH and succinate. The branches join at the c-type cytochromes. Cytochrome b(563), although reduced by the dehydrogenase of the main branch, lies outside the main DPNH oxidase pathway. The relation of DPNH oxidase activity to NaCl concentration and the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme in the absence of salt reflect the behavior of a single component of the system, DPNH dehydrogenase. The place of the b-type cytochromes in the proposed electron transport scheme is confirmed through the determination of salt dependence curves."
https://openalex.org/W1563025093,"Abstract Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.2.3.2) has been shown to reduce the N-oxide function of several purine N-oxide derivatives. The reaction requires anaerobic conditions and electron donors such as xanthine, hypoxanthine, sodium dithionite, or DPNH. With no other electron donor present, the purine N-oxide can also serve as the electron donor if it has an oxidizable carbon atom. With sodium dithionite as the electron donor, a spectrometric procedure has been devised which permits measurement of the enzymatic reduction of N-oxides or other compounds by monitoring the disappearance of the dithionite absorption. The enzymatic synthesis of 8-hydroxyguanine 3-oxide is described."
https://openalex.org/W1603069747,"A nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-specific isocitric dehydrogenase has been isolated and purified 450-fold from Blastocladiella emersonii. The enzyme has a monomeric molecular weight of 110,000 ± 10,000. It is capable of aggregating to polymers of molecular weight ranging from 200,000 to 500,000 and higher at acid pH levels. At alkaline pH values, it exists as a monomer. The aggregated enzyme is inactive and the monomer is active. Under the influence of various ligands (citrate, isocitrate, Mn++, Mg++), the aggregated enzyme can be converted to the monomer. A difference of 1 pH unit (6.5 to 7.5) changes the association-dissociation equilibrium in favor of monomer formation from the polymeric form. The enzyme was shown to exist as two distinct ionized forms with pH optima at 6.5 and 9.0. By a complex series of ligand interactions over a wide range of pH values, the two pH optima disappear and a single ionized species becomes evident with a pH optimum at 8. Although isocitrate and NAD+ display cooperative interactions, at low pH levels and high NAD+ concentrations, NAD+ is incapable of dissociating the polymer into monomer whereas isocitrate can. The same incompetence is shown by AMP but not by citrate, both of which are allosteric activators. Kinetic analyses have shown that the kinetic mechanism may be ordered binary-ternary. Attempts have been made to relate these and other findings to a system of regulation by which this enzyme is coupled to the glutamic dehydrogenase found in the mitochondria. Very tenuous correlations have been proposed for the participation of this regulatory mechanism in the germination process in this organism."
https://openalex.org/W1514776781,"Abstract Pyridoxal dehydrogenase was partially purified from extracts of Pseudomonas sp. MA grown on pyridoxamine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, and shown to catalyze Reaction i. [see PDF for equation] Pyridoxal dehydrogenase is specific for DPN+ and does not oxidize benzaldehyde, acetaldehyde, salicylaldehyde, or 5-deoxypyridoxal. In the presence of the latter compound, oxidation of pyridoxal is stimulated, apparently because of the occurrence of the dismutation reaction (ii). 2-Demethyl-2-ethylpyridoxal is dehydrogenated at the same rate as pyridoxal. At high substrate concentrations the pH [see PDF for equation] optimum of pyridoxal dehydrogenase is above 9.3; at pH 9.3 the Km values for pyridoxal and DPN+ are 0.076 mm and 0.29 mm, respectively. Reaction i appears to be irreversible. o-Phenanthroline and some other chelating agents inhibit the enzyme, but m- and p-phenanthroline (which do not act as chelating agents) are much more potent inhibitors with Ki values of about 1.0 µm. 4-Pyridoxolactonase, which catalyzes Reaction iii, also occurs in this same organism. It acts optimally at pH 7.7, [see PDF for equation] has a Km value of 3.1 µm, and, at the stage of purity achieved, requires no added cofactors. m- and p-Phenanthroline also inhibit this enzyme, but only at concentrations much higher than those that inhibit pyridoxal dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1901184220,"Abstract 1. The two C4 protons of the dihydropyridine ring of reduced coenzymes appear as an AB spectrum in the 220 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance system. This indicates that they are chemically and magnetically nonequivalent. 2. When the oxidized coenzyme is converted to the reduced coenzyme, the coupling constant of C'1H of ribose adjacent to the pyridine increased by about 3.5 Hz, whereas the same of the ribose adjacent to the adenine remained constant. This indicates that, when the oxidized pyridine dinucleotide is reduced, the ribose attached to the pyridine ring undergoes a conformational change, the conformation of the ribose attached to the adenine remaining the same in both oxidized and reduced coenzymes. 3. The C'1H of the ribose adjacent to pyridine of reduced coenzymes is substantially broadened, and this broadening increased at elevated temperatures. This is due to onset of unresolved nitrogen spin-spin coupling as a result of the alteration of the relaxation time of nitrogen dominated by quadrupole coupling. This observation provides the most unequivocal method for assigning the chemical shift of the C'1H of ribose attached to the pyridine of reduced coenzyme. 4. Startling changes take place in the shape and position of the ribose protons as a result of the reduction of the oxidized coenzyme. It is thought to result from an alteration in the geometric posture of the diphosphate backbone as a result of the reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2006194402,"Complex synaptic configurations which appear to have especial evolutionary and functional significance are shown in the neuropil of the brain of the planarian Dugesia dorotocephala. Some of the endings in these synaptic attachments contain dense core vesicles, suggesting that nonadrenaline or serotonin or both are neurotransmitters at a more primitive phyletic level than reported hitherto. The spatial proximity and connectivity of the synapses suggest modes of action permitting greater functional complexity to the planarian brain than previously supposed. Closely adjacent cellular processes which contain polysomal ribosomes, unusual in the neuropil, suggest synaptic transmission-protein synthesis coupling and a possible role in memory."
https://openalex.org/W1481734446,"Abstract Kinetic studies on the purified lobster muscle lactate dehydrogenase indicate that the reaction catalyzing the oxidation of lactate by DPN+ is modulated by the product DPNH. At low concentrations DPNH activates the reaction and at higher concentrations inhibits it. The combined effects of positive and negative modulations in activity result in sigmoidal rate patterns and rate plotted against DPN+ or l-lactate concentrations yields sigmoidal plots. The sigmoid patterns are converted to rectangular hyperbolas when the reaction is carried out in the presence of added reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide. The kinetic features of the reaction catalyzing the oxidation of lactate by DPN+ have the general characteristics of second order autocatalyzed reactions. The reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotides are specific modulators of the reaction, the 3-acetylpyridine analogue of DPNH being a more effective modulator. The reaction catalyzing the reduction of pyruvate by DPNH follows normal Michaelis-Menton kinetics. A model is proposed based on the concept of subunit interactions controlling enzymatic activity to explain DPNH-effected modulations in the rate of lactate oxidation by DPN+. The oxidized and reduced forms of the diphosphopyridine nucleotides occupy the same sites on the protein; hence, in the proposed model a separate and distinct regulatory site for the effector molecule is not implicated. It is proposed that the binding of the reduced nucleotide to one or more of the four binding sites on the enzyme causes a structural change in the protein so that the binding of the oxidized nucleotide to another available site is facilitated. Such a model provides a reasonable explanation to account for the anomalous kinetics of the lobster lactate dehydrogenase. Product-induced positive and negative modulations in the rate of lactate oxidation provide the system with a built-in regulatory mechanism whereby the product DPNH controls the rate of its own production."

https://openalex.org/W1977399702,Hamster lens epithelium infected with simian virus 40 underwent transformation in vitro and produced tumors when injected into homologous hosts. Undisturbed lens epithelium in man and experimental animals has not been observed to undergo neoplastic change. The virus-induced tumors contained undifferentiated cells that were either polygonal or spindle-shaped. Their origin from lens epithelium seems certain since it is possible to isolate this unique structure free of connective tissue and blood vessels.

We have already reported that the aldolase B found in the normal rat liver disappeared in the fast growing and highly malignant rat hepatomas and, instead, aldolase A was produced. In slowly growing rat hepatomas, aldolase A, aldolase B and their hybrids were observed4. The existence of aldolase C in the brain attracted our attention and led us to investigate the aldolase isozyme patterns of human brain tumours."

https://openalex.org/W1548088364,"Abstract Under the conditions for oxidative degradation, with a 2-fold molar excess of periodate and cyclohexylamine at room temperature, ψMP is degraded to inorganic phosphate but fails to release the base. In this latter respect, the parent pseudouridine behaves similarly. Under more drastic conditions, with a prolonged treatment at 45° and a 6-fold molar excess of periodate and cyclohexylamine, ψMP is degraded to inorganic phosphate and a mixture of 5-formyluracil and 5-carboxyuracil. The apparent pKa values of 5-formyluracil, calculated from ultraviolet absorption spectra at various pH values, are 6.8 and g11.2. The same constants of 5-carboxyuracil are 4.3,9.15, and g13.2. Analysis of the spectral data shows that in both of these 5-substituted uracil derivatives anion formation involves loss of a proton from N-1 rather than from N-3 of the uracil ring."
https://openalex.org/W1512755669,"Abstract The binding of copper to bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A, its carboxymethylated histidine-119 and histidine-12 derivatives, ribonuclease S and S-protein, has been investigated at pH 5 and 6 by measuring the enhancement of the magnetic proton relaxation rate (PRR) of water due to bound copper. The magnitude of the PRR enhancement factor is characteristic for the binding site and reflects its protein environment. Titrations of copper and protein yield values of the binding constants and the number of sites and reveal interaction between binding sites. At pH 5, RNase A and RNase S exhibit three independent binding sites, one strong binding site with a dissociation constant, Kd, of 6 to 7 x 10-4 m and two weaker ones with Kd of approximately 8 x 10-3 m. The 1-carboxymethylhistidine-119-RNase and Sprotein have only two binding sites, one strong and one weak, and 3-carboxymethyl histidine-12-RNase has one strong site. The enhancement of the strong site, ebb1, is 6.1 for RNase A, almost the same for the 1-carboxymethylhistidine119-RNase, 5.9, but significantly lower for RNase S, 5.1, suggesting a more flexible structure for RNase S at the first Cu(II)-binding site. Modification of histidine-12 by carboxymethylation results in a drastic change in the environment of this Cu(II)-binding site, ebb1 = 30. To a lesser extent, removal of S-peptide also results in an increased value of ebb1 at the tight binding site, ebb1 = 9.0 in S-protein. At pH 6.0, the binding patterns become much more complex; all species except the histidine-12 derivative exhibit cooperativity in Cu(II) binding and some association, rendering it impossible to extract the number of sites or values of Kd and eb for individual sites from the data. 3-Carboxylmethylhistidine-12-RNase is exceptional in that it reveals two equivalent noninteracting binding sites at pH 6, Kd equals 4 x 10-4 m, and eb equals 24.3. Measurements of the enhancement as a function of temperature indicated that the chemical exchange of water ligands in the Cu(II) ribonuclease complexes is so fast that the observed relaxation rates of all of the complexes are determined by the dipolar correlation time in the first hydration sphere of Cu(II). The magnitude of the energies of activation of 3 to 5 kcal per mole indicates that rotational motion determines the relaxation rate. The inhibitor constants for Cu(II) were determined at pH 5 for RNase A and RNase S, respectively, with cytidine2', 3'-cyclic phosphate as substrate and agreed within a factor of 2 or less with the Kd of the tight binding site determined from PRR enhancement data. In electron paramagnetic resonance spectra at pH 5 of solutions of Cu(II) and RNase A, two peaks were observed corresponding to free copper and bound copper. Titrations of RNase A with Cu(II) by electron paramagnetic resonance yielded the same values for free Cu(II) as those calculated from the PRR enhancement data, indicating that all of the Cu(II)-binding sites were enhanced and that the PRR data accounted for the total Cu(II) bound. On the basis of the enhancement data and other known properties of RNase A, the strong Cu(II)-binding site is tentatively assigned to histidine-12 and the two weaker sites to histidine-105 and histidine-119."
https://openalex.org/W1990198794,"IN 1952 Skeggs et al.1 published a method for extracting angiotensin from blood, and several authors have since dealt with the measurement of circulating angiotensin in man and experimental animals2–6. In all cases the concentration of angiotensin was measured by bioassay in the rat. The concentrations of circulating angiotensin found by these methods in normal and hypertensive subjects, and in experimental animals, are variable. This may be either because of variable recoveries or because of the inaccuracies inherent in bioassay."
