https://openalex.org/W1963690512,"Gonadal failure induces bone loss while obesity prevents it. This raises the possibility that bone mass, body weight, and gonadal function are regulated by common pathways. To test this hypothesis, we studied leptin-deficient and leptin receptor–deficient mice that are obese and hypogonadic. Both mutant mice have an increased bone formation leading to high bone mass despite hypogonadism and hypercortisolism. This phenotype is dominant, independent of the presence of fat, and specific for the absence of leptin signaling. There is no leptin signaling in osteoblasts but intracerebroventricular infusion of leptin causes bone loss in leptin-deficient and wild-type mice. This study identifies leptin as a potent inhibitor of bone formation acting through the central nervous system and therefore describes the central nature of bone mass control and its disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2058416613,"We have found that epithelial cells engage in a process of cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion that utilizes calcium and actin polymerization in unexpected ways. Calcium stimulates filopodia, which penetrate and embed into neighboring cells. E-cadherin complexes cluster at filopodia tips, generating a two-rowed zipper of embedded puncta. Opposing cell surfaces are clamped by desmosomes, while vinculin, zyxin, VASP, and Mena are recruited to adhesion zippers by a mechanism that requires alpha-catenin. Actin reorganizes and polymerizes to merge puncta into a single row and seal cell borders. In keratinocytes either null for alpha-catenin or blocked in VASP/Mena function, filopodia embed, but actin reorganization/polymerization is prevented, and membranes cannot seal. Taken together, a dynamic mechanism for intercellular adhesion is unveiled involving calcium-activated filopodia penetration and VASP/Mena-dependent actin reorganization/polymerization."

https://openalex.org/W2091701502,"Binding interactions between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton define cell functions such as cell shape, formation of cell processes, cell movement, and endocytosis. Here we use optical tweezers tether force measurements and show that plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) acts as a second messenger that regulates the adhesion energy between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. Receptor stimuli that hydrolyze PIP2 lowered adhesion energy, a process that could be mimicked by expressing PH domains that sequester PIP2 or by targeting a 5'-PIP2-phosphatase to the plasma membrane to selectively lower plasma membrane PIP2 concentration. Our study suggests that plasma membrane PIP2 controls dynamic membrane functions and cell shape by locally increasing and decreasing the adhesion between the actin-based cortical cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1986595328,"We have identified the 30-zinc finger protein OAZ as a DNA-binding factor that associates with Smads in response to BMP2, forming a complex that transcriptionally activates the homeobox regulator of Xenopus mesoderm and neural development, Xvent-2. OAZ contains a BMP signaling module formed by two clusters of fingers that bind Smads and the Xvent-2 BMP response element, respectively. Previously implicated as a transcriptional partner of Olf-1/EBF in olfactory epithelium and lymphocyte development in the rat, OAZ fulfills this role through clusters of fingers that are separate from the BMP signaling module. The mutually exclusive use of OAZ by the BMP-Smad and Olf pathways illustrates the dual role of a multi-zinc finger protein in signal transduction during development."

https://openalex.org/W2004559462,"The yeast [PSI+] factor is inherited by a prion mechanism involving self-propagating Sup35p aggregates. We find that Sup35p prion function is conserved among distantly related yeasts. As with mammalian prions, a species barrier inhibits prion induction between Sup35p from different yeast species. This barrier is faithfully reproduced in vitro where, remarkably, ongoing polymerization of one Sup35p species does not affect conversion of another. Chimeric analysis identifies a short domain sufficient to allow foreign Sup35p to cross this barrier. These observations argue that the species barrier results from specificity in the growing aggregate, mediated by a well-defined epitope on the amyloid surface and, together with our identification of a novel yeast prion domain, show that multiple prion-based heritable states can propagate independently within one cell."

https://openalex.org/W2049980665,"Hemolysin E (HlyE) is a novel pore-forming toxin of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Shigella flexneri. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the water-soluble form of E. coli HlyE at 2.0 A resolution and the visualization of the lipid-associated form of the toxin in projection at low resolution by electron microscopy. The crystal structure reveals HlyE to be the first member of a new family of toxin structures, consisting of an elaborated helical bundle some 100 A long. The electron micrographs show how HlyE oligomerizes in the presence of lipid to form transmembrane pores. Taken together, the data from these two structural techniques allow us to propose a simple model for the structure of the pore and for membrane interaction."

Earlier studies have shown that it can act like a molecular chaperone and form a stable complex with partially unfolded proteins. We have observed that prior binding of the hydrophobic protein melittin to α-crystallin diminishes its chaperone-like activity toward denaturing alcohol dehydrogenase, suggesting the presence of mutually exclusive sites for these proteins in α-crystallin. To investigate the mechanism of the interaction between α-crystallin and substrate proteins, we determined the melittin-binding sites in α-crystallin by cross-linking studies. Localization of melittin-binding sites in α-crystallin resulted in the identification of RTLGPFYPSR and FVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK of αA-crystallin and FSVNLDVK of αB-crystallin as the chaperone sites. Of these sites, FVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK and FSVNLDVK were identified earlier as 1,1′-bi(4-anilino) naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS)-binding hydrophobic sites. Here we also report the synthesis and characterization of the peptide, KFVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK, having the melittin as well as bis-ANS-binding sequence of αA-crystallin. We show that this peptide has characteristics similar to that of αA-crystallin by in vitro thermal aggregation assay, gel filtration study, CD spectroscopy, and bis-ANS interaction studies. The peptide sequence corresponds to the β3 and β4 region present in the α-crystallin domain of sHSP 16.5. We hypothesize that the α-crystallin domain in other sHSPs may have a similar function and would likely possess the anti-aggregation property even when separated from the native protein.

Landry J. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). α-Crystallin, the most abundant of the lens proteins, belongs to this group due to its structural and functional similarities (2.Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin is composed of αA and αB subunits of ∼20 kDa each and exists as a polydisperse oligomer with an average molecular mass of 800 kDa (3.Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies carried out in the past, the quaternary structure or the structure-function of α-crystallin or its subunits has remained an enigma. The available data suggest that the protein has high amounts of β-sheets. The α-crystallin subunits, once thought to be lens-specific, are now widely known to be present in other tissues as well (4.Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 5.Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki T. Liem R.K.H. Goldman J.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Like all other heat shock proteins α-crystallin also displays chaperone-like activity and forms stable complexes with a wide variety of chemically or thermally denatured proteins (6.Horwitz J. Proc.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been reported that α-crystallin isolated from aged lenses has decreased chaperone-like activity (11.Takemoto L. Boyle D. Curr.

A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) have led to the formulation of the hypothesis that α-crystallin may be involved in the maintenance of eye lens transparency via its chaperone-like function. In view of the suggested physiological role for the chaperone-like function of α-crystallin, several studies carried out recently investigated the critical residues required for the chaperone-like function of α-crystallin subunits. The C-terminal region of αA-crystallin (15.Takemoto L., T. Emmons T. Horwitz J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16.Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A.

Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) have all been suggested to be necessary for chaperone-like activity. We have reported that the residues 57–69 and 93–107 in αB-crystallins are involved in chaperoning ADH (10.Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the hydrophobic sites in α-crystallin are responsible for the chaperone-like activity (20.Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 369: 321-325Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar) as in the case of molecular chaperone GroEL (22.Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine the role of specific hydrophobic sites in α-crystallin, we have recently determined those sites using hydrophobic probes. We determined that residues 50–54 and 79–99 in αA-crystallin and residues 75–103 in αB-crystallin are bis-ANS-binding sites (23.Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because prior binding of bis-ANS to α-crystallin results in diminished chaperone-like activity (24.Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we concluded that the hydrophobic sites participate in chaperone-like activity of the protein. However, it is not clear which of the hydrophobic sites are also chaperone sites because there is disagreement between the residues necessary for chaperone activity and the bis-ANS-binding sites (15.Takemoto L., T. Emmons T. Horwitz J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16.Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of chaperone sites in α-crystallin by cross-linking melittin and show that the melittin-binding site and the bis-ANS-binding sites overlap. For the first time we also show that a 19-amino acid peptide sequence from αA-crystallin, containing melittin and bis-ANS-binding sequences, possesses an anti-aggregating property similar to that of αA-crystallin. α-Crystallin was isolated from young bovine lenses and purified as described (10.Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). αA-Crystallin was isolated according to the procedure described elsewhere (23.Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All peptides used in this study were synthesized by t-Boc chemistry at Research Genetics and purified by the reverse phase HPLC method. The peptide concentrations were determined by Biuret method. Melittin was purchased from Sigma and purified by reverse phase HPLC. The multifunctional cross-linker, sulfosuccinimidyl-2-[6-(biotinamido)-2-(p-azidobenzamido)-hexanoamido]-1,3′ dithiopropionate (Sulfo-SBED) was from Pierce, and insulin and ADH were from Sigma. Citrate synthase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. 5 mg of melittin was treated with Sulfo-SBED in 50 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide for 30 min in the dark. Sulfo-SBED-melittin was purified using a Sephadex-G15 column and mixed with 40 mg of α-crystallin at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. The sample was photolyzed with UV lamp at 366 nm for 15 min on ice with stirring. The complex was purified on a Bio-Gel A 0.5 column. The α-crystallin-Sulfo-SBED-melittin complex was digested with trypsin (1:50 ratio) for 18 h at 37 °C, after which trypsin was inhibited with diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The peptides released were reduced with dithiothreitol, and the biotin containing peptides were purified by Avidin-Sepharose chromatography according to the manufacturer's (Pierce) instruction. The peptides eluted from the avidin column were separated on a reverse phase C18 column using a 0–60% acetonitrile gradient (23.Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Using avidin-peroxidase and 4-chloro-1-naphthol, the presence of biotinyl group in peptides was confirmed. The peptides that gave a positive reaction with avidin-peroxidase assay were sequenced at the Protein Core Facility of University of Missouri on an Applied Biosystems PROCISE CLC protein sequencing system. The capacity of the different peptides to protect against heat-induced denaturation of ADH was measured according to the procedure described earlier (9.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.-L. Ding L.-L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10.Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, a known amount of target protein (200–300 μg) was heated in 50 mm PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, and 0.1 mNaCl in the presence or absence of the different peptides in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The assays were performed at 48 °C using ADH, at 37 °C using insulin (9.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.-L. Ding L.-L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and at 42 °C using citrate synthase (26.Jakob U. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The aggregation of denaturing proteins was monitored by measuring the apparent absorption caused by light scattering at 360 nm for ADH, at 400 nm for insulin, and at 320 nm for citrate synthase, as a function of time in a Shimadzu spectrophotometer equipped with multicell transporter with a Peltier temperature regulator. A Biogel P-30 size exclusion column (1.5 × 80 cm) chromatography was performed to test the complex formation between ADH and the peptide 1D. Briefly, ADH (2 mg) and the peptide (0.5 mg) were mixed in 1.0 ml of 0.05m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and heated at 48 °C for 1 h. After cooling, the sample was passed through the Bio-gel column equilibrated with 0.05 m PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl. 2-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 10 ml/hr. Similarly, a control sample containing ADH and the peptide without heating was also processed simultaneously. Chromatography of the peptide alone was performed separately. The void volume (V o) was determined using purified α-crystallin. The Biogel P-30 size exclusion chromatography peak fraction containing ADH (see Fig. 3 b) was treated with 4 m urea to dissociate the bound peptide. The solution was filtered through a 10-kDa Centricon filter to recover the released peptide. The filtrate was injected on to a Vydac C18 analytical column (218TP54) equilibrated with water + 5% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A). The elution of the bound peptide was carried out with a linear gradient (0–90%) formed by mixing of solvent A and solvent B (100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). A flow rate of 1 ml/min over 45 min was maintained, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The elution was monitored at 220 nm for absorption. The molecular weight of the peptide was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization analysis at Research Genetics. The far UV CD spectra of purified peptides were recorded at 25 °C over the range of 200–250 nm on an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter. To obtain a spectra, an aliquot of the peptide solution (0.9–1.1 mm in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7) was placed in a quartz cell of 0.01-cm path length. The spectra shown is the average of five scans after correcting for solvent blanks. Earlier studies have shown that α-crystallin can bind insulin B chain, melittin, and denatured ADH (9.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.-L. Ding L.-L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10.Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kester K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether melittin (2.8-kDa polypeptide) and a larger protein such as ADH (140 kDa) bind to α-crystallin at the same chaperone site, we studied the chaperone-like property of α-crystallin-melittin complex in a thermal unfolding and aggregation assay using ADH. In this experiment α-crystallin was first mixed with a known amount of melittin according to (9.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.-L. Ding L.-L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and the α-crystallin-melittin complex was tested for chaperone-like activity using ADH. By examining the results shown in Fig. 1, we concluded that melittin can block the binding of denatured ADH to α-crystallin. Peptides KIQTGLDATHAERAIPVSREEKPTSAPSS (the C-terminal 29 amino acid residues of α-crystallin), bradykinin, or the DnaK-binding peptide NRLLLTG (27.Gragerov A. Zeng L. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) were not able to block the binding of α-crystallin to denaturing ADH (data not shown). This indicated that the melittin interaction with α-crystallin is at or near the denaturing protein-binding region. It is also possible that melittin binding to α-crystallin may have induced a conformational change in the protein, which in turn showed decreased protection of denaturing ADH. In concentrations used in the study, melittin alone showed no influence on the aggregation kinetics of ADH. Having established that melittin, a 2.8-kDa hydrophobic polypeptide, and the 140-kDa protein ADH bind to α-crystallin at a mutually exclusive site, we cross-linked melittin to α-crystallin using a tri-functional cross-linker, Sulfo-SBED (28.Geselowitz D.A. Neumann R.D. Bioconjugate Chem. 1995; 6: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using this cross-linker we determined the melittin-binding sites in αA- and αB-crystallins. We discovered that amino acid residues 13–21 and 71–88 in αA-crystallin and residues 70–78 in αB-crystallin are the sequences that interact with melittin. The residues 71–78 of αA-crystallin represent the most hydrophobic region (29.Smith J.B. Liu Y. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and part of the bis-ANS-binding site in αA-crystallin (23.Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The melittin-binding site discovered now in αB-crystallin, residues 70–79, is a bis-ANS-binding site (23.Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above data suggest that the residues 71–88 in αA-crystallin and residues 70–79 in αB-crystallin are at least part of chaperone sites. It has been shown in GroEL system that hydrophobic sites at the rim region of the oligomeric protein is responsible for binding denatured proteins by bis-ANS binding and site-directed mutagenesis studies (22.Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30.Fenton W.A Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Because the exact quaternary structure of α-crystallin is not known, the precise location of the chaperone sites on this oligomeric protein can only be speculated. A sequence comparison of α-crystallin subunits with that of theMethanococcus jannaschii sHSP 16.5, for which the crystal structure is available (31.Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), shows that the chaperone sites in αA- and αB-crystallins reported here, residues 71–88 and 70–79, respectively, correspond to the two β sheet regions β3 and β4 of sHSP 16.5. The β3 and β4 are solvent-accessible. Therefore, one can argue that the chaperone sites in α-crystallin are also solvent accessible and the denaturing proteins bind to the surface of α-crystallin molecule. Earlier we showed that melittin competed with ADH for a binding site on α-crystallin. Therefore we hypothesized that a synthetic peptide, representing an active site of αA-crystallin was likely to bind to denaturing ADH. The test results shown in Fig.2 A confirms that this was the case. The peptide KFVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK (residues 70–88 of αA-crystallin, Peptide 1A) was able to prevent aggregation and precipitation of denaturing ADH. However, a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of αA-crystallin (KIQTGLDATHAERAIPVSREEKPTSAPSS, residues 145–173), presumed to be one of the regions responsible for the chaperone-like activity (15.Takemoto L., T. Emmons T. Horwitz J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16.Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) was ineffective in suppressing the aggregation of denaturing proteins. Likewise, hydrophobic peptides bradykinin and DnaK chaperone-binding peptide, NRLLLTG (27.Gragerov A. Zeng L. Burkholder W. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), were inactive as anti-aggregating peptides (data not shown). An inverted sequence of Peptide 1A showed about one-tenth of the activity of the active peptide, suggesting a specific structural requirement for the anti-aggregation property of the peptide. These results show that the in vitro synthesized Peptide 1A is a functional element in αA-crystallin and can function independently. This was further confirmed by an in vitro experiment where prior binding of melittin to Peptide 1A was found to decrease the anti-aggregation property of the synthetic Peptide 1A (Fig.2 A). To determine the relative activity of the synthetic Peptide 1D (where the N-terminal Lys in Peptide 1A is replaced by Asp to increase solubility) and that of αA-crystallin, we tested the ability of Peptide 1D and isolated bovine αA-crystallin to suppress the aggregation of ADH in a thermal denaturation assay. The result is shown in Fig. 2 B. The data show that whereas 2.7 μmαA-crystallin was able to suppress the aggregation of 1.8 μm ADH by 70%, 22 μm Peptide 1D was needed to suppress the aggregation of 1.8 μm of ADH to the same extent. Although the molar concentration of the peptide 1D required to suppress the aggregation of denaturing ADH was about 8-fold higher than that of αA-crystallin, this is first report that a 19-amino acid peptide displays anti-aggregation property similar to that of αA-crystallin in vitro. This also confirms that the chaperone site in αA-crystallin, determined by cross-linking melittin and bis-ANS is the true chaperone site. Peptide 1D and Peptide 1A also suppressed the aggregation of insulin B chain and heat-denatured citrate synthase (data not shown). It was reported earlier, that glutathione (10–20 mm) strongly inhibits ADH aggregation (32.Clark J.I. Huang Q.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15185-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, in the present study when glutathione (22 μm) was used in place of the peptide 1D, no inhibition of ADH aggregation was observed. Further, addition of peptide 1D (22–44 μm) to the aggregated ADH did not solubilize the protein, suggesting that the peptide does not behave like a detergent. After observing the anti-aggregating properties in a 19-amino acid synthetic peptide (Peptide 1A), we investigated the minimum sequence of Peptide 1A essential to exhibit this activity (TableI). Although the removal of Lys from the N terminus of Peptide 1A did not result in a significant change in its functional activity, further deletion of amino acids from the N terminus completely abolished the property of Peptide 1A (Table I). The removal of DLTVK from the C terminus of Peptide 1A also completely abolished its function. Table II shows the results from a study involving peptides with substitutions at the N-terminal Lys or Phe2 of Peptide 1A. Interestingly, the substitution of Asp for Lys at the N terminus increased the solubility of Peptide 1A without significantly altering its function. The substitution of Phe2 of Peptide 1A with a neutral amino acid Gly (Peptide 1G) abolished >85% of the activity. When Tyr, an aromatic amino acid, was present at the second position in Peptide 1A, a 70% decrease in anti-aggregating property was observed. Furthermore, substitution with Arg for Phe at the second position resulted in complete loss of its function. These data show that an aromatic residue is necessary at the 2nd position in Peptide 1A to display anti-aggregation property. The αA-crystallin sequenced from all species to date have a highly conserved Phe in their sequence, corresponding to the Phe71 of human protein.Table IAnti-aggregation activity of truncated forms of Peptide 1ASequence of peptide addedConcentrationRelative light scattering by ADHμmKFVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK (Peptide 1A)2230FVIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK2325VIFLDVKHFSPEDLTVK2892LDVKHFSPEDLTVK41100KFVIFLDVKHFSPE28100RDKFVIFLDVKHFSPE24100Thermal denaturation and aggregation assay of ADH (1.8 μm) was carried out as described in Ref. 10.Sharma K.K.

Heat-induced aggregation assays of ADH (1.8 μm) was done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Studies with molecular chaperone GroEL have shown that hydrophobic sites in that protein are involved in the binding of refolding proteins (22.Seale J.W. Martinez J.L. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7443-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown a correlation between α-crystallin hydrophobicity and its molecular chaperone properties (20.Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 369: 321-325Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23.Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The data included above and published earlier (23.Sharma K.K. Kumar G.S. Murphy A.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15474-15478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) show that the same sequence in αA-crystallin is involved in binding of bis-ANS and melittin and chaperone-like activity. This prompted us to test whether the peptide 1A can bind bis-ANS. The increase in the fluorescence of bis-ANS observed in the presence of peptide 1A was similar to that observed when α-crystallin is treated with bis-ANS (21.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 369: 321-325Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 24.Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Similar data were obtained when peptide 1D and bis-ANS were used (data not shown). These data confirm that the chaperone sites represent hydrophobic site(s). The observation of bis-ANS binding to a 19-amino acid linear peptide was surprising, because binding of bis-ANS or other fluorescent probes to only synthetic cyclical peptides has been reported earlier (33.Brazil B.T. Cleland J.L. McDowell R.S. Skelton N.J. Paris K. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5105-5111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,34.Byer C.F. Craig I.C. Gibbons W.A. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 241: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Various studies have shown that α-crystallin can prevent aggregation of proteins exposed to denaturing conditions and that during the process it binds and forms a complex with the denatured proteins (35.Rao P.V. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, to determine the mechanism of the peptide 1D anti-aggregation property, ADH and peptide were heated at 48 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature the mixture was passed through a Bio-gel P30 column. Fig. 3(a and b) shows the elution profile of the ADH and peptide 1D before and after heating. In the sample without heating, the ADH eluted in the void volume region with aV e/V o value of 1.06. The peptide by itself eluted withV e/V o value of 1.86. After heating, the ADH + peptide eluted in the same fractions as that of the unheated ADH, and the A 228 absorption was nearly equal to the sum of the components. The binding of the peptide 1D to ADH was also confirmed by urea dissociation, HPLC (Fig.3 b, inset), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization analysis. The elution profile of the native peptide (V e/V o 1.86) is shown in Fig. 3 c. These data show that the peptide binds to the thermally denatured ADH. The CD spectral analysis of Peptide 1D indicates a high degree of secondary structure, whereas the spectra of the same peptide in 6 m guanidine HCl shows no regular structure (Fig. 4). The ellipticity trough at 215 nm suggests a high degree of β sheet structure for the peptide. The CD spectra of the peptide shown in Fig.4 is similar to that of αA-crystallin (7.Merck K.B. Groenen P.J.T.A. Voorter C.E.M. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the CD data for peptide conformation (37.Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar) showed the following: α-helix = 9% β-sheet = 22% β-turns = 39%, and random coil = 28%. Previous studies (38.Bloemendal M. Toumadje A. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) on the secondary structure of α-crystallin by CD show the presence of 6% α-helix, 39% β-sheet, 13% β-turns, and others (coils + unordered) 41%. The peptide 1G, with Phe2 → Gly did not show secondary structure or anti-aggregating activity (Table II), suggesting a structural/conformational requirement for the function of the peptide. Therefore, we hypothesize that any age-related modifications occurringin vivo at the chaperone site that affect the secondary structure are likely to diminish the chaperone-like function of αA-crystallin. This may lead to an accelerated in vivoprotein aggregation resulting in cataract. Our results show that the N-terminal residues in the highly conserved α-crystallin domain of heat shock proteins are involved in chaperone-like activity. This is in contrast to earlier reports indicating that the α-crystallin domain alone has no chaperone activity (39.Merck K.B. Horwitz J. Kersten M. Overkamp P. Gaestel M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40.Leroux M. Ma B.J. Batelier G. Melki R. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12847-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Other reports suggest an active role to the C terminus of the protein in chaperone-like activity display (15.Takemoto L., T. Emmons T. Horwitz J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16.Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 258: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Another study with sHSP αB-crystallin reported that the N-terminal Phe-rich region is critical for chaperone-like activity (18.Plater M.L. Goode D. Crabbe M.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28558-28566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A sequence alignment of the chaperone site described here with that of HSP16.5 (data not shown), for which a crystal structure is available (31.Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar), shows that the αA-crystallin chaperone site reported here corresponds to the loop between two β sheets β3 and β4, of HSP 16.5. This loop is localized outside the sphere of this multimeric protein, which would be expected to be accessible for interaction with target proteins. The cysteine scanning study reported recently also shows that the same sequence also exists in β-sheet format in αA-crystallin and is accessible during chaperone assays (42.Mchaourab H.S. Koteiche H.A. Berengian A.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: S300Google Scholar). A corresponding sequence in plant protein HSP18.1 has also been found to bind bis-ANS and is predicted to be a chaperone site (43.Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Viierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). These data argue in favor of the presence of a common ancestral chaperone domain in sHSPs and the evolution of other domains for specific functions. The demonstration that a 19-amino acid peptide from the αA-crystallin domain possesses the hydrophobic site and anti-aggregation property suggests an important role for the α-crystallin domain of sHSPs in their function to suppress nonspecific aggregation of unfolded proteins.

We have been investigating the function of the small GTPase Rab5 in early endocytic transport. In vitro studies have demonstrated a role of Rab5 in two membrane fusion events: the heterotypic fusion between plasma membrane-derived clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and early endosomes and in the homotypic fusion between early endosomes. Several Rab5 effectors are required in homotypic endosome fusion, including EEA1, which mediates endosome membrane docking, as well as Rabaptin-5·Rabex-5 complex and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVPS34. In this study we have examined the localization and function of Rab5 and its effectors in heterotypic fusion in vitro. We report that the presence of active Rab5 is necessary on both CCVs and early endosomes for a heterotypic fusion event to occur. This process requires EEA1 in addition to the Rabaptin-5 complex. However, whereas Rab5 and Rabaptin-5 are symmetrically distributed between CCVs and early endosomes, EEA1 is recruited selectively onto the membrane of early endosomes. Our results suggest that EEA1 is a tethering molecule that provides directionality to vesicular transport from the plasma membrane to the early endosomes.

To ensure the proper directionality of membrane flow, the target organelle must possess appropriate molecular machinery allowing for specific recognition and docking of the incoming vesicle. The binding of membrane proteins of the transport vesicle, v-SNAREs,1 with membrane proteins of the target organelle, t-SNAREs, was initially proposed to be the central principle underlying vesicle targeting as well as membrane fusion (1.Sollner T.

It has become apparent, however, that v- and t-SNAREs (referred also as R- and Q-SNARES; Ref. 4.Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) do not display a tight segregation between vesicle and target membranes because both can be incorporated in transport vesicles and cycle between organelles (5.Garcia E.P.

Thus, SNARE pairing must be subjected to yet another layer of regulation to maintain the fidelity and vectoriality of vesicular transport. This function appears to be provided by the Rab family of small GTPases through their downstream effectors (10.Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin.

In accordance with this functional diversity, Rab5 lies at the center of a complex machinery comprising several effector proteins (13.Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R., D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Among them, the Rabaptin-5·Rabex-5 complex activates and stabilizes Rab5 in the GTP-bound conformation (19.Stenmark H.

Rab5 effectors can efficiently replace cytosol in homotypic EE fusion in vitro (13.Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R., D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Of these proteins, EEA1 was identified as a core component of the homotypic endosome docking and fusion machinery and was shown to play a role in the docking/tethering of endosome membranes (13.Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R., D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The membrane recruitment of EEA1 depends on Rab5-GTP as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) (21.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol.

EEA1 is predominantly localized to the early endosomes and is regarded as a specific marker of this compartment (25.Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Because of this localization and given its function in endosome membrane docking (13.Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R., D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that EEA1 may confer directionality to Rab5-dependent vesicular transport to the early endosomes. It has not yet been determined, however, whether the same molecular machinery that regulates homotypic EE fusion, and most notably EEA1, also controls the heterotypic CCV-EE fusion. It also remains to be established whether the presence of Rab5 and its effectors is necessary on both membranes undergoing heterotypic fusion or, alternatively, whether these components are asymmetrically distributed. Clearly, in homotypic EE fusion Rab proteins, their effectors, and SNAREs are evenly distributed between the fusion partners, rendering the study of directionality of membrane transport difficult. To address these questions, we have therefore examined the requirement for Rab5 and the membrane recruitment of the Rab5 effectors Rabaptin-5 and EEA1 in heterotypic CCV-EE fusion in vitro. CCVs labeled with biotinylated transferrin were prepared from HeLa cells by a modification of the procedure described by Woodman and Warren (26.Woodman P.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–4 × 1010 HeLa cells in suspension were concentrated about 20 times, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and incubated in a serum-free medium containing 50 μg/ml biotinylated transferrin for 3 min at 37 °C. The internalization was stopped by washing the cells twice in ice-cold vesicle buffer (140 mm sucrose, 70 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.6, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate). The cell pellet was then resuspended in two cell volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.6, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized with a potter homogenizer in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min and incubated with 0.1 mg/ml ribonuclease type A for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequent purification steps were performed according to the original protocol. EE labeled with anti-transferrin antibody were prepared as described (16.Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), and standard in vitro fusion assays were performed as described (20.Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M.

Preloading of EE or CCV with Rab5-XTPγS was done by incubating the membranes with 180 nm REP-1·His-Rab5D136N complex and 1 mm XTPγS for 5 min at 37 °C in the absence of ATP-regenerating system. Membrane recruitment assays were performed essentially as described (24.Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.-C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) using EE from HeLa cells and CCVs from human placenta purified according to Steel et al. (27.Steel G.J. Tagaya M. Woodman P.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) except for the recovery of membranes by ultracentrifugation which was done using a 10% sucrose cushion. The following procedures were previously described: purification of RabGDI from bovine brain cytosol (20.Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K.

Horiuchi H. Alexandrov K. Zerial M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); preparation of REP-1·His-Rab5D136N complex (29.Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar); synthesis of XTPγS (30.Goody R.S. Eckstein F. Schirmer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); and the immunodepletion of EEA1 (23.Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) or Rabaptin5·Rabex5 complex (20.Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M.

The rabbit affinity-purified anti-EEA1 antibodies (23.Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) used in the fusion assays were a kind gift of Dr. H. Stenmark. To investigate the recruitment of Rab5 effectors onto CCVs and EE, we first tested whether the presence of active Rab5 is necessary on both membrane partners undergoing heterotypic fusion. For this purpose, we took advantage of an in vitro assay measuring fusion between CCVs containing internalized biotinylated transferrin (donor membranes) and EE labeled with anti-transferrin antibody (acceptor membranes) (20.Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Fusion signals were quantified as percentage of the basal reaction (Fig. 1, lane 2) performed in the presence of 3 mg/ml cytosol and ATP-regenerating system. Omission of cytosol (Fig. 1, lane 1) or ATP-regenerating system (lane 3) markedly reduced fusion, demonstrating that this process depends on the supply of soluble proteins and energy. To test for Rab5 requirement, we employed the Rab5D136N mutant that binds xanthosine nucleotides with high affinity (31.Weijland A. Parmeggiani A. Science. 1993; 259: 1311-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor (RabGDI) extracts endogenous Rab proteins from the membrane in the GDP-bound form, this particular mutant can be rendered resistant to extraction by RabGDI in the presence of XTPγS (29.Rybin V. Ullrich O. Rubino M. Alexandrov K. Simon I. Seabra M.C. Goody R. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 383: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Therefore this system allowed us to test the activity of Rab5D136N in endocytic membrane fusion in the absence of endogenous functional Rab5. Donor CCVs and acceptor EE were separately pre-loaded with Rab5D136N upon delivery through its chaperone Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1; Ref. 32.Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) in the presence of XTPγS. This pre-incubation step was performed in the absence of ATP-regenerating system to prevent membrane fusion. Subsequently, donor and acceptor membranes were combined and allowed to fuse under standard conditions, in the absence (Fig. 1, lane 4) or presence of 0.5 μm RabGDI to remove endogenous Rab5 (Fig. 1,lanes 5–8) as well as other Rab proteins (33.Araki S. Kikuchi A. Hata Y. Isomura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of both fusing partners with Rab5D136N·XTPγS in the absence of RabGDI (Fig. 1, lane 4) caused a more than 3-fold increase in the fusion efficiency, thus indicating that the mutant protein is functionally active. Consistently, removal of Rab proteins by RabGDI completely inhibited the fusion of CCVs and EE (Fig. 1,lane 5). The pretreatment of one set of membranes (either donor or acceptor) with Rab5D136N·XTPγS failed to restore membrane fusion in the presence of RabGDI (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and7, respectively). Only when both membranes were preloaded with Rab5D136N·XTPγS, was the RabGDI-mediated inhibition of CCV-EE fusion rescued (Fig. 1, lane 8). The level of rescued fusion did not reach the efficiency observed upon Rab5D136N stimulation in the absence of RabGDI (Fig. 1, lane 4) because of the removal of endogenous Rab5. These results indicate that active Rab5 is necessary on both membrane partners in the heterotypic CCV-EE fusion, as previously determined for the homotypic fusion between early endosomes (35.Barbieri M.A. Hoffenberg S. Roberts R. Mukhopadhyay A. Pomrehn A. Dickey B.F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25850-25855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 2R. Lippé and M. Zerial, unpublished data. The requirement for Rab5 on both CCV and EE raises the question of whether the Rab5 effectors which function in homotypic EE fusion (13.Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R., D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar,20.Horiuchi H. Lippé R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K.

Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) are also symmetrically distributed between the donor CCV and acceptor EE membranes. We first examined the requirement for EEA1 in the heterotypic CCV-EE fusion. When the fusion reaction was conducted in the presence of anti-EEA1 antibodies a 60% reduction of the fusion signal was observed compared with the basal reaction (Fig.2). This inhibition was specific as preimmune serum did not significantly affect the reaction. Do the antibodies inhibit the membrane-bound pool of EEA1 or the cytosolic fraction that is recruited on the endosome membrane? This question was addressed in a second set of experiments where EEA1 was depleted from cytosol using anti-EEA1 antibodies or preimmune serum prior to adding it to the assay. As shown in Fig. 2, cytosol depleted for EEA1 did not support CCV-EE fusion, in contrast to the cytosol treated with preimmune serum. These data establish the requirement for EEA1 in the heterotypic fusion between EE and CCVs and, more importantly, demonstrate that the cytosolic pool of EEA1 is required for the fusion reaction. Given that the association of EEA1 with the membrane is necessary for the homotypic fusion between EE (23.Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 36.Mills I.G. Jones A.T. Clague M.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 881-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the data presented so far argue that the heterotypic fusion reaction requires the translocation of EEA1 from cytosol to the membrane. Does the distribution of EEA1 between EE and CCV reflect the symmetrical localization of Rab5? Given the dynamic equilibrium between cytosolic- and membrane-bound pools, it is necessary to examine the membrane recruitment of Rab5 effectors rather than their steady-state distribution in sub-cellular fractions. For this purpose, we tested the ability of CCV and EE to recruit cytosolic EEA1 and Rabaptin-5 in vitro. Aliquots of EE or CCVs were incubated with cytosol under standard fusion assay conditions. Subsequently, the membranes were recovered by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and the presence of bound proteins was detected by immunoblotting. The recovery of membranes was controlled by monitoring the presence of an endocytic t-SNARE, syntaxin 13 (14.McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 37.Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 38.Tang B.L. Tan A.E. Lim L.K. Lee S.S. Low D.Y. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6944-6950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As a further control, EE and CCV membranes were incubated under the assay conditions without cytosol or any reagent, and reisolated by ultracentrifugation. Under the experimental conditions used, EEA1 and Rabaptin-5 were hardly detectable in the pelleted membranes (Fig. 3 A,right panels), indicating that these proteins are not stably associated with, but translocate to, the membranes during the incubation with cytosol. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the binding pattern of the two Rab5 effectors was clearly different. Rabaptin-5 was efficiently recruited from cytosol onto both CCV and EE membranes, whereas EEA1 was found associated preferentially with EE with only background amounts detected on CCVs. The membrane association was modulated by Rab5 as recruitment of Rabaptin-5 and EEA1 on the endosome membranes was inhibited by addition of RabGDI and stimulated by Rab5-RabGDI complex. However, even upon loading CCVs with exogenous Rab5, EEA1 failed to be efficiently recruited onto these membranes. Moreover, the recruitment of Rabaptin-5 and EEA1 onto EE seemed to be functionally coupled. When Rabaptin-5 and Rabex-5 were immunodepleted from cytosol, the efficiency of EEA1 recruitment onto EE was decreased (Fig. 3 B). Removal of Rabaptin-5·Rabex-5 complex from cytosol also did not enable the EEA1 binding to CCVs (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the Rabaptin-5·Rabex-5 complex competes with EEA1 for Rab5 binding on the vesicles. These results therefore establish that EEA1 is primarily, if not exclusively, recruited on the acceptor organelle in the heterotypic CCV-EE fusion. EEA1 is a core component of the early endocytic transport machinery. It is required for docking and, subsequently, for fusion between EE. Morphological studies have shown that this protein is absent from the plasma membrane (25.Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and our results demonstrate that it is unable to associate with CCVs in vitro. This is in contrast to the broad distribution of SNAREs, and in particular of syntaxin 13, which functions in endosome fusion (14.McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and is also present on CCVs (Fig.3 A). Based on previous data and the results reported here, we propose that EEA1 specifies the target compartment in the heterotypic CCV-EE fusion and thus confers directionality to vesicular transport from the plasma membrane to the early endosome. In this respect the function of EEA1 would resemble that of other proposed docking factors such as the Exocyst and TRAPP complexes that specify the target compartments in the secretory vesicle to plasma membrane and ER to Golgi transport pathways in yeast, respectively (39.TerBush D.R. Maurice T. Roth D. Novick P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6483-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 40.Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 41.Sacher M. Jiang Y. Barrowman J. Scarpa A. Burston J. Zhang L. Schieltz D. Yates J.R. Abeliovich H. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2494-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It is also possible that other Rab5 effectors may participate with EEA1 in the vesicle targeting process. What determines the asymmetrical distribution of EEA1? EEA1 has two Rab5-binding sites. The first is located in the N terminus and involves the C2H2zinc-finger motif, and the second is in the C terminus, immediately adjacent to the FYVE finger (21.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23.Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 25.Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L.

Rab5 alone is not sufficient for the membrane recruitment of EEA1, given that even an excess of Rab5 on CCVs cannot recruit EEA1 to this membrane. Thus, neither the N-terminal nor C-terminal binding site alone can mediate a stable association of EEA1 with Rab5 on the membrane. Instead, what is critical for the association of EEA1 with the endosome membrane is the concomitant presence of both Rab5-GTP and PI(3)P (21.Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 23.Simonsen A. Lippé R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.-M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.-H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), which appear to cooperatively bind to the C terminus of EEA1 on the endosomal membrane. The recent finding that the PI3-K hVPS34 is a Rab5 effector explains how PI(3)P production can be coupled to Rab5 localization (24.Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.-C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, hVPS34 seems also to be absent from CCVs (24.Christoforidis S. Miaczynska M. Ashman K. Wilm M. Zhao L. Yip S.-C. Waterfield M.D. Backer J.M. Zerial M. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Lack of sufficient amounts of PI(3)P would explain why EEA1 cannot be recruited on the vesicle membrane. The mechanism responsible for the selective targeting of hVPS34 to the early endosome is unclear at present and most likely involves the accessory protein Vps15p/p150 (42.Panaretou C. Domin J. Cockcroft S. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2477-2485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 43.Volinia S. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. MacDougall L.K. Stein R. Zvelebil M.J. Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the clathrin coat could represent an additional mechanical barrier preventing EEA1 from binding to the vesicles. However, this is not very likely considering that, firstly, incubation of CCVs with cytosol and ATP-regenerating system results in the removal of coat, presumably because of the action of hsc70, the uncoating ATPase (44.Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Secondly, we show that another coiled-coil protein of a relatively large size such as Rabaptin-5 (19.Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) can be efficiently recruited to the vesicles under the same conditions. We have established that Rab5 must be present on both CCVs and EE membranes in heterotypic fusion. In the light of these findings, an attractive possibility is that while EEA1 is anchored to the endosome via its C terminus, the N terminus binds to Rab5 on the CCV, thus tethering the vesicle to the early endosome. Clearly, a single EEA1 dimer present in cytosol (45.Callaghan J. Simonsen A. Gaullier J.M. Toh B.H. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) cannot be recruited by Rab5 on the CCV (Fig. 3 A). However, EEA1 is found in large oligomers together with Rabaptin-5 and NSF on the endosome membrane (14.McBride H.M. Rybin V. Murphy C. Giner A. Teasdale R. Zerial M. Cell. 1999; 98: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and it is likely that PI(3)P binding is essential for this process. Upon incorporation into the oligomers, the high density of EEA1 molecules in the membrane may result in a sufficient number of low affinity binding sites which are then capable of stabilizing the interaction of the N terminus of EEA1 with Rab5 on the CCV membrane. This model also predicts that, because of the lack of recruitment of EEA1, CCVs should in principle be unable to undergo homotypic fusion, a process previously proposed to account for the biogenesis of the early endosomes (46.Murphy R.F. Trends in Cell Biology. 1991; 1: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Finally, it will be interesting to examine the role of EEA1 and other Rab5 effectors in vesicle targeting in polarized cells such as epithelial cells and neurons. In these cells the endocytic circuits in each plasma membrane domain are operated by distinct machineries (47.Bomsel M. Parton R. Kuznetsov S.A. Schroer T. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1990; 62: 719-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) while being nevertheless subjected to regulation by Rab5 GTPase (48.Bucci C. Wandinger-Ness A. Lütcke A.

Protein binding can also inhibit transfection activity in vitro. In this study a multivalent reactive hydrophilic polymer has been used to inhibit protein binding. This polymer is based on poly-[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (pHPMA) bearing pendent oligopeptide (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly) side chains terminated in reactive 4-nitrophenoxy groups (8.6 mol%). The polymer reacts with the primary amino groups of poly(l-lysine) (pLL) and produces a hydrophilic coating on the surface of pLL·DNA complexes (as measured by fluorescamine). The resulting pHPMA-coated complexes show a decreased surface charge (from +14 mV for pLL·DNA complexes to −25 mV for pHPMA-modified complexes) as measured by ζ potential analysis. The pHPMA-coated complexes also show a slightly increased average diameter (approximately 90 nm compared with 60 nm for pLL·DNA complexes) as viewed by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy and around 100 nm as viewed by photon correlation spectroscopy. They are completely resistant to protein interaction, as determined by turbidometry and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of complexes isolated from plasma, and show significantly decreased nonspecific uptake into cells in vitro. Spare reactive ester groups can be used to conjugate targeting ligands (e.g. transferrin) on to the surface of the complex to provide a means of tissue-specific targeting and transfection.

Presently, however, nearly all of these strategies are severely limited by inefficient delivery and expression of therapeutic DNA (7.Anderson W.F. Nature. 1998; 392: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There are two broad problems; first, the efficiency of transgene expression in target cells and tissues is usually low or of inadequate duration. Second, possibilities for delivery of genes to target cellsin vivo are limited to local administration either by direct injection into the target tissue or its blood supply (8.Gleich L.L. Gluckman J.L. Armstrong S. Biddinger P.W. Miller M.A. Balakrishnan K. Wilson K.M. Saavedra H.I. Stambrook P.J. Arch. Otolaryngol.

A. 1997; 94: 14547-14552Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). There are presently no plausible options for systemic delivery of genes following intravenous injection. Viruses comprise the most efficient means to introduce transgenes into cells, but often their immunogenic and inflammatory properties combine with safety concerns to limit their realistic clinical application (12.DeMatteo R.P. Yeh H. Friscia M. Caparrelli D. Burke C. Desai N. Chu G. Markmann J.F. Raper S.E. Barker C.F. Ann. Surg. Oncol. 1999; 6: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,13.Mornex J.F. Presse Med. 1998; 27: 769-770PubMed Google Scholar). We are therefore seeking to develop nonviral systems, with limited immunogenicity, suitable for targeted delivery of genes in vivo. Distribution kinetics of nonviral vectors based on cationic lipids or on cationic polymers have previously been examined in vivo; however, they are invariably cleared quickly from the bloodstream and often accumulate in the lungs (14.Li S. Huang L. J. Liposome Res. 1997; 7: 207-219Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This is thought to result from binding and aggregation of serum proteins, leading to selective retention within the first capillary bed encountered, usually the pulmonary bed. Consequently, several studies have examined various strategies to inhibit the binding of serum proteins to DNA complexes (15.Hara T. Liu F. Liu D.X. Huang L. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1997; 24: 265-271Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For example, self-assembly of DNA with block copolymers containing cationic segments (e.g.poly(l-lysine) (pLL)1 or poly(trimethylammonio ethylmethacrylate) linked to hydrophilic segments (poly(ethylene glycol), dextran, or poly-N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide) can produce small particles that are enshrouded, to some extent, with hydrophilic polymers (16.Wolfert M.A. Schacht E.H. Toncheva V. Ulbrich K. Nazarova O. Seymour L.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 17.Toncheva V. Wolfert M.A. Dash P.R. Oupicky D. Ulbrich K. Seymour L.W. Schacht E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1380: 354-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Analogous to stealth liposomes, the resulting complexes show a marked fall in their interaction with serum proteins, becoming up to 100-fold less prone to aggregation by albumin in vitro. However, following intravenous administration to mice, such block copolymer·DNA complexes still show rapid bloodclearance. 2P. R. Dash, unpublished results. One difference between the technology of polyethylene glycol-shielded liposomes (which show circulatory half lives of several hours in mice (18.Allen T.M. Drugs. 1998; 56: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)) and polyethylene glycol-pLL·DNA complexes is that the former has lateral stabilization of its surface by bonding between adjacent lipid groups. The polyelectrolyte particles, on the other hand, are condensed into a hydrophobic core that has no such lateral stabilizing force. Although it is protected, to some extent, by polyethylene glycol chains, protein molecules that penetrate the polyethylene glycol layer may be able to undergo hydrophobic interactions with the core of the complex and gradually destabilize it. This appears to happen at high protein concentrations in vitro and probably underlies the rapid blood clearance observed in vivo. Consequently, our attention has been focused recently on developing a system capable both of protecting the surface of polyelectrolyte DNA particles and simultaneously endowing the complexes with a lateral stabilizing force to resist destabilization by even physiological concentrations of proteins. Such a system is described here. It is based on hydrophilic polymers that carry several identical 4-nitrophenoxy groups capable of binding to lysine amino groups exposed on the surface of pLL·DNA complexes. These polymers are thought to undergo a cooperative binding reaction that results in cross-linking of the surface of the polyelectrolyte particles and protects them completely against even physiological concentrations of serum proteins. To permit activation of the DNA following its arrival within target cells, the coating polymer can be designed to contain linkages that can be hydrolyzed or cleaved by target-associated enzymes to release DNA in a form suitable for transcription. The 5.5-kilobase pair expression vector DNA used (JL1132) contains the β-gal gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The plasmid was grown in Escherichia coli and purified using Qiagen Gigaprep Kits (Crawley, W. Sussex, UK). Calf thymus DNA was obtained from Sigma and purified using phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Concentration and purity of the DNA was checked on a spectrophotometer atA 260/A 280 absorbance wavelengths. Unless otherwise stated expression vector DNA was used throughout this study. The expression vector was linearized using HindIII restriction enzyme and was then radiolabeled using [32P]dCTP and the Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using MicroSpin S-300 Sephacryl columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the purity of the labeled DNA was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Less than 1% of the radioactivity was found to be due to the presence of free nucleotides. DNA was added to a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml in ultra-pure water and mixed thoroughly. A small volume of pLL (5 mg/ml stock in water, average molecular weight 20,000) was added to the DNA solution to give an N:P ratio of 2.0 (defined as the ratio of lysine ε amino groups to DNA phosphates), unless otherwise stated, and gently mixed. The complexes were allowed to form for at least 30 min at room temperature prior to use. The N:P ratio of 2.0 was selected in order to combine efficient complex formation with minimal residual-free pLL (19.Dash P.R. Toncheva V. Schacht E. Seymour L.W. J. Controlled Release. 1997; 48: 269-276Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A hydrophilic polymer was synthesized based on poly-[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] (pHPMA) bearing pendent tetrapeptide (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly) side chains (8.6 mol %) terminated in reactive 4-nitrophenoxy groups, as described previously (20.Rihova B. Bilej M. Vetvicka V. Ulbrich K. Strohalm J. Kopecek J. Duncan R. Biomaterials. 1989; 10: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The material (pHPMA-ONp) was characterized by fast protein liquid chromatography (calibrated with pHPMA standards) and showed a weight average molecular weight of 35,000 (Fig.1). To introduce the multivalent polymer coating, reactive hydrophilic polymer pHPMA-ONp (various amounts in water) was added to the preformed pLL·DNA complexes following the addition of 5% v/v Hepes buffer (1 m, pH 7.4) to give a final Hepes concentration of 50 mm. The reaction between pHPMA-ONp and lysine amino groups results in the loss of 4-nitrophenoxy groups and a corresponding fall in absorbance at 274 nm, which can be monitored spectrophotometrically (molar extinction coefficient 9500 cm−1). Unless otherwise stated the coating reaction was allowed to proceed overnight with remaining ONp groups aminolysed with aminoethanol (0.1 μl/ml) added just prior to use. Polyelectrolyte complexes were formed by mixing calf thymus DNA (40 μg/ml) with pLL (20 kDa) in water at a N:P ratio of 2.0 for at least 30 min. The pHPMA-ONp polymer and an equal volume of 200 mm sodium borate, pH 7.3, were added to the preformed complexes, and the coating reaction continued overnight at room temperature. The final concentration of coating polymer used ranged from 0 to 200 μg/ml. To vary the pH, alternative solvents were used, including sodium citrate buffer (200 mm, pH 6.0) and sodium borate (200 mm, pH 8.2). To assay for amino group availability, 50-μl aliquots of samples were removed and diluted with 1.5 ml of assay buffer (100 mm sodium borate, pH 7.0). 500 μl of fluorescamine (0.01% in acetone) was then quickly added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Fluorescence was measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B fluorimeter, λex392 and λem 480 nm with 5-nm slit widths, with buffer-only background deducted. In control experiments, the amine availability of free DNA, poly(l-lysine), and coating polymer alone were also examined. Complexes were formed at a DNA concentration of 20 μg/ml in water and reacted with pHPMA-ONp as described above. Surface charge was measured using a Zetamaster (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) equipped with a 5-milliwatt internal laser. Sampling time was set to automatic, and the zeta range was set to unknown. All ζ potentials were determined in 50 mm Hepes buffer. The size of complexes was determined using a Malvern Instruments Zetasizer with a 70-milliwatt external laser (wavelength 488 nm). Complexes were formed in water at a DNA concentration of 20 μg/ml as described above. Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) was performed at 25 °C in Hepes buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) in triplicate with sampling time and analysis method set to automatic. Samples (1–2 μl) containing complexes formed in water at a DNA concentration of 20 μg/ml were deposited onto the surface of a freshly split untreated mica disc (Agar Scientific, Stansted, Essex, UK). Following adsorption (1–2 min at room temperature) excess fluid was removed by adsorption onto filter paper. The mica surface was then dried at room temperature before imaging using an AFM-2, part of the NanoScope II system (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA). A 200-μm-long Si3N4 cantilever with a spring constant of 0.12 N/m and a D scanner head (AFM 351) with a 12-μm scan range were used. The image mode was set to constant force, hence the images obtained are height images of the sample surface. The scanning speed varied between 2.48 and 8.68 Hz. pLL·DNA complexes (10 μl, 20 μg of DNA/ml) were added to a formvar/carbon-coated copper grid and allowed to air dry. Uranyl acetate (10 μl of a filtered 2% solution) was added for 2 min before the excess was drawn off. The grid was allowed to air dry, washed with water, and visualized with a Joel 1200 EX transmission electron microscope. Turbidity of polyelectrolyte complexes is known to increase in the presence of serum albumin. Effects of albumin on turbidity of the complexes prepared here were measured as light reflection in a Perkin-Elmer fluorimeter with both excitation and emission wavelengths set to 600 nm and slit widths set to 3 nm. Complexes were prepared in water at a calf thymus DNA concentration of 20 μg/ml; albumin was added in 1-μl aliquots from a 35 mg/ml stock solution; and changes in turbidity were noted. Complexes containing 32P-labeled DNA were coated with 200 μg/ml of pHPMA-ONp as described above or left uncoated. Complexes were then incubated in filtered human plasma (2 ml, 50% solution, 1 h, 37 °C). Samples (1 ml) were then loaded carefully into a water layer (8 ml) above a simple sucrose cushion (45% (w/v) 5 ml). Samples were then centrifuged in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge L265B (30,000 rpm, 12 h) SW40Ti rotor to pellet the complexes. Tubes were then frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the bottom part of the tube (containing approximately 1 ml of sucrose solution) was removed with a razor blade. The sample was then allowed to thaw; supernatant sucrose was removed, and the32P-labeled pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of water. Recovery of the DNA was determined by measuring the radioactivity retrieved. More than 99% of the DNA was shown to be in the resuspended pellet. The complexes were then dissociated and denatured by boiling in mercaptoethanol/SDS (Laemlli buffer) and proteins resolved by electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel (Hoeffer Minigel, 25 mA, 80 min) with visualization using diamine silver. To permit comparison of bound protein a standard amount of DNA (120 ng) was loaded onto each lane. The human leukemia cell line K562 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cellular uptake studies were performed with complexes formed with a trace amount of32P-radiolabeled DNA and 20 μg/ml plasmid DNA. Complexes were coated with pHPMA as described above, and transferrin was added after 2 h. Cells were placed into 12-well plates at a concentration of 105 cells/well containing fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum, and complexes were added to a final DNA concentration of 2 μg/ml. Media were removed at set timepoints, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved with lysis solution. The cell lysates, media, and cell washings were placed in scintillation vials; scintillant was added, and the radioactivity was counted in a Packard (1900TR) scintillation counter. The percentage of radioactivity associated with the cells was then calculated. Transfection studies were also performed in K562 cells in the presence of serum. Complexes were formed with a β-Gal plasmid expression vector. The complexes were then formulated as described above and were incubated with the cells for 4 h before the media were replaced. The cells were then left for 48 h before assaying for β-galactosidase using the Galactolight-Plus kit (Tropix, Cambridge, UK). Reactivity of pHPMA-ONp esters toward nucleophilic centers is highly dependent on pH. Examination of the hydrolytic stability of the reactive polymer pHPMA-ONp showed that there was little time-dependent decrease in bound 4-nitrophenoxy groups at pH 6.0. Conversely, at pH 8.2, virtually all of the ester bonds were hydrolyzed within 5 min of dissolution, indicating rapid reaction at this higher pH. When hydrolysis was examined at pH 7.4, an intermediate rate of time-dependent hydrolysis was determined (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of pLL·DNA complexes there was only a very slow reaction at pH 6.0, suggesting stability of the ester at this pH. At pH 8.2, in the presence of pLL·DNA complexes, the reaction was very fast although the profile of disappearance of reactive esters was very similar to that due simply to hydrolysis, reflecting the high reactivity of the ester at this pH. At pH 7.4 the reaction observed in the presence of pLL·DNA complexes was appreciably faster than that due to hydrolysis alone, and this pH was selected as optimal to promote covalent linkage of the reactive polymer to the complexes. The reactivity of pHPMA-ONp reacting with pLL·DNA complexes at pH 7.4 was compared with reactivity to free pLL alone, and also to DNA alone (Fig. 2 B). Rates of reaction in the presence of pLL alone were similar to those generated in the presence of pLL·DNA complexes, indicating appreciable reactivity of pHPMA-ONp with the cationic component of the complexes. When mixed with DNA alone the loss of reactive esters from pHPMA-ONp was similar to or less than that produced by hydrolysis. This indicates that there was no reaction occurring between the activated esters and the amino groups present in DNA. Covalent reaction between the reactive esters of pHPMA-ONp and the pLL·DNA complexes would be expected to decrease the number of free amine groups on the surface of the complex. This hypothesis was tested using fluorescamine to determine the number of free amine groups before and after the addition of varying amounts of pHPMA-ONp to the complexes (Fig.3 A). In every case the number of free amino groups measured using fluorescamine was represented as a percentage of the number determined using the equivalent quantity of free pLL. Addition of 200 μg/ml pHPMA-ONp (corresponding to 85.5 μm reactive esters) to free pLL led to a fall of 45% in available amino groups (corresponding to 59.9 μm amines). This suggests that the reactive esters are binding to amino groups in pLL with an efficiency of about 70% with remaining reactive esters presumably hydrolyzing in water. Binding of pLL to DNA physically protects approximately 30% of the free amino groups of pLL from reactivity with fluorescamine. Reaction with increasing amounts of pHPMA-ONp results in a further decrease in the number of amino groups available for derivatization. The availability of amino groups in pLL and pLL·DNA complexes for reaction with fluorescamine was examined at different pH values, including the effects of reaction with pHPMA-ONp. Unexpectedly over 20% of amino groups of free pLL were masked following reaction with pHPMA-ONp at pH 6.0 (Fig. 3 B), perhaps reflecting a noncovalent association and subsequent masking of the amino groups by the intact polymer. As expected a greater quantity (nearly 50%) became masked at pH 7.3 and the reaction was slightly more efficient at pH 8.2, with over 50% of amino groups becoming masked by pHPMA-ONp. Precisely the same trends were seen for availability of amino groups present in pHPMA-modified pLL·DNA complexes using corresponding pLL·DNA complexes at appropriate pH values to supply the appropriate 100% figures for calibration. The pH also affects the availability of pLL amino groups within pLL·DNA complexes for reaction with fluorescamine. At lower pH values (e.g. pH 6.0), fewer amino groups are available for reaction compared with unconjugated pLL at the same pH values, presumably reflecting stronger electrostatic binding of pLL to DNA. The overall result confirms that covalent modification of pLL·DNA complexes using pHPMA-ONp is substantially more efficient at pH 7.3 and 8.2 than it is at 6.0. pHPMA-modified and simple pLL·DNA complexes were characterized by TEM and AFM to determine their overall structure. Both TEM and AFM showed that simple pLL·DNA complexes were discrete, apparently spherical complexes with an average diameter of around 60 nm (Fig.4, A and C). Analysis of pHPMA-coated complexes by AFM suggested a greater tendency to adhere to the mica surface, because there were many more images in the field of view than observed with unmodified complexes (Fig.4 B). Analysis of the pHPMA-coated complexes by TEM showed an area of less dense staining surrounding the complex, possibly due to the presence of the coating polymer (Fig. 4 D). Both AFM and TEM showed that pHPMA-coated complexes maintain a discrete, apparently spherical morphology, with a slightly larger size than uncoated pLL·DNA complexes (90–100 nm approximately). The surface charge of particles is known to be one of the major factors influencing their biodistribution (21.Mahato R.I. Takakura Y. Hashida M. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 1997; 14: 133-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transfection activity (22.Nomura T. Nakajima S. Kawabata K. Yamashita F. Takakura Y. Hashida M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2681-2686PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason the surface charge on coated and uncoated complexes was determined using ζ potential analysis. At an N:P ratio of 2, pLL·DNA complexes were positively charged with a ζ potential of around +14 mV (Table I). The addition of increasing concentrations of pHPMA-ONp led to corresponding decreases in surface charge, falling to around neutral (+1 mV) with 50 μg/ml of pHPMA-ONp and reaching as low as −25 mV when 200 μg/ml coating polymer was used.Table Iζ Potential of pLL · DNA complexes (N:P ratio 2.0, formed at a DNA concentration of 20 μg/ml in water) coated with different concentrations of pHPMA-ONppHPMA-ONp concentrationζ potentialStandard deviationμg/mlmV0+13.75.1050+0.880.37100−7.780.15150−21.20.64200−25.10.29 Open table in a new tab Determination of particle size was also performed using PCS. The results show that uncoated pLL·DNA complexes have an average diameter of 50 nm (Fig. 5 A). Coating the complexes with pHPMA produces a population of particles, as measured by PCS, with a slightly greater average diameter of around 90 nm, possibly due to incorporation of polymer on the surface of the particles (Fig. 5 B). Combined with the microscopic analysis (Fig. 4) these results confirm that the complexes have not become noticeably cross-linked by reaction with pHPMA-ONp, instead remaining predominantly as discrete complexes. Polymer-coated and -uncoated pLL·DNA complexes were incubated in the presence of 5% serum overnight, and their size was determined by PCS. It was found that the addition of serum to uncoated pLL·DNA complexes resulted in an increase in particle diameter from around 50 nm to over 1000 nm (Fig. 5, A and C). In comparison, pHPMA-coated complexes remained at a constant 90-nm diameter even in the presence of 10% serum (Fig. 5, B andD), suggesting that the complexes are resistant to serum-induced aggregation. An alternative assay to monitor protein binding relies on changes in turbidity measured as light reflection in a fluorimeter. Following the addition of aliquot portions of albumin solution to pLL·DNA complexes in water there was an obvious increase in the turbidity of the solution, probably due to an aggregation of the complexes (Fig. 6). pLL·DNA complexes premodified with 50 μg/ml of pHPMA-ONp displayed a substantial reduction in albumin-induced turbidity. A further fall in turbidity was achieved using 100 μg/ml pHPMA-ONp, whereas 200 μg/ml completely prevented albumin-mediated increases in turbidity. It was not clear whether the decreased protein binding following reaction with pHPMA-ONp was due to decreased availability of electrostatic sites within the pLL·DNA complex for protein binding or was perhaps mediated by the strong negative surface charge endowed by hydrolysis of unreacted ester groups present on the coating polymer. Consequently pLL·DNA complexes surface modified with pHPMA-ONp (200 μg/ml) were aminolysed with aminoethanol at various times following the addition of the reactive polymer to remove unreacted 4-nitrophenoxy groups. This prevented subsequent hydrolysis and formation of carboxylic acid groups and led to the formation of complexes with a surface charge much closer to neutrality (Fig.7 A). This modified charge did not affect the ability of the complexes to withstand albumin disruption, according to determination of albumin-induced turbidity (Fig. 7 B). This suggests that it is the surface masking or stabilization effect of the pHPMA, not the surface charge, that is important in preventing an interaction with albumin. It was also demonstrated that the presence of free pHPMA in solution is not responsible for the improved stability to serum albumin (Fig.7 B). To elucidate the interaction of pLL·DNA complexes with plasma proteins, both simple and pHPMA-coated complexes were incubated in 50% fresh plasma. The complexes were than recovered from the plasma by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine which proteins were associated with the complexes (Fig.8). Silver staining revealed a number of proteins binding to uncoated pLL·DNA complexes, particularly a 66-kDa protein that co-electrophoreses with serum albumin. There were also several other proteins associated with pLL·DNA complexes, notably bands with molecular masses of 66 and 120 kDa, approximately. In contrast, no proteins were detected bound to the pHPMA-coated complexes. Rates of association of coated and uncoated pLL·DNA complexes with K562 cells were determined in vitro using pLL·DNA complexes trace labeled with [32P]DNA (Fig.9 A). After 30 min around 33% of simple pLL·DNA complexes have been internalized by the cells, whereas only around 15% of the pHPMA coated complexes have been internalized over the same time point. After 5 h approximately 50% of the pLL·DNA complexes have been taken up by the cells compared with around 25% for the pHPMA-coated complexes. This suggests that coating the complexes with pHPMA can reduce the nonspecific cell interactions observed with simple pLL·DNA complexes by approximately 2-fold. In the absence of serum the reduction in nonspecific cell uptake is even greater, with around a 10-fold reduction in cell uptake of pHPMA-coated complexes (data not shown). However, targeting the complexes to cell surface receptors using transferrin restored the uptake of pHPMA-coated complexes. Transferrin-modified pHPMA-coated complexes produce a much greater and more rapid cellular uptake"

https://openalex.org/W1499459823,"The present study was designed to investigate whether apoptosis occurs in early-stage vein grafts and to determine the mechanisms by which mechanical stress contributes to apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Apoptosis in vessel walls of mouse vein grafts was confirmed by morphological changes and by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). TUNEL(+) cells in vein grafts 1, 4, and 8 wk postoperatively was 13%, 29%, and 21%, respectively, and apoptosis occurred mainly in veins grafted to arteries, remaining unchanged in vein-to-vein grafts. When mouse, rat, and human arterial SMCs were cultured on a flexible membrane and subjected to cyclic strain stress, apoptosis was observed in a time- and strength-dependent manner. All three types of SMCs showed apoptotic death as confirmed by TUNEL, propidium iodide, and annexin V staining. To further study the signal pathways leading to apoptosis, activities of p38, a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), were determined. Mechanical stress resulted in p38 MAPK activation, reaching high levels within 8 min. SB 202190, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPKs, prevented SMC apoptosis in response to mechanical stress. SMC lines stably transfected with a dominant negative rac, an upstream signal transducer, or overexpressing MAPK phosphatase-1, a negative regulator for MAPKs, completely inhibited mechanical stress stimulated p38 activation and abolished mechanical stress-induced apoptosis. Thus, we provide solid evidence that one of the earliest events in venous bypass grafts is apoptosis, in which mechanical stress-induced p38-MAPK activation is responsible for transducing signals leading to apoptosis.-Mayr, M., Li, C., Zou, Y., Huemer, U., Hu, Y., Xu, Q. Biomechanical stress-induced apoptosis in vein grafts involves p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2066784934,"Although it is well established that Ras requires membrane localization for activation of its target molecule, Raf-1, the reason for this requirement is not fully understood. In this study, we found that modified Ras, which is purified from Sf9 cells, could activate Raf-1 in a cell-free system, when incorporated into liposome. Using a bifunctional cross-linker and a protein-fragmentation complementation assay, we detected dimer formation of Ras in the liposome and in the intact cells, respectively. These results suggest that dimerization of Ras in the lipid membrane is essential for activation of Raf-1. To support this, we found that, when fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), unprocessed Ras expressed in Escherichia coli could bypass the requirement for liposome. A Ras-dependent Raf-1 activator, which we previously reported (Mizutani, S., Koide, H., and Kaziro, Y. (1998)Oncogene 16, 2781–2786), was still required for Raf-1 activation by GST-Ras. Furthermore, an enforced dimerization of unmodified oncogenic Ras mutant in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, using a portion of gyrase B or estrogen receptor, also resulted in activation of Raf-1. From these results, we conclude that membrane localization allows Ras to form a dimer, which is essential, although not sufficient, for Raf-1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2083616765,"Typical of DNA bacteriophages and herpesviruses, HK97 assembles in two stages: polymerization and maturation. First, capsid protein polymerizes into closed shells; then, these precursors mature into larger, stabler particles. Maturation is initiated by proteolysis, producing a metastable particle primed for expansion-the major structural transition. We induced expansion in vitro by acidic pH and monitored the resulting changes by time-resolved X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy. The transition, which is not synchronized over the population, proceeds in a series of stochastically triggered subtransitions. Three distinct intermediates were identified, which are comparable to transitional states in protein folding. The intermediates' structures reveal the molecular events occurring during expansion. Integrated into a movie (see Dynamic Visualization below), they show capsid maturation as a dynamic process."

https://openalex.org/W2068876308,"Over the past decade, numerous studies have been targeted at defining structure-activity relationships of glucagon. Recently, we have found that glucagon1–29 is hydrolyzed by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) to produce glucagon3–29 and glucagon5–29; in human serum, [pyroglutamyl (pGlu)3]glucagon3–29 is formed from glucagon3–29, and this prevents further hydrolysis of glucagon by DPIV (H.-U. Demuth, K. Glund, U. Heiser, J. Pospisilik, S. Hinke, T. Hoffmann, F. Rosche, D. Schlenzig, M. Wermann, C. McIntosh, and R. Pederson, manuscript in preparation). In the current study, the biological activity of these peptides was examined in vitro. The amino-terminally truncated peptides all behaved as partial agonists in cyclic AMP stimulation assays, with Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells overexpressing the human glucagon receptor (potency: glucagon1–29 > [pGlu3]glu- cagon3–29 > glucagon3–29 > glucagon5–29 > [Glu9]glu- cagon2–29). In competition binding experiments, [pGlu3]glucagon3–29 and glucagon5–29 both demonstrated 5-fold lower affinity for the receptor than glucagon1–29, whereas glucagon3–29 exhibited 18-fold lower affinity. Of the peptides tested, only glucagon5–29 showed antagonist activity, and this was weak compared with the classical glucagon antagonist, [Glu9]glucagon2–29. Hence, DPIV hydrolysis of glucagon yields low affinity agonists of the glucagon receptor. As a corollary to evidence indicating that DPIV degrades glucagon (Demuth, et al., manuscript in preparation), DPIV-resistant analogs were synthesized. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was used to assess DPIV resistance, and it allowed kinetic analysis of degradation. Of several analogs generated, only [d-Ser2] and [Gly2]glucagon retained high affinity binding and biological potency, similar to native glucagon in vitro. [d-Ser2]Glucagon exhibited enhanced hyperglycemic activity in a bioassay, whereas [Gly2]glucagon was not completely resistant to DPIV degradation. Over the past decade, numerous studies have been targeted at defining structure-activity relationships of glucagon. Recently, we have found that glucagon1–29 is hydrolyzed by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) to produce glucagon3–29 and glucagon5–29; in human serum, [pyroglutamyl (pGlu)3]glucagon3–29 is formed from glucagon3–29, and this prevents further hydrolysis of glucagon by DPIV (H.-U. Demuth, K. Glund, U. Heiser, J. Pospisilik, S. Hinke, T. Hoffmann, F. Rosche, D. Schlenzig, M. Wermann, C. McIntosh, and R. Pederson, manuscript in preparation). In the current study, the biological activity of these peptides was examined in vitro. The amino-terminally truncated peptides all behaved as partial agonists in cyclic AMP stimulation assays, with Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells overexpressing the human glucagon receptor (potency: glucagon1–29 > [pGlu3]glu- cagon3–29 > glucagon3–29 > glucagon5–29 > [Glu9]glu- cagon2–29). In competition binding experiments, [pGlu3]glucagon3–29 and glucagon5–29 both demonstrated 5-fold lower affinity for the receptor than glucagon1–29, whereas glucagon3–29 exhibited 18-fold lower affinity.

Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 66/I. Springer-Verlag, New York1983: 361-382Google Scholar). The circulating half-life of immunoreactive glucagon is estimated to be between 5 and 6 min in dogs and humans (3.Jaspan J. Polonsky K. Lewis M. Pensler J. Pugh W. Moossa A. Rubenstein A. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: E233-E244PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Alford F. Bloom S. Nabarro J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1976; 42: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The tissues responsible for the clearance of glucagon from the circulation are somewhat controversial; however, it is generally accepted that the kidneys play the dominant role (reviewed in Refs. 5.Holst J. Henriksen J. Degradation of Bioactive Substances: Physiology and Pathophysiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 167-180Google Scholar and 6.Lefebvre P. Luyckx A. Lefebvre P. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 66/II. Springer-Verlag, New York1983: 389-396Google Scholar). Interestingly, there have been reports that glucagon degradation in blood or plasma is negligible (7.Hendriks T. Benraad T. Diabetologia. 1981; 20: 553-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 8.Märki F. Horm. Metab. Res. 1983; 15: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been presented suggesting that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV)1 is responsible in part for the inactivation of glucagon (9.Demuth H.-U. Glund K. Heiser U. Hinke S. Hoffman T. Pospisilik J. Rosche F. Schlenzig D. Wermann M. McIntosh C. Pederson R. 12th International Symposium on Regulatory Peptides, Abstracts of the. Mackinac Island, MI1998Google Scholar). 2H.-U.

Pospisilik, S. Hinke, T. Hoffmann, F. Rosche, D. Schlenzig, M. Wermann, C. McIntosh, and R. Pederson, manuscript in preparation. This finding is consistent with renal clearance of glucagon but conflicts with the absence of plasma degradation previously reported, as DPIV is found on the surface of lymphocytes and as a freely circulating enzyme in addition to the apical surface of the renal proximal tubules (10.Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The glucagon receptor is a class B serpentine G-protein coupled receptor, belonging to the same family of hormone receptors as those for secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/gastric inhibitory polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide-1, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (11.Horn F. Weare J. Beukers M. Hörsch S. Bairoch A. Chen W. Edvardsen Ø. Campagne F. Vriend G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The ligand specificity of the glucagon receptor is primarily conferred by its extracellular amino terminus (12.Graziano M. Hey P. Strader C. Receptors Channels. 1996; 4: 9-17PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Buggy J. Livingston J. Rabin D. Yoo-Warren H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7474-7478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); activation of the receptor results in activation of both the adenylyl cyclase/cyclic AMP and the phospholipase C/inositol trisphosphate intracellular cascades (14.Li J. Larocca J. Rodriguez-Gabin A. Charron M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To date, a plethora of structure-activity studies on glucagon have been performed (the most recent comprehensive review in Ref. 15.Hruby V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 44: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These have generally consisted of rational and systematic investigations of ligand-receptor agonism and antagonism, resulting in an increased understanding of the charge-charge interactions between the hormone and receptor resulting in its ability to bind and activate the receptor (16.Unson C. Wu C.-R. Cheung C. Merrifield R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10308-10312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Other key findings include the importance of the amino terminus of glucagon in receptor activation (17.Smith R. Sisk R. Lockhart P. Mathewes S. Gilbert T. Walker K. Piggot J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar), as well as important residues within the primary sequence of glucagon (16.Unson C. Wu C.-R. Cheung C. Merrifield R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10308-10312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18.Azizeh B. Van Tine B. Trivedi D. Hruby V. Peptides. 1997; 18: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that purified pork kidney DPIV is capable of hydrolyzing glucagon1–29 to glucagon3–29and glucagon5–29 in vitro and that, in human serum, it is converted first to glucagon3–29, and subsequently its amino terminus is cyclized by a serum enzyme (possibly to pyroglutamyl-glucagon3–29([pGlu3]glucagon3–29)), thus preventing further DPIV degradation, as it does not fulfil the substrate requirements of the enzyme (i.e. it lacks a protonable amino terminus).2 The specificity of DPIV was characterized to preferentially release dipeptides from the amino terminus of polypeptides with proline or alanine in the penultimate position (10.Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). However, amino-terminal degradation of nontypical substrates has been reported, including sequential cleavage of amino-terminal dipeptides (19.Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Opdenakker G. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Mantovani A. Augustyns K. Bal G. Haemers A. Lambeir A.-M. Scharpé S. Van Damme J. De Meester I. J. Biol.

In the current study, the effects of the potentially physiologically relevant amino-terminally truncated glucagon fragments on the human glucagon receptor were examined. The glucagon fragments glucagon3–29, glucagon5–29, and [pGlu3]glucagon3–29 were characterized on Chinese hamster ovary K1 (CHO-K1) cells transfected with the human glucagon receptor, with respect to agonist and antagonist activity as well as binding affinity, and compared with glucagon1–29and [Glu9]glucagon2–29. Further studies using DPIV-resistant glucagon analogs were performed to support existing evidence for DPIV degradation of glucagon using in vitro methods and a bioassay. Glucagon analogs were synthesized with an automated synthesizer Symphony (Rainin) using a modified Fmoc protocol. Fmoc-protected amino acids, 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate,N-methylmorpho- line, and NovaSyn resin were purchased from Novabiochem (Schwalbach, Germany). Dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) solvents were supplied by Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) or J. T. Baker (Griesheim, Germany). The peptide couplings were performed by 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate/N-methylmorpholine-activation using a 0.23-mmol NovaSyn TGR-resin at a 25 μm scale. Cleavage from the resin was carried out by a cleavage-mixture consisting of 94.5% trifluoroacetic acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol (Merck) and 1% tris-isopropylsilane (Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany). Analytical and preparative HPLC were performed with a linear gradient (10–90% over 30 min) of acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a 125-4 RP18 or a 250-20 RP8 column, respectively, using the LiChrograph HPLC system (Merck-Hitachi). To confirm peptide identity and verify purity, matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was employed (described below). Glucagon1–29 was purchased from Peninsula Biolabs (Belmont, CA); [Glu9]glucagon2–29 was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the human glucagon receptor (21.Hansen L. Abrahamsen N. Hager J. Jenlinek L. Kindsvogel W. Froguel P. Nishimura E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with a glycerol shock (22.Wheeler M. Gelling R. McIntosh C. Georgiou J. Brown J. Pederson R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4629-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing the human glucagon receptor (hGlucR cells) were selected for with 800 μg/ml Geneticin® (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Cansera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada), antibiotics (50 units/ml each of penicillin G and streptomycin; Sigma), and maintained under high selection with G418. Cells were grown in 75 cm2 T-flasks (Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at 37 °C and in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere; they were harvested with trypsin/EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and plated at a density of 50,000 cells per well into 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson). Forty-eight hours later, when cells had reached 1–5 × 105 cells/well, plates were used in cyclic AMP studies and binding experiments. hGlucR cells were washed twice in serum-free, HEPES-buffered (15 mm; FisherBiotech, Fair Lawn, NJ) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, with 1% Trasylol® (aprotinin; Bayer, Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay fraction V; Sigma) and allowed to equilibrate in this medium for 1 h prior to stimulation. Cyclic AMP production was stimulated with concentrations of glucagon and glucagon analogs shown in the figures, in the above buffer with the addition of 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA). Cyclic AMP stimulation proceeded for 30 min in the same medium described above, prior to lysis of cells in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and intracelluar contents were concentrated with a Speed Vac (Sorvall, Farmingdale, NY). Cyclic AMP content was measured by radioimmunoassay (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) using the manufacturer's protocol for nonacetylated samples. Antagonism of glucagon1–29 action by glucagon analogs was determined by preincubating cells with various concentrations of analogs for 15 min, prior to 30 min of stimulation with 1 nm glucagon. The cyclic AMP stimulation and antagonism protocols used in this report are similar to those described previously (23.Gelling R. Coy D. Pederson R. Wheeler M. Hinke S. Kwan T. McIntosh C. Regul. Pept. 1997; 69: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Binding affinity of glucagon analogs was measured using competition binding experiments. Briefly, cells were incubated in the presence of 50,000 cpm 3-[125I]iodotyrosyl10-glucagon (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence or absence of glucagon or analogs at the concentrations shown in the figures, for 4 h at 4 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% Trasylol. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold buffer, followed by solublization in 1 ml of 0.1m NaOH and transfer to borosilicate tubes for counting of cell associated radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was defined as the cell-associated radioactivity measured in the presence of 1 μm glucagon1–29. Protein-protein interaction studies were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). This technology allows detection of biomolecules and monitoring of binding events between two or more molecules, in real-time, without the use of labels. The optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance, is based on the change in refractive index at the surface of a sensor chip. The refractive index (given in resonance units), is directly related to the mass concentration in the surface layer of the sensor chip and increases when analyte (interactant in free solution) binds to the immobilized ligand. Research grade CM5 chips,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide,N-hydroxysuccinimide, ethanolamine, and P20 surfactant were obtained from BIAcore AB. Porcine kidney DPIV (specific activity, 31.2 units/mg) was purified as described previously (24.Pauly R. Rosche F. Wermann M. McIntosh C. Pederson R. Demuth H.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23222-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and immobilized onto the flow cell of the CM5 chip using amine coupling chemistry. One unit of DPIV activity is defined as the release of 1.0 μm4-nitroaniline per min from Gly-Pro-4-nitroaniline at 30 °C using a substrate concentration of 400 μm in a HEPES buffer (40 mm, pH 7.6, I = 0.102 by KCl) (25.Pederson R. White H. Schlenzig D. Pauly R. McIntosh C. Demuth H.-U. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Release of 4-nitroaniline was measured spectrophotometrically at 390 nm. The immobilization steps were carried out at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P20 surfactant). The chip surface was activated for 12 min with a mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide (50 mm) andN-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (200 mm). DPIV (200 nm in 10 mmacetate buffer, pH 4.0) was injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, followed by a 7-min treatment of the chip with ethanolamine (1m, pH 8.0) to block remaining activated groups. A baseline of 5000 resonance units was obtained following DPIV coupling to the sensor chip. Glucagon and analogs were dissolved in buffer (above) to cover a concentration range of 500 nm to 100 μm and were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min (25 °C). The binding profiles were analyzed with BIAevaluation software (version 3.0) to obtain dissociation constants (K d). Measurement of degradation of native glucagon and amino-terminally modified glucagon analogs was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, as described previously (24.Pauly R. Rosche F. Wermann M. McIntosh C. Pederson R. Demuth H.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23222-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25.Pederson R. White H. Schlenzig D. Pauly R. McIntosh C. Demuth H.-U. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Briefly, glucagon or analogs (25 μm) were incubated in 0.04 mTris/HCl (pH 7.6) with purified pork dipeptidyl peptidase IV (2.5 milliunits; 18.1 units/mg) or human serum (20%), obtained from healthy subjects. Kinetic analysis of results was performed as per previously published literature (24.Pauly R. Rosche F. Wermann M. McIntosh C. Pederson R. Demuth H.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23222-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26.Rosche F. Schmidt J. Hoffmann T. Pauly R. McIntosh C. Pederson R. Demuth H.-U. Chapman J. Protein and Peptide Analysis. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar, 27.Schmidt J. Wermann M. Rosche F. Demuth H.-U. Protein Peptide Lett. 1996; 3: 385-392Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to quantify the amount of intact substrate versus time, and data were fitted to a first-order exponential decay equation to obtain the half-life (t 12) (26.Rosche F. Schmidt J. Hoffmann T. Pauly R. McIntosh C. Pederson R. Demuth H.-U. Chapman J. Protein and Peptide Analysis. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). To compare data from different peptides, it was necessary to use relative intensity on the ordinate axis rather than absolute intensity (μV), as signal intensity varies from peptide to peptide at the same concentration (24.Pauly R. Rosche F. Wermann M. McIntosh C. Pederson R. Demuth H.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23222-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar,26.Rosche F. Schmidt J. Hoffmann T. Pauly R. McIntosh C. Pederson R. Demuth H.-U. Chapman J. Protein and Peptide Analysis. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). Synthetic glucagon analogs were tested in vivo, using a bioassay monitoring whole blood glucose concentration. Glucagon analogs were tested for bioactivity, degradation in normal rat plasma, and degradation in pure porcine DPIV. For biological activity, peptides were dissolved in saline and injected subcutaneously into unrestrained conscious fed male Wistar rats (∼275 g). Animal work was in compliance with the guidelines set out by the National Institutes of Health (42.National Institutes of HealthPrinciples of Animal Laboratory Care. National Institutes of Health, Betheda, MD1985Google Scholar). Analog dose was calculated by molar equivalence (7.1 nmol/kg), such that analog dose was equivalent to the dose of glucagon1–29. Degradation by purified DPIV was assessed by incubation with 0.31 units of DPIV in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 3.25 h, followed by subcutaneous injection. Similarly, peptides were incubated in normal (male Wistar) rat plasma (1.0 ml) under the same conditions (37 °C, 3.25 h), prior to subcutaneous injection. Whole blood glucose concentration was measured using tail bleeds and the SureStep® glucose analyzer (LifeScan Canada Ltd., Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). Data are presented as mean ± S.E., with the number of experiments shown in the figure legends. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level and assessed using analysis of variance and Dunnett's multiple comparison test or the Newmann-Keuls test as post hoc tests of significance where appropriate. Data analysis was done using the Prism software package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Cyclic AMP data are presented as fmol (10−15mol) per 1000 cells and receptor binding data as percentage of binding in the absence of competitor (B/B o). EC50, IC50, and (I/A)50 values were obtained from nonlinear regression analysis using Prism.K d values of DPIV for glucagon and analogs were measured using BIAevaluation software (BIAcore AB). Blood glucose data is presented as fold basal activity and the integrated glucose response over the measurement period, as determined by the trapezoidal method. Stimulation of cyclic AMP production in CHO-K1 hGlucR cells by glucagon1–29, glucagon3–29, [pGlu3]glucagon3–29, and glucagon5–29 is shown in Fig.1. A summary of the statistical analysis is shown in Table I. Fragments were all partial agonists of the glucagon receptor, with the following rank of potency: [pGlu3]glucagon3–29 > glucagon3–29 > glucagon5–29. [Glu9]Glucagon2–29 was included in antagonism experiments as a positive control because it is a well characterized antagonist (28.Unson C. Gurzenda E. Merrifield R. Peptides. 1989; 10: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); [Glu9]glucagon2–29 exhibited a small but significant concentration-dependent increase in intracellular cyclic AMP content of hGlucR cells (2.7 times basal). Because the glucagon fragments were only partial agonists, they were also tested for possible antagonist activity (Fig.2 and Table I). Glucagon5–29was found to antagonize cAMP stimulation by 1 nmglucagon1–29 (2 μm, p < 0.05; 10 μm, p < 0.01), although to a lesser degree than [Glu9]glucagon2–29. Glucagon5–29 was an approximately 11-fold weaker antagonist (Table I). Neither glucagon3–29 nor [pGlu3]glucagon3–29 was found to antagonize glucagon1–29 activity.Table ISummary of molecular weights, agonism, antagonism and binding statistics of amino-terminally truncated glucagon fragments on CHO-K1 hGlucR cellsExpected molecular weightMeasured molecular weightaMolecular weight measured using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.Adenylyl cyclase activityAntagonism (I/A)50)Receptor binding (IC50)EC50Maximum cAMPnmfmol/1000 cellsnmGlucagon1–293482.83482.9bSynthetic glucagon1–29 was obtained from Peninsula Biolabs (Belmont, CA).0.398 ± 0.05832.8 ± 1.48.83 ± 0.60Glucagon3–293258.63256.7239 ± 20cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.17.0 ± 1.9cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.N/AdN/A = not applicable.155 ± 29cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.[pGlu3]Glucagon3–293241.63242.2131 ± 34cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.22.3 ± 1.1cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.N/A48.7 ± 4.1cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.Glucagon5–293073.43074.9182 ± 33cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.10.5 ± 1.0cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.215945.3 ± 9.4cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.[Glu9]Glucagon2–293359.7NDeND, not determined (synthetic [Glu9]glucagon2–29 was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA).59.8 ± 19.2cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.7.2 ± 0.5cP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.1926.37 ± 0.74Data represent mean ± S.E.

Glucagon1–29 and [Glu9]glucagon2–29 exhibited approximately equal affinity for the glucagon receptor. All other truncated peptides showed significantly lower affinity for the human glucagon receptor than glucagon1–29 under the given assay conditions. [pGlu3]Glucagon3–29 and glucagon5–29 both had approximately 5-fold lower affinity in binding competition experiments, whereas glucagon3–29had 18-fold lower affinity for the receptor. Substitution or modification of amino acids 2 or 3 was used to generate DPIV-resistant glucagon analogs, given the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The affinity of DPIV for glucagon and amino-terminally modified analogs was determined by saturation binding experiments using surface plasmon resonance. Previous work has shown that immobilization of DPIV has no significant effects on catalytic efficiency relative to the soluble enzyme (29.Wolf B. Fischer G. Barth A. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1978; 37: 409-420PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (K d) of DPIV for native glucagon was in the μm range (Table II). This value compares well with the K m value for DPIV hydrolysis of glucagon using capillary zone electrophoresis and theK i value obtained from spectrophotometric experiments using glucagon to inhibit DPIV hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-4-nitroaniline (data not shown).2 Modification of the amino terminus about the scissile bond resulted in a 6–23-fold reduction in affinity for DPIV (K d: glucagon < [d-Ser2]glucagon < [Gly2]glucagon < [Ser(P)2]glucagon < [d-Gln3]glucagon).Table IISummary of molecular weights, agonism and binding statistics of amino-terminally modified glucagon analogs on CHO-K1 hGlucR cells or dextran-immobilized DPIVCalculated molecular weightMeasured molecular weightAdenylyl cyclase activityReceptor binding (IC50)DPIV binding (K d)EC50Maximum cAMPnmfmol/1000 cellsnmμmGlucagon3482.83482.90.398 ± 0.05832.8 ± 1.48.83 ± 0.602.97 ± 0.01[d-Ser2]Glucagon3482.83485.21.41 ± 0.4138.1 ± 3.823.6 ± 6.4aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.18.5 ± 0.1aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.[(P)Ser2]Glucagon3562.83564.130.3 ± 7.2aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.31.8 ± 2.069.1 ± 5.7aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.19.2 ± 0.2aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.[Gly2]Glucagon3451.83452.01.70 ± 0.6731.9 ± 1.316.6 ± 5.522.2 ± 0.1aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.[d-Gln3]Glucagon3482.83483.915.9 ± 10.1aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.45.5 ± 3.2aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.164 ± 79aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.68.0 ± 4.8aP < 0.05 relative to glucagon1–29.Data represent mean = S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1994424160,"During catabolic diseases such as sepsis, inflammation, and infection, a state of growth hormone (GH) resistance develops in liver. This has been attributed in part to increased production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β). To determine how IL-1β induces GH resistance, we studied the acid-labile subunit (ALS) gene whose hepatic transcription is increased by GH via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. IL-1β reduced the ability of GH to stimulate ALS mRNA in rat primary hepatocytes and ALS promoter activity in H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells. This inhibition was dependent on ALSGAS1, an element resembling a γ-interferon activated sequence that mediates the transcriptional effects of GH. Inhibition by IL-1β was also associated with a reduction of GH-dependent binding of STAT5 to this element after chronic (8 and 24 h), but not after acute treatment (15 min). Because these results indicated that the inhibition by IL-1β was indirect, expression of the recently discovered suppressors of cytokine action (SOCS) was examined in liver cells. IL-1β did not alter the expression of SOCS1, SOCS2, and CIS, indicating that they are not involved. In contrast, IL-1β increased SOCS3 mRNA by 8-fold after 24 h of treatment, whereas GH had no effect. Forced expression of SOCS3 was just as effective as IL-1β in reducing the GH induction of ALS promoter activity in H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells. Similar results were observed in primary rat hepatocytes. We conclude that the induction of SOCS3 by IL-1β contributes to the development of GH resistance in liver, and represents a mechanism by which cytokines such as IL-1β cross-talk with cytokines using the JAK-STAT pathway.

In postnatal animals, most of IGF-I circulates in ternary complexes of 150 kDa composed of one molecule each of IGF-I, IGF-binding protein-3, or IGF-binding protein-5, and an acid-labile subunit (ALS) (3.Jones J.I.

They are almost completely absent in the plasma of GH-deficient rodents because circulating ALS and IGF-I originates mostly from the liver where transcription of both genes is dependent on adequate circulating levels of GH (9.Gargosky S.E.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The effects of GH on hepatic gene transcription are impaired in many diseased states, including malnutrition, infection, inflammation, and sepsis (12.Frost R.A. Lang C.H. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr.

Metab. 1998; 12: 315-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Individuals suffering from these diseased states have low circulating levels of IGF-I in the presence of normal or elevated concentrations of GH, and are unable to increase circulating IGF-I in response to GH therapy (13.Jenkins R.C. Ross R.J. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 12: 315-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14.Dahn M.S. Lange M.P. Jacobs L.A. Arch. Surg. 1988; 123: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Deleterious consequences of reduced circulating IGF-I include the development of negative N balance and muscle wasting (12.Frost R.A. Lang C.H. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab.

Metab. 1997; 11: 679-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Increased production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6 by monocytes and macrophages have been implicated in the development of a GH-resistant state in some of these catabolic diseases (12.Frost R.A. Lang C.H. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1998; 1: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In rats, administration of the endotoxin liposaccharide, an inducer of IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, or direct administration of these cytokines reduced hepatic production and circulating levels of IGF-I as well as the ability of GH to increase hepatic IGF-I mRNA (16.Fan J. Char D. Kolasa A.J. Pan W. Maitra S.R. Patlak C.S. Spolarics Z. Gelato M.C. Lang C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E33-E42PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Fan J. Wojnar M.M. Theodorakis M. Lang C.H. Am. J.

Gelato M.C. Lang C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R1204-R1212PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which these cytokines induces a state of GH resistance in liver has not been completely elucidated. They could repress transcription of GH-responsive genes directly, or they could prevent transmission of the GH signal. This last mechanism is suggested by the ability of IL-1β to block the GH-dependent induction of ALS and IGF-I mRNA in primary hepatocytes (20.Delhanty P.J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21.Thissen J.-P. Verniers J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22.Wolf M. Bohm S. Brand M. Kreymann G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 135: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the case of IGF-I, studies of the mechanism underlying the effect of IL-1β are complicated by the lack of information regarding regulatory sequence and transcription factors involved in GH stimulation of gene transcription (23.Thomas M.J. Kikuchi K. Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24.Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have demonstrated that GH stimulates the transcription of the ALS gene in primary hepatocytes and in the H4-II-E hepatoma liver cell line by inducing the binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-5a and -5b to a single element resembling a γ-interferon activated sequence (GAS) in the promoter (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this model of GH-regulated transcription in liver, we demonstrate that IL-1β inhibits the GH-induced transcription of the ALS gene by inducing the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), a member of a family of intracellular protein involved in the termination of signaling by the JAK-STAT pathway (26.Yoshimura A. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,27.Starr R. Hilton D.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SOCS can play broader roles such as mediating cross-talk between JAK-STAT and unrelated signal transduction pathways. Restriction endonucleases, DNA polymerase, and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Tissue culture media and bovine insulin were from Life Technologies, Inc., and protease inhibitors and dexamethasone from Sigma. The basement membrane Matrigel® was purchased from Becton Dickinson Labware (Bedford, MA). Recombinant bovine GH was a gift from Protiva (St. Louis, MO), recombinant human IL-1β a donation from the Biological Resources Branch of the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). DEAE-dextran and the DNA alternating copolymers poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were custom-made by Life Technologies, Inc. or by the BioResource Center at Cornell University. Radionucleotides were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Construction of the mouse ALS promoter plasmids has been described in detail (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fragments corresponding to nt −703 to nt −11 (A+1TG) or to nt −1627 to nt −11 of the mouse ALS gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and inserted between the KpnI and HindIII restriction sites of the promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-basic (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) to give plasmid 703WT and 1627WT, respectively. Block substitution mutants of two GAS-like sites were generated in the context of 703WT by replacing 9 base pairs of native sequence with anEcoRI linker (5′-CGAATTCGC-3′) between nt −633 and −625 to give plasmid 703ΔALS1, and between nt −553 and −545 to give plasmid 703ΔALS2. For each construct, two independent polymerase chain reactions were performed with the high fidelity Vent polymerase, and used to prepare duplicate plasmids. The expression vector pEF-FLAG-I/SOCS3 was constructed by inserting the coding region of the mouse SOCS3 cDNA into the mammalian expression vector pEF-FLAG-I, and was obtained from Drs. D. J Hilton and R. Starr (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Australia) (28.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar). All plasmids were purified by ion-exchange chromatography (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). H4-II-E cells were plated and grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in Falcon® tissue culture dish (Becton Dickinson Labware). Primary hepatocytes were isolated from adult male rats by the recirculating collagenase perfusion method (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), according to procedures approved by the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. They were plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/9.5 cm2 in Primaria culture dish (Becton Dickinson Labware) and allowed to attach for 5 h in modified William's E medium (MWEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (MWEM is William's E supplemented to 27.5 mm glucose, 23 mm HEPES, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, 2 mm glutamine, 10 nm dexamethasone, 3.84 μg/ml bovine insulin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). For the preparation of nuclear extracts and total RNA, H4-II-E cells or primary hepatocytes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium. Media were then changed to fresh serum-free medium (DMEM for H4-II-E, MWEM containing 500 μg/ml Matrigel® for the primary hepatocytes) supplemented with various cytokines as indicated in the figure legends. Total RNA was prepared from rat liver cells by the acid guanidium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform method, and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm (11.Ooi G.T. Cohen F.J. Tseng L.Y.-H. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Total RNA (15 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized to [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes. Probes used included the coding region of mouse SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, and CIS cDNA (obtained from Drs. Hilton and Starr; Ref. 28.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar), and a DNA fragment corresponding to nt +1262 to nt +1555 of the rat ALS cDNA (A+1TG) (29.Dai J. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Staining with ethidium bromide confirmed that ribosomal RNA was intact and that equal amounts of RNA were loaded in each lane. The relative abundance of each signal was quantified by phosphorimaging using a Fuji BAS 1000 unit (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). Nuclear extracts were prepared rapidly from rat liver cells by the mini-extraction procedure of Lee et al. (30.Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), modified by the inclusion of protease and phosphatase inhibitors in the various buffers (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration of each extract was determined by the Lowry method. Nuclear extracts (6 μg) were preincubated for 10 min in a buffer containing 1 μg of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT), 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then a radiolabeled probe (4–9 fmol, 20,000–40,000 cpm), corresponding to nt −638 to nt −621 of the mouse ALS gene (ALSGAS1; top strand, AGGTGTTCCTAGAAGAGG, bottom strand, CCTCTTCTAGGAACA), was added (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This probe was prepared by labeling the double-stranded ALSGAS1 oligonucleotide with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, protein-DNA complexes were separated on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (38:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide; 2% glycerol, 22 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 15 mA (2 h at 4 °C). Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C using intensifying screens. Relative intensity of the specific protein-DNA complexes were quantified by phosphorimaging. Transfections were performed exactly as described previously (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that cells were grown in six-well plates. Briefly, each well of near confluent H4-II-E cells were exposed to 100 μl of a DNA solution (0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran, 0.7 μg of firefly luciferase plasmid, 0.3 μg of plasmid pRL-TK, and, when indicated, 0.5 μg of pEF-FLAG-I/SOCS3 or pEF-FLAG-I). The plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) encodes Renillaluciferase and was used to correct for variation in transfection efficiency. After a 40-h recovery period in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, media were changed to serum-free DMEM supplemented with cytokines as indicated in the figure legends. Twenty hours later, cell lysates were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega). For primary hepatocytes, each well of a six-well plate was transfected for 14 h with a 1 ml solution of serum-free MWEM containing 1.2 μg of the firefly luciferase plasmid, 300 ng of pRL-TK, and 15 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). In some experiments, 0.5 μg of pEF-FLAG-I/SOCS3 or pEF-FLAG-I was added to this solution. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 48 h in MWEM (supplemented with 500 μg/ml Matrigel® for the first 24 h) in the absence or presence of cytokines as specified in the figure legends. Firefly and Renilla luciferase were then measured as described above. IL-1β has been reported to reduce the ability of GH to increase the synthesis of ALS in primary rat hepatocytes (20.Delhanty P.J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To document this effect, primary hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h in the absence or in the presence of a maximally effective dose of 100 ng/ml GH with increasing concentrations of IL-1β (Fig.1). GH increased the abundance of ALS mRNA by 12-fold, whereas IL-1β inhibited this stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition by IL-1β reached a maximum at the dose of 10 ng/ml. We next determine whether the inhibitory effects of IL-1β occurred at the level of transcription. The H4-II-E rat hepatoma cells, which we have shown to recapitulate exactly the mechanisms leading to basal and GH-stimulated transcription of the mouse ALS gene (11.Ooi G.T. Cohen F.J. Tseng L.Y.-H. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with a luciferase construct driven by a promoter fragment corresponding to nt −703 to nt −11 (703WT) of the mouse ALS gene. Transfected cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence or in the presence of 100 ng/ml GH with increasing concentrations of IL-1β (Fig. 2). As shown previously (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GH stimulated the luciferase activity of this construct by 2.6-fold. This stimulation was suppressed by IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibition of 43% at the dose of 10 ng/ml, similar to the concentration required for maximal inhibition of ALS mRNA in primary rat hepatocytes. These results indicate that inhibition of transcription is an important mechanism by which IL-1β reduces the GH-mediated increase in ALS gene expression. We have shown previously that ALSGAS1, a single GAS element located between nt −633 and nt −625, mediates the GH stimulation of ALS gene transcription (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of IL-1β could be dependent on the GAS element or could involve a distinct regulatory sequence in the ALS promoter. To distinguish between these possibilities, H4-II-E cells were transfected with the luciferase plasmids 703WT, 703ΔGAS1, or 703ΔGAS2, and treated with GH with or without IL-1β. Plasmid 703ΔGAS1 is identical to 703WT, except for an inactivating block mutation of the GH-response element ALSGAS1. Plasmid 703ΔGAS2 contains an identical mutation in a GAS-like sequence located between nt −553 and −545 that plays no role in the the GH stimulation of the ALS promoter (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β alone did not alter the basal activity of the wild type or of the mutant luciferase constructs (Fig.3). Similar results were obtained with the luciferase plasmid 1627WT, which contains an additional 925 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence from the mouse ALS promoter (results not shown). These results indicate that the promoter region comprised between nt −1627 and nt −11 does not contain an IL-1β-responsive element. In contrast, IL-1β readily inhibited the GH-dependent increase of luciferase activity in H4-II-E cells transfected with the plasmids 703WT or 703ΔGAS2. This inhibition was not observed in H4-II-E cells transfected with the plasmid 703ΔGAS1, which harbors a mutation of the GH-responsive element, ALSGAS1. Therefore, inhibition of ALS expression by IL-1β is dependent on GH stimulation and does not occur in GH-treated cells unless the GH response element of the ALS promoter is present. GH stimulates the transcription of the ALS gene through activation of STAT5a and STAT5b, followed by their binding to the ALSGAS1 element (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 by receptor-associated JAK2 kinases is required for nuclear translocation and DNA binding (31.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev.

To determine whether formation of the GH-dependent STAT5-DNA complex is affected by IL-1β, nuclear extracts were prepared from H4-II-E cells treated for 15 min to 24 h with GH, IL-1β or the combination of both cytokines, and analyzed by EMSA using a radiolabeled ALSGAS1 probe (Fig.4). As expected, GH was able to induce the binding of STAT5 isoforms to ALSGAS1 2We have shown previously that this complex is specific in H4-II-E cells and in primary hepatocytes as shown by competition with excess ALSGAS1 oligonucleotide, but not by an excess of unrelated oligonucleotide (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed, using specific antibodies, that this complex is composed exclusively of STAT5a and STAT5b (25.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (Fig. 4). Binding was maximal after 15 min of treatment and remained obvious after 24 h of continuous incubation with GH. In contrast, nuclear extracts from IL-1β-treated cells did not induce the formation of any protein-DNA complexes over this time period. However, when used in conjunction with GH, IL-1β was able to reduce the abundance of the GH-dependent STAT5-ALSGAS1 complex after 8 and 24 h of incubation (Fig. 4, compare lanes 8 and10, and lanes 11 and 13), but had no effects at earlier times (15 min and 1 h; comparelanes 2 and 4, and lanes 5 and 7). The abundance of total STAT5, however, was not reduced by incubation with IL-1β with or without GH over this time period when analyzed by immunoblotting (results not shown). Therefore, these results indicate that IL-1β reduces the abundance of activated STAT5 binding to the ALSGAS1 element, leading to a decrease in the GH-dependent transcription of the ALS gene. The inhibitory effects of IL-1β on STAT5 binding develops slowly, suggesting that they might represent secondary effects. Recently, a family of proteins able to suppress signaling by the JAK-STAT pathway was discovered (26.Yoshimura A. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27.Starr R. Hilton D.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These proteins, called suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), inhibit transcriptional responses to many cytokines, in part by reducing the abundance of activated STAT (32.Song M.M. Shuai K. J.

Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the possible involvement of SOCS in mediating the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on ALS promoter activity, H4-II-E cells were treated with maximally effective concentrations of GH, IL-1β or the combination of both. Total RNA was prepared before (15 min) and after (8 and 24 h) the suppression by IL-1β of the GH-dependent formation of STAT5-ALSGAS1 complexes, and analyzed by Northern blotting for the steady state abundance of SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3, and CIS mRNAs (Fig.5). At the 15-min time point, abundance of CIS and SOCS2 mRNAs was low and unaffected by the various treatments. At 8 and 24 h, GH with or without IL-1β caused similar induction of SOCS2 and CIS mRNA levels, indicating GH-dependent regulation at these times. At the 24-h time point, SOCS2 mRNA was repressed by IL-1β. Finally, the abundance of SOCS1 mRNA remained very low and unresponsive to the various cytokine treatments over the study period. Overall, these changes in SOCS1, SOCS2, and CIS mRNAs cannot account for the inhibitory effects of IL-1β on GH stimulation of ALS gene expression. In contrast, the abundance of SOCS3 mRNA was increased by 2- and 8-fold following incubation of H4-II-E cells with IL-1β for 8 and 24 h, respectively (p < 0.05). A similar stimulation was seen in cells treated with IL-1β in the presence of GH, indicating that it was dependent on IL-1β but independent of GH. Induction of SOCS3 mRNA by IL-1β, therefore, correlates temporally with the inhibition of the GH-dependent events responsible for increased ALS gene expression (i.e.GH-dependent binding of STAT5 to ALSGAS1 at 8 and 24 h, and GH stimulation of ALS promoter activity at 24 h). These findings suggest that SOCS3 plays a role in mediating the inhibitory effects of IL-1β. To evaluate directly the ability of SOCS3 to inhibit the action of GH, H4-II-E cells were transfected with the luciferase plasmids 703WT or 703ΔGAS1, either in the absence or in the presence of the mouse SOCS3 expression vector or the corresponding empty vector. Transfected cells were then incubated with or without GH for 24 h (Fig.6). Overexpression of SOCS3 reduced the ability of GH to increase luciferase activity by 50%. This inhibitory effect is specific to the GH-responsive GAS element, as overexpression of SOCS3 was not able to suppress luciferase activity in GH-treated H4-II-E cells transfected with the plasmid 703ΔGAS1, the promoter construct containing a block mutation of the ALSGAS1 element. Finally, we determined whether a similar mechanism underlies the inhibition by IL-1β of the GH-dependent induction of ALS mRNA in isolated primary liver cells. In primary hepatocytes transfected with the GH-responsive ALS plasmid 703WT, IL-1β repressed ALS promoter activity only in the presence of GH (Fig. 7). This repression was also associated with a decrease in the formation of the GH-dependent STAT5-ALSGAS1 complex after 8 h of treatment with IL-1β, but not after 15 min (Fig. 7). Therefore, similar to that shown in H4-II-E cells, inhibition of the GH-activation of ALS gene expression by IL-1β is at the level of transcription in isolated liver cells and occurs after a few hours of treatment. To determine if SOCS could mediate this inhibition, we compared time-dependent changes of ALS and SOCS mRNA after the addition of IL-1β to GH-treated primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were"

Previously, we identified the widely expressed actin modulatory protein gelsolin as a prominent substrate of caspase-3 and demonstrated that the N-terminal gelsolin cleavage product promotes apoptosis. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate in pure micelles or mixed vesicles prevent caspase-3 cleavage of gelsolin. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-gelsolin strongly inhibits caspase-3 and -9 activity through the formation of a stable phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-gelsolin-caspase complex. In addition, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-gelsolin prevents apoptotic progression mediated by caspase-3 in a cell-free system, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-gelsolin-caspase-9 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-gelsolin-caspase-3 complexes form in mouse embryonic fibroblasts during apoptosis induction when stimulated with fibronectin, to delay cell death. The results suggest that gelsolin can act as both an effector and an inhibitor of caspase-3, the latter in concert with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and other membrane phospholipids to regulate the onset and progression of apoptosis.

Strasser A. Cell. 1994; 76: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Recent studies have delineated two primary pathways leading to apoptosis. The first involves the interaction between cytokine signals, e.g.tumor necrosis factor, and their receptors, which leads to activation of the initiator caspase-8 (4.Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

The second pathway is a stress response pathway in which release of mitochondrial cytochrome c leads to formation of the apoptosome complex in which caspase-9 is activated (5.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6259) Google Scholar). Both pathways then converge to activate the effector caspase-3, -2, and -7, which have multiple downstream targets, resulting in the morphological and nuclear changes of apoptosis. Bcl-2 and some related proteins inhibit the early stages in the activation of the second pathway (6.Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Several inhibitors of caspase-3 and -7 are known (XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, survivin), but their effectiveness in inhibitiing apoptosis in vivo and tissue distribution is uncertain (7.LaCasse E.C.

Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Gelsolin was identified as a prominent substrate of caspase-3 in murine embryos in an in vitro translation assay system (9.Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Gelsolin is cleaved between residues Asp-352 and Gly-353, and the N-terminal gelsolin fragment contributes to the morphologic changes of apoptosis, demonstrated by the accelerated apoptosis of wild-type neutrophils in comparison with gelsolin null neutrophils. Gelsolin is also cleaved and appears to contribute to apoptotic progression in vascular smooth muscle cells (10.Geng Y.J. Azuma T. Tang J.X. Hartwig J.H. Muszynski M. Wu Q. Libby P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, in Jurkat cells, a human T lymphocyte cell line, expression of gelsolin has been reported to inhibit apoptosis induced by any of several different stimuli, including both cytokine apoptosis inducers and stress response activators (11.Ohtsu M.

Here, we explored the mechanism and cellular circumstances in which gelsolin might act as an inhibitor of apoptosis. Phospholipids were obtained from either Sigma or Fluka. Recombinant caspases were prepared as described (caspase-3), (9.Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J.

Murine mutant D352K gelsolin (aspartic acid at amino acid 352 replaced with a lysine) was made by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, cloned into pMW172, and confirmed by sequencing. Wild-type and D352K mutant gelsolins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as described (12.Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A D4-GDI expression construct was the gift of Dr. Bing Lim (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA). Caspase-3 -8, -9 activity levels were assayed by the release of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (AFC)1 from DEVD-AFC, IETD-AFC, or LEHD-AFC, respectively, using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5 fluorimeter (excitation 405 nm, emission 500 nm) in 50 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 10 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm peptide substrate. The inhibition rate (K i) was calculated from reaction rates on progression curves performed with DEVD-AFC, 0.3 nmcaspase-3, 60 nm gelsolin, plus or minus phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) at concentrations of 250 nm–2 mm. Primary murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from wild-type and gelsolin null mouse day 12.5 embryos were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin G-streptomycin sulfate. Serum-starved quiescent MEF cells were detached from culture dishes with trypsin, treated with 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, washed, and placed in serum-free media (SFM) for 8 h. Glass coverslips or tissue culture plates were coated with either 50 mg/ml fibronectin (FN) overnight at 4 °C or 10 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (PLL) at room temperature for 1 h. Cells in SFM were plated onto the coverslips in SFM. Cell death was analyzed using the ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay (CLONTECH). Rabbit anti-murine gelsolin antibody was used as described (13.Azuma T. Witke W. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-6xhis tag antibody was the gift of Hiroaki Onda (Brigham and Women's Hospital). Rabbit anti-caspase-3 antibody was prepared using purified caspase-3 expressed in E. coli. Anti-PI(4,5)P2 antibodies were obtained from Advanced Magnetics (Cambridge, MA). Immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE was performed using ECL (13.Azuma T. Witke W. Stossel T.P. Hartwig J.H. Kwiatkowski D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). One mg of wild-type or D352K mutant gelsolin was pre-incubated with or without 0.3 mm PI(4,5)P2, and added to purified 0.25 mg of caspase-3 or 1.0 mg of caspase-9 with or without caspase peptide inhibitor (1 mm z-VAD-fmk or 1 mm LEHF-fmk, respectively) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. In some experiments, PI(4,5)P2 was pre-mixed with the PIP2 binding peptide rhodamine B-QRLFQVKGRR (gelsolin-60–169) (14.Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before adding it to the reaction mixture. After incubation at 4 °C for 60 min, anti-gelsolin antibody immobilized on protein A-agarose beads (ImmunoPure IgG, Pierce) was added and incubated for 30 min. at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer without a reducing reagent and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cellular extracts were processed similarly after lysis with TTE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Cell extracts were prepared as described (15.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Mouse hepatocyte nuclei were prepared by homogenizing fresh mouse liver in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 2.4 m sucrose, 15 mm KCl, 2 mmsodium-EDTA, 0.15 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with a Dounce homogenizer using a B-type pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged through a 10-ml cushion of buffer A at 25,000 rpm for 1 h in a SW 28 rotor at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer C (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 20 mmNaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm DTT) at 5.0 × 107 nuclei/ml and stored at −80 °C (15.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). 50 μl (500 μg of protein) of Jurkat cell extract, 10 μl of hepatocyte nuclei, and 250 ng of caspase-3 were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence or absence of lipids and gelsolin. DNA was extracted and size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Lipid bilayer vesicles were prepared by drying a chloroform mixture containing 30% phosphatidylcholine (PC), 40% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and 20% phosphatidylserine (PS) onto a glass surface with N2 gas (16.Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A. Cantley L.C. Stossel T.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32986-32993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Vesicles were swelled off the glass by the addition of buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 211 mm sucrose) with or without PI(4,5)P2 to make the final PI(4,5)P2 concentration at 10%. Hydrated vesicles were extruded through a 100-nm membrane to make unilamellar vesicles of uniform size. Vesicles were then diluted into iso-osmotic buffers containing 120 mm KCl but no sucrose. Despite the rapid and complete cleavage of gelsolin by caspase-3in vitro, we observed that some gelsolin remained uncleaved in all cells even after complete cell death (9.Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Because gelsolin binds to Ca2+, actin, polyphosphoinositides (17.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and lysophosphatidic acid (18.Meerschaert K. Corte V.D. Yvette D.V. Vandekerckhove J. Gettemans J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5923-5932Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with high affinity, we examined whether these binding partners could affect caspase-3 cleavage of gelsolin. Although free Ca2+ concentrations in the nm to mm range had no effect on the rate of gelsolin cleavage, such cleavage was blocked by bound actin (data not shown) and by bound PI(4,5)P2 at all Ca2+ concentrations (Fig.1 a). Complete inhibition of caspase-3 cleavage of gelsolin was observed with PI(4,5)P2at a molar ratio of 30:1 PI(4,5)P2:gelsolin, consistent with the assembly of PI(4,5)P2 into micelles of ∼90 kDa and a binding stoichiometry of 1 micelle:1 gelsolin (17.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 b). Other lipids (PS, PC) not known to bind to gelsolin had no effect on caspase-3 cleavage of gelsolin (data not shown). We then examined whether PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin or gelsolin-actin had any effect on caspase-3 activity. PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin inhibited caspase-3 cleavage of the fluorogenic peptide substrate DEVD-AFC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 a), and a 100:1 ratio of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin complex:caspase-3 resulted in near complete inhibition (K i = 1.5 nm). No effect on caspase-3 activity was seen with PI(4,5)P2alone. Gelsolin ± PC or PS caused a mild decline in fluorescence increase, as gelsolin is a preferred substrate (9.Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). PI(3,4)P2-gelsolin also had strong inhibitory activity (K i = 0.9 nm, Fig. 2 b), as did gelsolin added to PI(4,5)P2-PC-PS-mixed micelles (Fig.2 c). The ability of clustered PI(4,5)P2 within the mixed micelles to bind to gelsolin (17.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibit caspase-3 suggests that PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin complexes that occurin vivo (19.Chellaiah M. Hruska K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) could inhibit caspase-3. In contrast gelsolin-actin complexes had no effect on caspase-3 activity. A D352K mutant gelsolin (aspartic acid (D) at residue 352 changed to lysine (K)) was generated and had PI(4,5)P2-sensitive actin severing activity similar to that of native gelsolin (data not shown). The D352K mutant gelsolin, however, was completely resistant to caspase-3 cleavage (data not shown), and PI(4,5)P2-D352K-gelsolin did not inhibit caspase-3 (Fig.2 d). These observations suggest that the site of interaction between PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin and caspase-3 involves the Asp-352 gelsolin cleavage site. The effect of PI(4,5)P2 on another caspase-3 substrate, D4-GDI (20.Na S. Chuang T.H. Cunningham A. Turi T.G. Hanke J.H. Bokoch G.M. Danley D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11209-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), was also examined. D4-GDI cleavage by caspase-3 was not affected by PI(4,5)P2 (data not shown), and mixtures of PI(4,5)P2 and D4-GDI had no effect on caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2 e). We also examined other caspases and found that caspase-7 and -9 cleaved gelsolin in a manner similar to caspase-3, whereas caspase-1, -6, and -8 did not cleave gelsolin (Fig.3 a). In addition, the PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin complex inhibited caspase-9 activity on a peptide substrate (Fig. 3 b), similar to its effect on caspase-3, but did not inhibit caspase-8 (Fig. 3 c). Consistent with these observations, we also demonstrated that PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin formed a stable complex with these caspases (Fig. 3 d). For each of caspase-3 and -9, incubation with PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin yielded a complex that could be isolated by immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for gelsolin, and shown to contain the caspase. Pre-incubation with either a caspase active site covalent ligand (zVAD-fmk and LEHD-fmk, respectively, for caspase-3 and -9) or a molar excess of a PI(4,5)P2 binding peptide (14.Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) blocked formation of the ternary complex. The D352K-gelsolin did not form a complex with the caspases in parallel experiments, confirming the importance of the wild-type cleavage site within gelsolin for this interaction (Fig. 3 d). To explore the in vivo significance of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin inhibition of caspases, we began with an assay of DNA fragmentation in a cell-free system consisting of Jurkat cell cytoplasmic extracts and mouse hepatocyte nuclei (15.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar) and added caspase-3. We also prepared unilamellar bilayer vesicles containing PS, PC, and PE, as well as 10% PI(4,5)P2 to mimic native cell membrane. In this assay, both PI(4,5)P2 micelles and PI(4,5)P2 in vesicles without gelsolin had a slight inhibitory effect on DNA fragmentation, whereas gelsolin alone or vesicles without PI(4,5)P2 showed no inhibition (Fig.4). Both PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin and PI(4,5)P2/vesicle-gelsolin inhibited DNA fragmentation to a major extent, and at higher doses of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin, this inhibition appeared to be complete. Note that this occurred at relatively low concentrations of PI(4,5)P2, possibly reflecting the contribution of cellular phospholipid to this inhibition or the enhanced binding of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin to caspase-3 under these conditions. To explore the in vivo significance of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin inhibition of caspase activity during apoptosis directly, we used MEF obtained from wild-type and gelsolin null day 12.5 embryos (12.Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments (data not shown), we observed that during apoptosis induced by either serum withdrawal (0.2% fetal calf serum) or cycloheximide (10 mg/ml), pre-treatment with a phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122) increased cellular levels of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin (21.Chen P. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and significantly delayed the onset of apoptosis in wild-type MEF compared with similarly treated gelsolin null MEF. For a model more closely approximating in vivo conditions, we induced apoptosis in wild-type and gelsolin null MEF by serum withdrawal and used plating on fibronectin-coated dishes to stimulate formation of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin complexes. Gelsolin null MEF had similar rates of apoptosis when plated on either fibronectin-coated or poly-l-lysine-coated dishes (Fig.5 b). In contrast, apoptosis in wild-type MEF was significantly delayed when the cells were plated on fibronectin in comparison with plating on poly-l-lysine (Fig. 5 a). In addition, processing of both pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 to their active forms was delayed in the wild-type MEF plated on fibronectin, in comparison with gelsolin null MEF plated on fibronectin (Fig. 5, c–f), consistent with the presence of an inhibitory molecule or effect in the wild-type cells. Gelsolin cleavage was also delayed in the wild-type MEF plated on fibronectin compared with plating on poly-l-lysine (Fig. 5,g and h). We also observed that as gelsolin levels fell somewhat during these conditions, PI(4,5)P2binding to gelsolin, as assessed by immunoprecipitation of gelsolin, followed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting for PI(4,5)P2, occurred within 2 h of plating on fibronectin and persisted for up to 18 h (Fig. 5, i and j). To confirm that a complex between gelsolin and caspases formed during these treatments, we immunoprecipitated gelsolin from cell extracts and found that both caspase-3 and caspase-9 were stably bound to gelsolin at appropriate intervals after plating on fibronectin (Fig. 5, k andl). The presence of PI(4,5)P2 in these complexes was confirmed by immunoprecipitation for each of the caspases from cell extracts, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 5 m). Gelsolin is a widely and relatively highly expressed protein that is important in the mediation of actin-based motility in several cell types (12.Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T.

Here, we have shown that the PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin complex is a high affinity inhibitor of caspase-3 and -9, forming a stable ternary complex with each caspase both in vitro and in vivo. Many substrates and inhibitors of caspases have been identified throughin vitro biochemical assays, whereas only a few have been shown to have critical roles in apoptotic progression in vivo (23.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6181) Google Scholar, 24.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The IAP family members, cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, NAIP, and survivin, all inhibit caspase activity and apoptotic progression, but with limited induction agent specificity and uncertain in vivo distribution (23.Thornberry N.A.

Bcl-2 family members bcl-2, bclX, and BID are all cleaved by different caspases, and in all cases such cleavage greatly accentuates their pro-apoptotic activity (26.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

The inhibitory activity of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin is as strong as that of the most potent IAP proteins (23.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6181) Google Scholar, 24.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 25.Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar), although it is also novel in the requirement for bound phosphoinositide. In contrast, cleaved gelsolin has potent apoptosis promoting capability (9.Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), showing that gelsolin can act as a double-edged sword during apoptosis, serving as a brake against apoptotic progression as well as an active effector of apoptosis. The balance between these two opposing activities of gelsolin may have significant effects on the onset and progression of apoptosis. Growth factor treatment and binding to adhesive substrates each prevents or delays apoptosis in many cell types, acting through phospholipid and kinase signaling pathways (29.Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar). We have shown that binding to fibronectin by MEF cells leads to formation of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin complexes that directly contribute to this anti-apoptotic pathway by complexing with active caspase-3 and -9. The full extent of involvement of PI(4,5)P2-gelsolin in preventing or delaying apotosis in vivo will require further study of additional cell types and models of apoptosis induction, but the induced proximity model of caspase activation (30.Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) implies that caspase inhibitors are critical regulator of apoptosis induction. In addition, expression of gelsolin in Jurkat cells (a human T cell line) is reported to prevent apoptotic progression in response to several stimuli (18.Meerschaert K. Corte V.D. Yvette D.V. Vandekerckhove J. Gettemans J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5923-5932Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and may be due to gelsolin inhibition of caspase activity. The balance of gelsolin activity in apoptosis (anti- versuspro-) may well be highly cell type- and stimulus-specific, similar to observations made on the role of caspases and Bcl proteins (23.Thornberry N.A.

IRS-1 associates with an insoluble multiprotein complex, possibly the cytoskeleton, in adipocytes. This localization may facilitate interaction with the IR at the cell surface. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that the release of IRS proteins from this location may be a mechanism for insulin desensitization. We show that a second IRS protein, IRS-2, is associated with a multiprotein complex in adipocytes with similar characteristics to the IRS-1 complex. Insulin treatment (15–60 min) caused the release of IRS-1 and IRS-2 from this complex (high speed pellet; HSP) into the cytosol, whereas the level of tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS proteins remained constant. Chronic insulin treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the HSP, eventually (>2 h) leading to IRS protein degradation and decreased levels of tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS proteins. Okadaic acid, which rapidly induces insulin resistance in adipocytes independently of IR function, caused an almost quantitative release of IRS-1 into the cytosol commensurate with a significant reduction in tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS proteins. Platelet-derived growth factor, a factor known to compromise insulin signaling, caused a more moderate release of IRS proteins from the HSP. Collectively, these results suggest that the assembly of IRS-1/IRS-2 into a multiprotein complex facilitates coupling to the IR and that the regulated release from this location may represent a novel mechanism of insulin resistance.

One property that distinguishes the IR from other growth factor receptors is its ability to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of a family of intracellular signaling molecules referred to as insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (2.Lavan B.E.

IRS proteins contain a pleckstrin homology domain and a phosphotyrosine binding domain, both of which are required for the efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins by the activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (6.Gustafson T.A.

The first member of the IRS family to be identified, IRS-1, encodes a 160-kDa protein that is highly expressed in physiologically insulin-responsive tissues such as adipocytes and muscle cells and has been implicated in the control of a number of insulin-sensitive metabolic pathways including glucose transport, lipid deposition, and glycogen synthesis (8.Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 82: 13-22Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In response to insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues within the C terminus of IRS-1 by the IR leads to the generation of highly specific binding sites for a number of Src homology 2 domain-containing downstream signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositide (PI) 3-kinase, Syp, Nck, Fyn, and Grb-2 (8.Ogawa W.

In basal cells, IRS-1 is also highly phosphorylated on serine and threonine (Ser/Thr) residues, and insulin acutely stimulates a further increase in IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation (4.Sun X.J.

The signaling function of IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation is unknown, although this may regulate the docking of other types of signaling molecules such as 14-3-3 proteins (16.Craparo A. Freund R.

Defects within insulin signaling pathways comprise a major locus for the development of insulin resistance in disease states such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (18.De Fronzo R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Certain forms of insulin resistance, such as that induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, okadaic acid, or chronic insulin treatment, may be due to uncoupling of the IR activity toward IRS-1 (19.Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 20.Tanti J.-F. Gremeaux T. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E.

While the molecular basis for this defect is unclear, a common observation in cells subjected to these conditions is that IRS-1 becomes hyperphosphorylated on serine and threonine residues and various intracellular Ser/Thr kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase-3, protein kinase C-α, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and protein kinase B/Akt, have been implicated in mediating this effect (22.Hotamisligil G.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The decline in insulin sensitivity invoked by tumor necrosis factor-α has recently been attributed to a dominant negative effect exerted by hyperphosphorylated IRS-1 upon the IR intrinsic tyrosine kinase (19.Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). However, neither okadaic acid nor chronic insulin treatment appear to disrupt IR tyrosine kinase activity in response to acute insulin activation (20.Tanti J.-F. Gremeaux T. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 64: E868-E873Google Scholar, 21.Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. J. Biol.

Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These latter observations suggest that other mechanisms may operate to induce insulin resistance. We have recently provided evidence to suggest that IRS-1 is enriched in a cytoskeletal fraction in adipocytes that is insoluble in a range of nonionic detergents (29.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This accounts for early reports suggesting that IRS-1 is bound to membranes, because the cytoskeletal fraction co-fractionates with microsomal membranes during ultracentrifugation (30.Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The anchoring of IRS-1 to the cytoskeleton may be of particular importance to the efficacy of insulin signaling by providing a platform for localizing IRS-1 within proximity to the insulin receptor. This arrangement may also provide a robust link between IRS-1 and downstream signaling proteins such as PI 3-kinase, which also appears to associate with this insoluble fraction (29.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). One functional consequence of this spatial localization is that it may create a unique site for the generation of specific signals required for insulin action. Consistent with the latter notion, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) also activates PI 3-kinase in adipocytes but has no significant effect on PI 3-kinase-dependent functions in these cells, including glucose transport and glycogen synthesis (32.Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that IRS-1 exists in at least two distinct pools in adipocytes: the cytoskeletal component and the cytosol (31.Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, short term insulin treatment triggers the release of IRS-1 from the cytoskeletal fraction into the cytosol (31.Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has been argued that the cytoskeletal component represents the functional pool of IRS-1, because most of the tyrosyl-phosphorylated IRS-1 is found in this pool, and there is a net increase in PI 3-kinase in this fraction in response to insulin (34.Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hence, it may be postulated that the deactivation of IRS-1 corresponds to its translocation from this fraction into the cytosol. This model raises the possibility that the cytosolic pool of IRS-1 is nonfunctional presumably due to its inaccessibility to the IR. Therefore, inappropriate accumulation of IRS-1 in the cytosol may disengage this protein from the receptor, resulting in a state of insulin resistance. In the present study, we have tested the notion that the intracellular location of IRS-1 can be modified under conditions that normally cause insulin resistance and/or alter insulin signaling potential. In addition, we have extended this hypothesis to include the IRS-1 homologue, IRS-2, which is also expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results show that a significant proportion of IRS-1 and IRS-2 are found in a detergent-resistant insoluble fraction that has properties analogous to the cytoskeleton. Moreover, IRS proteins translocate from this location into the cytosol following exposure of adipocytes to chronic insulin treatment or okadaic acid or PDGF. These data suggest that the intracellular location of IRS proteins is regulated in a way that may influence insulin action.

A cDNA fragment encoding the entire sequence of HA-IRS-1 was then amplified using standard polymerase chain reaction protocols. The amplified product was isolated, digested with SalI, and subcloned intoSalI sites of a eukaryotic expression vector, pMEX (36.Benito M. Porras A. Nebrada A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Clones carrying the insert in the desired orientation were verified by restriction mapping. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (37.Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mmglutamine for 2 h at 37 °C and subsequently incubated with insulin (1 μm) for 0.25 h (acute) or for 0.25, 1, 2, or 4 h (chronic) or with PDGF (50 ng/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, cells were incubated with wortmannin (100 nm) for 15 min and then insulin (1 μm) and wortmannin for 1 h at 37 °C. Medium was replaced with medium containing fresh wortmannin (100 nm) and insulin (1 μm) 30 min prior to harvesting cells. In other experiments, cells were incubated with okadaic acid (2.5–5.0 μm) for 30 min, during which insulin (1 μm) was added to the incubation medium for the last 15 min. In glucose uptake assays, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (2.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mmNaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4), KRP, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 3.0 mm sodium pyruvate, for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then incubated with PDGF (50 ng/ml) for 1 h and subsequently incubated with insulin (1 μm) for a further 15 min. CHO cells overexpressing the insulin receptor (CHO-IR) were kindly donated by Dr. M White (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and were maintained in culture as described previously (29.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Prior to transfection, cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and grown for a further 24 h to achieve 60–80% confluence. Transient transfections were performed by incubating cells in medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, nonessential amino acids, 2 mml-glutamine) containing 6 μg of HA-IRS-1/pMEX and 30 μl of Lipofectamine reagent for 5 h at 37 °C. Transfection medium was then replaced with CHO cell culture media, and cells were grown to 100% confluence. Transfected cells were subsequently serum-starved and exposed to chronic insulin treatment as described above for adipocytes. In preliminary experiments, immunofluorescence studies of CHO-IR cells transfected with HA-IRS-1 cDNA showed that at least 20–30% of cells expressed full-length HA-IRS-1 protein. After incubation with the appropriate agents, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed three times with ice-cold HES buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose) and homogenized in the same buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm tetra-sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm ammonium molybdate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Subcellular fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation as previously detailed (37.Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Briefly, cell homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in HES buffer and layered onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion as described by Piperet al. (37.Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 77,000 ×g for 1 h, the plasma membrane fraction was collected from the 1.12 m sucrose interface. The supernatant from the 13,000 × g centrifugation step was subjected to centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the high density microsomal fraction. The resultant supernatant was subjected to further centrifugation at 175,000 × g for 75 min to obtain the high speed pellet (HSP). The supernatant from this centrifugation step was designated the cytosol fraction. The membrane pellets were solubilized with 1% SDS in PBS. In some experiments, the HSP fraction from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was resuspended and incubated in HES containing 1% Triton X-100 (Pierce) for 1 h on ice. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 175,000 ×g for 75 min at 4 °C, and the resultant pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS in PBS. CHO-IR cells overexpressing HA-IRS-1 were subjected to chronic insulin treatment, and the HSP from these cells was obtained as described previously (29.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with some modifications. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed in ice-cold HES and then homogenized in HES buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors by passage through a 22-gauge needle. The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 15 min to remove high density microsomes, plasma membranes, mitochondria/nuclei, and cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 175,000 ×g for 75 min. The resultant supernatant was designated the cytosol. The pellet (HSP), was solubilized in 1% SDS in PBS. The amount of protein present in all samples was determined using BCA reagent (Pierce). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (38.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) or with 5% skim milk powder in PBS buffer (all other antibodies). The membranes were incubated with primary antibody, washed, and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography using enhanced chemiluminescence (Supersignal, Pierce, or ECL Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The protein bands were quantified by densitometry (GS-700 Imaging densitometer, Bio-Rad) using nonsaturated exposed x-ray films. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Microsoft Excel software. All data are presented as the mean value. 2-Deoxy-[3H]glucose uptake was measured as described previously (39.Robinson L.J. Razzack Z.F. Lawrence J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26422-26427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated in the absence or presence of growth factor in 950 μl of KRP containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 3.0 mm sodium pyruvate. The assay was initiated by adding 50 μl of 1 mm 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (20 μCi/mmol)/KRP and, after 3 min, was terminated by washing cells rapidly three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were subsequently solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, and 3H was quantitated by scintillation counting (Packard 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer, Packard Instrument Co.). Glucose uptake was measured in duplicate in all treatments. Nonspecific uptake of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose was determined by adding 50 μm cytochalasin B to the appropriate controls prior to the commencement of assays. In basal adipocytes, IRS-1 is enriched in a microsomal fraction, often referred to as the low density microsomes (31.Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33.Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition to intracellular membranes that contain the insulin-regulatable glucose transporter, GLUT4, the low density microsomes fraction also contains cytoskeleton and other large protein complexes. In fact, >60% of the protein in this fraction is insoluble in nonionic detergents, so we now refer to this fraction as the high speed pellet, or HSP (41.Hill M.M. Clark S.F. James D.E. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2629-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast to membrane proteins such as GLUT4, IRS-1 remains insoluble following treatment of the HSP with nonionic detergents, and it does not have a buoyant density that enables it to float up through a 50% sucrose solution (29.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we proposed that IRS-1 is either attached to the cytoskeleton or found in a large protein complex that enables it to be pelleted during high speed centrifugation. In certain cellular contexts, IRS-2 may functionally substitute for IRS-1 in mediating insulin action (42.Zhou L. Chen L. Lin C.H. Cong L.-N. McGibbon M.A. Sciacchitano S. Lesniak M.A. Quon M.J. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29829-29833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the subcellular distribution of IRS-2 is indistinguishable from IRS-1 (Fig.1 A). Consistent with recent studies (34.Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 43.Anai O. Ono H. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Inukai K. Ogihara T. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29686-29692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we observed a significant amount (60–80% of the total) of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the HSP fraction in basal adipocytes. Low levels were found in the plasma membrane and high density microsome fractions, possibly due to contamination of these fractions with HSP-derived material. Significant levels (20–40%) of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were found in the cytosol under basal conditions. Consistent with previous studies (31.Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34.Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were released from the HSP into the cytosol upon acute treatment of the cells with insulin (Fig. 1 A). The HSP pool of IRS-2 exhibited similar biochemical properties to that of IRS-1, in that it remained insoluble following treatment with the nonionic detergent, Triton X-100 (Fig.1 B). In addition, flotation analysis of the HSP as described previously (29.Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) showed that, in contrast to membrane-associated proteins but identical to IRS-1, IRS-2 does not float up through a 50% sucrose solution (data not shown). These data are consistent with a model where the HSP pool of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not membrane-associated. As depicted in Fig. 1 Aand described in more recent studies (34.Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), both IRS-1 and IRS-2 undergo acute insulin-stimulated release from the HSP into the cytosol. With extended insulin treatment (15–60 min), there was significant loss of immunoreactive IRS-1 and IRS-2 from the HSP (>80%), but the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins remained fairly constant during this time (Fig. 2, A andB). This suggests that a relatively small component of the total IRS protein pool is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin at steady state and that this pool of IRS proteins is maintained despite a marked loss of immunoreactive protein from the HSP fraction following prolonged exposure to insulin. The amount of IRS proteins in the HSP continued to decline in response to long term exposure to insulin, and it was not until the cells had been incubated in the presence of insulin for up to 4 h before there was a significant decrease in tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins in the HSP f"

We hypothesized that the FKN mucin domain may be important for its function in adhesion, and tested the ability of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) fusion proteins containing the entire extracellular region (FKN-SEAP), the chemokine domain (CX3C-SEAP), or the mucin domain (mucin-SEAP) to support firm adhesion under flow. CX3C-SEAP induced suboptimal firm adhesion of resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compared with FKN-SEAP, and mucin-SEAP induced no firm adhesion. CX3C-SEAP and FKN-SEAP bound to CX3CR1 with similar affinities. By electron microscopy, fractalkine was 29 nm in length with a long stalk (mucin domain), and a globular head (CX3C). To test the function of the mucin domain, a chimeric protein replacing the mucin domain with a rod-like segment of E-selectin was constructed. This chimeric protein gave the same adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells as intact FKN, both when immobilized on glass and when expressed on the cell surface. This implies that the function of the mucin domain is to provide a stalk, extending the chemokine domain away from the endothelial cell surface to present it to flowing leukocytes.

In the classic pathway of leukocyte migration, the first step involves transient, selectin-mediated interactions between the rolling leukocytes and the endothelium (3.Ley K. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 525-528PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Chen A. Engel P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). In the next step, integrins are activated by locally produced chemokines to induce firm adhesion of the leukocyte to endothelial cells (5.Bargatze R.F. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 6.Honda S. Campbell J.J. Andrew D.P. Engelhardt B. Butcher B.A. Warnock R.A. Ye R.D. Butcher E.C. J.

Science. 1998; 279: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Leukocytes then extravasate through the vascular wall and into the tissue. Recently, a new pathway by which leukocytes can be induced to firmly adhere to endothelium and traffic into inflamed tissues has been described. This process is mediated by the chemokine fractalkine (FKN),1 expressed on endothelial cells, and its G-protein coupled receptor, CX3CR1, expressed on PBMC. Fractalkine (neurotactin in the mouse) is the first, and thus far only, member of the CX3C chemokine family, so named because the first two conserved cysteine residues are separated by three amino acids (8.Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar, 9.Pan Y. Lloyd C. Zhou H. Dolich S. Deeds J.

Another unique characteristic of fractalkine is that it is the only chemokine that is expressed on the cell surface. By nucleotide sequence analysis, fractalkine consists of a chemokine head tethered to the cell surface by a mucin stalk, followed by a single transmembrane spanning domain and a short cytoplasmic tail (8.Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar, 9.Pan Y. Lloyd C. Zhou H. Dolich S. Deeds J.

In addition, fractalkine expression on endothelium is increased by proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α. The receptor for fractalkine, CX3CR1 (V28), is expressed on T cells, monocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells (10.Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Nomiyama H. Schall T.J. Yoshie O. Cell. 1997; 91: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 11.Combadiere C. Salzwedel K. Smith E.D. Tiffany H.L.

Fractalkine and CX3CR1 function as cell adhesion molecules under both static and dynamic conditions (10.Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Nomiyama H. Schall T.J. Yoshie O. Cell. 1997; 91: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 12.Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Unlike other chemokine/G-protein coupled receptor interactions that require signal transduction and integrin activation for cell adhesion to occur, the adhesive interaction between fractalkine and CX3CR1 is independent of signal transduction or integrin function (12.Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 13.Haskell C.A. Cleary M.D. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10053-10058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore, fractalkine and CX3CR1 provide an integrin-independent mechanism for leukocyte migration. Compared with other chemokines, fractalkine has at least three unique features that may mediate its function as a cell adhesion molecule: 1) it is a transmembrane molecule with a cytoplasmic tail that may participate in signal transduction; 2) it has a mucin domain; 3) it is the only CX3C chemokine and has a three-dimensional structure that is slightly different from other chemokines (14.Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this report, we sought to determine the role of the various fractalkine domains, but in particular the mucin domain, in cell adhesion. FKN-SEAP, CX3C-SEAP, and mucin-SEAP fusion proteins were produced as described previously. (10.Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M. Nagira M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Takagi S. Nomiyama H.

DNA encoding the CX3C domain was synthesized using primers 5′-CGCGTCGACTCAGCCATGGCTCCGATA-3′ and 5′-CGCAGATCTTAGGGCAGCAGCCTGGCG-3′, and digested withSalI and BglII. DNA encoding the E selectin consensus repeat (ESCR) domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of E-selectin cDNA in pMT2 (15.Tu L. Chen A. Delahunty M.D. Moore K.L. Watson S.R. McEver R.P. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3995-4004PubMed Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-CGCAGATCTATTGTGAACTGTACAGCC-3′ and 5′-CGCTCTAGATTCACAGGTAGGTAGCAG-3′. These fragments were digested with BglII and XbaI and then ligated together into the pDREF-Hyg SEAP expression vector digested withSalI and XbaI. The nucleotide sequence of both strands of the new construct (pCX3C-ESCR-SEAP) was determined to verify its identity. A plasmid encoding a CX3C-ESCR-GFP fusion protein in which the mucin domain of full-length fractalkine was replaced by ESCR was constructed by amplifying the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of fractalkine by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-CGCTCTAGACAGGCGGTGGGGCTGCTG-3′ and 5′-CTGAGGATCCCCACGGGCACCAGGAC-3′. This fragment and the CX3C-ESCR fragment described above (prepared by digesting pCX3C-ESCR-SEAP with SalI and XbaI) were cloned into the pEGFP-N2 expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, Ca) digested with XbaI and BamHI. The nucleotide sequence of the resulting plasmid (pCX3C-ESCR-GFP) was determined for verification. SEAP fusion proteins were produced in mammalian 293/EBNA-1 cells and soluble fractalkine was generated in a baculovirus system as described previously (10.Imai T. Hieshima K. Haskell C. Baba M.

Briefly, SEAP fusion proteins were immobilized on coverslips using 10 μg/ml anti-SEAP antibody 8B6 (Sigma). Either K562, CX3CR1 transfected K562 cells (K562-CX3CR1), or purified human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were resuspended in flow buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.75 mmCaCl2, 0.75 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin) at a concentration of 1 × 106cells/ml. The cells were allowed to interact with the substrate within the flow chamber at a shear stress of 0.25 dynes/cm2 for 5 min. The shear stresses were adjusted using a Harvard Model 44 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). Following subsequent washes at shear stresses of 2, 5, and 10 dynes/cm2 for 2 min each, the number of firmly attached cells to the coverslip was counted. In studies using transfected ECV304 cells as the target for binding, the adherent cells were plated onto the glass coverslips within a 6-well cluster dish the day before the experiment.

Briefly, 2 × 105 L1.2 cells expressing CX3CR1 (V28) were incubated with various concentrations of FKN-SEAP, FKN-ESCR-SEAP, and CX3C-SEAP for 1 h at 16 °C in 200 μl of RPMI containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide. Cells were then washed and lysed in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 1% Triton X-100 and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. Following centrifugation, lysates were collected and alkaline phosphatase activity was determined by chemiluminescense. Binding data were analyzed by the LIGAND program. Samples of fractalkine-SEAP or of fractalkine alone were layered on 15–40% glycerol gradients in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and centrifuged in a SW50Ti rotor (Beckman) at 30,000 rpm for 16 h at 20 °C. Sedimentation standards (catalase, 11.3 S; bovine serum albumin, 4.6 S; and ovalbumin, 3.5 S) were centrifuged in a separate gradient. Gradients were fractionated into 12 fractions, and the protein peaks were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sedimentation coefficients were estimated relative to the standards. Peak fractions were supplemented to 40% glycerol, sprayed on mica, and rotary shadowed as described (16.Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Specimens were examined in a Phillips 301 transmission electron microscope and photographed at ×50,000 magnification. All length measurements were corrected for the presumed 1-nm shell of metal around the protein. The level of cell surface expression was determined by labeling the transfected cells with antibodies against either the chemokine domain of fractalkine (4F2) or the mucin domain (1D6) as described previously (12.Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The secondary reagent used was phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Analysis was performed on a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and data analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). To determine which domains of fractalkine may be necessary for leukocyte capture and firm adhesion, we constructed fusion proteins of the chemokine (CX3C) and mucin domains separately linked to SEAP. Based on our previous studies in which immobilized fusion proteins containing the entire extracellular region of fractalkine (FKN-SEAP) functioned as well in leukocyte capture and firm adhesion as cells expressing fractalkine, we reasoned that the extracellular domains (CX3C and mucin) contained all of the structures necessary for fractalkine-mediated cell adhesion (12.Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Both PBMC and K562 cells expressing CX3CR1 (K562-CX3CR1) on the cell surface were able to firmly adhere to immobilized fractalkine-SEAP but not to control SEAP proteins alone (Fig.1 A). CX3C-SEAP induced capture and firm adhesion of resting PBMC, but at a reduced number compared with FKN-SEAP (17 ± 7 versus 105 ± 13 cells/mm2, p < 0.005). In contrast, no interactions or firmly adherent cells were observed in association with immobilized mucin-SEAP. These results suggested that the chemokine domain provided the specificity of interaction with CX3CR1 and that the mucin domain acted to increase the affinity or avidity of CX3CR1 interaction. The mucin domain could have acted either as a co-receptor with the CX3C domain or as an extender to present the CX3C domain to CX3CR1-expressing cells. To determine if the mucin domain may itself act as a cell adhesion molecule, mucin-SEAP fusion proteins were tested for their ability to bind to K562-CX3CR1 cells by flow cytometry and L1.2-CX3CR1 cells by receptor binding assays. While FKN-SEAP fusion proteins bound well to K562-CX3CR1 cells (12.Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), mucin-SEAP did not detectably bind (not shown). Furthermore, while mucin-SEAP did not bind detectably to L1.2-CX3CR1 cells, both FKN-SEAP and CX3C-SEAP bound with similar high affinities (K d = 113 and 136 pm, respectively) (Fig. 1 B). To determine if the mucin domain could act as a stalk or presentation molecule, we determined the ultrastructure of the fractalkine extracellular domain. Information on the structures of FKN-SEAP and soluble FKN was obtained by glycerol gradient sedimentation. Fig.2 shows SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the two proteins after fractionating the gradients. Each ran as a discrete peak, indicating a homogeneous sample. FKN-SEAP showed a broad band at ∼150 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The predicted mass of the protein backbone of FKN-SEAP is 100.6 kDa, indicating that FKN-SEAP has approximately 50 kDa ofO-linked carbohydates. FKN-SEAP sedimented between catalase and bovine serum albumin, at an estimated 6.3 S.f/f min, where f is the observed frictional coefficient and f min is the frictional coefficient for an unhydrated sphere that could contain the protein mass, would be 1.1 if the protein were a monomer, and 1.7 if it were a dimer. If the protein were a monomer, thef/f min would imply a very compact, globular structure, while the value for a dimer would imply an elongated structure. It is known that SEAP forms a dimer (17.Hoylaerts M.F. Manes T. Millan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22781-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), so the sedimentation data are consistent with an elongated dimer. Baculovirus-expressed FKN sedimented much more slowly than FKN-SEAP, giving a peak near the top of the gradient. Based on the calculated mass of the protein backbone of soluble FKN (36.6 kDa), the baculovirus-derived FKN which migrated as a diffuse band between 46 and 56 kDa contains 10 to 20 kDa of O-linked carbohydrates. Since FKN ran well behind our slowest standard (ovalbumin at 3.5 S) we could only estimate the S by extrapolation, which was not very accurate. Values from 0.6 to 2.5 S were estimated in three different experiments. These values are consistent with an elongated 50-kDa protein. See Ref. 18.Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar for more extensive examples off/f min for elongated proteins. Electron microscopy of FKN-SEAP (Fig. 3) showed a large central globular particle with two thin strands projecting from them. These thin strands are identified as the mucin stalk, and had a length of 26 nm. The mucin stalk was capped by a small globular domain about 3 nm in diameter, which we identify as the cytokine domain. The entire length of the FKN molecule is 29 nm. The structure of the mucin domain as a long stalk suggested that it functioned to extend the chemokine domain for optimal interaction with cell surface CX3CR1. To confirm that the mucin domain acted as an extender and not as a co-receptor, we replaced the mucin domain in FKN-SEAP with the six short consensus repeat segments of E-selectin (Fig. 4 A). ESCR is expected to have the same length (approximately 26 nm) as the mucin domain (19.Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not have any intrinsic binding capacity (15.Tu L. Chen A. Delahunty M.D. Moore K.L. Watson S.R. McEver R.P. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3995-4004PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble CX3C-ESCR bound to L1.2-CX3CR1 cells with the same characteristics as CX3C-SEAP and FKN-SEAP (K d = 130 pm) (Fig.4 B). Immobilized CX3C-ESCR functioned as well as FKN-SEAP in the capture and firm adhesion of resting PBMC and K562-CX3CR1 under physiologic flow conditions (Figs. 4 C). These data indicated that extension was the important feature of the mucin domain. While the above studies indicate that the mucin domain could be functionally replaced by a stalk of similar length (ESCR), they were performed with purified fusion proteins immobilized on glass coverslips. To determine whether ESCR could functionally replace the fractalkine mucin domain in the context of the cell surface, two chimeric molecules were constructed: a transmembrane fractalkine-green fluorescent protein (FKN-GFP) molecule; and a CX3C-ESCR-GFP fusion protein in which the mucin domain of FKN-GFP was replaced with the ESCR domain (CX3C-ESCR-GFP). Stable ECV-304 transfectants expressing similar surface levels of native fractalkine, FKN-GFP and CX3C-ESCR-GFP were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using monoclonal antibodies recognizing the CX3C (4F2) domain of fractalkine. As expected, mCX3C-ESCR-GFP was recognized by monoclonal antibody 4F2, but not 1D6, an antibody against the mucin domain of fractalkine (Fig.5). Expression of a GFP tag on the cytoplasmic tail of fractalkine did not affect its function in cell adhesion (Fig. 6). ECV304 cells expressing mCX3C-ESCR-GFP induced capture and firm adhesion of CX3CR1-expressing K562 cells as efficiently as ECV304-FKN cells (Fig.6).Figure 6Function of membrane-bound, chimeric fractalkine fusion proteins in firm adhesion.

From the results presented here, we conclude the following. 1) The FKN mucin domain enhances the ability of CX3C to function in cell adhesion. The CX3C chemokine domain of FKN is sufficient for the rapid capture and firm adhesion of circulating leukocytes, but the capture is more efficient with the mucin domain. 2) The mucin domain does not significantly alter the affinity of soluble CX3C binding to CX3CR1. 3) The mucin domain does not inherently function as a cell adhesion molecule or co-receptor. 4) The FKN mucin domain exists as an approximately 26 nm long stalk between the globular CX3C domain and the cell surface. 5) A primary function of the mucin domain in cell adhesion is to extend the CX3C chemokine domain away from the cell surface to present it to flowing leukocytes. Mucins, including many selectin ligands like PSGL-1, are highlyO-glycosylated and exist as long, thin stalk-like structures (20.Li F. Erickson H.P. James J.A. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6342-6348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For most selectin ligands, the O-linked carbohydrates are essential components for binding (21.McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 97-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Hemmerich S. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12035-12047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). FKN has 26 potentialO-linked glycosylation sites, and is heavily glycosylated (8.Bazan J.F. Bacon K.B. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D.R. Zlotnik A. Schall T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1703) Google Scholar, 9.Pan Y. Lloyd C. Zhou H. Dolich S. Deeds J.

Consistent with other mucins, the FKN mucin domain has a long stalk-like ultrastructure, but we could not detect any binding function of the mucin domain. In this respect, the FKN mucin domain shares similarity with the short consensus repeats of L-, E-, and P-selectin that function to extend the ligand-binding lectin + epidermal growth factor domains while having no intrinsic binding activity (15.Tu L. Chen A. Delahunty M.D. Moore K.L. Watson S.R. McEver R.P. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3995-4004PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol.

Cell adhesion is typically mediated by protein-protein interaction rather than by proteins interacting directly with the lipid bilayer, and the interaction typically takes place at an extended distance from the cell surface. For example, integrins have two long stalks that project the ligand-binding domain 20 nm from the membrane. Cadherins project 15 nm, keeping the opposing membranes 30 nm apart. The selectins range from 15 nm (L-) to 25 nm (E-) to 38 nm (P-selectin), and their ligands on the adhering cell are also elongated (1.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6400) Google Scholar, 19.Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickson H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol.

The 26-nm elongated stalk of fractalkine is thus consistent with this generalization that adhesion receptors project adhesion domains far from the membrane. What is unique about the fractalkine adhesion complex is that the receptor is a 7-transmembrane receptor that projects very little from the membrane. The largest possibility for projection is the N terminus, which could project 8.4 nm if the 24 amino acids were fully extended (0.35 nm per amino acid). It is unusual for molecules that are involved in leukocyte capture to be located so close to the cell surface. The roles of the FKN pathway of leukocyte migration in normal and diseased states are now being elucidated. We have shown that FKN can mediate the trafficking of monocytes, CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells (12.Fong A.M. Robinson L.A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), indicating a potential role in viral pathogenesis. Fractalkine is expressed highly in neurons of the brain and interacts with CX3CR1 expressed in the microglia (29.Harrison J.K. Jiang Y. Chen S. Xia Y. Maciejewski D. McNamara R.K. Streit W.J. Salafranca M.N. Adhikari S. Thompson D.A. Botti P. Bacon K.B. Feng L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10896-10901Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 30.Nishiyori A. Minami M.

Exogenously added fractalkine can cause the migration of primary rat microglial cells in vitro (31.Maciejewski-Lenoir D. Chen S. Feng L. Maki R. Bacon K.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1628-1635PubMed Google Scholar). A role for FKN and CX3CR1 during nerve regeneration has been postulated (29.Harrison J.K. Jiang Y. Chen S. Xia Y. Maciejewski D. McNamara R.K. Streit W.J. Salafranca M.N. Adhikari S. Thompson D.A. Botti P. Bacon K.B. Feng L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10896-10901Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Thus, molecules that inhibit FKN-CX3CR1 interactions may have therapeutic value in a variety of diseases. In summary, we have studied the role of the chemokine and mucin domains of fractalkine in FKN-mediated firm adhesion. The chemokine domain is absolutely necessary for interactions with CX3CR1, but is suboptimal for firm adhesion under physiological shear stresses. The mucin domain is a 26-nm long stalk that functions to extend the chemokine domain away from the cell surface for optimal interaction of CX3C with its receptor. The FKN mucin domain is functionally similar to the stalk regions of the selectin family of molecules that also function in leukocyte capture and firm adhesion under physiologic flow conditions. FKN and CX3CR1 may also share other functional similarities with the selectins and their ligands. We thank Drs. Tom Tedder and Mike Krangel for helpful discussions and critically reviewing this manuscript."

Recently, many examples of the involvement of Sox-POU partnerships in transcription have been discovered, including a partnership between Sox-2 and Oct-3. Little is known about the mechanisms by which these factors modulate transcription. To better understand the molecular interactions involved, we mapped the location of the transactivation domain of Sox-2. This was done in the context of its interaction with Oct-3, as well as its ability to transactivate as a fusion protein linked to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. Both approaches demonstrated that Sox-2 contains a transactivation domain in its C-terminal half, containing a serine-rich region and the C terminus. We also determined that the viral oncoprotein E1a inhibits the ability of the Gal4/Sox-2 fusion protein to transactivate, as well as the transcriptional activation mediated by the combined action of Sox-2 and Oct-3. In contrast, a mutant form of E1a, unable to bind p300, lacks both of these effects. Importantly, we determined that p300 overcomes the inhibitory effects of E1a in both assays. Together, these findings suggest that Sox-2 mediates its effects, at least in part, through the co-activator p300.

Members of the Sox family are further subdivided into subgroups based on the amount of homology outside of the HMG domain, as well as identity within the HMG domain. Unlike most transcription factors, Sox proteins bind DNA in the minor groove. Hence, Sox factors are able to bind DNA in close proximity to transcription factors that bind in the major groove. Indeed, interaction and/or cooperation between Sox factors and other transcription factors has been observed, including Sox-10 with Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP (2.Kuhlbrodt K. Herbath B. Sock E.

Sox-2 and Oct-3 are co-expressed with the FGF-4 gene in the preimplantation mouse embryo (1.Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 17.Rosner M.H.

Dev. 1991; 36: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) but are down-regulated upon differentiation of these cells (19.Yoshida T. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Sakamoto H. Katoh O. Sugimura T.

Furthermore, the HMG and POU sites are separated by only three base pairs, and inserting five base pairs between these sites results in a loss of enhancer function (4.Ambrosetti D.-C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). 3L. R. Johnson and A. Rizzino, unpublished observations. Synergism and physical interaction between Sox-2 and Oct-3 at their binding sites has been demonstrated (4.Ambrosetti D.-C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), indicating that the FGF-4 gene is likely to be regulated by the concerted action of Sox-2 and Oct-3. The UTF1 and OPN genes are also co-expressed withSox-2 and Oct-3 in F9 EC and embryonic stem cells, are down-regulated upon differentiation, and contain an HMG motif and a POU motif (7.Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5453-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 8.Botquin V. Hess H. Fuhrmann G. Anastassiadis C. Gross M.K. Vriend G. Scholer H.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2073-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the UTF1 gene, the HMG and POU motifs are located next to one another and approximately 1.8 kilobases downstream of the transcription start site, similar to theFGF-4 gene (7.Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5453-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In contrast, these motifs are separated by 48 base pairs and are located relatively close to the transcription start site in the OPN gene (8.Botquin V. Hess H. Fuhrmann G. Anastassiadis C. Gross M.K. Vriend G. Scholer H.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2073-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Both genes are regulated by Sox-2 and Oct-3. However, the UTF1 gene is regulated by the synergistic action of Sox-2 and Oct-3 (7.Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5453-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), whereas Sox-2 represses the Oct-3 activation of the OPN gene (8.Botquin V. Hess H. Fuhrmann G. Anastassiadis C. Gross M.K. Vriend G. Scholer H.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2073-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The repression of theOPN gene by Sox-2 requires the C-terminal region of Sox-2. Positive regulation of the FGF-4 and UTF1 genes and negative regulation of the OPN gene by the combination of Sox-2 and Oct-3 may be attributed to the arrangement of the HMG and POU motifs relative to each other, as well as to other transcription factor binding sites. These studies illustrate that the effects of Sox factors on transcription are dependent on the context of the gene, but little is known about the mechanisms that Sox factors use to modulate transcription. Recently, it has been reported that the transactivation domain of several Sox family members is located in the C-terminal half of the molecule (3.Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 22.van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H.

However, it is unclear whether more than one region of the molecule is needed for transactivation, nor is it clear whether the domains involved are dependent on transcription factors that act in concert with Sox proteins. Transactivation by many transcription factors requires the action of a co-activator. In the context of the HMG and POU sites of the FGF-4 gene, Sox-2 and Oct-3 activate transcription from a distance. Therefore, co-factors are likely to be involved in bridging these proteins to the transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, E1a has been shown to repress the Oct-3-mediated expression of the Rex-1 gene (25.Ben-Shushan E. Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1866-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), as well as the transcription of several other genes (reviewed in Ref. 26.Zantema A. van der Eb A.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199: 1-23PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, overexpression of the co-factor p300, a ubiquitous protein that can interact directly with E1a, was able to overcome E1a inhibition (27.Pfitzner E. Jahne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Sang N. Avantaggiati M.L. Giordano A. J. Cell.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1529-1535PubMed Google Scholar), indicating a possible role for p300 as a co-activator. To advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which Sox-2 acts, several questions are addressed in this study. First, which domains of Sox-2 are necessary for transactivation? Second, does Sox-2 on its own or in combination with Oct-3 mediate its effects through a co-activator? Here, we show that the C-terminal half of Sox-2, including its serine-rich domain and extreme C-terminal end, is necessary for transactivation. We also demonstrate that E1a inhibits the ability of a Gal4/Sox-2 fusion protein to transactivate, as well as the transcriptional activation mediated by Sox-2 and Oct-3. Importantly, we demonstrate that the co-activator p300 can recover this inhibition by E1a. These findings are the first to implicate p300 in the action of the Sox family of transcription factors. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). HeLa cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish unless otherwise noted for 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described previously (11.Ma Y.-G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32.Scholtz B. Lamb K. Rosfjord E. Kingsley M. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), incubated with the precipitate for 14–16 h and refed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested the following day. Cell extracts were prepared, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase activities were determined, as reported previously (16.Johnson L.R. Lamb K.A. Gao Q. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by addition of null vectors. To adjust for transfection efficiency, all transfections were normalized with either pCH110 (SV40β-gal) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pCMVβ-gal (CLONTECH) as indicated in the figure legends. All transfections were performed in duplicate or triplicate with representative transfections shown. Plasmid DNA was purified by Qiagen tip-500 columns. The promoter-reporter construct pCatSO3 was constructed as follows: complimentary oligonucleotides (synthesized by the Eppley Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facility) containing two sets of the Sox-2 and Oct-3 binding sites (in boldface) from the FGF-4 enhancer region and BglII sites at both ends (5′-GATCTCTTTGTTTGGATGCTAATGGCTCTTTGTTTGGATGCTAATGGA-3′) were annealed and ligated to generate multimers. These multimers were then ligated into a BglII site upstream of the SV40 promoter of the pCat vector (Promega) to generate pCatSO3, which contains a total of six tandem copies of the HMG and POU sites. pCMVSox-2 3′ deletion constructs were generated by digesting pCMVSox-2 (16.Johnson L.R. Lamb K.A. Gao Q. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) at the NotI site 5′ of the Sox-2 insert andAccI, StyI, or AatII sites within the 3′ end of the Sox-2 sequence. The Sox-2 fragmentsNotI-AccI, NotI-StyI, andNotI-AatII were isolated and ligated into pCMVΔSox-2N/X vector (pCMVSox-2 digested at the NotI andXhoI sites flanking the Sox-2 sequence and isolated), to generate pCMVSox-21–293, pCMVSox-21–242, and pCMVSox-21–202, respectively. pCMVSox-21–180(pCMVNP2) has been described previously (16.Johnson L.R. Lamb K.A. Gao Q. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sox-2 was isolated from pCMVSox-2 by digesting with NotI andXhoI and then cloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene) to generate pCRSox-2. This construct was then used to generate additional Sox-2 deletions. pCRSox-2Δ177–293 was generated by performing PCR with pCRSox-2 and the 3′ primer 177L (5′-CTGCTCCTGCATCATGCTGTAGCTG-3′) and the 5′ primer 293U (5′-CGACTGCACATGGCCCAGCTC-3′). This amplified the entire plasmid excluding the region of Sox-2 of base pairs 537–879 (amino acids 177–293). The PCR product was then digested with DpnI, which will digest methylated DNA destroying the parental plasmid, ligated, and transformed into bacteria. Similarly, pCRSox-2 and either the primer pair of 3′ primer 45L (5′-CCTCTTGACGCGTTCCGGGCT-3′) and 5′ primer 116U (5′-ATCCGGAAAACCAAGACGCTCATGAAG-3′) or the primer pair of 3′ primer 207L (5′-CTGCAGGGCGCTGACGTCGTA-3′) and 5′ primer 254U (5′-GATCCCGTGGTTACCTCTTCCTCCCA-3′) were used in PCRs to generate pCRSox-2Δ45–116 and pCRSox-2Δ207–254, respectively. pCRSox-2Δ45–116 excludes the region of Sox-2 of base pairs 135–348 (amino acids 45–116) and pCRSox-2Δ207–254 excludes the region of Sox-2 of base pairs 621–762 (amino acids 207–254). In the case of the Δ45–116 and Δ207–254 constructs, an additional three base pairs were added to the 5′ end of the 5′ primers, which, after PCR and ligation, generated a BamHI site that was used for screening. After confirmation by sequencing, the Sox-2 deletions were isolated followingNotI-XhoI digestion and ligated into pCMVΔSox-2N/X. The 5′ end of Sox-2 was tagged with the Flag epitope as follows. A 5′ primer (5′-CGCGCGGGTACCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACATGTATAACATGATGGAGACG-3′) containing a KpnI site, a Kozac sequence, the Flag sequence, and 24 base pairs of the 5′ Sox-2 sequence and the 3′ primer 45L (described above) were used in a PCR with pCMVSox-2 as template. The resulting product was digested with KpnI andHindIII and ligated into pCMVΔSox-2K/H vector (pCMVSox-2 digested with KpnI and HindIII and isolated), generating pCMVFlagSox-2. The same method was used to insert the Flag sequence into the pCMVSox-2 deletion constructs. Sequencing confirmed that all constructs contained the Flag sequence in-frame with Sox-2. A GFPSox-2 expression vector was constructed by ligating aSacI-KpnI Sox-2 fragment from pCRSox-2 into theSacI-KpnI sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), fusing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in-frame to the N terminus of Sox-2. Positive clones were verified by sequencing. Other plasmids utilized included pCMVOct-3 (11.Ma Y.-G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); Gal4/Sox-11 C3, obtained from Michael Wegner (3.Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol.

Moran E. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); and pCMVp300 and pCMVp300del30, a mutant p300 unable to bind E1a, obtained from David Livingston (34.Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Gal4/Sox-2 fusions were constructed by ligating PCR-generated Sox-2 fragments into the EcoRI andHindIII sites of the SV40Gal4 fusion vector, pM3, obtained from Ivan Sadowski (35.Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene. 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The following primers were used in PCRs to generate the Sox-2 fragments indicated: Sox-2121–319, 121U (5′-CCGTCAATGAATTCTCATGAAGAAGGATAAGTACACG-3′) and 319L (5′-TATTTGAAGCTTCTCACATGTGCGACAGGGG-3′); Sox-2206–319, 206U (5′-GTCAATGAATTCTGCAGTACAACTCCATGACCAGC-3′) and 319L; Sox-2206–291, 206U and 291L (5′-TATTTGAAGCTTGGGCGCAGCGGGCT-3′); Sox-2206–260, 206U and 260L (5′-TATTTGAAGCTTGGAGGAAGAGGTAACCACGGG-3′); Sox-2291–319, 291L (5′-GTCAATGAATTCCCAGTAGACTGCACATGGCC-3′) and 319L. All resulting constructs were sequenced and determined to be in frame with Gal4 and named as indicated in Fig. 3 A. These constructs were co-transfected with pG5EC obtained from Ivan Sadowski (35.Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene. 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). pG5EC contains five Gal4 DNA-binding sites upstream of the TATA box from the adenovirus E1b gene driving the CAT reporter gene.BglII-HindIII fragments from pM3 and Gal4/Sox-2206–319 were ligated into the BglII and HindIII sites of pCMV5 (36.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the plasmids CMVGal4 and CMVGal4/Sox-2206–319, respectively. HeLa cells were transfected as described above. In each case, CMVβ-gal was co-transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figure legends and used to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. Whole cell extracts were prepared after transfection as follows. Cells were washed twice with 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested into 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4–8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, various protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase activity, normalized, and diluted in 4× sample buffer (250 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% w/v SDS, 40% glycerol, 200 mmdithiothreitol, 0.4% (w/v) bromphenol blue), heated to 95–100 °C for 5 min, and loaded onto a Tris-glycine gel. Gels were subjected to electrophoresis in running buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.2m glycine, and 0.1% SDS). Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, 20% methanol) and membranes were blocked in a 3% bovine serum albumin solution. For detection of the Gal4 fusion proteins, membranes were incubated with an anti-Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer + 0.1% Tween-20, washed in TBS/T (Tris buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) diluted 1:10000 in TBS/T. For detection of the Flag fusion proteins, membranes were incubated with an anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:2000 in TBS/T, washed in TBS/T, and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) diluted 1:2000 in TBS/T. Proteins were detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence (ECF) kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and scanned on a Storm phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitation was performed using the ImageQuant analysis software (Molecular Dynamics). All Western blots were performed in duplicate or triplicate, with representative Western blots shown. The HMG and POU sites located in the enhancer of theFGF-4 gene are crucial for transcription (9.Curatola A.M. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11.Ma Y.-G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev.

Furthermore, overexpression studies have shown that Oct-3 on its own can stimulate transcription of promoter-reporter constructs containing the HMG and POU sites of the FGF-4 enhancer (11.Ma Y.-G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P. Tiesman J. Kelly D. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that the addition of Sox-2 results in a synergistic stimulation of transcription (15.Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Although the transactivation domains of Oct-3 have been mapped (37.Scholer H.R. Ciesiolka T. Gruss P.

Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Sox-2 and Oct-3 have been shown to physically interact (4.Ambrosetti D.-C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), it is unclear how these factors cooperate to stimulate transcription. Therefore, to advance our understanding of this partnership, we set out to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which Sox-2 acts by mapping the transactivation domain of Sox-2. Previous studies demonstrated that the N-terminal region of Sox-2 (Sox-21–180) contains the DNA-binding domain (15.Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 16.Johnson L.R. Lamb K.A. Gao Q. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod.

To map the domains of Sox-2 transactivating activity, a series of fusion proteins containing the DBD of Gal4 and various regions of Sox-2 was constructed. Gal4 fusion proteins have been used widely to identify transactivation domains of transcription factors. In these studies, various Sox-2 C-terminal regions were cloned into pM3, a Gal4 DBD expression vector (Fig. 1 A). These Gal4/Sox-2 fusion constructs were co-transfected into HeLa cells with the promoter-reporter CAT construct pG5EC, containing five copies of the Gal4 binding site. The region from just C-terminal of the HMG domain to the C-terminal end (amino acids 121–319) exhibited maximum transactivation at the concentration indicated (Fig. 1 B). However, the region from the serine-rich domain to the C-terminal end, amino acids 206–319, also contains considerable transactivation potential (Fig. 1 B). Constructs containing only the serine-rich domain (Gal4/Sox-2206–291 and Gal4/Sox-2206–260) or the last 28 amino acids of the C terminus (Gal4/Sox-2291–319) failed to transactivate, whereas constructs containing both of these domains (Gal4/Sox-2121–319 and Gal4/Sox-2206–319) were able to transactivate. This suggests that both the serine-rich domain (amino acids 206–260) and the C-terminal end (amino acids 260–319) are necessary for transactivation. A Gal4/Sox-11 construct (Gal4/Sox-11 C3) (3.Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J."
https://openalex.org/W2069185570,"Abstract We have studied the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in MTLn3 rat adenocarcinoma cells. Stimulation of MTLn3 cells withepidermal growth factor (EGF) induced a rapid increase in actin polymerization, with production of lamellipodia within 3 min. EGF-stimulated lamellipodia were blocked by 100 nm wortmannin, suggesting the involvement of a class Ia PI 3-kinase. MTLn3 cells contain equal amounts of p110α and p110β, and do not contain p110δ. Injection of specific inhibitory antibodies to p110α induced cell rounding and blocked EGF-stimulated lamellipod extension, whereas control or anti-p110β antibodies had no effect. In contrast, both antibodies inhibited EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis. An in situ assay for actin nucleation showed that EGF-stimulated formation of new barbed ends was blocked by injection of anti-p110α antibodies. In summary, the p110α isoform of PI 3-kinase is specifically required for EGF-stimulated actin nucleation during lamellipod extension in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029086458,"The global production of the greenhouse gas methane by methanogenic archaea reaches 1 billion tons per annum. The final reaction releasing methane is catalyzed by the enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase. The crystal structure of methyl-coenzyme M reductase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicumrevealed the presence of five modified amino acids within the α-subunit and near the active site region. Four of these modifications were C-, N-, and S-methylations, two of which, 2-(S)-methylglutamine and 5-(S)-methylarginine, have never been encountered before. We have now confirmed these modifications by mass spectrometry of chymotryptic peptides. With methyl-coenzyme M reductase purified from cells grown in the presence of l-[methyl-D3]methionine, it was shown that the methyl groups of the modified amino acids are derived from the methyl group of methionine rather than from methyl-coenzyme M, an intermediate in methane formation. The D3 labeling pattern was found to be qualitatively and quantitatively the same as in the two methyl groups of the methanogenic coenzyme F430, which are known to be introduced viaS-adenosylmethionine. From the results, it is concluded that the methyl groups of the modified amino acids in methyl-coenzyme M reductase are biosynthetically introduced by anS-adenosylmethionine-dependent post-translational modification. A mechanism for the methylation of glutamine at C-2 and of arginine at C-5 is discussed. The global production of the greenhouse gas methane by methanogenic archaea reaches 1 billion tons per annum. The final reaction releasing methane is catalyzed by the enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase. The crystal structure of methyl-coenzyme M reductase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicumrevealed the presence of five modified amino acids within the α-subunit and near the active site region. Four of these modifications were C-, N-, and S-methylations, two of which, 2-(S)-methylglutamine and 5-(S)-methylarginine, have never been encountered before. We have now confirmed these modifications by mass spectrometry of chymotryptic peptides.

Methyl-coenzyme M reductase catalyzes the final reaction step in the formation of methane by methanogenic archaea. It is a 300-kDa protein composed of three different subunits in an α2β2γ2 arrangement and contains per mol 2 mol of the nickel porphinoid coenzyme F430 as prosthetic group (1.Wolfe R.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Thauer R.K. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the enzyme from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has recently been solved at 1.45-Å resolution (3.Ermler U. Grabarse W. Shima S. Goubeaud M. Thauer R.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The electron density map suggested the presence of five modified amino acids in the α subunits either at or very near the active site region: 1-N-methylhistidine α257 (3-methylhistidine according to IUPAC nomenclature), 5-(S)-methylarginine α271, 2-(S)-methylglutamine α400, S-methylcysteine α452, and thioglycine α445, forming a thiopeptide bond (Fig.1). Thioglycine has been proposed to function as a one-electron relay in the catalytic mechanism (2.Thauer R.K. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation of histidine α257, which is involved in substrate binding, probably influences the substrate affinity of the enzyme (3.Ermler U. Grabarse W. Shima S. Goubeaud M. Thauer R.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). For the methylation of the three other amino acids, an accidental methylation via methyl-coenzyme M-derived methyl radicals has been envisaged. We have now ruled out this possibility by showing that the methyl group of all four methylated amino acids is derived from the methyl group of methionine, most likely viaS-adenosylmethionine (SAM).1 Our experiments are based on the previous finding that methionine is taken up from the medium by growing M. thermoautotrophicum and that the methionine taken up is used for protein synthesis and in SAM-dependent methylation reactions rather than in methyl-coenzyme M-dependent methane synthesis (4.Jaenchen R. Diekert G. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 130: 133-136Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The results reported here were obtained from labeling experiments withl-[methyl-D3]methionine. It has been shown recently that stable heavy isotope labels can be followed by mass spectrometry down to the level of purified peptides and that it is possible to evaluate the spectra thus obtained quantitatively (5.Selmer T. Buckel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20772-20778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo determine the origin of the methyl groups in the four methylated amino acids in methyl-coenzyme M reductase, M. thermoautotrophicum was grown on H2 and12CO2 in standard medium and in standard medium supplemented with 2.5 mml-[methyl-D3]methionine. From the cells thus obtained, methyl-coenzyme M reductase was isolated and separated into its three subunits and its prosthetic group coenzyme F430 by HPLC (Fig. 2). Subsequently, the α-subunit, which harbors the five modified amino acids, was subjected to proteolysis with chymotrypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC (data not shown) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Coenzyme F430 (Fig. 3), which is known to contain two methyl groups derived fromS-adenosylmethionine (4.Jaenchen R. Diekert G. Thauer R.K.

After growth of M. thermoautotrophicum in the presence of 2.5 mml-[methyl-D3]methionine, four differently labeled F430 are found: both methyl groups not labeled (CH3/CH3 = a/a); only the left methyl group labeled (CD3/CH3 =b/a); only the right methyl group labeled (CH3/CD3 = a/b); and both methyl groups labeled (CD3/CD3 =b/b).

The radioactivity per ml of culture (cells plus medium) was found to remain constant. During growth of a 1-liter culture to anA 578 of 4 (1.6 g dry mass of cells/liter), approximately 1 mol of methane was formed (Y CH4= 1.6 g/mol) (7.Schönheit P. Moll J. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 127: 59-65Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and 0.25 mmol ofl-[methyl-14C]methionine was incorporated into cellular matter (4.Jaenchen R. Diekert G. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 130: 133-136Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the methyl group ofl-[methyl-14C]methionine was not converted to methane under the experimental conditions.Coenzyme F430 AnalysisThe mass spectrum obtained for coenzyme F430 showed clearly resolved single isotopic signals, which were due to the natural abundance of heavy isotopes (Fig. 4 A). The monoisotopic mass of 906.3 Da was in excellent agreement with the theoretical value of 906.6 calculated for the sum formula C42H52N6NiO13 for [M + H]+. The integrated spectra have been aligned to a simulated spectrum for coenzyme F430 with an experimental error of less than 4% (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the isotopic distribution for the factor F430 purified from methyl-coenzyme M reductase from cells grown on [methyl-D3]methionine-containing medium was clearly shifted (Fig. 4 B). The monoisotopic peak (m/z = 906.2 Da) was small, and distinct distributions for methyl-D3-labeled species were seen, yielding a composite spectrum characterized by mass increments of 3 Da. Using a least square fit procedure to simulate the spectrum, amethyl-D3 content of 83 ± 3% was determined with relative abundances for the CH3,CH3, CH3,CD3, and CD3,CD3 species of 4, 43, and 100%, respectively. These results confirm previous findings that at a methionine concentration of 2.5 mm in the growth medium approximately 80% of the methionine in growing M. thermoautotrophicum is supplied by methionine uptake and only approximately 20% by biosynthesis from CO2 (4.Jaenchen R. Diekert G. Thauer R.K. FEBS Lett. 1981; 130: 133-136Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Figure 4Mass spectra of coenzyme F430.

They were identified by their monoisotopic mass, which was identical (deviation <500 ppm) to that calculated for the chymotryptic peptides containing the modified amino acids. The peptides were also identified by their N-terminal amino acid sequence determined via Edman degradation or a ladder sequencing approach. With the exception of thioglycine α445 and S-methylcysteine α452, which were present in a single peptide, the modified amino acids were recognized by the unusual retention behavior of their phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives (peptides A, B, and D, Table I). In methyl-coenzyme M reductase derived from cells grown in the presence ofl-[methyl-D3]methionine, the four chymotryptic peptides containing the methylated amino acids were labeled with methyl-D3 groups as evidenced by the shift in mass of 3 Da (peptides B, C, and D) and 6 Da (peptide A, Table I).

Single distributions starting at 1442.1, 1445.1, and 1448.1 Da, respectively, indicated the presence of two methyl groups derived from [methyl-D3]methionine within the peptide. These findings are consistent with the presence of onemethyl-D 3 group in methionine α263 and one in 1-N-methylhistidine α257. The location of the methyl groups was confirmed by MALDI postsource decay analysis. By these measurements, almost complete a and b series for residues 4–10 of the tridecameric peptide were obtained, which demonstrated the location of the labeled methyl groups in the predicted positions (not shown). The isotopic distribution with relative intensities of 4, 41, and 100% of the particular distributions were used to simulate a spectrum containing 83 ± 3%methyl-D3 groups.The molecular mass of the heptadecameric peptide harboring 5-(S)-methylarginine α271 was shifted by 3 Da to 1868.4 Da (Fig. 5 B). The relative intensities of 20 and 100% for the single distributions of the nonlabeled and labeled species, respectively, were indicative of the presence of onemethyl-D3 group, as predicted from the amino acid sequence (Table I). The methyl-D3 content of the peptide was 84 ± 3%.The nonadecameric peptide carrying 2-(S)-methylglutamine α400 was observed initially only in very poor yields. When the chymotryptic peptides were reduced by dithiothreitol and then S-carboxymethylated by iodoacetic acid prior to HPLC, the yield for this peptide increased significantly. The carboxymethylation of cysteine α411 increased the molecular mass observed for the peptide by 58 Da. If this additional modification is considered, the mass observed for the peptide derived from deuterated enzyme (1770.8 Da) is in agreement with a single methyl-D3 group in the peptide (Fig. 5 C). The relative intensities of 21 and 100, for the nonlabeled and the labeled species, respectively, were used to calculate a methyl-D3 content of 83 ± 3%.For the pentadecameric peptide harboring thioglycine α445 andS-methylcysteine α452, a molecular mass of 1712.3 Da was found (Fig. 5 D). The relative intensities of 18% for the nonlabeled and 100% for the labeled fraction of the peptide suggested the presence of one methyl group within the peptide. Themethyl-D3 content of the peptide was calculated to be 86 ± 3%. The presence of both modified amino acids in the peptide was confirmed by the molecular mass, which is in agreement with the calculated value. However, neither thioglycine norS-methylcysteine was detected with Edman degradation chemistry (Table I). Whereas the N-terminal tyrosine residue was detected in good yield, detection of the subsequent amino acids failed. This result was explained by the presence of thioglycine in position 2 of the sequence, which is predicted to interfere with Edman degradation.In addition to the four peptides carrying methylated amino acids, some other peptides containing methionine were identified by their molecular masses and analyzed for their methyl-D3 content. In these peptides, the methyl-D3 content also ranged from 80 to 85% (data not shown).DISCUSSIONThe four methylated amino acids in the α-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase were found to become trideutero-labeled when M. thermoautotrophicum was grown in the presence ofl-[methyl-D3]methionine. Themethyl-D3 content was the same as in coenzyme F430 and in the peptides containing methionine, indicating that the methyl groups in the four modified amino acids were derived exclusively from the methyl group of methionine. Evidence was presented that the methyl group of methionine was not converted to methane. The results exclude methyl-coenzyme M as methyl donor.In coenzyme F430 (Fig. 3), the two methyl groups are known to be introduced from methionine via SAM, which is therefore also very likely the methyl donor in the biosynthesis of the methylated amino acids. This proposal agrees with the finding that in the crystal structure of methyl-coenzyme M reductase the 2-methylglutamine and 5-methylarginine are present only in the S-isomeric form. Therefore, introduction of the methyl groups was stereospecific. The finding that 2-methylglutamine is the S-isomer indicates that methylation of glutamine α400 proceeded via retention of stereoconfiguration at C-2. This is to be expected for an electrophilic substitution of a proton at C-2 by a methyl group from SAM (10.Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Spies A. Schowen R.L. Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis: A Mechanistic Reference. I. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 1-30Google Scholar).The mcrA gene is predicted to code for an α-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase that does not contain modified amino acids (2.Thauer R.K. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore has to be proposed that the modifications are introduced after translation or during translation. The modifications must, however, be made before quaternary structure formation, since in the native enzyme the modified amino acids are buried deep inside, where they are not accessible to SAM (3.Ermler U. Grabarse W. Shima S. Goubeaud M. Thauer R.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar).Post-translational and co-translational modifications by SAM-dependent methylation are not without precedent. They are catalyzed by protein methylases (11.Paik W.K. Kim S. Protein Methylation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar, 12.Kim S. Park G.H. Paik W.K. Amino Acids. 1998; 15: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13.Kim S. Park G.H. Joo W.A. Paik W.K. Cook R.J. Williams K.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) that specifically recognize the amino acid sequences up- and downstream of the amino acid to be methylated. Since the sequences up- and downstream of the four methylated amino acids in the α-subunit of methyl-coenzyme M reductase are very different (2.Thauer R.K. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2377-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has to be concluded that in the post-translational modification four different SAM-dependent protein methylases are involved. This agrees well with the finding that the genome of M. thermoautotrophicum harbors many open reading frames predicted to encode protein methylases (15.Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. Harrison D. Hoang L. Keagle P. Lumm W. Pothier B. Qiu D. Spadafora R. Vicaire R. Wang Y. Wierzbowski J. Gibson R. Jiwani N.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar).SAM-dependent methyl transferases have been under investigation for many years (for a review, see Ref. 10.Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Spies A. Schowen R.L. Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis: A Mechanistic Reference. I. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 1-30Google Scholar). All of them appear to have in common that they possess a catalytic domain with a SAM binding site and a second domain with the binding site for the individual methylation target (16.Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 17.Schluckebier G. Kozak M. Bleimling N. Weinhold E. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The substitution of a hydrogen from a thiol group or from a ring nitrogen of histidine by a methyl group from SAM is chemically not difficult to envisage (10.Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Spies A. Schowen R.L. Sinnott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis: A Mechanistic Reference. I. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 1-30Google Scholar). The mechanism for the substitution of a hydrogen at C-5 of arginine or of a hydrogen at C-2 of glutamine is less readily apparent. In DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase, it has been shown that a critical cysteine residue is required to increase the nucleophilicity of carbon-5: the addition of the thiol group to carbon-4 increases the nucleophilicity of C-5 in DNA-bound cytosine, allowing a nucleophilic attack onto the methyl carbon of SAM (18.Wu J.C. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This kind of activation is not possible for methylation of the C-2 of glutamine or of the C-5 of arginine. However, the neighborhood of a nitrogen may allow an ammonium ylid chemistry; although ammonium ylids are difficult to prepare and less stable than phosphonium or sulfonium ylids, their existence has been demonstrated, and some of the chemical properties of these compounds were studied (for a review, see Refs. 19.Musker W.K. Top. Curr. Chem. 1970; 14: 295-362Google Scholarand 20.Johnson A.W. Ylid Chemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1966: 251-283Google Scholar). As do other ylids, the predicted ammonium ylid intermediates of glutamine and arginine are strong nucleophiles that can easily react with electrophilic centers (e.g. in Wittig reaction with carbonyls). As outlined in Fig.6 A, the abstraction of a hydrogen from the α-carbon of glutamine might be facilitated by protonation of the N-terminal peptide bond carbonyl oxygen. Mesomeric effects might contribute significantly to a transition state stabilization of the ylid intermediate of glutamine. A similar mesomeric stabilization might be achieved for the deprotonation of C-5 in arginine by the neighbored guanidyl group (Fig. 6 B). Here, the imino function of the guanidyl group may act in a similar fashion as the carbonyl oxygen in the peptide bond of glutamine.Figure 6Mechanism proposed for C-methylation of glutamine α400 (A) and arginine α271 (B). Acids (AH) or bases (A −) in the neighborhood of the amino acid to be modified could aid the deprotonation of the C-2 atom of glutamine α400 or of the C-5 atom of arginine α271. Mesomeric structures of the N-terminal peptide bond of glutamine or of the guanidino group of arginine are predicted to localize a positive charge at the nitrogen next to the carbon atom from which a proton has to be abstracted. The formed carbanion may be stabilized by mesomeric structures. The strong nucleophilic carbanion should easily react with SAM, forming the methylated amino acid andS-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). It should be noted that the possibility of enolate formation between the peptide carbonyl and C-α of glutamine α400 also significantly contributes to transition state stabilization, although the formation of this enolate is more difficult. hCys, homocysteine; ado, adenosyl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Whereas 5-(S)-methylarginine has, until now, only been observed in methyl-coenzyme M reductase, N-methylated arginines are known to occur in many proteins (11.Paik W.K.

This indicates that the protein methylase catalyzing the C-methylation and the methyltransferases catalyzing the N-methylation of arginine must have different recognition sites.Nothing is known about the origin of the sulfur in the thiopeptide bond in residue thioglycine α445.

Although it is widely accepted that Mg2+ efflux is Na+-dependent, little is known about transporter identity and the overall regulation. Even less is known about the mechanism of cellular Mg2+uptake. Using sealed and right-sided rat liver plasma membrane vesicles representing either the basolateral (bLPM) or apical (aLPM) domain, it was possible to dissect three different Mg2+ transport mechanisms based upon specific inhibition, localization within the plasma membrane, and directionality. The bLPM possesses only one Mg2+ transporter, which is strictly Na+-dependent, bi-directional, and not inhibited by amiloride. The aLPM possesses two separate Mg2+ transporters. One, similar to that in the bLPM because it strictly depends on Na+ transport, and it can be differentiated from that of the bLPM because it is unidirectional and fully inhibited by amiloride. The second is a novel Ca2+/Mg2+ exchanger that is unidirectional and inhibited by amiloride and imipramine. Hence, the bLPM transporter may be responsible for the exchange of Mg2+ between hepatocytes and plasma, and vice versa, shown in livers upon specific metabolic stimulation, whereas the aLPM transporters can only extrude Mg2+ into the biliary tract. The dissection of these three distinct pathways and, therefore, the opportunity to study each individually will greatly facilitate further characterization of these transporters and a better understanding of Mg2+homeostasis.

In principle, these discrepancies could be accounted for by the co-existence of separate plasma membrane Mg2+ transporters each operating with different mechanisms and sensitivity to inhibitors. Hence, this work was designed to dissect putatively different Mg2+ transporters using an appropriate cellular model, the plasma membrane of rat hepatocytes.In view of its size and secretory capacity, the liver should play a major role in Mg2+ homeostasis. Recent evidence in the literature demonstrates that the perfused liver or isolated hepatocytes can accumulate or release very large amounts of Mg2+ upon specific metabolic stimulation (7.Romani A. Dowell E.A. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24376-24384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Romani A. Marfella C. Scarpa A. J. Biol.

Recently, this laboratory was able to successfully obtain sealed liver plasma membranes (LPM)1 to study Mg2+ transport across the hepatocyte cell membrane (21.Cefaratti C. Romani A. Scarpa A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C995-C1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model provides well defined and controllable experimental conditions in which membrane transport can be quantitatively investigated in the absence of interfering intracellular signaling pathways or transport by organelles. Using sealed plasma membranes, we recently found that either extravesicular Na+ or Ca2+ could mobilize intravesicular Mg2+(21.Cefaratti C. Romani A. Scarpa A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C995-C1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A major difference in liver plasma membrane vesicles is that they release intravesicular Mg2+ in the presence of extravesicular Na+ or Ca2+ alone, without the need of metabolic stimulation (21.Cefaratti C. Romani A. Scarpa A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C995-C1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) necessary in intact hepatocytes (7.Romani A. Dowell E.A. Scarpa A. J. Biol.

Under these conditions, cellular Mg2+ transport appears “uncoupled” and maximally operating in the absence of stimulatory cellular signals. One intriguing possibility is the presence in hepatocytes of a physiological “break” on Mg2+transport, which could be transiently removed as the result of activation of cellular pathways. Such a break (i.e. protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation) appears to be absent in LPM probably because they are devoid of ATP and signaling pathways.Those studies also provided direct evidence that extracellular Na+ and Ca2+ elicited a larger Mg2+efflux than either cation alone and suggested the presence of distinct Na+/Mg2+ and Ca2+/Mg2+transporters (21.Cefaratti C. Romani A. Scarpa A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C995-C1008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, both putative transporters seemed to be inhibited by the same inhibitor. Additionally, it was not clear whether the two transport mechanisms were localized within the same vesicle or in two distinct populations of vesicles.The hepatocyte is a highly polarized cell with differential localization of enzymes or transporters in the two main membrane domains, the basolateral and apical plasma membrane. The present study has now taken advantage of the possibility of obtaining separate populations of sealed and properly oriented plasma membranes comprised mostly of either apical (aLPM) or basolateral (bLPM) domains.The data presented here demonstrate that the Na+- dependent and Ca2+-dependent Mg2+transporters are distinct in terms of localization within the plasma membrane, inhibition, and overall operation. The data indicate that two distinguishable Na+-dependent Mg2+exchange mechanisms are localized to both the basolateral and apical domain, whereas a Ca2+/Mg2+ exchanger operates only in the apical domain. Such a finding should be of primary importance to kinetically characterize individual Mg2+transporters and to better identify them.

A key question is the nature of the target of Rlk responsible for bridging the TcR with the activation of IL-2 transcription. In this study, we identify a pathway in which Rlk phosphorylates SLP-76 leading to the phosphorylation of PLCγ1, activation of ERKs, and the synergistic up-regulation of TcR-driven IL-2 NFAT/AP-1 transcription. Rlk phosphorylated the N-terminal region of SLP-76, a region that has been previously shown to serve as a target for ZAP-70.

Tec kinases typified by Btk are comprised of an N-terminal phosphatidylinositol phosphate binding pleckstrin homology domain, followed by an SH2 and SH3 domain and a catalytic domain. Btk mutations have been documented to cause severe immunodeficiencies (12.Vetrie D. Vorechovsky I. Sideras P. Holland J. Davies A. Flinter F. Hammarström L. Kinnon C. Levinsky R. Bobrow M.

Tec kinases are positioned downstream of Src kinases that regulate their activity by phosphorylating within the activation loop of the kinase domain (17.Heyeck S.D. Wilcox H.M. Bunnell S.C. Berg L.J.

T-cells express three members of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases that include Rlk (resting lymphocytekinase), ITK (interleukin-2-responsiveT-cell specific kinase) (otherwise known as Tsk (T-cell-specific kinase) or EMT), and Tec (20.Desiderio S. Siliciano J.D. Chem. Immunol. 1994; 59: 191Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21.Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J.

Rlk resembles other Tec kinases except for the absence of a pleckstrin homology domain, which has been replaced with palmitoylated cysteine ring motif that is required for membrane localization (23.Debnath J. Chamorro M. Czar M.J. Schaeffer E.M. Lenardo M.J. Varmus H.E. Schwartzberg P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two forms of Rlk exist that include a full-length form and an alternately spliced version that lacks the cysteine ring motif (23.Debnath J. Chamorro M. Czar M.J. Schaeffer E.M. Lenardo M.J. Varmus H.E. Schwartzberg P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ITK and Rlk appear to complement each other in the regulation of T-cell function. Although ITK−/− mice show mild to moderate impairments of responses to TcR ligation (24.Bachman M.F. Littman D.R. Liao X.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7253-7257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Rlk−/− phenotype is less pronounced with a slight decrease in numbers of mature T-cells, in particular of the CD4+ subset (25.Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao C. Littman D. Sher A. Varmus H. Lenardo M. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). By contrast, the combined loss of Rlk and ITK shows major defects in TcR signaling events such as Ca2+ mobilization and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and IL-21production (25.Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao C. Littman D. Sher A. Varmus H. Lenardo M. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar).Aside from kinases, recent studies have identified an array of immune cell-specific adaptor proteins in T-cells that act as substrates for upstream kinases and play important roles in T-cell function (26.Rudd C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 27.Peterson E.J. Clements J.L. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). One of these adaptors, SLP-76, is a relatively hydrophilic protein with an acidic N-terminal region, several tyrosine consensus motifs, a central proline-rich region, and a C-terminal SH2 domain (28.Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). As with Rlk-deficient T-cells, SLP-76−/− T-cells show defects in Ca2+ mobilization and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and IL-2 production (29.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 218: 413-416Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To date, the ZAP-70 and SYK kinases have been shown to couple receptors to SLP-76 by virtue of their ability to phosphorylate SLP-76 (30.Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E.

Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ZAP-70 phosphorylates residues within an acidic region of SLP-76 that includes several tyrosine motifs: YESP, YESP, and YEPP (31.Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These N-terminal residues are required for the ability of SLP-76 to potentiate IL-2 production (32.Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar).Despite its importance to T-cell proliferation, the signaling pathway that connects Rlk to the TcR complex and the subsequent up-regulation of ERK activity and IL-2 transcription is unclear. In particular, it has been uncertain whether the Rlk kinase targets any of the newly identified lymphoid adaptors in T-cells. In this study, we report that Rlk phosphorylates SLP-76 at its N-terminal YESP/YEPP sites, a region that previously was found to act as a site for ZAP-70, and further that Rlk and SLP-76 potently and cooperatively up-regulate TcR-driven IL-2 transcription in T-cells. Loss of the N-terminal YESP/YEPP sites of SLP-76 or the Rlk kinase activity attenuated the cooperative effect. These observations support a model where the TcR can utilize the two kinases Rlk and ZAP-70 in the phosphorylation of SLP-76 leading to the up-regulation of IL-2 production in T-cells.RESULTST-cell activation is accompanied by an increase in phosphorylation of the lymphoid adaptor protein SLP-76 (28.Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that SLP-76−/− and Rlk−/− × ITK−/− T-cells show similar defects in Ca2+ mobilization and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and IL-2 production (29.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 218: 413-416Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To assess the role of Rlk in TcRζ/CD3 signaling and in particular whether the kinase might target SLP-76, Rlk was transfected into Jurkat T-cells and assessed for an effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76. As shown in Fig.1 A (top left panel), anti-CD3 stimulation induced an increase in SLP-76 phosphorylation (lane 2 versus lane 1), whereas overexpression of Rlk caused a further increase (lane 6). Significantly, the increase was comparable with that observed with the overexpression of ZAP-70 (lane 4), a kinase previously shown to phosphorylate SLP-76 (31.Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Further, the levels of ZAP-70 and Rlk expression were roughly equivalent in the transfectants (lower panels). The anti-Rlk antiserum is specific for the transfected murine Rlk protein without cross-reaction with the endogenous human kinase (Txk). As a further control, similar levels of SLP-76 were found expressed in lysates from the different cells (right upper panel). These data indicate that Rlk can cooperate with the TcR complex in the generation of signals leading to SLP-76 phosphorylation.A previous study using SLP-76-deficient cells have demonstrated a requirement for SLP-76 in the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 (29.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 218: 413-416Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In this context, it was interesting that the overexpression of Rlk augmented the level of TcR-induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation (Fig.1 A, middle panel, lane 6). Taken together, these observations are consistent with a role for Rlk in events leading to SLP-76 phosphorylation and its connection with PLCγ1. No effect was observed on TcRζ phosphorylation or the recruitment of ZAP-70 (data not shown). Rlk-induced phosphorylation of SLP-76 could be either direct or indirect. We and others have previously shown that SLP-76 acts as a substrate for the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 (30.Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 31.Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To assess further whether SLP-76 acts as a direct substrate for Rlk, the kinase and SLP-76 were co-expressed in COS cells and analyzed for changes in tyrosine phosphorylation. Transfection of heterologous cells such as COS cells allows for an analysis of lymphoid kinases and substrates in the absence of other lymphoid proteins. As observed in T-cells, the expression of Rlk resulted in the marked phosphorylation of SLP-76 (Fig. 1 B,top panel, lane 2 versus lane 1). By contrast, as a control, kinase inactive Rlk (dRlk) failed to induce phosphorylation (lane 3). Significantly, Rlk phosphorylated SLP-76 at levels that were roughly comparable with that mediated by ZAP-70 (lane 4). Similar amounts of SLP-76 were immunoprecipitated from the different transfectants as shown in an anti-SLP-76 immunoblot (middle panel). Immunoblotting with anti-Rlk antiserum was used as a control for the expression of Rlk (lower panel).SLP-76 possesses three key tyrosines (YESP, YESP, and YEPP) in an acidic N-terminal region that are important for the ability of the adaptor to augment IL-2 transcription in T-cells (32.Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar). ZAP-70 and SYK kinases phosphorylate SLP-76 at these tyrosines (30.Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 31.Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the specificity of Rlk phosphorylation and in particular whether Rlk targeted the same region as ZAP-70, Rlk was co-expressed in T-cells (Fig. 2 A, top panel) and in COS cells (Fig. 2B, top panel) with a mutant form of SLP-76 in which the three key tyrosines have been mutated to phenylalanines. Significantly, the mutation of the key tyrosines resulted in a complete loss of Rlk-mediated phosphorylation in T-cells (Fig. 2 A, top panel, lane 6). An anti-SLP-76 immunoblot showed the same amounts of SLP-76 in the different transfectants (middle panel). Anti-CD3-mediated phosphorylation of SLP-76 in cells transfected with mutant SLP-76Y3F3 alone was also abolished (lane 4 versus lane 2). In COS cells, a 50–60% loss in SLP-76 phosphorylation was observed when the mutant was co-transfected with Rlk (Fig. 2 B, upper panel, lane 4 versus lane 3). As a control, phosphorylation of SLP-76 by ZAP-70 was no longer detectable with the loss of the tyrosines (lane 2 versus lane 1). The same amounts of SLP-76 were immunoprecipitated from the different COS cell transfectants as shown in an anti-SLP-76 immunoblot (middle panel). Immunoblotting with anti-Rlk antiserum was used as a control for the expression of Rlk (lower panel). These data indicate that Rlk and ZAP-70 share an ability to phosphorylate SLP-76 within its acidic N-terminal region, a region that is crucial to the function of the SLP-76 adaptor. The residual phosphorylation of SLP-76Y3F3 in COS cells could be due to the phosphorylation of tyrosines other than the YESP/YEPP sites. In T-cells, overexpressed Rlk mainly phosphorylated the three key tyrosines. The affinity for other tyrosines might be very low, which resulted in no detectable phosphorylation of transfected SLP-76Y3F3.Figure 2Rlk directly phosphorylates the N-terminal region of SLP-76 in COS and T-cells.

Top panel, Jurkat T-cells, transfected with HA-tagged wild-type SLP-76 (lanes 1 and 2), HA-tagged mutant SLP-76Y3F3 (lanes 3 and 4) or together with HA-tagged SLP-76Y3F3 and Rlk (lanes 5 and 6) were either left unstimulated (RαM) (lanes 1, 3, and5) or stimulated with OKT3 and RαM antibodies (lanes 2, 4, and 6), lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-pTyr mAb.Middle panel, the same blot was reprobed with anti-HA mAb.Bottom panel, Rlk expression level of transfected Jurkat cells as shown by anti-Rlk immunoblotting.

Middle panel, the same blot was reprobed with anti-SLP-76 mAb. Bottom panel, Rlk expression level of transfected murine Rlk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because SLP-76 expression is needed for TcR-mediated activation of ERKs (29.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 218: 413-416Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar), the next question was whether the TcRζ/CD3 complex employed Rlk-SLP-76 in the regulation of ERK activity. For this purpose, the kinase and substrate were individually and jointly transfected into Jurkat T-cells, stimulated for 15 min with CD3 mAb, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with ERK1/2 antibodies. Myelin basic protein was then used as a substrate in an in vitro kinase assay for the assessment of ERK activity. As shown in Fig.3, anti-CD3 stimulation induced an increase in ERK activity in vector transfected cells (lane 2 versus lane 1) that was further augmented by expression of SLP-76 (lane 4) or Rlk (lane 6). The combined expression of SLP-76 and Rlk led to a further increase in ERK activity in response to TcRζ/CD3 ligation (lane 8). Similar amounts of cell lysates were subjected to the in vitro kinase assay as shown in an anti-ERK1/2 immunoblot (lower panel). These data therefore demonstrate that both Rlk and SLP-76 operate in response to TcRζ/CD3 ligation to up-regulate ERK activity.Figure 3Co-expression of SLP-76 and Rlk leads to increased ERK activity. Upper panel, Jurkat T-cells transfected with vector (mock) alone (lanes 1 and2), SLP-76 (lanes 3 and 4), Rlk (lanes 5 and 6), or SLP-76 plus Rlk (lanes 7 and 8) were either left unstimulated (RαM) (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or stimulated with OKT3 and RαM antibodies (lanes 2,4, 6, and 8) for 15 min, lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-ERK1/2 mAbs, and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. Lower panel, similar amounts of cell lysates were subjected to the in vitro kinase assay as shown in an anti-ERK1/2 immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given these stimulatory effects, a key question was whether the TcR complex also uses Rlk and its phosphorylation of SLP-76 in the regulation of IL-2 transcription. As seen in Fig.4, Rlk or SLP-76 itself led to a slight increase in anti-CD3 induced NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional activity when compared with cells transfected with vector alone. The effect of SLP-76 on NFAT/AP-1 transcription is comparable with that reported by others (32.Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the combined expression of Rlk and SLP-76 resulted in a marked synergy in the potentiation of IL-2 transcription. In fact, the level of transcription was some 100-fold greater than in cells that were individually transfected with Rlk or SLP-76 (Fig. 4 A). Levels of SLP-76 and Rlk expression were monitored by anti-SLP-76 and anti-Rlk immunoblotting, respectively (right panels). Significantly, the importance of Rlk-mediated phosphorylation was evident with the attenuation of SLP-76/Rlk cooperativity with the kinase inactive Rlk (dRlk) (Fig. 4 A). These data indicated that Rlk kinase activity was needed for the potentiation of IL-2 gene activation. To further connect this phosphorylation with the N-terminal region of SLP-76, the mutant form of SLP-76 (lacking the key tyrosine residues) was also analyzed. In this case, it was also defective in supporting increased IL-2 transcription (Fig. 4 B). Levels of SLP-76 and Rlk expression were monitored by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-Rlk antibodies, respectively (right panels). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Rlk-mediated phosphorylation of SLP-76 cooperatively up-regulates TcRζ/CD3-induced IL-2 transcription in T-cells and that the kinase activity of Rlk and its phosphorylation site on SLP-76 are needed for this potentiation.Figure 4Rlk and SLP-76 cooperatively up-regulate TcRζ/CD3-induced IL-2 production. A, Jurkat T-cells were co-transfected with 3X NFAT/AP-1-LUC reporter plasmid and vector (mock), HA-tagged SLP-76, Rlk, kinase inactive Rlk (dRlk), HA-tagged SLP-76 plus Rlk, or HA-tagged SLP-76 plus dRlk. Cells were either left unstimulated (RαM) (black bars) or stimulated with OKT3 and RαM mAbs (hatched bars) and assayed for luciferase activity (left panel). Expression levels of SLP-76 and Rlk are shown in an anti-SLP-76 and anti-Rlk immunoblot. B, Jurkat T-cells were co-transfected with 3X NFAT/AP-1 and vector, HA-tagged wild-type SLP-76 plus Rlk, or HA-tagged mutant SLP-76Y3F3 plus Rlk.

Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao C. Littman D. Sher A. Varmus H. Lenardo M. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar,29.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R.

Med. 1997; 186: 221-22838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, despite the importance of SLP-76, the identity of kinases that connect the TcR complex to the adaptor and the subsequent up-regulation of ERK activity and IL-2 transcription has been unclear. In this study, we provide the first evidence of a link between Rlk and the SLP-76 adaptor. We found that Rlk phosphorylates SLP-76 at its N-terminal YESP/YEPP sites, a region that previously was found to act as a site for ZAP-70 phosphorylation (31.Raab M. da Silva A.J. Findell P.R. Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1997; 6: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These N-terminal residues are required for the ability of SLP-76 to up-regulate IL-2 transcription (32.Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar). Further, Rlk and SLP-76 potently and cooperatively up-regulate TcR-driven IL-2 transcription in T-cells. This synergy depended on Rlk phosphorylation of SLP-76 tyrosine sites. Loss of the N-terminal YESP/YEPP sites of SLP-76 attenuated the cooperative effect, as did the loss of Rlk kinase activity. These observations support a model where the TcR can utilize the two kinases Rlk and ZAP-70 in the phosphorylation of SLP-76 leading to the up-regulation of IL-2 production in T-cells (Fig. 5). Whether these two kinases operate in synergy at some other juncture in the cascade (i.e. PLCγ1 phosphorylation) awaits further studies.Figure 5Model of Rlk targeting of SLP-76 in TcR signaling. TcR complex can use Rlk and its ability to phosphorylate SLP-76 to up-regulate IL-2 transcription. As with ZAP-70, Rlk can phosphorylate SLP-76 in its acidic N-terminal region, the region needed for the SLP-76 potentiated IL-2 transcription. Both TcR-driven ERK activation and NFAT transcription were increased by co-expression of SLP-76 and Rlk in T-cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to placing Rlk in a TcR-mediated signaling network, our data emphasize the central role of SLP-76 as an integrator of signals from both the ZAP-70 and Rlk kinases. It is also consistent with the observation that T-cells from Rlk−/− × ITK−/− and SLP-76−/− mice show a similar phenotype with defects in Ca2+ mobilization and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and IL-2 production (25.Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao C. Littman D. Sher A. Varmus H. Lenardo M. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 29.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 218: 413-416Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The ability of co-transfected SLP-76 and Rlk to up-regulate ERK activity is also in agreement with the delayed onset of ERK activation in T-cells from Rlk−/− × ITK−/− mice (25.Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao C. Littman D. Sher A. Varmus H. Lenardo M. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition, the knock-out mice showed alterations in Ca2+ mobilization, which was also observed in our transfection studies (data not shown). Our observation that Rlk transfection led to increased PLCγ1 phosphorylation suggests that Rlk could be one of the bridging protein tyrosine kinases between SLP-76 and PLCγ1. Taken together, our results provide an alternate pathway from the TcR that phosphorylates SLP-76 and potentiates PLCγ1 phosphorylation.The overlapping roles of Rlk and ZAP-70 in the phosphorylation of SLP-76 do not exclude additional functions of ZAP-70 and SLP-76 unconnected with Rlk. This is suggested by the difference in the phenotypes of the Rlk−/− × ITK−/− and ZAP-70−/− mice, where ZAP-70−/− mice show a block in thymic development that is not evident in RLK−/− × ITK−/− mice (38.Chan A.C.

A closely associated, cAMP-dependent protein kinase rapidly reduced channel activity in a conditional manner that could be overcome completely by increasing cytoplasmic free calcium 3-fold or 20 mV further depolarization. Phosphorylation at a pharmacologically distinct site inhibited channel activity unconditionally by reducing availability to approximately half that of maximum at all physiological calcium and voltages.

Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of BKCa channels to such physiological stimuli can be modified by enzyme pathways mediating reversible phosphorylation of the ion channel proteins or other closely associated regulatory proteins (2.Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Such reversible protein phosphorylation is the primary mechanism for regulating ion channel activity on the physiological time scale of seconds and minutes (2.Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev.

Modification of the behavior of BKCa channels has profound effects on the frequency and duration of action potentials in excitable cells, thereby controlling the physiological function of these cells. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that the activity of BKCa channels in native cells may be up- or down-regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation. For example, protein kinase-induced phosphorylation enhances calcium-activated potassium currents in smooth muscle (5.Kume H. Takai A. Tokonu H. Tomita T.

Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the currents are inhibited by kinase activity. BKCa channels exist as multimeric protein complexes composed of two integral membrane subunits, the pore-forming α subunit and the regulatory β subunit (1.Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). All α subunits are apparently coded by the same gene, theslo gene, but alternative RNA splicing during development produces functionally distinct channel proteins in different cell types (13.Tseng-Crank J. Godinot N. Johansen T.E. Ahring P.K Strobaek D. Mertz R. Foster C.D. Olesen S.P. Reinhart P.H Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hence, opposite modulatory effects of protein phosphorylation are likely to reflect differential modulation of BKCachannel subtypes derived from alternately spliced mRNA transcripts or could arise as a result of variations in the α and β subunit composition of the channel complexes (1.Vergara C.

Sci. 1998; 13: 112-117PubMed Google Scholar) or more indirect signaling cascades. We have used the patch-clamp technique to investigate the modulation of BKCa channel behavior by reversible protein phosphorylation at the molecular level by recording channel opening behavior in cell-free patches of native membrane. Thus, we report studies of BKCa channel modulation under controlled conditions in the absence of alternative splicing or diffusible regulatory proteins, where the open probability (P o) of the channels was determined under a variety of experimental conditions to promote or inhibit protein phosphorylation. In mammalian endocrine and nervous systems, most examples of BKCa channel regulation by hormones and neurotransmitters involve channel inhibition by protein phosphorylation (1.Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N.V. Adelman J.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 9.Dorner D. Pitler T.A. Alger B.E. J.

Andrade R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 191-197PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the BKCa channels in rat pituitary tumor cells (GH4C1 cells) are also inhibited by phosphorylation. In these cells, maximal stimulation of either protein kinase A (PKA) or C (PKC) completely suppresses BKCachannel activity in the physiological voltage range (17.Sikdar S.K. McIntosh R.P. Mason W.T. Brain Res. 1989; 496: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18.Shipston M.J. Armstrong D.L. J. Physiol. 1996; 493 (627): 665Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); conversely, hormones that inhibit secretion from GH4C1 cells have been shown to stimulate BKCa channels through protein dephosphorylation (12.White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19.White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, the BKCa channels in GH4C1cells are regulated in the same way as many other physiologically relevant examples of BKCa channels in the brain. For this reason, we have chosen to study the effects of reversible protein phosphorylation on the calcium and voltage dependence of single native BKCa channels from GH4C1 cells. Previous studies at the single-channel level have focused on BKCa channels that are stimulated by protein phosphorylation (5.Kume H. Takai A. Tokonu H. Tomita T. Nature. 1989; 341: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 20.Ewald D.A. Williams A. Levitan I.B. Nature. 1985; 315: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21.Lechleiter J.D.

In this paper, we report evidence of BKCa channel modulation using a cell-free system that qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces the effects of hormones on intact cells. This is the first study of native BKCa channels in native membranes that systematically varies all three of the molecular mechanisms known to regulate these channels: voltage, intracellular free calcium concentration, and protein phosphorylation. BKCa channel modulation has not previously been examined at sufficiently high open probabilities to address the molecular mechanism of modulation across the complete range of channel activity. To measure the effects of reversible protein phosphorylation on BKCachannel activity reproducibly over the entire physiological range, 0.01 ≤ P o ≤ 0.9, we have found it essential to use 1,2-bis(aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)1 and its dibromo analogue to buffer calcium on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane patches. EGTA, which saturates at submicromolar concentrations of calcium (24.Byerly L. Moody W.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 352: 637-652Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25.Marty A. Neher E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 367: 117-141Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26.Adler E.M. Augustine G.J. Duffy S.N. Charlton M.P. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1496-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is an ineffective buffer of physiological calcium transients. In contrast, BAPTA and dibromo-BAPTA bind calcium rapidly and independently of pH and physiological magnesium concentrations with an affinity that allows effective buffering of free calcium at concentrations up to and above 10 μm (27.Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). With this experimental precaution, our measurements have revealed a novel property of BKCa channel regulation by protein phosphorylation. Our findings have important implications for the control of BKCa channel proteins and demonstrate that reversible protein phosphorylation cascades play an integral role in controlling cellular excitability through their actions on BKCa channels. BKCa channel activity was studied in GH4C1 cells, an immortal cell line derived from rat anterior pituitary tumor cells (28.Tashjian Jr., A.H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in sterile Ham's F-10 culture medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (2.5%, vol), equine serum (12.5%, vol), and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Cells were plated onto plain or collagen-coated glass coverslips 1–6 days before patch clamp recording, and the culture medium was replaced every 3–4 days. Cells from culture passage 2–28 were used in these studies. The activity of single BKCa channels was investigated using conventional patch clamp recording techniques (29.Sakmann B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (7052; Garner Glass Co, Claremont, CA), the pipette shank was coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI), and the tips were fire-polished just before use. These pipettes had resistances in the range of 4–8 megaohms when filled with electrolyte (see below for composition). Single-channel activity was recorded at room temperature from cell-attached patches of membrane on intact cells and from cell-free, inside-out patches using an Axopatch 1C amplifier and TL-1 interface (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Data were recorded and analyzed using pClamp software, version 6.0.1 (Axon Instruments). Voltage-dependent channel activity was measured over the range −40 to 100 mV, with the applied voltage stepped at random. BKCa channels were identified by their conductance, ∼120 picosiemens in a physiological [K+] gradient. The stochastic behavior of ion channels in these patches was interpreted using standard analytical procedures. Channel open probability (P o) was determined from continuous records of channel activity over 10, 20, or 30 s at a given potential; P o may show some variability when measured over shorter periods (30.Smith M.A. Ashford M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 733-747Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Excised membrane patches commonly contained more than one active BKCa channel. The number of active channels could be counted with confidence (N ≤ 3) when all the channels were stimulated to open simultaneously, giving high open probabilities (P o near 1) during a 10-s period. In these patches, P o was calculated according to the relationship, Po=∑N1(i×ti)/(N×tt)Equation 1 where i = 1 to N, N is the maximum number of channels open simultaneously at the most depolarized membrane potentials (positive to +60 mV; N ≤ 3),t t is the total time of the recording andt i is the cumulative time during which exactlyi channels are open. When channel behavior in multichannel patches was not monitored across the complete voltage range, activity is expressed as N*P o. Data are expressed as the mean value ± S.D. from multiple independent measurements (n ≥ 3). Statistical analyses were made by Student'st test (2-tailed) for paired or unpaired data as appropriate; the null hypothesis was rejected when p < 0.05. Boltzmann curves were generated by best fit to complete data sets using the Origin 4.0 software package (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA); P o(min) was constrained at 0, and where appropriate, P o(max) was constrained at 0.87 (mean value from experimental data). For cell-attached recording, intact cells were bathed in high [K+] solution with the following composition: 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with NaOH), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 30 mm glucose, such thatE K = 0 mV. Pipette-filling solution had the following composition: 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.001 mm tetrodotoxin. After seal formation (>30 gigaohms), cell-free patches were excised into a similar high [K+] solution containing the calcium buffers BAPTA or dibromo-BAPTA (1 mm). Free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) was adjusted in the ranges 10−8 to 5 × 10−7m (with BAPTA as the calcium buffer) and 10−6to 10−5m (with dibromo-BAPTA as the calcium buffer) by the addition of appropriate amounts of a stock solution of CaCl2 (1 m), according to the relationship, Total added [Ca2+]=[buffer]/(KD/free[Ca2+])+1Equation 2 Use of 1 mm BAPTA or dibromo-BAPTA allowed accurate buffering of [Ca2+] at the intracellular face of the membrane and avoided the artifacts associated with the slow Mg2+- and pH-dependent buffering by EGTA (27.Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid was used to inhibit the activity of specific protein phosphatases (31.Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1989; 256: 283-290Crossref Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Consistent effects of okadaic acid were obtained by careful treatment of the inhibitor. Stock okadaic acid solutions were prepared in sterile, dry dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored in airtight containers at −20 °C for up to 2 months. Stock solutions were diluted in bath solution to give a final Me2SO concentration of 0.1%; the activity of okadaic acid was preserved by limiting the thawing and refreezing of stock solutions and avoiding sonication of experimental solutions. When GH cells are voltage-clamped through perforated patches in a physiological salt solution, BKCa channels dominate the steady-state membrane conductance at depolarized voltages (12.White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 32.Barros F. Mieskes G. del Camino D. de la Pena P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33.Simasko S.M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2015-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, individual channels in cell-attached patches on resting cells often showed surprisingly low activity: P o< 0.1 even at +40 mV. However, when membrane patches were excised into an ATP-free bathing solution (Fig. 1), the mean open probability (P o) increased slowly but significantly over 10–15 min, reaching a new steady-state level that was 258 ± 167% greater than the activity measured immediately following patch excision (n = 11;p < 0.01). In many patches, an increase in the number of BKCa channels open simultaneously (N) was also observed. The rate of increase in channel activity was not affected by varying calcium concentration the range 0.1 to 1.0 μm or by varying the membrane potential of the patch from 0 to +40 mV (not shown). Once BKCa channel activity had stabilized in MgATP-free solution, it remained stable for the duration of the recording (up to 90 min, Fig.2 A). Nevertheless, the mean open probability of the channels in the patch could be increased independently by further depolarization (V) or by increasing the free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) at the intracellular face of the membrane, up to a maximumP o = 0.86 ± 0.11 (n = 10 complete P o V curves at 5 different [Ca2+] in 8 patches) (Fig. 2 B). These effects were reproducible and fully reversible and showed no sign of inactivation during prolonged stimulation. At calcium concentrations between 0.1 and 10.0 μm, an e-fold increase inP o over the linear range from 0.1 to 0.8 was produced by increasing the voltage 14.6 ± 6.6 mV (n = 8 independent curves, in 6 patches). On average, increasing free calcium 10-fold at the cytoplasmic surface reduced the voltage required to produce half-maximal activity (V 1/2) by 55mV without changing the intrinsic voltage dependence of activity (Fig. 2 C). Thus, when protein kinases are inhibited, native BKCa channels are extremely sensitive to changes in voltage and calcium in the physiological ranges. The dissociation constant (K D) for Ca2+ binding was 1.8 μm (calculated from the linear fit to the data in Fig. 2 C (34.Ramanathan K. Michael T.H. Jiang G-J. Heil H. Fuchs P.A. Science. 1999; 283: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)). Hence, although depolarization greater than any action potential (∼+55 mV) would be required for half-maximal channel activity at the resting calcium level in the cell (∼0.1 μm), half-maximal channel activity would be sustained below the resting membrane potential of the cell (∼−55 mV) as long as free Ca2+ levels underneath the plasma membrane exceeded 10.0 μm. Previous studies show that protein dephosphorylation stimulates BKCa channel activity in GH4C1 cells (12.White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19.White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); this behavior is similar to that of BK channels in other neuronal cell types (3.Nicoll R.A. Science. 1988; 241: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 9.Dorner D. Pitler T.A. Alger B.E. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4069-4078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Pedarzani P. Storm J.F. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 2749-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11.Torres G.E. Chaput Y. Andrade R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 191-197PubMed Google Scholar). The increase in BKCa channels activity we observed following patch excision into ATP-free solutions is consistent with this published data. Two independent pharmacological manipulations of the patches provide additional evidence that endogenous protein phosphatases are responsible for the increase in BKCachannel activity. First, inhibition of serine/threonine-directed protein phosphatases with the structurally unrelated microbial toxins 1 μm microcystin (n = 3) or 1 nm okadaic acid (n = 5) to selectively inhibit the PP2A family of phosphatases (35.MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) completely prevented the increase in channel activity when they were added before patch excision (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, if the inhibitors were not added until after channel activity had increased in ATP-free solution, they had no effect on channel activity (not shown), which rules out direct effects of the toxins on channel gating. Second, subsequent addition of MgATP at the intracellular face of the membrane rapidly reduced activity back to the low level recorded immediately following patch excision (Fig. 3 A;n = 6). This effect of MgATP was not readily reversible, but neither free Mg2+ ions alone (as 1 mm MgCl2; n = 4) nor 1 mm MgADP (n = 4) nor 0.1 mm GTP (n = 2) could mimic this effect of MgATP. These findings demonstrate a specific requirement for MgATP, which indicates a role for protein phosphorylation in the suppression of BKCa channel opening. In support of this conclusion, the effect of MgATP was prevented when PKA was inhibited by preaddition of 10 μm Rp-cAMPS with 1 μm wiptide (PKI5–22 (Peninsula Labs)). The activity of BKCa channels in dephosphorylated membrane patches was reduced dramatically by subsequent protein phosphorylation (Fig. 3). The addition of 1 mm MgATP (but not ADP or GTP; see above) to the solution at the intracellular face of the excised patch caused a shift of 19 ± 10 mV (n = 5 patches; p < 0.05) toward more depolarizing potentials in the voltage dependence of BKCa channel activity without changing the slope of the relationship (Fig. 3 C). We interpret the reduction in activity as a decrease in channel sensitivity to calcium because the same effect was observed at two calcium concentrations (1 and 5 μm) and because the intrinsic voltage-dependence of channel activity remained unchanged. The decrease inP o was achieved predominantly by a decrease in the frequency of channel opening with no significant change in the mean open time. Nevertheless, the maximum attainable channel activity was not suppressed by MgATP in excised patches; channels could be stimulated maximally by raising calcium or by depolarizing further (Fig. 3). In three patches, P o(max) was 0.76 ± 0.07 following run up in the absence of ATP and 0.71 ± 0.10 following the addition of MgATP (no significant difference;p > 0.1). The inhibitory effect of MgATP on channel activity was not potentiated by subsequent addition of low concentrations (≤10 nm) of okadaic acid or microcystin (not shown), indicating that the basal activity of PKA was substantially higher than that of the phosphatase. This conclusion is consistent with the low activity of BKCachannels in cell-attached patches observed before excision and is supported by the observation that incubating cells in 1 nmokadaic acid and 1 mm cpt-cAMP for 10 min before patch excision also had no significant effect on channel activity in cell-attached patches (n = 4). However, the open probability of the channels after patch excision from cells treated with okadaic acid could not be increased beyondP o = 0.47 ± 0.19 (n = 10 complete P oV curves over a range of [Ca2+] in 6 patches) at any calcium concentration (≤50 μm) or voltage (≤+100mV) we examined (Fig.4). In all but one of the patches treated with okadaic acid before excision, maximal opening probability was <0.5. In contrast, in every single one of the dephosphorylated patches and those patches that were rephosphorylated after excision, maximal channel open probability could be driven to P o> 0.7. Hence, we interpret this suppressed channel activity as an effect on all of the channels rather than on a subset of the channel population. Our data indicate that in intact cells there is an additional kinase regulating the activity of BKCa channels to produce a significantly different physiological effect on cell excitability. PKA-mediated phosphorylation reduces the sensitivity of BKCa channels to increases in voltage and calcium, but phosphorylation by the second kinase reduces the maximum attainable channel activity by half. In other words, the inhibition by PKA is conditional, but the inhibition by the second kinase is unconditional. The data reported here establish clearly that native calcium-activated potassium channels with the largest conductance (BKCa or maxi-K) are inhibited by endogenous protein kinases and stimulated by endogenous protein phosphatases that remain closely associated with the channels in cell-free patches from an immortalized endocrine rat pituitary cell line (GH4C1). Our results are entirely consistent with the physiological stimulation of excitability and secretion in the anterior pituitary by hypothalamic neuropeptides, which increase protein kinase activity through Gs- and Gq-coupled receptors (36.Yajima Y. Akita Y. Saito T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2684-2689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Armstrong D.L. White R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such kinase-mediated inhibition demonstrates that BKCa channels in GH4C1 cells behave in the same way as the calcium-activated potassium currents in hippocampal neurons of the mammalian central nervous system (3.Nicoll R.A.

In contrast, most previous single-channel studies of BKCa channel modulation have been conducted on channels that are stimulated by protein kinases and inhibited by protein phosphatases, using either native channels in nonneuronal tissues (5.Kume H.

Nevertheless, single-channel studies in neurons have also shown stimulation of BKCa channel activity by protein kinases (20.Ewald D.A. Williams A. Levitan I.B.

Similar diversity in the response to protein kinases and phosphatases has been reported for BKCachannels in cells from the vascular system (42.Perez G. Toro L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1459-C1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Zhou X. Ruth P. Schlossmann J. Hoffmann F. Korth M. J. Biol.

As yet there is only one slo gene encoding the pore-forming subunit of the BKCa channel in any single species; hence, such diametrically opposed differences in modulation by phosphorylation must reflect alternative splicing of the gene or interaction with additional regulatory subunits or more indirect signaling cascades through which the protein kinases produce their effects. We have used a number of criteria to identify the specific biochemical mechanism of the observed “run-up” of BKCa channel activity in excised membrane patches, although we have not characterized as clearly all of the enzymes or their substrates that are responsible for modulating the availability of BKCachannels for opening. This is the first study to investigate the effect of protein phosphorylation on BKCa channel activity at maximal open probabilities. As a result, we have discovered that pharmacologically distinct protein kinases produce functionally distinct effects on channel behavior. One kinase, probably PKA, reduces stimulation of BKCa channel activity by calcium and voltage without reducing the availability of the channels. For an enzyme, this would correspond to a reduction in K m without a change in V max. A second, unidentified kinase reduces the availability of the channels at all calcium concentrations and voltages, corresponding to a decrease inV max. The exact mechanisms by which the functional consequences of protein phosphorylation are achieved remain unclear. Both α and β subunits of the channel complex contain potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase A and protein kinase C (16.Toro L. Wallner M. Meera P. Tanaka Y. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 112-117PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal “tail” of the α subunit has also been demonstrated to confer the calcium-sensing properties of BKCa channels (38.Wei A. Solaro C. Lingle C. Salkoff L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 671-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar); thus, the addition or removal of charged phosphate groups could alter the calcium sensitivity of channel activity by influencing the “Ca2+ sensor” in the protein. Alternatively, co-expression of the β subunit has been shown to enhance the calcium sensitivity of BKCa channels (13.Tseng-Crank J. Godinot N. Johansen T.E. Ahring P.K Strobaek D. Mertz R. Foster C.D. Olesen S.P. Reinhart P.H Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9200-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,39.McManus O.B. Helms L.M.H. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Swanson R.

Gribkoff V.K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4543-4550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) so reversible phosphorylation could modulate channel behavior by promoting or inhibiting interactions between the α and β subunits in the heteromultimeric channel complex. Fig. 5 illustrates one hypothesis that integrates the results of this study with previously published results from intact GH4C1 cells (12,18) and from BKCa channels isolated from rat brain and reconstituted into lipid bilayers (41.Reinhart P.H. Chung S.K. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When protein phosphorylation is prevented, the channels respond robustly to physiological increases in voltage and calcium. Phosphorylation at one of the modulatory sites inhibits channel activity in a conditional manner that can be overcome by increasing cytoplasmic calcium 3-fold or depolarizing the membrane by an additional 20 mV. Phosphorylation of this “conditional” site requires PKA activity and is protected by low concentrations of okadaic acid, which leads us to postulate that it is regulated by a type 2A-like protein phosphatase. In support of this proposal, it has been shown in bilayers that the inhibitory effect of PKA on brain BKCa channels is reversed selectively by PP2A but not PP1 (41.Reinhart P.H. Chung S.K. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results also demonstrate a second pharmacologically and functionally distinct phosphorylation site that regulates channel availability. Phosphorylation at this site modulates BKCachannel behavior in an unconditional manner by reducing the maximum attainable open probability to P o <0.5, even with unphysiologically high calcium concentrations or depolarized membrane potentials. PKC is a powerful inhibitor of BKCachannel activity in intact GH4C1 cells (18.Shipston M.J. Armstrong D.L. J. Physiol. 1996; 493 (627): 665Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and in neurons (9.Dorner D. Pitler T.A. Alger B.E. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4069-4078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, however, unconditional inhibition is lost when the membrane patch is excised from the cell, which implies either that this kinase is not functionally coupled to the channels in cell-free patches or that basal protein phosphatase activity is much greater than the activity of the kinase at this site. Preliminary experiments in which cell-free patches were treated with MgATP and a higher concentration (100 nm) of okadaic acid indicate that channel availability is suppressed under these conditions, 2S. K. Hall, unpublished observations. which implies a direct role for another phosphatase less sensitive to okadaic acid than PP2A. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is much less sensitive to okadaic acid than PP2A (31.Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1989; 256: 283-290Crossref Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), and PP1 selectively reverses the effects of PKC on BKCa channels in other systems (23.Bielefeldt K. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475: 241-254Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 46.Reinhart P.H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4572-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified two functionally distinct effects of endogenous protein kinases and phosphatases on the activity of calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels. Phosphorylation at a putative PKA/PP2A site reduces the calcium sensitivity of BKCachannels without altering the voltage dependence of activation or suppressing maximum channel availability. In contrast, phosphorylation at a putative PKC/PP1 site reduces the availability of the channels at all calcium concentrations and voltages in the physiological range. Such conditional and unconditional regulation by two pharmacologically distinct signaling pathways provides the nervous and neuroendocrine systems with a powerful computational process at the cellular level. Activation of Gs-coupled receptors would inhibit BKCa channel activity and, hence, stimulate cell excitability in a conditional manner, an effect that could be reversed when the intracellular calcium concentration increased or the membrane depolarized further. In contrast, activation of Gq-coupled receptors would inhibit BKCa channel activity and stimulate excitability unconditionally until the effects of PKC were reversed by protein phosphatase activity."

We report that mutational disruption of 14-3-3 binding to the B-Raf catalytic domain inhibits B-Raf biological activity. Expression of the isolated B-Raf catalytic domain (B-Rafcat) induces PC12 cell differentiation in the absence of nerve growth factor. By contrast, the B-Rafcat 14-3-3 binding mutant, B-Rafcat S728A, was severely compromised for the induction of PC12 cell differentiation. Interestingly, the B-Rafcat 14-3-3 binding mutant retained significant in vitro catalytic activity.

A complex multistep process of Raf-1 activation by growth factors has begun to emerge.

The relief of negative regulation appears to involve both phosphorylation and altered interactions with associated proteins. Initially, growth factor stimulated activation of the Ras protein induces a translocation of Raf-1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (6.Van Aelst L. Barr M. Marcus S. Polverino A. Wigler M.

Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that in an analogous manner to Src homology domain 2-containing proteins, the 14-3-3 family of proteins, by virtue of their ability to dimerize, may function as adapter proteins that link different intracellular signaling molecules in higher order complexes (18.Muslin A.J.

Both positive and negative roles for 14-3-3 interaction with Raf-1 have been suggested. The 14-3-3 proteins are not direct Raf-1 activators (20.Luo Z. Zhang X. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol.

However, there is also evidence that 14-3-3 proteins are not required for Raf-1 activity (21.Suen K.L. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell.

These apparently contradictory findings may be explained in part by the fact that multiple 14-3-3 binding sites exist on Raf-1 (18.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 25.Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell.

Mutational analysis of the Raf-1 14-3-3 binding sites has provided some insight into the effect of 14-3-3 binding upon Raf-1. Ablation of the Raf-1 N-terminal regulatory domain 14-3-3 binding site consensus sequence results in a constitutively active enzyme, implying an inhibitory role for 14-3-3 binding in the regulation of Raf-1 activation (25.Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, 14-3-3 association with the N-terminal domain has also been shown to facilitate Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation (27.Roy S. McPherson R.A. Apolloni A. Yan J. Lane A. Clyde S.J. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that 14-3-3 interaction maintains Raf-1 in an inactive, but activable, conformation. Consistent with this interpretation, 14-3-3 protein is displaced from the N-terminal domain of Raf-1 in response to Ras binding (29.Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the 14-3-3 binding site within the Raf-1 C-terminal catalytic domain (18.Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar), by contrast, renders the mutant Raf-1 protein catalytically inactive (30.Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that interaction of 14-3-3 with the C-terminal catalytic domain is required for Raf-1 kinase activity. Very little is known about the role of 14-3-3 in the regulation of the B-Raf activity. 14-3-3 proteins have been demonstrated to interact with B-Raf in vivo (31.Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Fukui K. Ohtsuka T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11723-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and in a manner similar to Raf-1, these interactions appear to occur through separate N- and C-terminal interaction sites (32.Papin C. Denouel A. Calothy G. Eychene A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2213-2221PubMed Google Scholar). A consensus 14-3-3 interaction motif is found centered around serine 728 (Ser-728) in the C-terminal catalytic domain (equivalent to Ser-621 in Raf-1). In this study, we have determined the effect of mutational perturbation of 14-3-3 interaction with the B-Raf catalytic domain. Our findings suggest that 14-3-3 binding to the catalytic domain is not necessary for B-Raf kinase activity per se but rather facilitates B-Raf biological activity through the coupling of B-Raf to downstream effector complexes. The plasmids pXen B-Raf catalytic domain (B-Rafcat), pXen B-Raf, pXen Rafcat (pXen vRaf), SRα B-Raf, and SRα B-Rafcat have been described previously (33.MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Standard polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce a serine to alanine mutation at amino acid 728 (S728A) within pXen B-Rafcat and pXen B-Raf, to generate pXen B-Rafcat S728A and pXen B-Raf S728A, respectively. Similarly, a serine to alanine mutation at amino acid 621 was introduced within pXen Rafcat, to generate pXen Rafcat S621A. Forin vitro transcription, pXen plasmids were linearized withEcoRI and capped RNA synthesized with SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (35.MacNicol M.C. Pot D. MacNicol A.M. Gene. 1997; 196: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The open reading frames of pXen B-Rafcat S728A, B-Raf S728A and Rafcat were isolated and subcloned into the SRα expression vector to generate SRα B-Rafcat S728A, SRα B-Raf S728A, and SRα Rafcat, respectively. To subclone into the yeast two-hybrid vector pAS1, pXen B-Rafcat, and pXen B-Rafcat S728A were digested with Asp718 and XbaI, Klenow-treated, and subcloned into SmaI digested pAS1 to generate pAS1 B-Rafcat and pAS1 B-Rafcat S728A, respectively. B-Rafcat and the point mutant S728A version of B-Rafcat (B-Rafcat S728A) were inserted into pAS1-CYH as in-frame fusions with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (residues 1–147) to make pAS B-Rafcat and pAS B-Rafcat S728A (14.Fantl W.J.

Yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with the B-Rafcat constructs and 14-3-3β or lamin and plated onto medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. Colonies were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by use of X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside) as a substrate (14.Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M.

DefolliculatedXenopus oocytes were microinjected with in vitrotranscribed RNA (5–10 ng of RNA per embryo) encoding glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins as indicated. The extent of oocyte maturation (in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml progesterone (Sigma)) was monitored morphologically by the appearance of a white spot on the animal hemisphere, which is indicative of germinal vesicle breakdown. Pools of 20 injected oocytes were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 units of aprotinin (Sigma)/ml, 0.1 mm NaVO4, and 25 μm leupeptin) (34.Muslin A.J. MacNicol A.M. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4197-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For cyclin B protein injections, human Δ87 cyclin B1 was expressed and purified from sf9 cells as described previously (36.Howard E.L. Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and 50–100 pg of cyclin protein was injected per oocyte. Subcellular fractionation of membrane and cytosolic components was performed as described previously (37.Evans J.P. Kay B.K. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% equine serum and 5% fetal calf serum. For transfections PC12 cells were plated on 35 mm Biocoat dishes (Becton Dickinson) at 30% confluency and transfected by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were cultured in low serum medium (2% equine serum + 1% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) in order to maximize their differentiation response (38.Rudkin B.B. Lazarovici P. Levi B.Z. Abe Y. Fujita K. Guroff G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3319-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). NGF (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; final concentration, 100 ng/ml) was added in low serum medium. Transfected cells were visualized by expression of the co-transfected β-galactosidase gene and blue X-gal staining (Life Technologies, Inc.). NGF- and B-Rafcat-stimulated differentiation was scored by counting hypertrophic cells with one or more growth cone tipped neurites greater than 2 cell bodies in length. To prepare protein lysates, transfected cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was assayed for total protein by Bradford assay (Pierce). GST fusion proteins were partially purified from PC12 andXenopus cell lysates as described previously (33.MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13193-13197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were then assayed for Raf activity in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 25 mm β glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 ng of kinase-negative MEK for 10 min at 30 °C (35.MacNicol M.C. Pot D. MacNicol A.M. Gene. 1997; 196: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 39.Gardner A.M. Lange C.C. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 258-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into kinase-negative MEK was determined by PhosphorImager analysis (33.MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13193-13197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Western blotting to determine GST fusion protein levels was performed with a GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The activation status of MEK and MAP kinase was visualized using antibodies specific for the diphosphorylated, activated forms of each enzyme (New England Biolabs). Bound antibody was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposure to hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For 14-3-3 association experiments, the partially purified GST fusion proteins were washed twice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 1m NaCl, and associated 14-3-3 protein was detected after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western transfer with a 14-3-3β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To visualize vRas after subcellular fractionation, Western blotting was performed with a Ras monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The amino acids residues encoding the Raf-1 C-terminal catalytic domain 14-3-3 recognition motif (RSASEP) are conserved in B-Raf and are centered around serine 728. We utilized the yeast two-hybrid protein association assay to determine whether mutation of serine 728 to an alanine residue (S728A) disrupted 14-3-3 protein interaction with the catalytic domain of B-Raf. The cDNAs encoding the C-terminal catalytic domain (B-Rafcat) and a mutant encoding the serine to alanine change (B-Rafcat S728A) were subcloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the yeast two-hybrid pAS1 vector. A series of yeast transformations was performed with the GAL4 transactivation domain fusion pGAD vector encoding 14-3-3β or lamin (an unrelated, control protein). The S728A mutation disrupted association of 14-3-3β protein with the B-Raf catalytic domain as assessed by GAL4-dependent β-galactosidase expression (data not shown). No association of B-Rafcat or B-Rafcat S728A with lamin was detected. To determine the signaling properties of the mutant B-Rafcat S728A protein in vivo, we utilized the Xenopus oocyte maturation model system. Because every oocyte expresses injected RNA transcripts, it is possible to analyze the effect of exogenous proteins on endogenous effector pathways. The isolated B-Raf catalytic domain and the S728A derivative were subcloned into the pXen vector (35.MacNicol M.C. Pot D. MacNicol A.M. Gene. 1997; 196: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to engineer an in-frame N-terminal GST epitope tag, and in vitro transcribed RNA was prepared and injected into immatureXenopus oocytes. The GST fusion proteins were partially purified, and any associated 14-3-3 protein was analyzed by Western blotting with a 14-3-3β-specific antiserum. As can be seen in Fig.1, the S728A mutation abrogated 14-3-3 interaction with the catalytic domain of B-Raf, confirming the results of the yeast two-hybrid analysis. We next determined whether expression of GST B-Rafcat or GST B-Rafcat S728A could induce Xenopusoocyte maturation. Whereas GST B-Rafcat effectively induces maturation in >90% of the injected oocytes, the B-Rafcat S728A mutant protein failed to induce maturation after 20 h of culture (Fig.2 A). The kinase activity of B-Raf was necessary for the induction of oocyte maturation because B-Rafcat K482M (a kinase deficient mutant) failed to induce maturation at any time point examined (data not shown). An analysis of the activation status of endogenous MEK and MAP kinase in oocytes expressing the GST-tagged proteins revealed that in contrast to GST B-Rafcat, the mutant GST B-Rafcat S728A had a significantly reduced ability to activate MEK and MAP kinase (Fig. 2 B). GST B-Rafcat S728A induced MEK activation was barely detectable, although a modest activation of MAP kinase (as compared with progesterone or GST B-Rafcat) was reproducibly observed. This GST B-Rafcat S728A induced MAP kinase activation probably reflects an amplification of the weak MEK activation signal. No significant differences in subcellular localization were detected (Fig. 2 C, left panel), and both GST B-Rafcat and GST B-Rafcat S728A proteins were found predominantly in the cytosolic compartment. As a control for fractionation, ectopic vRas (RasV12) was predominantly localized to the membrane fraction (Fig. 2 C, right panel).Figure 2The S728A mutation compromises the ability of B-Rafcat to induce Xenopus oocyte maturation. A, immature Xenopus oocytes were microinjected with RNA encoding either GST B-Rafcat or GST B-Rafcat S728A, and the extent of oocyte maturation was determined morphologically (by the appearance of a white spot on the animal hemisphere, which is indicative of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD)) after 20 h of culture. The histogram represents the combined data from three independent experiments, and the numbers above each column indicate the number of mature oocytes over the total number characterized. No maturation was observed in uninjected oocytes (control). B, protein lysates were prepared from pools of oocytes analyzed in A, and the activation status of MEK and MAP kinase was determined by Western blotting with antiserum specific for the activated (phosphorylated) forms of each enzyme (arrowheads). For negative and positive controls, protein lysates were prepared from immature (Imm) and progesterone matured (Prog) oocytes, respectively. Equivalent levels of GST B-Rafcat and GST B-Rafcat S728A were expressed. A representative Western blot is shown. C, hypotonic protein lysates were prepared from pools of oocytes expressing GST B-Rafcat, GST B-Rafcat S728A, or oncogenic RasV12 (vRas) (14.Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T. Nature. 1994; 371: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and fractionated into membrane (M) and cytosolic (C) fractions. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the B-Rafcat and B-Rafcat S728A proteins were detected with a GST antibody (left panel), and vRas was detected with a Ras monoclonal antibody (right panel). The expressed vRas protein migrates as a doublet. A representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined whether the failure to induce oocyte maturation was due to the S728A mutation rendering the B-Rafcat S728A protein catalytically inactive. Suprisingly, the GST B-Rafcat S728A mutant protein possessed 45.3% (± 7.1 S.E.; n = 3) of the specific in vitro kinase activity of GST B-Rafcat (Fig.3, upper panel) when the relative catalytic activities are normalized for GST fusion protein expression (Fig. 3, lower panel). Thus, despite possessing significant in vitro catalytic activity the GST B-Rafcat S728A protein failed to effectively activate downstream effectorsin vivo (Fig. 2). Because equivalent levels of GST B-Rafcat and GST B-Rafcat S728A were expressed (Fig. 3, lower panel), the differential ability to exert a biological effect cannot be attributable to a decreased stability of the mutant protein. When the analogous 14-3-3 interaction site mutation was made in the Raf-1 enzyme (changing serine 621 to alanine) the Rafcat S621A protein was essentially inactive (7% Rafcat activity) consistent with an earlier report (40.Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the GST Rafcat and GST Rafcat S621A proteins were expressed to significantly higher levels than the GST B-Rafcat and GST B-Rafcat S728A proteins (Fig. 3, lower panel). These results are consistent with earlier findings (41.Pritchard C.A. Samuels M.L. Bosch E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6430-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) in which the isolated Rafcat, despite being oncogenic, has a lower specific activity than the isolated B-Rafcat. Because the catalytic domain of B-Raf S728A appears to possess in vitro catalytic activity but fails to activate MEK in vivo or to elicit a biological response, we wished to determine whether the S728A mutation in the context of the full-length protein would exert a dominant inhibitory influence on progesterone-stimulated oocyte maturation. As can be seen in Fig.4 A, expression of GST B-Raf slightly potentiated progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. Expression of an equivalent level of GST B-Raf S728A, however, dramatically attenuated progesterone-induced maturation when compared with control RNA-injected oocytes (66.7% inhibition of maturation ± 4.6 S.E.;n = 3). Consistent with the effect on maturation, expression of GST B-Raf S728A protein significantly reduced the activation of endogenous MEK and MAP kinase in response to progesterone (Fig. 4 B). To demonstrate that the expression of GST B-Rafcat S728A is not simply cytotoxic to oocytes, we stimulated maturation with cyclin B protein (42.Freeman R.S. Ballantyne S.M. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1713-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cyclin B protein induced maturation in either the absence (83% maturation, 60 oocytes scored) or presence of co-expressed GST B-Rafcat S728A (80% maturation, 60 oocytes scored). When protein lysates were prepared from these oocytes, cyclin B-mediated MAP kinase activation was fully induced in the GST B-Rafcat S728A expressing oocytes, although we did observed some attenuation of MEK activation (Fig. 4 B). These findings demonstrate that expression of GST B-Raf S728A specifically attenuates progesterone-induced oocyte maturation. To examine the effect of the B-Raf S728A mutation in a cellular context in which B-Raf is normally expressed, PC12 cells were transiently co-transfected with GST-tagged forms of B-Rafcat or B-Rafcat S728A and a β-galactosidase reporter construct. The transfected cells were scored for differentiation in response to expression of GST B-Rafcat or GST B-Raf S728A. Differentiation was scored as the number of blue staining (transfected) cells with neurite extensions of greater than 2 cell diameters. As can be seen in Fig. 5, expression of GST B-Rafcat induced PC12 cell differentiation. By contrast, expression of the 14-3-3 binding mutant GST B-Rafcat S728A protein had dramatically reduced ability to induce PC12 differentiation (4.7% differentiation ± 1.9 S.E.; n = 3). The expressed GST B-Rafcat and GST B-Rafcat S728A proteins were partially purified from PC12 cell lysate using glutathione-Sepharose. GST Western blotting confirmed that equivalent levels of each protein were expressed in these experiments (data not shown), suggesting that the differential effects on"

Several additional amino acids in helix 4 of the PPARγLBD were defective with respect to CBP recruitment, but retained relatively normal SRC-1 recruitment.

Mechanisms that confer the specificity for the nuclear receptor-coactivator interaction have become a central focus of investigation in this field.

Here, we identified the LBD residues of PPARγ that are required for both CBP and SRC-1 binding; in addition, we also identified several amino acids that differentially affect binding to CBP and SRC-1. These results suggest that certain residues within the LBD of nuclear receptors have an important role in mediating functional specificity by allowing for differential interactions with individual coactivators.

Each well was transfected with 20 ng of hPPARγ/GR plasmid, 40 ng of GR-responsive reporter gene MMTV/luciferase and 25 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector for the control of transfection efficiency. After 6 h, cells were treated with compound C at the concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 μm. Cell lysate was produced 48 h later using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Extracts from COS1 cells expressing transfected hPPARγ/GR were used for radioligand binding assay using3H-labeled compound B (19.Berger J.

The binding site of a 14-amino acid CBP peptide, containing an LXXLL motif, was mapped by comparison of NMR spectra of the PPARγ LBD in the presence and absence of the peptide. In both spectra the PPARγ LBD was bound to a potent known agonist (compound A) (19.Berger J. Bailey P. Biswas C. Cullinan C.A. Doebber T.W. Hayes N.S. Saperstein R. Smith R.G. Leibowitz M.D. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The most significant perturbation of the spectra observed in the presence of CBP peptide was a reduction in intensity or disappearance of a specific set of peaks. However, the majority of the peaks remained relatively unchanged in position and intensity indicating that peptide binding results in only a local perturbation of the structure. Fig.1 A illustrates four representative peaks that were assigned to a six-residue stretch of the protein. The position and intensity of a peak corresponding to Val-307 was essentially unchanged by CBP peptide binding, whereas that corresponding to Asp-310 was attenuated significantly and those corresponding to Leu-311 and Asn-312 were no longer observable after addition of peptide. The most likely explanation for these results is a broadening and signal loss due to chemical exchange of the peptide on and off the protein. The perturbed peaks can be used to map the location of the binding site of the CBP peptide onto the three-dimensional structure of the PPARγ LBD as determined by x-ray crystallography. Fig. 1 B illustrates the mapping of the perturbed cross-peaks onto a ribbon diagram of the PPARγ LBD. The perturbed residues form a contiguous surface formed by residues from helices 3, 4, 5, and 12. Based on the NMR differential map, each of 20 perturbed amino acids was replaced with the neutral and small amino acid, alanine. Thr-297 and Val-307, which were not associated with an observed NMR peak shift, were chosen as control in this study. Each mutant was examined for its function in four assays: agonist-induced coactivator interaction, ligand binding (22.Berger J. Leibowitz M.D. Doebber T.W. Elbrecht A. Zhang B. Zhou G. Biswas C.

The data in Table I can be used to classify the mutants into four groups. The first group, including V293A, Q294A, E295A, T297A, E298A, V307A, D310A, Q314A, L317A, L318A, V322A, and Q470A, did not abolish receptor function in all experiments performed. Thus, the chemical shifts of peaks corresponding to these amino acids in differential NMR studies may represent an indirect influence from the surrounding protein structure environment. The second group of mutants, including K301A, V315A, Y320A, L468A, and E471A, abolished the interaction of PPARγ with either CBP or SRC-1in vitro and were associated with deficient transcriptional activation function in cells (Table I and Fig.2). The third group, L311A, N312A, and T316A, selectively abolished PPARγ interaction with CBP but maintained interaction with SRC-1 (Table I and Fig.3).Figure 3Differential interactions of mutant L311A, N312A, and T316A to CBP and SRC-1.

Error barsrepresent the S.D. from duplicate data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fourth group, K319A and L469A, were shown to exhibit substantially defective radioactive ligand binding. Although K319A mutant failed to exhibit significant radioligand binding, at higher ligand concentrations, it was able to bind coactivators in vitroand to mediate transactivation, suggesting that the main effect of this mutation was a relative defect in ligand binding affinity (Fig.4). Thein vitro pull-down assay showed that mutants K301A in helix 3, V315A in helix 4, Y320A in helix 5, and L468A and E471A in helix 12 had completely lost ligand-induced coactivator interaction function, while their radioligand binding abilities were retained (Table I, Figs.2 and 4). With the exception of a single LXXLL motif, the 14-amino acid CBP peptide used in this experiment displayed little similarity with the SRC-1 fragment (from amino acid 568 to 780; containing three LXXLL motifs) used for the pull-down assay. The fact that the group two mutants, which were identified via CBP peptide NMR mapping, abolished PPARγ interactions with both CBP and SRC-1 strongly suggests that these five amino acids are directly involved in the LXXLL motif binding. This is consistent with the recently reported “charge-clamp” model based on PPARγLBD-SRC-1 peptide co-crystal structure (7.Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Thus, Val-315, Tyr-320, and Leu-468 are likely to form the hydrophobic pocket for LXXLL binding. We recently showed that specific nuclear receptors, including PPARγ and the estrogen receptor (ERα), exhibit distinct intrinsic affinities for different coactivators (3.Zhou G. Cummings R. Li Y. Mitra S. Wilkinson H.A. Elbrecht A. Hermes J.D. Schaeffer J.M. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1594-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). LXXLL binding alone fails to offer an explanation for potential differences in the ability of discrete coactivators to interact with a given nuclear receptor LBD. In comparing the ability of individual amino acid mutants to interact with CBP versus SRC-1, we found that L311A, N312A, and T316A, all in helix 4, abolished the ability for CBP binding while retaining a relative (or even enhanced as noted with T316A) ability for SRC-1 binding (Table I and Fig. 3), strongly suggesting that Leu-311, Asn-312, and Thr-316 in helix 4 are involved in determining the specificity of coactivator recruitment by PPARγ. It has been shown recently that amino acids COOH-terminal to the second LXXLL motif of SRC-1 may dictate the selection of different nuclear receptors as preferred partners (17.McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). According to the LXXLL charge clamp interaction model, amino acids located COOH-terminal to the LXXLL motif would be placed in proximity to PPARγ amino acids in helix 4. Thus site-directed mutagenesis experiments, which have been performed with either nuclear receptor (present studies) or coactivator (17.McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), point toward a unified conclusion: that, in addition to the crucial role of the LXXLL motif-LBD interaction, interactions involving other coactivator and LBD residues are an important determinant of nuclear receptor-coactivator specificity. These results therefore suggest the following model for specific interactions between nuclear receptors and distinct coactivators. Ligand-induced conformational change (stabilized conformation) creates a binding surface for coactivators.2 The coactivator LXXLL motif is orientated via a charge clamp formed by a conserved lysine residue and a glutamate residue such that LXXLL binding forms a bridge between helix 12 and helix 3. As a result, two additional interactions follow: (a) first, side chains of leucine residues are allowed to pack into a hydrophobic pocket formed by helices 3, 4, 5, and 12 (including Val-315, Tyr-320, and Leu-468); (b) second, the interaction between amino acids COOH-terminal to LXXLL motif in the coactivator and LBD residues in helix 4 (including Leu-311, Asn-312, and Thr-316 in PPARγ) takes place. This second interaction, which determines the specificity, is also required for nuclear receptor function."

https://openalex.org/W2022603931,"This paper explores the possibility that neutrophil-derived DNA interferes with the inhibition of neutrophil cathepsin G (cat G) and proteinase 3 by the lung antiproteinases α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI), α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), and mucus proteinase inhibitor (MPI). A 30-base pair DNA fragment (30bpDNA), used as a model of DNA, tightly binds cat G (K d, 8.5 nm) but does not react with proteinase 3, α1PI, ACT, and MPI at physiological ionic strength. The polynucleotide is a partial noncompetitive inhibitor of cat G whoseK i is close to K d. ACT and α1PI are slow binding inhibitors of the cat G-30bpDNA complex whose second-order rate constants of inhibition are 2300 m−1 s−1 and 21 m−1 s−1, respectively, which represents a 195-fold and a 3190-fold rate deceleration. DNA thus renders cat G virtually resistant to inhibition by these irreversible serpins. On the other hand, 30bpDNA has little or no effect on the reversible inhibition of cat G by MPI or chymostatin or on the irreversible inhibition of cat G by carbobenzoxy-Gly-Leu-Phe-chloromethylketone. The polynucleotide neither inhibits proteinase 3 nor affects its rate of inhibition by α1PI. These findings suggest that cat G may cause lung tissue destruction despite the presence of antiproteinases.

Their azurophil granules, which participate in phagocytosis, store a number of hydrolytic enzymes including elastase, cat G,1 and proteinase 3, three serine proteinases whose tertiary structure has been elucidated recently. These 25–30-kDa glycoproteins contain a large number of basic amino acid residues that are responsible for their cationic character. Their specificity is directed against small aliphatic amino acid residues (elastase and proteinase 3) or more bulky ones (cat G).In vitro, these enzymes are able to cleave lung extracellular matrix proteins such as elastin, collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. They also cause extensive lung tissue damage in the animal (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Ideally, digestion of phagocytosed material should take place within the neutrophil in a phagocytic vacuole filled with the above proteinases. Actually, however, part of the lysomal enzymes reaches the extracellular space as a result of incomplete closure of the phagolysosome or of frustrated phagocytosis of large particules. In addition, neutrophils are short lived cells that release the bulk of their proteinases when they die at sites of inflammation. Tissues are normally protected against these enzymes by a number of proteinase inhibitors. For example, lung secretions contain at least three antiproteinases, namely α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI), α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), and mucus proteinase inhibitor (MPI) (2.Tegner H. Acta Oto-laryngol. 1978; 85: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 53-kDa α1PI and the 68-kDa ACT are glycoproteins synthesized in the liver and transported into the lung via the blood circulation. They belong to the serpins, a superfamily of proteins that have developed by divergent evolution over 500 million years. The serpins have a highly conserved secondary structure comprising nine α-helices and three β-sheets with a very flexible reactive site loop. They form denaturant-stable complexes with their target proteinases and behave kinetically like irreversible inhibitors. This irreversible binding is due to the formation of a nonhydrolyzable acyl-enzyme adduct between the serine residue of the enzyme's active site and the P1 residue of the serpin. The P1 residues of α1PI and ACT are Met and Leu, respectively (3.Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Landes R.G. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. Springer, New York1996Google Scholar). α1PI inhibits the three aforementioned proteinases, whereas ACT reacts only with cat G. The second-order rate constants for these serpin-proteinase associations range from 105 to 107m−1 s−1 (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). MPI is a 11.7-kDa basic protein synthesized and secreted by bronchial epithelial cells. It is formed of a single chain of 107 amino acid residues organized in two domains of similar size and architecture. It has a Leu residue at the P1 position of its reactive center. MPI belongs to the class of canonical inhibitors that have a rigid reactive site loop that forms a reversible “lock and key” complex with the target proteinase. This complex is stabilized by a large number of noncovalent bonds, which account for the high enzyme-inhibitor affinity (4.Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). MPI is a tight binding reversible inhibitor of elastase (K i, 32 pm (5.Cadène M. Boudier C. Daney de Marcillac G. Bieth J.G.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9540-9548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of their ability to cleave lung extracellular matrix proteinsin vitro, neutrophil proteinases are thought to cause tissue destruction in inflammatory lung diseases. This raises, however, the following question: why does proteolysis occur despite the presence of the aforementioned inhibitors? Oxidative inactivation of proteinase inhibitors, transient excess of proteinase over inhibitor, and close neutrophil/matrix contact are conditions that favor proteolysis in the presence of inhibitors (1.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Binding of proteinases to DNA released from neutrophils following cell death may also promote proteolysis in an inhibitory environment. We have recently shown that polynucleotides bind neutrophil elastase and impair its inhibition by MPI and α1PI (8.Belorgey D. Bieth J., G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9.Belorgey D. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16416-16422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we study the influence of neutrophil DNA on the inhibition of neutrophil cat G and proteinase 3 by α1PI, ACT, and MPI. To this end, we use a 30-base pair DNA fragment (30bpDNA) as a handy model of DNA. Human neutrophil cat G was isolated and active site titrated as described previously (10.Boudier C. Holle C. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10256-10258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human neutrophil proteinase 3 and human plasma ACT were purchased from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). Human recombinant α1PI and MPI were obtained through the courtesy of Dr. H.P. Schnebli, Novartis, Switzerland. α1PI and MPI were active site titrated with elastase (11.Bruch M. Bieth J.G. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas ACT was titrated with cat G (12.Duranton J. Adam C. Bieth J .G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11239-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Proteinase 3 was titrated with α1PI (7.Rao N. Wehner N. Marshall B. Gray W. Gray B. Hoidal J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9540-9548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human pancreatic DNase I (Pulmozyme, Genentech, San Francisco, CA) was obtained from the Pharmacy of the University Hospital of Strasbourg. Thep-nitroanilide and the thiobenzylester substrates came from Bachem (Switzerland) and E.S.P. (Livermore, CA), respectively. Stock solutions of the substrates and of 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (Sigma) were made in dimethylformamide (final concentration, 2% (v/v)). Z-Gly-Leu-Phe CH2Cl and chymostatin came from E.S.P. and Sigma, respectively. All experiments were done at 25 °C in 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, a solution called the buffer. The bronchial secretions from cystic fibrosis patients were used as a source of neutrophil DNA. The viscous fluids were incubated for 3 h at 50 °C with 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma), 20 μg/ml RNase (Sigma), and 5 mm EDTA. DNA was then extracted using phenol:chloroform:isoamylic alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol (13.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The pellet was then dissolved in the buffer (2 mg/ml) and reacted with 290 nm DNase for 90 min at 25 °C. After heating for 5 min at 65 °C, the mixture was chromatographed on a 12 HR 10/30 Superose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), calibrated with the pBr 322 plasmid previously digested with HaeIII (14.Früh H. Kostoulas G. Michel B.A. Baici A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The fractions containing DNA fragments of about 30 base pairs (M r 20,000) were collected and concentrated. The purity was checked using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Phastsystem, Phast Gel 20 and DNA silverstaining kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sepharose-bound 30bpDNA and MPI were prepared using epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The affinity supports were poured into HR 10/10 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech columns and equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. cat G, proteinase 3, α1PI, and ACT were dissolved in this buffer at a concentration of 0.2–0.3 mg/ml, loaded on the Sepharose-30bpDNA column and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Protein elution was followed at 280 nm.30bpDNA (20 μg/ml) was dissolved in the above buffer and chromatographed on the Sepharose-MPI column. NaCl gradient elution was followed at 260 nm. Fluorescent labeling of cat G was done by reacting 1 mol of cat G with 10 mol of 5-(4, 6-dichlorotriazinyl)aminofluorescein (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 0.2 m carbonate buffer, pH 8.4. After 15 min of continuous stirring at room temperature, labeled cat G was isolated using a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with a buffer formed of 50 mm Hepes and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Constant concentrations of labeled cat G were mixed with increasing concentrations of 30bpDNA, and the fluorescence intensity of the mixtures was determined with a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectrofluorimeter (λex, 495 nm; λem, 514 nm) The data were fitted to Equation 1 by nonlinear regression analysis, which gave the best estimate of K d and its confidence interval.

The inhibition of cat G by30bpDNA was monitored using a synthetic substrate as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The inhibition of 30 nmproteinase 3 by concentrations of 30bpDNA up to 1 μm was assessed using 2 mmmethoxysuccinyl-Lys(2pico)-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA (14.Früh H. Kostoulas G. Michel B.A. Baici A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The effect of 30bpDNA on the elastolytic activity of these two proteinases was tested using Remazol Brilliant Blue elastin as described previously (8.Belorgey D. Bieth J., G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The final concentration of the proteinases was 0.5 μm. One single concentration of30bpDNA (15 μm) was used in replicate assays. Rate constants of inhibition were measured by adding cat G ± 30bpDNA to a mixture of inhibitor + substrate ± 30bpDNA and recording the release of product as a function of time. When the progress curves lasted for more than 10 min, an ordinary spectrophotometer (Uvikon 941, Kontron) was used to record them. When the reaction was terminated in 2 min or less the Uvikon spectrophotometer was equipped with a SFA-11 fast mixing accessory (High-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK). When faster reactions were followed, mixing of the reagents and data acquisition were performed with a PQ/SF-53 stopped flow apparatus (High Tech Scientific). All experiments were done under pseudo-first-order conditions, that is [I]o ≥ 10[E]o. The concentration of product at the end of the inhibition experiments was always lower than 5% of the initial substrate concentration so that the latter was virtually not depleted during the inhibition process. Under these two conditions the progress curves describing the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of substrate in the presence of irreversible inhibitors such as ACT, α1PI, or Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CH2Cl may be described by Equation 2 (15.Bieth J.G.

The progress curves were fitted to Equation 2by nonlinear least square analysis to obtain the best estimates ofk. The variation of k as a function of inhibitor or substrate concentration was analyzed assuming either that the inhibition conforms to a simple bimolecular reaction E +I →kass EI or that it takes place in two-steps.

Two-step inhibition does not, however, necessarily yield a hyperbolic dependence of k versus[I]o; if the largest [I]o used is significantly lower than K i*(1 + [S]o/K m), Equation 5 reduces to k =k 2[I]o/K i*(1 + [S]o/K m), a linear equation that resembles Equation 4. The progress curves for the inhibition of 30bpDNA-bound cat G by the reversible inhibitors MPI and chymostatin may be described by Equation 6 (15.Bieth J.G.

The variation of k as a function of inhibition concentration was analyzed assuming one-step inhibition: E+I ⇌kdisskass EIEquation 7 for which k is given by: k=kass[I] o1+[S] o/Km+kdissEquation 8 One volume of a buffered solution of cat G ± 30bpDNA was mixed with an equal volume of a continuously stirred suspension of Remazol Brilliant Blue elastin ± α1PI ±30bpDNA. While stirring was continued at 37 °C, 0.5-ml aliquots were withdrawn after given periods of time and diluted with 0.5 ml of 0.75 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0, to stop the reaction. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the absorbances were read at 595 nm. The absorbances of appropriate controls were substrated. The buffer was 50 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The final reactant concentrations were: cat G = α1PI = 1 μm, 30bpDNA = 2 μm, elastin = 3 mg/ml. Fig.1 A shows that at low ionic strength (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) Sepharose-30bpDNA binds ACT and cat G but does not significantly bind α1PI. MPI was weakly bound and was eluted with a low NaCl concentration (not shown). Whereas cat G was tightly bound to the affinity support, ACT was eluted at a NaCl concentration lower than that contained in the buffer used for the enzyme kinetic assays, namely 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The weak binding of ACT to the affinity column is not surprising, because ACT is known as a DNA-binding protein whose binding domain has been identified recently (17.Naidoo N. Cooperman B.S. Wang Z.M. Liu X.Z. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14548-14555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To further confirm the weak binding of MPI to the polynucleotide, we have chromatographed 30bpDNA on a Sepharose-MPI column. Fig.1 B shows that the polynucleotide elutes from this column with a NaCl concentration of about 100 mm. Thus, cat G is the only protein that binds 30bpDNA in the aforementioned buffer. In an attempt to quantitate the cat G-30bpDNA affinity we have measured the effect of polynucleotide concentration on the fluorescence intensity of fluorescently labeled cat G. Fig.2 A shows that this intensity decreases up to a limiting value F min. Fig.2 B is a replot of these data in accordance with Equation 1from which K d, the equilibrium dissociation constant of the cat G-30bpDNA complex, was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. K d was found to be 8.5 ± 3.2 nm. Reaction of constant amounts of cat G with increasing amounts of 30bpDNA resulted in partial inhibition of the enzymatic activity on Suc-Ala2-Pro-Phe-pNA, whether the enzyme concentration was low (24 nm) or high (300 nm) (Fig. 3). When the inhibition of 24 nm cat G was measured using different substrate concentrations, similar results were obtained (data not shown). Partial inhibition may be analyzed using the scheme adapted from Ref. 18.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar, E+S ⇌Km ES →kcat E+P ++ I IKi⥯⥯αKi EI+S ⇌αKmEIS →βkcat EI+PEquation EScheme_1 where E, S, and I stand for enzyme, substrate, and 30bpDNA, respectively,K i is the inhibition constant and α and β are dimensionless numbers. The inhibition is said to be partially competitive if ∞ > α > 1 and β = 1 and partially noncompetitive if α = 1 and 0 < β < 1 (18.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). To decide between these two mechanisms we have measured the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of Suc-Ala2-Pro-Phe-pNA by free cat G to getk cat and K m and by30bpDNA-saturated cat G to obtain βk cat and αKm . The following constants were found: k cat, 3.1 ± 0.3 s−1; βk cat, 1.4 ± 0.1 s−1; K m, 2.5 ± 0.2 mm; αKm , 2.8 ± 0.2 mm. Thus, α = 1.1 ± 0.2 and β = 0.45 ± 0.09, which strongly suggests partially noncompetitive inhibition, that is 30bpDNA does not alter the binding of Suc-Ala2-Pro-Phe-pNA to the active site of cat G but hinders its breakdown into products. Szedlacsek et al. (19.Szedlacsek S.E. Ostafe V. Serban M. Vlad M.O. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 311-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have derived an equation that allows the estimation of K i from partial tight binding inhibition such as that shown in Fig. 3. This complex equation (not shown) contains five unknown parameters: K i,k cat, K m, α, and β. We have taken the experimentally determined k cat,K m, α, and β terms as known constants of Szedlacsek's equation to calculate K i by nonlinear regression analysis. With the data collected with 24 nm cat G in Fig. 3, K i was 6.7 ± 0.5 nm,whereas with cat G, 300 nm, K i = 11 ± 5 nm. These figures are in excellent agreement with the fluorometrically measured equilibrium dissociation constant.30bpDNA also partially inhibited the activity of cat G on insoluble elastin; the percentage of cat G inhibition was 16.2 ± 4.1. Fig. 4 shows that 30bpDNA sharply depresses the rate constant for the inhibition of cat G by ACT and α1PI. With ACT the maximal decrease was 210-fold, whereas it was 3100-fold in the case of α1PI. The inhibition of cat G by ACT was also tested with variable concentrations of full-length DNA (0.5–10 μg/ml). The rate constant decreased 200-fold as with 30bpDNA (data not shown), indicating that 30bpDNA is a valuable model of full-length DNA. To study the influence of substrate concentration on the inhibition of30bpDNA-bound cat G by ACT and α1PI, we used constant concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor (30 nm cat G + 0.5 μm30bpDNA + 0.5 μm ACT or 10 nm cat G + 0.5 μm30bpDNA + 50 μm α1PI) and variable concentrations of Suc-Ala2-Pro-Phe-pNA (0.8–6 mm). We found that 1/k was linearly related to [S]o, as predicted by Equations 4and 5. As shown in Fig. 5, the rate constant for the inhibition of 30bpDNA-bound cat G varies hyperbolically with the ACT concentration, suggesting two-step inhibition. Indeed, the data could be fit to Equation 5 by nonlinear regression analysis. In contrast, the linear variation of k with the α1PI concentrations indicates one-step inhibition. The kinetic constants are reported in Table I together with those collected previously with free cat G (12.Duranton J. Adam C. Bieth J .G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11239-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It can be seen that30bpDNA lowers the second-order rate constant for the inhibition of cat G by ACT and α1PI by a factor of 195 and 3200, respectively.Table IKinetic constants describing the inhibition of neutrophil cat G by ACT and α1PI in the absence and presence of 30bpDNA at pH 7.4 and 25 °CInhibitor30bpDNAInhibition kineticsK i*k 2k 2/K i* or k assms −1m −1 s −1ACTaFrom Duranton et al.

Open table in a new tab The errors on the kinetic parameters are less than 15% (experimental constants) or 30% (calculated constants) and are not reported. Two experiments were run to further illustrate the dramatic effect of30bpDNA on the rate inhibition of cat G by α1PI. First, we have incubated constant concentrations of free or polynucleotide-bound cat G with increasing concentrations of α1PI for 1 h, a time largely sufficient to ensure full inhibition of the free enzyme. The inhibitor yielded a linear inhibition curve with free cat G, whereas the 30bpDNA-cat G complex was fully resistant to inhibition (data not shown). Second, we have studied the influence of 30bpDNA on the inhibition of the elastolytic activity of cat G by α1PI. We have found that α1PI fully inhibited the elastolytic activity of cat G in the absence of 30bpDNA, whereas in the presence of the polynucleotide, there was only 28% inhibition. Fig. 6 shows that the progress curves run in the presence of cat G + MPI ± 30bpDNA are biphasic, as predicted for reversible inhibition (Equation 6). The rate constant of inhibition is linearly related to the MPI concentration, indicating one-step inhibition (Equation 8). The kinetic constants k ass, k diss, and K i were found to be 1.5 × 105m−1 s−1, 1.7 × 10−2 s−1, and 1.2 × 10−7m, respectively. MPI also inhibits free cat G in a one-step reaction characterized by k ass = 1.0 × 105m−1 s−1,k diss = 3.5 × 10−3s−1 and K i = 3.5 × 10−8m. Thus, the polynucleotide has virtually no effect on k ass and moderately increasesk diss and K i. Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CH2Cl is an irreversible cat G inhibitor, whereas chymostatin inhibits the enzyme reversibly (20.Stein R. Strimpler A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2611-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The rates of inhibition were measured using 5–10 nmcat G, 0.5 μm30bpDNA, 0.6 mmSuc-Ala2-Pro-Phe-thiobenzylester, and variable concentrations of inhibitor. For both compounds the rate constant of inhibition k was found to be linearly related to the inhibitor concentration, indicating one-step inhibition. Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CH2Cl inhibited cat G with ak ass of 25 m−1s−1 and 23.9 m−1 s−1in the absence and presence of polynucleotide, respectively. The kinetic parameters for the cat G-chymostatin interaction were found to be: k ass = 2.4 × 104m−1 s−1,k diss = 1.2 × 10−2s−1, in the absence of 30bpDNA andk ass = 1.8 × 104m−1 s−1,k diss = 1.6 × 10−2s−1 in its presence. The polynucleotide does not, therefore, significantly affect the inhibition of cat G by these synthetic inhibitors. Proteinase 3 did not bind to the Sepharose-30bpDNA column even at low ionic strength (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Also, its activity on methoxysuccinyl-lysyl (2-picolinoyl)-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA and on elastin was unaffected by 30bpDNA. On the other hand the polynucleotide did not significantly change its rate of inhibition by α1PI (data not shown). We have explored the possibility that DNA released from neutrophils at sites of inflammation interferes with the inhibition of neutrophil cat G and proteinase 3 by their endogenous inhibitors. A30bpDNA fragment used as a model of DNA was able to tightly bind cat G to form an enzymatically active complex. This complex was almost as active on synthetic substrates and on elastin as free car G and could be easily inhibited by MPI and synthetic cat G inhibitors. In contrast, the 30bpDNA-cat G complex was virtually resistant to inhibition by the two serpins ACT and α1PI. ACT inhibits both free (12.Duranton J. Adam C. Bieth J .G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11239-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and 30bpDNA-bound cat G via a two step reaction (see Eq. 3). The polynucleotide decreases both the affinity of the Michaelis-type complex EI* (K i* increases 42-fold) and the rate constant for its conversion into the final complex EI (k 2 decreases ∼15-fold) (Table I). Whereas α1PI inhibits free cat G in two steps (12.Duranton J. Adam C. Bieth J .G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11239-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it reacts in one step with the 30bpDNA-cat G complex. The value ofk ass (21 m−1s−1) is, however, several orders of magnitude lower than the maximum rate constant for a bimolecular diffusion-controlled reaction (21.Alberty M.L. Hammes G.G. J. Phys. Chem. 1958; 62: 154-159Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It may, therefore, be assumed that the reaction involves an intermediate even if the latter is not seen kinetically. This assumption predicts that the largest inhibitor concentration used (50 μm) must be lower than K i* (1 + [S]o/K m) (see Equation 5). Hence, K i* > 17 μm andk 2 > 3.6 × 10−4s−1. Comparison of these limits withK i* and k 2 previously determined with free cat G (12.Duranton J. Adam C. Bieth J .G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11239-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) indicates that 30bpDNA increases K i* at least 21-fold and decreasesk 2 at least 153-fold. Thus, the dramatic decrease in the rate of inhibition of cat G by ACT and α1PI is due in both cases to an unfavorable effect of30bpDNA on K i* andk 2. We have previously shown that polynucleotides also depress the rate of neutrophil elastase inhibition by α1PI. For instance, tRNA and polydeoxycytosine decrease the second-order rate constant of inhibition by factors of 3 and 31, respectively (9.Belorgey D. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16416-16422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have confirmed these mild effects using 30bpDNA, which depressed the second-order rate constant by a factor of 9 (data not shown). Thus, polynucleotides affect much less the inhibition of elastase by α1PI than that of cat G by α1PI. This is reminiscent of previous findings showing that heparin, another anionic ligand, decreases the rate of inhibition of cat G by α1PI by a factor of 400 (22.Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it lowers the rate of inhibition of elastase by α1PI by a factor of only 5 (23.Faller B. Cadène M. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9230-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DNA and heparin have thus similar effects on the two proteinase/α1PI systems; they enormously decrease the rate of inhibition of cat G but only marginally affect the rate of inhibition of elastase. This difference may be related to differences in the localization of the arginine residues in cat G and elastase. Arginine residues have the potential to form salt bridges with the anionic groups of heparin and DNA. Unlike elastase (24.Bode W. Wei A.Z. Huber R. Meyer E. Travis J. Neumann S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), cat G has three arginine residues in the immediate vicinity of its active site (25.Hof P. Mayr I. Huber R. Korzus E. Potempa J. Travis J. Powers J.C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5481-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As a consequence, heparin or 30bpDNA might bind closer to the active site of cat G than to that of elastase thus causing a more steric hindrance to the access of α1PI in cat G than in elastase. Proteinase 3 is not inhibited by ACT or MPI but is rapidly inactivated by α1PI (k ass = 8 × 106m−1 s−1 (7.Rao N. Wehner N. Marshall B. Gray W. Gray B. Hoidal J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9540-9548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This reaction rate is not altered by 30bpDNA. Thus, the inhibition of the three neutrophil serine proteinases by α1PI is diversely affected by 30bpDNA; cat G almost fully resists inhibition, elastase is inhibited with a moderately reduced rate, and the inhibition of proteinase 3 is not affected at all by the polynucleotide. We believe that our kinetic data have pathological bearing. In chronic bronchitis there is a continuous recruitment of neutrophils in airways. During activation or phagocytosis, neutrophils release part of their cat G, elastase, and proteinase 3 content in airway secretions. In addition, when these short lived cells die in situ they release both their proteinase and DNA content (26.Potter J. Spector S. Matthews L. Lemm J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1969; 99: 909-916PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that DNA forms a tight complex with cat G, and so it renders this proteinase virtually resistant to inhibition by the fast acting serpins α1PI and ACT. Thus, DNA promotes cat G-mediated proteolysis of lung matrix proteins in an inhibitory environment. We thank Synergen and Novartis for the gifts of recombinant α1PI and MPI."
