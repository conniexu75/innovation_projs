These strategies rely on sequence-specific hybridization of the oligonucleotide to mRNA or genomic DNA. Recently, it has become clear that oligonucleotides often have biological activities that cannot be attributed to their sequence-specific interactions with nucleic acids. Here we describe a series of guanosine-rich phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides that strongly inhibit proliferation in a number of human tumor cell lines. The presence of G-quartets in the active oligonucleotides is demonstrated using an UV melting technique. We show that G-rich oligonucleotides bind to a specific cellular protein and that the biological activity of the oligonucleotides correlates with binding to this protein. The G-rich oligonucleotide-binding protein was detected in both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and in proteins derived from the plasma membrane of cells. We present strong evidence that this protein is nucleolin, a multifunctional phosphoprotein whose levels are related to the rate of cell proliferation. Our results indicate that binding of G-rich oligonucleotides to nucleolin may be responsible for their non-sequence-specific effects. Furthermore, these oligonucleotides represent a new class of potentially therapeutic agents with a novel mechanism of action.

For this reason they have been considered as promising candidates to realize gene-specific therapies for the treatment of malignant, viral, and inflammatory diseases. Two major strategies of oligonucleotide-mediated therapeutic intervention have been developed, namely the antisense and antigene approaches. The antisense strategy aims to down-regulate expression of a specific gene by hybridization of the oligonucleotide to the specific mRNA, resulting in inhibition of translation (1Gewirtz A.M.

The antigene strategy proposes to inhibit transcription of a target gene by means of triple helix formation between the oligonucleotide and specific sequences in the double-stranded genomic DNA (5Helene C. Giovannangeli C. Guieysse-Peugeot A.L. Praseuth D. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 209: 94-102PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical trials based on the antisense approach are now showing that oligonucleotides can be administered in a clinically relevant way and have few toxic side effects (1Gewirtz A.M. Sokol D.L. Ratajczak M.Z. Blood. 1998; 92: 712-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Agrawal S. Zhao Q. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Whereas both the antisense and antigene strategies have met with some success, it has become clear in recent years that the interactions of oligonucleotides with the components of a living organism go far beyond sequence-specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid. Recent studies and reexamination of early antisense data have suggested that some of the observed biological effects of antisense oligonucleotides cannot be due entirely to Watson-Crick hybridization with the target mRNA. In some cases, the expected biological effect (e.g. inhibition of cell growth or apoptosis) was achieved, but this was not accompanied by a down-regulation of the target protein and was thus unlikely to be a true antisense effect (6White J.R.

Endocrinol. 1998; 157: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In many cases, it was demonstrated that other non-sequence-specific oligonucleotides could exert biological effects that equaled or exceeded the antisense sequence (8Barton C.M. Lemoine N.R. Br. J.

Although there is currently a high awareness among antisense investigators of the importance of appropriate control oligonucleotides, and the necessity of demonstrating inhibition of target protein production (11Stein C.A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the mechanism of non-antisense effects is poorly understood.In particular, phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides containing contiguous guanosines (G) have been repeatedly found to have non-antisense effects on the growth of cells in culture (9Burgess T.L. Fisher E.F. Ross S.L. Bready J.V. Qian Y.X. Bayewitch L.A. Cohen A.M. Herrera C.J. Hu S.S. Kramer T.B. Lott F.D. Martin F.H. Pierce G.F. Simonet L. Farrell C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1997; 88: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There is evidence that this activity is related to the ability of these oligonucleotides to form stable structures involving intramolecular or intermolecular G-quartets (9Burgess T.L. Fisher E.F. Ross S.L. Bready J.V. Qian Y.X. Bayewitch L.A. Cohen A.M. Herrera C.J. Hu S.S. Kramer T.B. Lott F.D. Martin F.H. Pierce G.F. Simonet L. Farrell C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Such structures are thought to play an important role in vivo, and putative quartet-forming sequences have been identified in telomeric DNA (13Sundquist W.I. Klug A. Nature. 1989; 342: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), immunoglobulin switch region sequences (14Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar), human immunodeficiency virus, type I, RNA (15Sundquist W.I. Heaphy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3393-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the fragile X repeat sequences (16Fry M. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4950-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and the retinoblastoma gene (17Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that non-antisense effects may be due to sequestration of intracellular or surface proteins by the oligonucleotide (18Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 19Stein C.A. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 209: 79-89PubMed Google Scholar). For G-rich oligonucleotides that can form folded or G-quartet-containing structures, this binding is not mediated by recognition of the primary sequence of the oligonucleotides but rather of their unique three-dimensional shape. However, the protein targets of these oligonucleotides have not been well characterized.Here we identify a G-rich oligonucleotide-binding protein, and we show that the ability of G-rich oligonucleotides to bind to this protein is correlated with their propensity to form G-quartets, and with their ability to inhibit the growth of tumor cells.DISCUSSIONOligonucleotides are polyanionic species that are internalized in cells, probably by receptor-mediated endocytosis (37Vlassov V.V. Balakireva L.A. Yabukov L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). They are likely to interact with many biomolecules within the cell and also in the extracellular membrane by virtue of both their charge and their shape, as well as sequence-specific interactions with nucleic acids. The proteins that bind to oligonucleotides and mediate non-antisense effects have not yet been unequivocally identified.We have described G-rich oligonucleotides that have potent growth inhibitory effects that are unrelated to any expected antisense or antigene activity. Although we have not yet delineated the mechanism of these effects, we have demonstrated that the antiproliferative effects of these oligonucleotides are related to their ability to bind to a specific cellular protein. Because the GRO-binding protein is also recognized by anti-nucleolin antibodies, we conclude that this protein is either nucleolin itself or a protein of a similar size that shares immunogenic similarities with nucleolin.Nucleolin is an abundant multifunctional 110-kDa phosphoprotein, thought to be located predominantly in the nucleolus of proliferating cells (for reviews, see Refs. 38Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 39Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been implicated in many aspects of ribosome biogenesis including the control of rDNA transcription, pre-ribosome packaging, and organization of nucleolar chromatin (38Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 39Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Another emerging role for nucleolin is as a shuttle protein that transports viral and cellular proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus/nucleolus of the cell (41Kibbey M.C. Johnson B. Petryshyn R. Jucker M. Kleinman H.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 42Lee C.H. Chang S.C. Chen C.J. Chang M.F. J. Biol.

Nucleolin is also implicated, directly or indirectly, in other roles including nuclear matrix structure (44Gotzmann J. Eger A. Meissner M. Grimm R. Gerner C. Sauermann G. Foisner R. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), cytokinesis, and nuclear division (45Léger-Silvestre I. Gulli M.P. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Faubladier M. Sicard H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Gas N. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and as an RNA and DNA helicase (46Tuteja N. Huang N.W. Skopac D. Tuteja R. Hrvatic S. Zhang J. Pongor S. Joseph G. Faucher C. Almaric F. Falasci A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Its multifunctional nature is reflected in its multidomain structure, consisting of a histone-like N terminus, a central domain containing RNA recognition motifs, and a glycine- and arginine-rich C terminus (47Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Levels of nucleolin are known to relate to the rate of cellular proliferation (48Derenzini M. Sirri V. Trere D. Ochs R.L. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 497-502PubMed Google Scholar, 49Roussel P. Hernandez-Verdun D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), being elevated in rapidly proliferating cells, such as malignant cells, and lower in more slowly dividing cells. For this reason, nucleolin may be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of malignant disease.Although considered a predominantly nucleolar protein, our finding that nucleolin was present in the plasma membrane is consistent with several reports identifying cell surface nucleolin and suggesting its role as a cell surface receptor (50Larrucea S. Gonzalez-Rubio C. Cambronero R. Ballou B. Bonay P. Lopez-Granados E. Bouvet P. Fontan G. Fresno M. Lopez-Trascas M. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In this present report, we have identified nucleolin (or a nucleolin-like protein) as a G-rich oligonucleotide-binding protein, and we have shown a strong correlation between binding to this protein and antiproliferative activity for a series of G-rich oligonucleotides. We believe that these findings strongly suggest a mechanistic role for nucleolin in non-antisense inhibition of cell growth by G-rich oligonucleotides. This belief has been strengthened by our recent immunofluorescence experiments that show significant differences in nucleolin levels between cells treated with GRO29A and untreated cells. 2P. J. Bates, N. Vigneswaren, S. D. Thomas, and D. M. Miller, manuscript in preparation.The relationship between nucleolin binding and antiproliferative activity for other, non-G-rich, oligonucleotides has not yet been fully evaluated. One mixed sequence oligonucleotide (MIX1) was found to bind to nucleolin, although it had no growth inhibitory effect. Nucleolin contains RNA binding domains that can recognize specific sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA (29Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 61Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Almaric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 34-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is possible that this particular oligonucleotide contains a sequence or structure that resembles such a recognition element.In support of our findings that nucleolin binds selectively to G-rich oligonucleotides that form stable G-quartet structures, Maizels et al. (62Hanakahi L.A. Sun H. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15906-15912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 63Dempsey L.A. Sun H. Hanakahi L.A. Maizels N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1066-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated binding of purified nucleolin to G-quartet forming DNA sequences from immunoglobulin switch regions and ribosomal DNA. It is likely that nucleolin has currently undefined functions in vivo that depend on recognition of G-quartet forming sequences in ribosomal DNA, switch region sequences, or telomeres.It is our hypothesis that nucleolin contains a specific binding site that recognizes certain G-quartet structures and that binding at this site by a G-rich oligonucleotide inhibits one or more of the normal functions of nucleolin. The consequences of nucleolin inhibition on the growth of cells have not been well studied, but it is easy to envisage that inhibition of a protein whose functions include ribosome production, nuclear transport, and cell entry could have profound effects on the growth of cells. Oligonucleotides have the potential to recognize unique sequences of DNA or RNA with a remarkable degree of specificity. For this reason they have been considered as promising candidates to realize gene-specific therapies for the treatment of malignant, viral, and inflammatory diseases.

DISCUSSIONOligonucleotides are polyanionic species that are internalized in cells, probably by receptor-mediated endocytosis (37Vlassov V.V. Balakireva L.A. Yabukov L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). They are likely to interact with many biomolecules within the cell and also in the extracellular membrane by virtue of both their charge and their shape, as well as sequence-specific interactions with nucleic acids. The proteins that bind to oligonucleotides and mediate non-antisense effects have not yet been unequivocally identified.We have described G-rich oligonucleotides that have potent growth inhibitory effects that are unrelated to any expected antisense or antigene activity. Although we have not yet delineated the mechanism of these effects, we have demonstrated that the antiproliferative effects of these oligonucleotides are related to their ability to bind to a specific cellular protein. Because the GRO-binding protein is also recognized by anti-nucleolin antibodies, we conclude that this protein is either nucleolin itself or a protein of a similar size that shares immunogenic similarities with nucleolin.Nucleolin is an abundant multifunctional 110-kDa phosphoprotein, thought to be located predominantly in the nucleolus of proliferating cells (for reviews, see Refs. 38Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 39Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been implicated in many aspects of ribosome biogenesis including the control of rDNA transcription, pre-ribosome packaging, and organization of nucleolar chromatin (38Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit.

Amalric F. Bouvet P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Another emerging role for nucleolin is as a shuttle protein that transports viral and cellular proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus/nucleolus of the cell (41Kibbey M.C. Johnson B. Petryshyn R. Jucker M. Kleinman H.K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 42Lee C.H. Chang S.C. Chen C.J. Chang M.F. J. Biol.

Nucleolin is also implicated, directly or indirectly, in other roles including nuclear matrix structure (44Gotzmann J. Eger A. Meissner M. Grimm R. Gerner C. Sauermann G. Foisner R. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2645-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), cytokinesis, and nuclear division (45Léger-Silvestre I. Gulli M.P. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Faubladier M. Sicard H.

Pongor S. Joseph G. Faucher C. Almaric F. Falasci A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Its multifunctional nature is reflected in its multidomain structure, consisting of a histone-like N terminus, a central domain containing RNA recognition motifs, and a glycine- and arginine-rich C terminus (47Lapeyre B. Bourbon H. Amalric F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1472-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Levels of nucleolin are known to relate to the rate of cellular proliferation (48Derenzini M. Sirri V. Trere D. Ochs R.L. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 497-502PubMed Google Scholar, 49Roussel P.

For this reason, nucleolin may be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of malignant disease.Although considered a predominantly nucleolar protein, our finding that nucleolin was present in the plasma membrane is consistent with several reports identifying cell surface nucleolin and suggesting its role as a cell surface receptor (50Larrucea S.

We believe that these findings strongly suggest a mechanistic role for nucleolin in non-antisense inhibition of cell growth by G-rich oligonucleotides. This belief has been strengthened by our recent immunofluorescence experiments that show significant differences in nucleolin levels between cells treated with GRO29A and untreated cells. 2P. J. Bates, N. Vigneswaren, S. D. Thomas, and D. M. Miller, manuscript in preparation.The relationship between nucleolin binding and antiproliferative activity for other, non-G-rich, oligonucleotides has not yet been fully evaluated. One mixed sequence oligonucleotide (MIX1) was found to bind to nucleolin, although it had no growth inhibitory effect. Nucleolin contains RNA binding domains that can recognize specific sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA (29Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 61Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Almaric F. Bouvet P. J. Mol.

It is possible that this particular oligonucleotide contains a sequence or structure that resembles such a recognition element.In support of our findings that nucleolin binds selectively to G-rich oligonucleotides that form stable G-quartet structures, Maizels et al.

It is likely that nucleolin has currently undefined functions in vivo that depend on recognition of G-quartet forming sequences in ribosomal DNA, switch region sequences, or telomeres.It is our hypothesis that nucleolin contains a specific binding site that recognizes certain G-quartet structures and that binding at this site by a G-rich oligonucleotide inhibits one or more of the normal functions of nucleolin. The consequences of nucleolin inhibition on the growth of cells have not been well studied, but it is easy to envisage that inhibition of a protein whose functions include ribosome production, nuclear transport, and cell entry could have profound effects on the growth of cells. Oligonucleotides are polyanionic species that are internalized in cells, probably by receptor-mediated endocytosis (37Vlassov V.V. Balakireva L.A. Yabukov L.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Overexpression of catalase in cytosol and in mitochondria was confirmed by Western blot, and activity measurement and stable cell lines were established. The intracellular level of H2O2 induced by exogenously added H2O2 or antimycin A was lower in C33 cell lines overexpressing catalase in the cytosol and mC5 cell lines overexpressing catalase in the mitochondria as compared with Hp cell lines transfected with empty vector. Cell death caused by H2O2, antimycin A, and menadione was considerably suppressed in both the mC5 and C33 cell lines. C33 and mC5 cells were also more resistant to apoptosis induced by H2O2 and to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by H2O2 and antimycin A. In view of the comparable protection by catalase overexpressed in the cytosol versus the mitochondria, catalase produced in both cellular compartments might act as a sink to decompose H2O2 and move diffusable H2O2 down its concentration gradient.

Under normal conditions, 1–2% of the oxygen reduced by mitochondria may be converted to O⨪2 at the NADH dehydrogenase and ubisemiquinone intermediate steps of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (1Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 2Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Superoxide can be readily converted by mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) into H2O2 (3Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18515-18517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The primary cellular enzymatic defense systems against hydrogen peroxide are the glutathione redox cycle and catalase. GSH is a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, which converts H2O2 to H2O at the expense of oxidizing GSH to its disulfide form (GSSG). Glutathione reductase regenerates GSH from GSSG, using reducing equivalents from NADPH (4Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar). Catalase also protects cells from the accumulation of H2O2 by converting it to H2O and O2 (5Michiels C. Raes M. Toussaint O. Remacle J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The glutathione redox cycle system exists in both the cytosol and mitochondrial compartments of the cell. However, catalase is present only or primarily in the peroxisome fraction and is absent in mitochondria of mammalian cells, except rat heart mitochondria (6Radi R. Turrens J.F. Chang L.Y. Bush K.M. Crapo J.D. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22028-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the only enzymatic defense system against hydrogen peroxide in mitochondria is the glutathione redox cycle system. Pathological conditions, which increase the rate of H2O2 production or deplete components of the anti-oxidant system, e.g. GSH, will lead to the accumulation of H2O2 in the cytosol or mitochondria. In biological systems, H2O2 could readily diffuse across cellular membranes and lead to depletion of ATP, GSH, and NADPH. It could also induce a rise in free cytosolic Ca2+ and activate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity and cause DNA damage (7Burdon R.H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). By scission of the peroxide bond through the Fenton reaction, hydrogen peroxide could generate hydroxyl radical, an extremely potent oxidant (5Michiels C. Raes M. Toussaint O. Remacle J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar, 8Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19095-19098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl radical is able to cause the degradation of most biological macromolecules, e.g. peroxidation of lipids, oxidation of sugars and of protein thiols, DNA base damage, and strand breakage of nucleic acids (9Dringen R. Hamprecht B. Brain Res. 1997; 759: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Low levels of H2O2 have been shown to trigger apoptosis, while high levels lead to necrosis (10Lennon S.V.

Many reports indicate that hydrogen peroxide plays a very crucial role in cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by stimuli such as ceramide (12Quillet-Mary A. Jaffrezou J.P. Mansat V. Bordier C.

It might also contribute to human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, stroke, and AIDS dementia complex (16Markesbery W.R. Free Radical Biol.

Studies in our laboratory indicate that CYP 2E1-dependent cytotoxicity or apoptosis by ethanol to HepG2 cells was due to the generation of ROS such as H2O2 (19Chen Q. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23914-23919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are a main target for damage by ROS. Hydrogen peroxide is know to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition and disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ). Such conditions can cause the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, thereby triggering cells to undergo apoptosis by activating caspase 3 (21Tada-Oikawa S. Oikawa S. Kawanishi M. Yamada M. Kawanishi S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). There are no reports on the possible protective actions caused by expression of functionally active catalase in the mitochondrial compartment against toxicity by ROS. In this study, stable HepG2 cell lines that constitutively express catalase in the mitochondrial compartment were developed. The main goal of the present study was to compare the effect of overexpression of human catalase in the cell cytosol to that in the mitochondria on the ability to protect cells from cytotoxicity or apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide and AA. Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), propidium iodide (PI), and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against human catalase was obtained from Calbiochem. Zeocin for cloning selection was from Invitrogen. Hydrogen peroxide, AA, horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG, MEM, fetal bovine serum, and trypan blue were purchased from Sigma. The pCAT10 plasmid containing the human catalase cDNA was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. PZeoSV2(+) mammalian expression vector was obtained from Invitrogen Corporation (San Diego, CA). A 900-base pair fragment containing the MnSOD mitochondrial signal peptide was PCR-amplified with Hin dIII-Sal I ends from pRCMV/MnSOD (22Melendez J.A. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18898-18903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resulting product was inserted into the pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen Corp.). A 1-kilobase pair fragment containing the mitochondrial signal peptide and the CMV promoter region of pCR/CMV plasmid was then removed from the resulting plasmid by digestion with Hin dIII, which cleaves at the newly introduced Hin dIII site and the naturally occurring Hin dIII 3′ site in the MnSOD cDNA. This fragment was ligated into the pZeoSV2(+), precut with Hin dIII. The new PZeoSV-MSP was digested with Bsa I, removing the CMV promoter region, and religated. The final pZeoSV-MSP was then digested with Hin dIII and Not I. The human fibroblast catalase cDNA from pCAT10 was equipped with a Hin dIII site at the 5′ end and a Not I site at the 3′ end with oligonucleotide linkers using PCR. The resulted 1.6-kilobase pair PCR product was ligated in frame into the pZeoSV-MSP to obtain the final recombinant plasmid pZeoSV/MSP-CAT. The mammalian expression vector pZeoSV-CAT was created by inserting the 1.6-kilobase pair catalase fragment into pZeoSV2(+) precut with Hin dIII and Not I. Each DNA insert was sequenced bidirectionally by using the Taq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI model 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). HepG2 cells (from ATCC) were cultured in MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere, in 5% CO2, at 37 °C. Before transfection, 5× 105 HepG2 cells were seeded onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown to 60% confluence. The expression plasmid vectors pZeoSV2(+), pZeoSV2(+) containing human catalase cDNA (pZeoSV-CAT), as well as pZeoSV2(+) containing human catalase cDNA with a MnSOD mitochondrial leader sequence (pZeoSV/MSP-CAT) were transfected into HepG2 cells using the DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded at a low cell density onto 10-cm culture dishes in 10% fetal bovine serum plus MEM containing 300 μg/ml Zeocin. HepG2 cells not subject to transfection were cultured with the same concentration of Zeocin medium as a control for selection. Two weeks after transfection, the surviving clones were isolated, transferred to 24-well plates, and grown to large scale. Catalase expression in each clone was measured by Western blot and assays of activity. Stable cell lines with overexpression of catalase in the cytosol and in the mitochondria, as well as cells transfected with the empty vector, were selected and maintained in MEM containing 300 μg/ml Zeocin. Mitochondria were prepared by discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation using a modification of the method of Sims (23Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Five 10-cm culture dishes of cells grown to 80% confluence were washed twice with PBS, scraped from the dishes, and suspended in 1 ml of cold isolation buffer (0.32 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Cells were homogenized using a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1330 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged at 21,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in a 15% Percoll solution, and aliquots were layered onto discontinuous Percoll gradients (23% over 40%) and then centrifuged for 15 min at 30,700 × g at 4 °C. The dense band of material at the interface between the 23% and 40% Percoll layers was collected, diluted 1:4 in fresh isolation buffer, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,700 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer and centrifuged again for 10 min at 6900 × g. The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 100 μl of PBS and used for Western blot analysis or catalase activity assay. To assay for total cellular catalase protein levels, cells were grown to 80% confluence in 10-cm dishes, washed twice with PBS, harvested by scraping, and subsequently sonicated at duty cycle 50% and output control 4 for 20 s. To assay for mitochondrial catalase protein levels, the intact mitochondria prepared as described above were sonicated (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc.) at duty cycle 30 and output control 3 for 10 s. The sonicated suspensions were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the protein concentration was measured (DC protein assay reagent, Bio-Rad). Ten μg of denatured protein were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-human catalase polyclonal antibody as the primary antibody (1:1000), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) as the second antibody (1:5000). Detection by the chemiluminescence reaction was carried out for 1 min using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by exposure to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Fresh sonicated extracts from cells and mitochondria were used. Catalase activity was determined at 25 °C according to Claiborne and Fridovich (24Claiborne A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4245-4252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase was followed by ultraviolet spectroscopy at 240 nm. The reaction was performed using a solution of 20 mm hydrogen peroxide in 50 mmKH2PO4 containing 10 μg of total cellular or mitochondrial protein in a final volume of 1 ml. Specific activity of catalase was calculated from the equation: specific activity (units/mg of protein/min) = ΔA240 nm (1 min) × 1000/43.6 × mg protein. Fluorescence spectrophotometry and confocal microscopy were used to measure intracellular H2O2, with 2′,7′-DCF-DA as the probe. DCF-DA readily diffuses through the cell membrane and is enzymatically hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases to the nonfluorescent DCFH, which can then be rapidly oxidized to highly fluorescent DCF in the presence of ROS. Cells incubated in medium alone or cells treated with H2O2 or AA were incubated with 5 μm DCF-DA in MEM for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were washed in PBS, trypsinized, resuspended in 3 ml of PBS, and the intensity of fluorescence was immediately read in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer 650-10S, Hitachi, Ltd.) at 503 nm for excitation and at 529 nm for emission. For confocal microscopy, slides with control, non-treated cells or cells treated with H2O2 and DCF-DA were washed in PBS and covered with glass covers, followed by observation under a confocal microscope. Cell viability was measured either by trypan blue exclusion or by vital dye reduction. For menadione toxicity experiments, the cell titer 96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) as described by Chen et al. (25Chen Q. Galleano M. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14532-14541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was used. 1 × 105 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and incubated with medium containing different concentrations of menadione for 18 h. After addition of the “stop” solution, the absorbance of the reaction solution at 570 nm was recorded. The absorbance at 630 nm was used as reference. The net A570 − A630 was taken as the index of cell viability, The net absorbance from the wells of cells cultured with control medium was taken as the 100% viability value. The percentage of viability of the treated cells was calculated by the formula (A570 −A630)sample/(A570 −A630)control × 100. For experiments involving toxicity of H2O2 and AA, cell viability was detected by the trypan blue exclusion assay. 1× 105 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates and first incubated with medium containing 0.3 mm BSO for 16 h, followed by incubation with medium containing 100 μmH2O2 or 15 μm AA. At different time points, cells were trypsinized and diluted followed by staining with 0.2% trypan blue. The number of cells excluding trypan blue or staining with trypan blue were counted under the light microscope. The percentage of cells excluding trypan blue was taken as an index of cell viability. Cell morphology was also visualized under the light microscope, and pictures were taken. The DNA fragmentation pattern (DNA ladder) was carried out by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cells (1× 106) were scraped and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, and 0.5% SDS and incubated for 2 h at 50 °C. DNA was extracted with 1 ml of phenol, pH 8.0, followed by extraction with 1 ml of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and chloroform. The aqueous phase was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at −20 °C overnight. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 13000 × g for 10 min. The pellets were air-dried, resuspended with 50 μl of TE buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, electrophoresed in TAE buffer for 2 h at 50 V, and photographed under UV illumination. DNA analysis by flow cytometry was used to quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells. 5 × 105 cells were seeded onto six-well plates and incubated with medium containing 0.3 mmBSO for 16 h, followed by treatment with 100 μmH2O2. At different time points, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed with PBS, followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet of cells was resuspended in 80% ethanol and stored at 4 °C for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, stained with PI (50 μg/ml), and analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA analysis. Changes in the integrity of the plasma membrane and in the mitochondrial membrane potential were examined by monitoring the cells after double staining with PI and Rh123. Cells (5 × 105) were seeded onto six-well plates and incubated with medium containing 0.3 mm BSO for 16 h followed by treatment with 100 μm H2O2 or 15 μm AA for different times. The cells were then incubated with medium containing 5 μg/ml Rh123 for 1 h. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and resuspended in 1 ml of MEM containing 5 μg of PI. The intensity of fluorescence from PI and Rh123 was analyzed by flow cytometry. Surviving clones of HepG2 cells transfected with the empty plasmid, or plasmid containing human catalase cDNA, or plasmid containing catalase cDNA with a 80-base pair MnSOD mitochondrial leader sequence were assayed for catalase expression by Western blot and catalase catalytic activity. Two high expression cytosol catalase clones (C1 and C33) and two high expression mitochondrial catalase clones (mC5 and mC26) were selected for detailed evaluation. Fig. 1 shows the expression of catalase in the total cell extract (panel a) and in the mitochondrial extract (panel b) from these cells and cells transfected with empty vector (Hp) as well as the parental HepG2 cells as determined by Western blot. Results from densitometric analyses of the intensity of the various bands indicated that the expression of catalase in total cell extracts of cell lines C1, C33, mC5, and mC26 was about 2-fold higher than that in the Hp cells and the parental HepG2 cells. A high amount of catalase was found in the mitochondrial extracts from mC5 and mC26 cells, but very low levels of catalase were present in the mitochondrial extracts from C1, C33, Hp, and parental HepG2 cells. The catalase content in mitochondrial extracts from mC5 and mC26 cells was about 20-fold higher than that in HepG2 cells and at least 5–10-fold higher than the other transfected cell lines. The same results were obtained for the catalase activity assay (Fig. 2). The catalase activity in total extracts of cell lines C1, C33, mC5, and mC26 was 2–3-fold higher than that of the control cell line Hp and parental HepG2 cells. With respect to catalase activity in the mitochondria, high activity was found only in the mitochondrial extracts of cell lines mC5 and mC26. For the experiments shown below, results were compared between C33, mC5, and Hp cell lines, in order to assess the effectiveness of mitochondrially expressed catalase with that of cytosolically expressed catalase in protecting against oxidative stress and cellular toxicity.Figure 2Catalase activity in different transfected clones and parental HepG2 cells. Ten micrograms of protein from cellular extraction (a) or from mitochondrial extraction (b) were used to measure the catalytic activity of catalase. Specific catalase units (units/mg protein/min) were calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Bar 1, HepG2 cells; bar 2, cells transfected with empty vector (Hp); bars 3 and 4, two different clones transfected with catalase (C1, C33); bars 5 and 6, two different clones transfected with catalase with a mitochondria leader sequence (mC5, mC26).

Higher H2O2 levels were detected in Hp cells and HepG2 cells than that found in C33 and mC5 cells after treatment with either 500 μm H2O2 or 15 μm AA for 2 h followed by incubation with 5 μm 2′,7′-DCF-DA for 30 min. Cytosolic and mitochondrial expressed catalase were equally effective in lowering the fluorescence associated with oxidation of DCFH after treatment with either H2O2 or AA. We also analyzed the intracellular level of H2O2 by confocal microscopy after treating cells with 500 μm H2O2for 2 h, followed by incubation with 2′,7′-DCF-DA (Fig.3 B). The intensity of fluorescence in Hp cells was much stronger than that observed for the C33 and mC5 cells. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity induced by the redox cycling agent, menadione. HepG2, Hp, C33, and mC5 cells were treated with different concentrations (0–20 μm) of menadione for 18 h, and the viability of the cells was determined. The percentage of surviving cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and the decrease was similar for the parental HepG2 cells and the Hp cell line (Fig. 4). mC5 cells were more resistant to the cytotoxic effects of menadione than Hp and wild HepG2 cells, and C33 cells were even more resistant. The resistance against menadione toxicity by the mC5 cells was maintained up to menadione concentrations of 15 μm but then decreased at the menadione concentration of 20 μm; C33 cells still showed strong resistance even at 20 μm menadione. A trypan blue exclusion assay was used to detect the cytotoxicity induced by H2O2 and AA. In order to show the maximum protective effects of catalase and to lower the influence of the GSH system, BSO, an inhibitor of the synthesis of glutathione, was used to lower the level of GSH in the cells. Hp, C33, and mC5 cells were pretreated with 0.3 mm BSO for 16 h, followed by incubation with 100 μm H2O2 or 15 μm AA for different times. The number of surviving Hp cells rapidly decreased after 8 h of incubation with 100 μm H2O2, and almost none of the Hp cells were viable after 48 h (Fig.5 a). Both C33 and mC5 cells showed a comparable resistance to the cytotoxic effects of H2O2 as compared with the Hp cells; 60–70% of cells were still viable even after 48 h of treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 5 a). Hp cells were also quite sensitive to toxicity by 15 μm AA, as only 50% of cells were viable after 4 h of treatment while few cells were alive after 12 h (Fig. 5 b). Both C33 and mC5 cells were significantly resistant to the toxicity of AA, with about 85% and 50% of cells viable after 4 and 12 h treatment, respectively (Fig.5 b). There is no significant difference between C33 and mC5 cells in protecting against the toxicity induced by 100 μm H2O2 or 15 μmAA. Essentially similar results were obtained after morphological visualization of the cells under the light microscope (data not shown). Most of the Hp cells lost normal morphology when treated with H2O2 for 24 h or AA for 12 h, whereas the C33 cells and the mC5 cells retained their shape and structure. DNA ladders are believed to be a biochemical marker for apoptosis. The cells were pretreated with 0.3 mm BSO for 16 h, followed by incubation with 100 μmH2O2 for 48 h. The DNA was isolated and electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Hp and parental HepG2 cells showed a clear DNA ladder in response to the H2O2 treatment, whereas no DNA ladder was seen in either the C33 or the mC5 cells (Fig.6). DNA analysis by flow cytometry after staining with PI was used to measure the percentage of apoptotic cells. Hp, C33, and mC5 cells were pretreated with 0.3 mm BSO for 16 h, followed by incubation with 100 μm H2O2 for 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. DNA analysis was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” There were less than 5% apoptotic cells after the BSO treatment for all three cell lines not incubated with the H2O2 (0 h samples) (Fig.7, A, panels a–c, and B, bar graph 2). In the Hp cells, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 17%, 40%, and 48% after 8, 12, and 24 h of treatment with H2O2, respectively (Fig. 7 B, bar graphs 4–6; A, panels d and g show the 8- and 24-h data). The C33 and mC5 cells were resistant to the H2O2-induced apoptosis, e.g. after the 24-h treatment, the percentage of apoptotic cells was 48% in Hp cells and only 17% and 6% in C33 and mC5, cells respectively (Fig. 7, A, panels g–i; B, bar graph 6). Rh123, a lipophilic cation, is selectively taken up by mitochondria, and uptake is directly proportional to mitochondrial Δψ (26Davis S. Weiss M.J. Wong J.R. Lampidis T.J. Chen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13844-13850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Skowronek P. Krummeck G. Haferkamp O. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). PI is imported into cells and binds to cellular DNA when the integrity of the plasma membranes is lost. After incubation with BSO, those Hp, C33, and mC5 cells not treated with H2O2 or AA were predominantly located in the PI-negative and high Δψ (strong Rh123 fluorescence) field (PI(−)-Δψ high) reflective of viable, intact cells (Fig.8, a–c, and insets a–c). A small percentage of cells were located in the (PI(+)-Δψ low) field, reflective of damaged cells (Fig. 8, a–c). Hp cells that were pretreated with 0.3 mmBSO for 16 h followed by incubation with 100 μmH2O2 for 24 h moved to the (PI(−)-Δψ low) and (PI(+)-Δψ low) field, and 67% of the cells displayed low Rh123 intensity (Fig. 8 d, M1 population, compared with 27% of Hp control cells in panel a). However, only 42% and 30% of C33 and mC5 cells treated with H2O2 were present in the Δψ low field, respectively (Fig. 8, e and f). Hp cells incubated with 15 μm AA for 8 h also moved to the (PI(+)-Δψ low) field, and 72% of the cells displayed low Rh123 intensity (Fig. 8 g, M1 population). However, only 29% and 34% of C33 and mC5 cells were present in the Δψ low field, respectively (Fig. 8, h and i). These results indicate that both cytosolic catalase and mitochondrial catalase protected the cells from loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and loss of membrane integrity produced by either H2O2 or AA. Because mitochondria are an important target for interaction with H2O2 and since these organelles lack catalase, we developed a HepG2 cell line that expresses catalase in mitochondria by transferring a plasmid containing catalase cDNA with the peptide leader sequence of MnSOD into HepG2 cells. Western blot and catalase activity assay showed that higher amounts of catalase were present in mitochondria of these cells, compared with mitochondria from cells transfected with plasmid containing only catalase cDNA or cells transfected with empty vector or parental HepG2 cells. Thus, the MnSOD leader sequence could be used to successfully import catalase into mitochondria. Most of the increase in cellular catalase content and activity in the mC5 (and in mC26) clones is due to the expression of catalase in the mitochondrial fraction of these cells with just a small increase in cytosolic catalase. Intracellular hydrogen peroxide generation induced by exogenous H2O2 or AA was suppressed by cytosolic catalase and by mitochondrial catalase. In general, the overexpression of cytosolic and mitochondrial catalase was equally effective in lowering DCF-DA fluorescence induced by exogenous H2O2or by AA. The overexpression of catalase in the cytosol and mitochondria protected the cells from cytotoxicity caused by menadione. Comparing C33 and mC5 cells, the cytosol catalase showed stronger protective effect than the mitochondria catalase at higher menadione concentrations. However, comparable protection against menadione toxicity was observed in the C1 and mC26 clones (data not shown). Cytosolic catalase and mitochondrial catalase equally protected cells from cytotoxicity induced by H2O2 and AA. Mitochondrial catalase was protective against exogenously added H2O2, which suggests that some of the added H2O2 diffuses into the mitochondria and perhaps damage to the mitochondria is an important factor contributing to H2O2 toxicity. Similarly, cytosolic catalase was protective against AA-induced H2O2production and toxicity, which suggests that mitochondrially produced H2O2 diffuses into the cytosol where it may exert cytotoxic action. It would appear that catalase produced in any cellular compartment might act as a sink for H2O2 and promote H2O2movement down its concentration gradient. There are reports that catalase added to the culture medium might protect cells against oxidant-induced injury; while this may reflect some uptake of catalase into the cells by endocytosis, it may also reflect the removal of diffusable H2O2 from the cell. Under physiological conditions, H2O2 may play an important role in signal transduction pathways (28Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Teng K.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (29Piette J. Piret B. Bonizzi G. Schoonbroodt S. Merville M.P. Legrand-Poels S. Bours V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1237-1245PubMed Google Scholar). However, under pathogenic conditions, H2O2 can produce apoptosis or necrosis (30Matsura T. Kai M. Fujii Y. Ito H. Yamada K. Free Radical Res. 1999; 30: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Teramoto S. Tomita T. Matsui H. Ohga E. Matsuse T. Ouchi Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 79: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells pretreated with BSO followed by exposure to 100 μm H2O2 could undergo apoptosis as a DNA ladder was detected in parental HepG2 and Hp cells after 48 h of incubation. Consistent with the protection afforded by cytosolic or mitochondrial catalase, a DNA ladder was not detected in the C33 and mC5 cells under the same conditions. Flow cytometry DNA analysis showed that 48% of Hp cells were in the apoptotic zone after incubation with BSO and 100 μmH2O2 for 24 h. However, only 17% and 6% percent apoptotic cells were detected in C33 and mC5 cells, respectively, under the same conditions. Thus both mitochondrial catalase and cytosolic catalase protect HepG2 cells from apoptosis induced by H2O2. It is also likely that some of the H2O2 toxicity may be necrotic in nature; for example, a DNA ladder was observed at 48 h but not at 24 h after treatment with 100 μmH2O2, yet 75% of Hp cells lost their viability at 24 h (Fig. 5). It would appear that cytosolic and mitochondrial catalase can protect against the apoptotic and the necrotic effects of H2O2. Mitochondria permeability transition (MPT) and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) are markers for mitochondrial damage and dysfunction (32Lemasters J.J. Qian T. Elmore S.P. Trost L.C. Nishimura Y.

We determined the mitochondrial membrane potential in Hp, C33, and mC5 cells pretreated with 0.3 mm BSO followed by incubation with either 100 μmH2O2 or 15 μm AA. The decline in Δψ caused by these agents was much less in C33 and mC5 cells than the Hp cells. These results suggest that both cytosolic catalase and mitochondrial catalase protected cells from oxidant-induced loss of mitochondrial potential, which may play an important role in the overall protection against oxidant-induced cytotoxicity. Both bcl-2 and bcl-xL prevent cell death by inhibiting the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and by inhibiting the release of cytochrome C or other apoptotic-inducing factors from mitochondria to cytosol (39Vander Heiden M.G.

These experiments demonstrate that protection of mitochondria might be an important target for prevention against oxidative injury. Overexpression of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase in mitochondria was much more effective than overexpression in the cytosol of RBL-2H3 cells in protecting from oxidative injury (45Arai M.

We found that cytosolic and mitochondrial catalase were equally effective in preventing loss of Δψ and loss of cellular viability. Perhaps one advantage of catalase over the GSH-glutathione peroxidase system in these actions is the lack of requirement for recycling of GSH and consumption of NADPH and perhaps avoiding the accumulation of GSSG and mixed protein disulfides. In summary, the present study suggests that mitochondria are an important target for oxidative damage and that both catalase in cytosol and catalase in mitochondria are capable of protecting HepG2 cells against cytotoxicity or apoptosis induced by oxidative stress."

The six β4Gal-Ts have highly conserved sequence motifs in the putative catalytic domain including four conserved cysteine residues.

This suggests that these genes arose late in evolutionary terms as a result of gene duplication and subsequent sequence divergence. Detailed analysis of the kinetic properties of these enzymes clearly show that each has a distinct function in biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures, but in accordance with their close evolutionary relationships the linkages formed are similar. In the present study, a seventh homologue of the β4Gal-T gene family was characterized. The gene was identified by sequence analysis of the EST data base. The coding region of the novel gene, designated β4Gal-T7, exhibited distinct substitutions in the sequence motifs highly conserved among β4Gal-T1 to β4Gal-T6. Notably, none of the four cysteines conserved among other β4Gal-Ts were found in the β4Gal-T7 sequence. It was predicted that the enzymatic properties of β4Gal-T7 were different from other β4Gal-Ts. Analysis of the substrate specificity of recombinant β4Gal-T7 revealed that this enzyme formed the Galβ1-4Xylβ1-R linkage found in the linkage region of proteoglycans (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser). β4Gal-T7 was proposed to encode a galactosyltransferase I (xylosylprotein β1,4-galactosyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.133) gene (11Schwartz N.B.

As a consequence of the enzyme deficiency, only about half of the core proteins of the small proteoglycans decorin and biglycan were linked with glycosaminoglycan chains (16Kresse H. Rosthoj S.

Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We sequenced the β4Gal-T7 coding region of DNA from fibroblasts established from this patient and his family. Two alleles, β4Gal-T7186D and β4Gal-T7206P, were identified in the affected patient, and each allele was shown to be derived from different parents. Expression of the variant alleles showed that one exhibited a significantly higher Km for the donor substrate and the other was inactive. The results show that β4Gal-T7 represents one galactosyltransferase I that is involved in proteoglycan synthesis. Identification of the molecular basis of the genetic defect in the progeroid patient with signs of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome opens the possibility of further studies on the role of this gene in progeroid syndromes and connective tissue disorders. tBLASTn analysis of the dbEST data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) with sequences from human β4Gal-T1 to β4Gal-T6, performed as described previously (4Almeida R.

Additional sequence was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends with a fetal brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) using antisense primer EBER1218 (5′-CTGAAGTGGTCCACCTGGTTG-3′) and sequencing on PAC genomic DNA. ESTs from β4Gal-T7 are represented in two Unigene clusters, Hs.54702 and Hs.45208, where the latter originate from priming in the second intron of the five introns identified in β4Gal-T7. Hs.45208 was mapped to 5q35.1–5q35.3 and was flanked by D5S498 and D5S408 (stSG40105, 184.7–195.8 cM). The complete compiled cDNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing of a PAC genomic DNA clone. A human PAC genomic library (Genome Systems) was screened using the primer pairs EBER1207 (5′-CAGAGAACGGGTCTGTCACAGG-3′) and EBER1215 (5′-GATGTGGTGCCGGATCTTCTT-3′). Three clones for β4Gal-T7 (99/C24, 143/B4, and 222/H10) were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. Intron/exon boundaries were determined by comparison with the cDNA sequence, optimizing for the gt/ag rule (17Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). Expression constructs designed to encode the full coding sequence and a secreted construct encoding amino acid residues 63–327 of β4Gal-T7 were prepared by reverse transcription-PCR with fetal brain mRNA. Products were cloned initially into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and subsequently into pVL1393 or pAcGP67 (Pharmingen). Expression constructs of β4Gal-T7 variants were prepared similarly using mRNA from fibroblasts of a patient with galactosyltransferase I deficiency (14Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Plasmids pVL-β4Gal-T7-full and pAcGP67-β4Gal-T7-sol were co-transfected with Baculo-GoldTM DNA (Pharmingen) and virus amplified as described previously (18Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol.

(see Table I for structures). The full-length construct was assayed with 1% Triton X-100 homogenates of cells twice washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Assays for determination of Km for the acceptor substrates were performed with semi-purified enzyme in the standard reaction mixture modified to include 200 μm UDP-[14C]-Gal for β4Gal-T7 and 400 μm for β4Gal-T7186D.

For product characterization 5 mg of MeUmb-β-Xylose were glycosylated to completion with semipurified β4Gal-T7, using thin layer chromatography to monitor reaction progress. The reaction product was purified on an octadecyl-silica cartridge (Bakerbond, J. T. Baker), deuterium exchanged by repeated lyophilization from D2O, and then dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O for NMR analysis. One-dimensional 1H NMR, two-dimensional1H-1H TOCSY, and 1H-detected,13C-decoupled, phase-sensitive gradient13C-1H HSQC and HMBC experiments were performed as described previously (Ref. 20Schwientek T. Nomoto M. Levery S.B. Merkx G. van Kessel A.G. Bennett E.P. Hollingsworth M.A. Clausen H. J. Biol.

One-dimensional reference 13C NMR spectra were acquired using direct detection on a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. A saturated solution of Xylβ1→7MU was prepared for NMR analysis in similar manner, and spectra were acquired under identical conditions for comparison. Chemical shifts are referenced to internal acetone (2.225 and 30.00 ppm for 1H and 13C, respectively). The cDNA fragment of soluble β4Gal-T7 was used as a probe. The probe was random priming labeled using [α32P]dCTP and an Strip-EZ DNA labeling kit (Ambion). A multiple human tissue Northern blot, MTN I (CLONTECH), was probed as described previously (7Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A purified secreted form of β4Gal-T7 was used for immunizing BALB/c mice, and monoclonal antibodies were selected and characterized by immunocytology on Sf9 cells infected with various β4Gal-transferase expression constructs, as described previously (21Mandel U. Hassan H. Therkildsen M.H. Rygaard J. Jakobsen M.H. Juhl B.R. Dabelsteen E. Clausen H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The specificity was further evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Western blot analysis using precast 8–25% gradient gels and the Phast system™ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Skin fibroblast cell lines from one affected patient, the parents, and two siblings were established and grown as described previously (14Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated and reverse transcription-PCR products were directly sequenced and/or subcloned and sequenced. The identified sequence variations were confirmed by direct sequencing PCR products obtained from genomic DNA. One missense mutation (557CA) was also identified by restriction digestion (Hin fI) of a PCR product from the mutant allele. The EST cloning strategy produced a novel gene with an open reading frame of 327 amino acids exhibiting sequence similarity to members of the β4Gal-T gene family. The predicted coding region of β4Gal-T7 has a single initiation codon in agreement with Kozak's rule (22Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which precedes a sequence encoding a potential hydrophobic transmembrane segment (Fig. 1 A) (DNA sequence available in GenBankTM). β4Gal-T7 is predicted to be a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 28 residues, a transmembrane segment of 30 residues, and a stem region and catalytic domain of 269 residues. The calculated molecular weight of the protein derived from the full coding is 37,404, and proteolytically cleaved secreted forms is predicted to be less than 31,065 (calculated from Arg59 immediately after the hydrophobic transmembrane signal sequence). Multiple sequence alignment of the seven human β4Gal-transferases (Fig. 1 A) shows that the sequence of β4Gal-T7 is distinct from other β4Gal-Ts in two potentially significant regions: the major conserved sequence motif (WGWGG/REDDD/E) is not conserved in two positions, and none of the four cysteine residues conserved among the first six β4Gal-Ts are conserved in β4Gal-T7. β4Gal-T7 has a single N-linked glycosylation consensus site, which is different from a site conserved among β4Gal-T2 to β4Gal-T6. The coding region of β4Gal-T7 was found in six exons (base pairs 1–50, 51–413, 414–639, 640–723, 724–828, and 829–984) similar to other β4Gal-Ts. However, in contrast to the five intron/exon boundaries conserved in β4Gal-T1 to β4Gal-T4, none of the five boundaries of β4Gal-T7 appears to be conserved (Fig. 1 A). The 3′ ESTs assembled in Hs.45208 were found in the second intron sequence of β4Gal-T7 and were linked to chromosome 5q35.1 to 5q35.3. Expression of full coding or secreted constructs of β4Gal-T7 in insect cells resulted in marked increase in galactosyltransferase activity with a number of βXyl containing acceptor substrates, compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with a control construct (TableI). The best acceptor substrate identified was β-MeUmb-Xyl, for which the Km was estimated at 0.89 ± 0.29 mm. The Km for UDP-Gal was 56 ± 12 μmusing β-MeUmb-Xyl as an acceptor. Low activity was observed with βGlcNAc acceptors, but there was no activity with other mono- or disaccharide substrates tested. Structural characterization by1H NMR of the product formed with β-MeUmb-Xyl showed that the β4Gal-T7 forms the Galβ1–4Xylβ1-R linkage (Table II and Fig.2). Comparison of a one-dimensional1H NMR spectrum of the product (Fig. 2 A) with that of substrate obtained under similar conditions (in D2O, 25 °C; not shown) clearly showed an additional H-1 resonance (4.512 ppm) from a sugar residue linked in the β-configuration (3 J1, 2 = 7–9 Hz). We did not find NMR data for the specific expected product in the literature or in glycoconjugate NMR data bases. The substantial anisotropic effects of the 4-methylumbelliferyl group obviates direct comparison of chemical shift data with those of other glycosides, e.g. linked to l-serine (23van Halbeek H.

Thus, a de novo sequence analysis of the product was undertaken by consecutive application of two-dimensional1H-1H TOCSY, 1H-13C HSQC, and 1H-13C HMBC NMR experiments (for a review of this strategy, see Ref. 24Bush C.A. Bull. Magn. Reson. 1988; 10: 73-95Google Scholar). Although 1H chemical shift data were available for the Xylβ1→7MeUmb substrate (25Manzi A. Salimath P.V. Spiro R.C. Keifer P.A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9154-9163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), these were acquired in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6, which is known to alter proton shifts when compared with D2O solutions (26Dabrowski J. Hanfland P. Egge H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, direct comparison of spectral data for the product were derived from an additional series of NMR experiments on the substrate glycoside dissolved in D2O. Thus, all 1H and 13C resonances were uniquely and unambiguously assigned by the TOCSY and HSQC experiments (Table II). The H-5ax and H-5eq resonances for β-Xyl were assigned on the basis of their3 J4,5 coupling constants; the trends for 1H resonances and coupling constants were similar to those observed for the corresponding l-serine glycosides (24Bush C.A. Bull. Magn. Reson. 1988; 10: 73-95Google Scholar); and the linkages were unambiguously established by observation of interglycosidic H1−C1−O1−Cx and C1−O1−Cx−Hx correlations in the HMBC spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2 B, evidence of the newly formed Galβ1→4Xylβ linkage in the product is clearly demonstrated by strong cross-peaks correlating β-Gal H-1 (4.512 ppm) with β-Xyl C4 (76.02 ppm) and the corresponding β-Gal C-1 (101.60 ppm) with the β-Xyl H-4 resonance (3.972 ppm). Because β-Xyl H-4 is completely resolved and unique in its coupling pattern with H-3, H-5eq, and H-5ax and because there are no instances of strong coupling between any of the β-Xyl ring proton resonances that might otherwise create uncertainty in their assignments, the latter correlation in particular renders assignment of the linkage unambiguous. Consistent with this, the β-Xyl C-4 resonance shows a substantial downfield glycosylation-induced shift (δΔ = 7.27 ppm) that is unique when comparing product to substrate, whereas C-3 and C-5 exhibit small upfield shift changes, as expected (27Gorin P.A.J. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1981; 38: 13-104Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). All of the proton resonances of the β-Xyl residue exhibit downfield glycosylation-induced shifts: H-4 was the largest (δΔ = 0.231 ppm). These results confirm the linkage structure of the product as β1–4.Table II1II, 13C chemical shifts (ppm) and1H-1H coupling constants (Hz) for XylβMU substrate and biosynthetic Galβ4XylβMU product in D2O at 25 °CXylβMU XylβGalβ4XylβMUGalβ4XylβH-15.1962-aChemical shifts of Xylβ H-1 and H-2 are somewhat concentrationdependent (H-1, 5.173 ppm; H-2, 4.609 ppm; in dilute solution).

Northern analysis with mRNA from eight human adult organs showed a ubiquitous pattern of expression for β4Gal-T7 (Fig. 3). The transcript size of β4Gal-T7 was approximately 2 kilobases. Sequence analysis of β4Gal-T7 mRNA and DNA in a patient with defective galactosyltransferase I activity revealed two missense mutations in coding exon III, C557 → A and T617 → C, which result in changes in amino acid sequence, respectively, Ala186 → Asp and Leu206 → Pro (Figs. 1 and4). A genotyping strategy involving selective restriction digestion with Hin fI of a PCR product confirmed the C557 → A mutation (not shown). Both substitutions are in the putative catalytic domain. The Ala186 → Asp substitution results in introduction of an acidic residue in a fairly conserved position among β4Gal-Ts (Ala/Val/Ser) (Fig. 1 A). The Leu206 → Pro substitution results in a nonconservative change of a fully conserved Leu residue (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 4, sequence analysis of the patient's family confirmed that the mother was heterozygous for the Ala186 → Asp allele and the father heterozygous for the Leu206 → Pro allele. Two siblings were also heterozygous for one or the other variant alleles. The sibling with the Leu206 → Pro allele was previously judged to be heterozygous based on analysis of galactosyltransferase I activity. 3H. Kresse, unpublished observation. Expression of the secreted forms of the variant alleles revealed that β4Gal-T7186D was active (Table I), but the Km for the donor substrate was elevated (Km 230 ± 64 μm). The Km for the acceptor MeUmb-β-Xyl was comparable with wild type (Km 0.54 ± 0.10 mm). In contrast, expression of the β4Gal-T7206P variant did not result in significant activity in the supernatant or in cell extracts of infected insect cells (Table I). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to human β4Gal-T7 confirmed that proteins of appropriate sizes were expressed in all cases (Fig.5). The monoclonal antibody, URH1(2C3) (IgG1), reacted specifically with cells infected with full coding or secreted constructs of β4Gal-T7 by immunocytology (not shown), and in Western blot analysis only one band corresponding to approximately 35.000 was detected in extracts of insect cells if these were infected with β4Gal-T7 constructs (Fig. 5).Figure 5Western blot analysis of the expression of β4Gal-T7186D and β4Gal-T7206P in Sf9 cells.

Such an enzyme is required for the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linkage region of proteoglycans (11Schwartz N.B. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Helting T. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2790-2798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Helting T. Rodén L.

The finding that two allelic variants of the β4Gal-T7 gene in a patient previously shown to exhibit a defect in galactosyltransferase I activity and in the biosynthesis of small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans had reduced or impaired functions strongly indicates that β4Gal-T7 is one of potentially multiple galactosyltransferase I genes. Furthermore, β4Gal-T7 is the galactosyltransferase I gene that is functionally important for small proteoglycan biosynthesis in skin fibroblasts. Given the number of genes encoding β4-galactosyltransferases transferring galactose to βGlcNAc and βGlc and considering the multitude of enzymes involved in catalyzing specific steps in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (e.g. glucosamine:3-O-sulfotransferases (29Shworak N.W. Liu J. Petros L.M. Zhang L. Kobayashi M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5170-5184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar)), we hypothesize that additional βXyl β4-galactosyltransferase genes exist. This is in agreement with the finding that in the patient fibroblasts no abnormality in the biosynthesis of versican and of heparan sulfate proteoglycans had been found (14Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that only a single galactosyltransferase I gene exists and that the active mutant allele, β4Gal-T7186D, has differential catalytic efficiency for transferring galactose to proteoglycans with different densities of glycosaminoglycan attachment sites. Independent studies on chemically mutagenized Chinese hamster ovary cells are in agreement with the proposal that either only a single galactosyltransferase I exists or that, alternatively, a single auxiliary protein for these enzymes is required. Interestingly, the mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells, which exhibited only about 2% of the normal level of galactosyltransferase I activity, could prime glycosaminoglycan synthesis on exogenously added β-xylosides (30Esko J.D. Weinke J.L. Taylor W.H. Ekborg G. Rodén L. Anantharamaiah G. Gawish A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12189-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this activity may stem from βGlc(NAc) β4GalTs (7Schwientek T. Almeida R. Levery S.B. Holmes E. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29331-29340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Khatra B.S. Herries D.G. Brew K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 537-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The catalytic properties of β4Gal-T7 resemble those of a partially purified galactosyltransferase I activity derived from embryonic chick cartilage (11Schwartz N.B. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both enzyme activities showed a Kmfor UDP-Gal of approximately 50 μm. Analysis of Km for the donor substrate with cell extracts appear to give higher Km of 100 μm (12Helting T. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2790-2798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 170 μm (14Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Apparent Km values for different acceptor substrates tested vary around 0.5–6 mm(14Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The properties of the recombinant allelic variants of β4Gal-T7, β4Gal-T7186D and β4Gal-T7206P were not in agreement with the properties of the galactosyltransferase I activity measured in extracts of fibroblasts from a patient with galactosyltransferase I deficiency (14Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The catalytically active allele, β4Gal-T7186D, exhibited an approximately 2-fold lower Km for the acceptor substrate MeUmb-β-Xyl, whereas the extract of patient cells had a 2-fold higher Km for xylosyl-serine compared with control cells. Furthermore, β4Gal-T7186D had a 4-fold higher Km for the donor substrate, whereas extracts exhibited an almost 7-fold lower Km than control cells. Additionally, only about 30–70% of the secreted decorin was devoid of the glycosaminoglycan chain, whereas the mature proteoglycan even contained longer dermatan sulfate chains. These discrepancies are likely related in part to experimental variation. Analysis of glycosyltransferase activities in extracts may be influenced by a number of factors. It is possible that multiple enzymes catalyze formation of the same linkage with different kinetic properties. Other factors in extracts may interfere or bind substrates. Furthermore, the properties of recombinant secreted forms of the enzyme may be different than those found with the transmembrane enzyme in cell homogenates. The total activity assessed in the patient fibroblasts was approximately 5% compared with controls, whereas both parents showed 50% reduction in activities. The 5% activity measured in the patient is likely to originate from the β4Gal-T7186D allele. The recombinant form of this allele was comparatively more active (Table I), but its poorer kinetic properties, potentially combined with a lower stability in cells or extracts (14Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), may account for the reduction in activities observed in the patient and parents. One unexplained observation from the study of Quentin et al. (14Quentin E. Gladen A. Rodén L. Kresse H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was that the β3-galactosyltransferase II activity forming the Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser structure was also reduced in the patient and parents. Further studies of the in vivo functions of the allelic variants of β4Gal-T7 are required to fully assess their functions in proteoglycan biosynthesis. The identified mutations in β4Gal-T7 are in the putative catalytic domain and involve residues that are partly or fully conserved among members of the β4Gal-T gene family (Fig. 1 A). The effects of these substitutions are in agreement with predictions based on x-ray crystallography data on the catalytic unit of β4Gal-T1. 4Gastinel, L. N., Cambillau, C., and Bourne, Y. (1999) EMBO J. 18, 3546–3557. The region around Ala186 corresponds to a segment in β4Gal-T1 that is included in the protein core. The adjacent Pro and His residues at positions 182 and 184 in β4Gal-T7 are strictly conserved among all human β4GalT sequences. Ala186 of β4Gal-T7 corresponds to Ser274 in β4Gal-T1. Ser274 is in a region close (less than 5 angstrom distance) to the UDP-Gal binding site and may interact with this and hence explain the poorer kinetic properties of the β4Gal-T7186D variant. The Gly201-Gly202 adjacent to Leu206are strictly conserved among β4Gal-T sequences, and they are included in the catalytic pocket of β4Gal-T1. Leu206 is also strictly conserved in all sequences, and the corresponding Leu296 in β4Gal-T1 is included in a network of hydrophobic interactions in the protein core with aromatic residue Phe301, Phe307, Phe290, and Leu325. The Pro206 substitution in β4Gal-T7206P is predicted to markedly change the fold of the protein core, which is in agreement with the observed lack of activity of this variant. Galactosyltransferase I has been considered as a cis-Golgi located enzyme in epiphyseal cartilage (32Sugumaran G. Silbert J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9565-9569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is believed to be noncovalently associated with the protein xylosyltransferase (33Schwartz N.B. Rodén L. Dorfman A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 56: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Schwartz N.B. FEBS Lett. 1975; 49: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The sequence of β4Gal-T7 predicts relatively long cytoplasmic (28 residues) and transmembrane (30 residues) domains compared with other β4Gal-Ts and Golgi-located glycosyltransferases in general. The cytoplasmic domain and the stem region are hydrophilic. We have not identified putative motifs that are predicted to mediate binding to the protein xylosyltransferase. The availability of recombinant β4Gal-T7 and antibodies thereto may provide tools for studying the interaction and possibly cloning the xylosyltransferase. Two homologues of the β4Gal-T gene family have been identified in the nematode Caenorhabtidis elegans (35Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. et al.Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). In a phylogenetic analysis presented by Lo et al. (36Lo N.-W. Shaper J.H. Pevsner J. Shaper N.L. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) the gene W02B12.11 (designated C. 2) (GenBankTM accession number Z66521) clustered with the β4Gal-T5 and β4Gal-T6 subgroup, while the gene R10E11.4 (designated C. elegans 1) (GenBankTM accession number Z29095) was not clustered. If β4Gal-T7 is included in this analysis, the R10E11.4 gene and β4Gal-T7 form a separate cluster (Fig. 1 B). The close relationship between W02B12.11 and β4Gal-T1 to β4Gal-T6 is further supported by the finding that two of the four intron positions in W02B12.11 align with the conserved intron/exon boundaries in β4Gal-T1 to β4Gal-T4 (Fig. 1 A). In addition, the predicted coding region of W02B12.11 includes the four conserved cysteine residues in β4Gal-T1 to β4Gal-T6. An evolutionary relationship between R10E11.4 and β4Gal-T7 is suggested by the sequence similarity, and this includes substitutions in the same positions in major conserved sequence motif among most β4Gal-Ts (Fig. 1). However, the substituted residues are not similar, and cysteine residues are not conserved, although two residues in the very C-terminal sequences do align between the two sequences (Fig.1 A). The coding region of R10E11.4 is organized in six exons, and none of the intron/exon boundaries align with those of β4Gal-T1 to β4Gal-T4, nor do they align with β4Gal-T7. The R10E11.4 gene corresponds to the sqv-3 gene found to play a critical role in vulval invagination in C. elegans (37Herman T. Horvitz R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferase activity of the protein encoded by either of the C. elegans β4Gal-T homologues have not been reported to our knowledge, but recent expression of a soluble, secreted construct of R10E11.4 in insect cells demonstrated similar activity as reported here for human β4Gal-T7. 5R. Almeida and H. Clausen, unpublished observation. Another gene found to play a role in vulval invagination in C. elegans is sqv-8 (37Herman T. Horvitz R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which showed high sequence similarity to the recently cloned β1,3-glucuronosyltransferase that adds the fourth residue to the proteoglycan linkage region tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O- Ser) (38Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka S. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The finding that impairment of the sqv-3 and sqv-8 genes in nematodes produce the same defect in vulval invagination would be in agreement with the hypothesis that both of these genes were involved in synthesis of the proteoglycan linkage region tetrasaccharide, albeit at different steps. Identification of the molecular genetic basis for the defect in proteoglycan biosynthesis of the patient studied here suggests that extensive studies of genetic defects in patients with progeroid syndromes and other inherited connective tissue disorders should be undertaken.

In contrast, BMP-2 characteristically induced the sustained activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with SB203580 inhibited the BMP-2-induced neurite outgrowth formation in a dose-dependent manner; this inhibition coincided well with the ability of SB203580 to inihibit the BMP-2-induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Overexpression in PC12 cells of wild-type MAP kinase kinase (MKK)-6 enhanced the BMP-2-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase, whose activation correlated well with the ability of these cells to induce neurite outgrowth in response to BMP-2. Transient expression of kinase-negative forms of MKK3/6 inhibited the formation of neurite outgrowth in response to BMP-2. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active forms of MKK3/6 induced neurite outgrowth without BMP-2 stimulation, and SB203580 inhibited this induction. These results clearly indicate that activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway is necessary for BMP-2-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells.

In this respect, we have recently demonstrated that BMP-2 acts as a neurotrophic factor; BMP-2 induces the neuronal differentiation of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (18Iwasaki S. Hattori A. Sato M.

BMPs transduce their signals by binding to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptor, type I and type II (20Massague J. Hata A. Liu F.

Upon ligand binding, type I and type II receptors form heteromeric receptor complexes. Then type I receptors are phosphorylated by type II receptors, and subsequent activation of the catalytic activity of type I receptor kinase is essential for BMP signaling. Although phosphorylation of Smad proteins by the activated type I receptor kinase was suggested to play an important role in the mediation of BMP signaling (20Massague J. Hata A. Liu F.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the precise cytoplasmic signaling pathway for BMPs through which it elicits its effects on the regulation of wide variety of biological processes remains largely unknown. We have recently shown that BMP-2 has the capacity to induce the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Unlike NGF, however, BMP-2 did not induce the activation of MEK or 41-/43-kDa MAP kinases (ERK2 and ERK1, respectively) in these cells (18Iwasaki S. Hattori A. Sato M. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). MEK and ERK1/2 constitute a protein kinase cascade (the ERK cascade), which is one of the major cytoplasmic signaling pathways commonly activated in a wide variety of cells by diverse extracellular stimuli (23Cobb M.H.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Activation of the cascade elicits a wide array of physiological responses such as cell division, differentiation, and secretion (23Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that the activation of the cascade is necessary and sufficient for PC12 cell neuronal differentiation (27Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar, 28Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). However, our previous findings, which showed a clear distinction between the requirement for the activation of MEK and ERK1/2 and the ability of BMP-2 to induce PC12 cell neuronal differentiation (18Iwasaki S. Hattori A. Sato M. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17360-17365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), have indicated that the activation of the ERK cascade is not an absolute requirement for PC12 cell differentiation. In fact, our results suggested the existence of alternative signaling pathway(s) that would be essential for eliciting the neurotrophic effect of BMP-2. In the present study, we have investigated the possible involvement of other members of the MAP kinase family, p38 MAP kinase and JNK, in the BMP-2 signaling pathway that leads to the induction of neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. For the analysis, we utilized a synthetic inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase and vectors for the expression of kinase-negative/constitutively active forms of MKK3/6. Our results demonstrate that activation of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway is required for the BMP-2-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Recombinant human BMP-2, expressed in silkworm larvae, was purified to homogeneity as described previously (29Ishida N. Tsujimoto M. Kanaya T. Shimamura A. Tsuruoka N. Kodama S. Katayama T. Oikawa S.

SB203580 and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem, and wortmannin was from Sigma. Other chemicals and reagents were of the purest grade available. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained through the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (growth medium). For experimental use, PC12 cells cultured on collagen (type IV)-coated plates were incubated in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml insulin, 2 μg/ml transferrin, 30 nmNa2SeO3, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) for 12 h. BMP-2 (30 ng/ml) or activin A (30 ng/ml) was then added, and neurite outgrowth was measured after 1.5–4 days as indicated in the legend of each figure. For quantification of neurite outgrowth, five random photographs were made per plate, and cells bearing processes longer than 2-fold the length of cell body were considered positive. A total of over 400 cells were counted, and each data point corresponded to the counts obtained from two independent plates. BMP-2-/activin A-stimulated PC12 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off plates in hypotonic cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 20 nm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm sodium molybdate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% aprotinin), and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen (18Iwasaki S.

After three freeze-thaw cycles, cells were lysed by passing them through a 25-gauge needle followed by sonication for 30 s. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates (10–80 μg of protein) were then immunoprecipitated by incubating for 3 h at 4 °C with each of the respective antibodies preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the immunoprecipitation of p38 MAP kinase, cell lysates were pretreated with 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 4 °C and diluted 1:10 in cell lysis buffer, and then the antibody was added (30Chatani Y.

The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cell lysis buffer. For protein kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with the kinase buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4) for p38 MAP kinase or JNK or with the kinase buffer B (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.1. mm Na3VO4) for MAPKAP kinase-2. p38 MAP kinase, JNK, and MAPKAP kinase-2 activities were measured in an immune complex kinase assay. Briefly, each immunoprecipitate was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C with 20 μm (for assays of p38 MAP kinase and JNK) or 100 μm (for assays of MAPKAP kinase-2) of ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of the respective kinase buffer; p38 MAP kinase assays were performed with 2 μg of GST-ATF2-(1–254) as substrate, JNK assays were performed using 2 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79), and MAPKAP kinase-2 assays were performed using a 100 μm concentration of the MAPKAP kinase-2 substrate peptide. For assays of p38 MAP kinase and JNK, reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer, and the incorporation of 32P into substrate proteins was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography using a Fujix Bioimaging analyzer BAS 1500 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). For assays of MAPKAP kinase-2, reactions were terminated by adding 10 μl of 1% orthophosphoric acid containing 1 mmATP and 1% bovine serum albumin. An aliquot (30 μl) was then spotted onto phosphocellulose filters (P81, Whatman), and radioactivity incorporated into the substrate peptide was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry after washing the filters five times in 150 mm phosphoric acid. ERK activity was measured in 10 μg of cell lysates using the BIOTRAKTM p42/p44 MAP kinase enzyme assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.), and subjected to immunodetection using the appropriate primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (18Iwasaki S. Hattori A. Sato M. Tsujimoto M. Kohno M. J. Biol.

Sugiyama and M. Hibi, unpublished data.Transfection of these plasmids into PC12 cells was done by the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.), using 5 μg of DNA/60-mm dish unless otherwise indicated. For the generation of PC12 cells overexpressing wild-type MKK6, 1 μg of DNA of pME-HA-MKK6 was transfected into the cells together with 9 μg of DNA of pSV2neo. Cells were then selected for 8 days in the growth medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml of Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and pools of selected cultures were used in the studies. More than 80% of the selected cells were HA-positive as viewed by fluorescent microscopy using the anti-HA antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (data not shown). BMP-2 treatment of PC12 cells induced their neuronal differentiation, as shown clearly by the appearance of neurite outgrowth (Fig. 1). Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, also induced the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, although less strongly compared with BMP-2. Unlike the NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, however, activation of the 41-/43-kDa MAP kinases (ERKs) was not detected at all in the BMP-2- or activin A-treated cells (Fig.2 A and data not shown; Ref.18Iwasaki S.

We next examined the possible involvement of other members of the MAP kinase family, p38 MAP kinase and JNK, in the signaling pathway of BMP-2 and activin A that leads to the induction of neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells.Figure 2Activation of p38 MAP kinase, ERKs, and JNK in PC12 cells treated with BMP-2, activin A, or NGF. PC12 cells were treated with 30 ng/ml BMP-2, 30 ng/ml activin A, or 20 ng/ml NGF for the indicated periods of time, and then cells were lysed.A, cell lysates (10 μg of protein for the detection of ERKs and 30 μg of proteins for p38 MAP kinase) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted, and probed with anti-ERK antibody (ERK), anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody (p38 MAPK), anti-active (phosphorylated) ERK antibody (ERK-P), or anti-active (phosphorylated) p38 MAP kinase antibody (p38 MAPK-P), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. pp43/pp41, activated (phosphorylated) forms of ERK1/2. B, the p38 MAP kinase assay was performed by incubating cell lysates (80 μg of protein) with the anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody followed by the kinase reaction, and the JNK assay was performed by incubating cell lysates (80 μg of protein) with the anti-JNK1 antibody followed by the kinase reaction. Radioactivity incorporated into GST-ATF2-(1–254) (p38 MAPK) or GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (JNK) was quantified with a Fujix Bioimaging analyzer BAS 1500, and each value represents the mean ± S.D. of duplicate determinations of a representative experiment. Data shown are representative of 3–5 separate experiments that gave essentially the same results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The activation of the p38 MAP kinase was determined by two different procedures: by measuring the appearance of the active form on immunoblots using an anti-active (phosphorylated) p38 MAP kinase antibody and by a direct in vitro kinase assay of the immunoprecipitates using GST-ATF2-(1–254) as substrate. These analyses always gave an essentially identical time course profile for p38 MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, BMP-2 induced a notable and sustained activation of p38 MAP kinase in PC12 cells. p38 MAP kinase activation reached the maximum level within 60 min and then declined gradually. However, a considerable level of activation could still be detected even 4 h after stimulation of the cells. Moreover, BMP-2 induced the activation of MAPKAP kinase-2, a downstream effector kinase of p38 MAP kinase (36Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar), in PC12 cells with a time course profile similar to that of p38 MAP kinase activation (Fig.3). Activin A also induced the activation of p38 MAP kinase and MAPKAP kinase-2 in PC12 cells with similar kinetics, but less efficiently compared with BMP-2-treated cells. In contrast, neither BMP-2 nor activin A induced any significant activation of JNK in PC12 cells (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). To examine the role of activation of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway in BMP-2-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, the cells were pretreated for 30 min with varying concentrations or 10 μm of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase (37Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar) and then stimulated with BMP-2. Because the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by SB203580 is in a reversible manner in vivo that cannot be detected by in vitro immune complex kinase assays of p38 MAP kinase (38Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adama J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), its inhibition by SB203580 was measured by determining MAPKAP kinase-2 activity. As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment of the cells with SB203580 inhibited the BMP-2-stimulated activity of MAPKAP kinase-2 in a dose-dependent manner, with almost complete inhibition being observed at 10 μm. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with 10 μm of SB203580 also inhibited completely the activin A-induced activation of MAPKAP kinase-2. To evaluate the specific role of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway in BMP-2- and activin A-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, the cells were pretreated with various concentrations or 10 μm of SB203580 for 30 min and then exposed to each stimulatory agent. As shown in Fig. 1, SB203580 inhibited the ability of PC12 cells to induce neurite outgrowth in response to BMP-2 and activin A. Importantly, the ability of SB203580 to inhibit the BMP-2-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells was dose-dependent and correlated well with its capacity to inhibit the BMP-2-induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway, with complete inhibition being observed at 10 μm. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with other inhibitors such as wortmannin (a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) (39Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) or PD98059 (a specific inhibitor of MEK) (40Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl.

Activation of p38 MAP kinase is achieved by combined tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation catalyzed by dual specificity kinases, MKK3 and MKK6; MKK6 has been reported to be the major activator of p38 MAP kinase (23Cobb M.H.

Thus, we next generated PC12 cells overexpressing wild-type MKK6, in order to investigate the causal link between the activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway and the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Overexpression of MKK6 in PC12 cells induced a ∼1.5-fold increase in the basal p38 MAP kinase activity compared with that observed in the pSV2neo-transfected cells (Fig. 4), and this increase was accompanied by the appearance of short processes (Fig.5). Treatment of the MKK6-transfected PC12 cells with BMP-2 or activin A induced marked activation of p38 MAP kinase; the degree of activation was ∼2-fold higher than that observed with the pSV2neo-transfected cells stimulated with either of these agents (Fig. 4).

The activity of NF-κB is highly regulated: transcriptionally active NF-κB proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins, IκB. A variety of extracellular signals, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), activate NF-κB by inducing phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, allowing nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB. Many of the stimuli that activate NF-κB by inducing IκB degradation also cause phosphorylation of the NF-κB RelA (p65) polypeptide. The transactivating capacity of RelA is positively regulated by phosphorylation, suggesting that in addition to cytosolic sequestration by IκB, phosphorylation represents another mechanism for control of NF-κB activity. In this report, we demonstrate that mesalamine, an anti-inflammatory aminosalicylate, dose-dependently inhibits IL-1-stimulated NF-κB-dependent transcription without preventing IκB degradation or nuclear translocation and DNA binding of the transcriptionally active NF-κB proteins, RelA, c-Rel, or RelB. Mesalamine was found to inhibit IL-1-stimulated RelA phosphorylation. These data suggest that pharmacologic modulation of the phosphorylation status of RelA regulates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, independent of nuclear translocation and DNA binding.

The activity of NF-κB is induced by a wide variety of stimuli, including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α, oxidant stress, bacterial endotoxin, and viral infection. Elevated NF-κB activity has been observed in a number of inflammatory disease states, including the gut mucosa in inflammatory bowel disease (3Schreiber S. Nikolaus S. Hampe J. Gut. 1998; 42: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 4Rogler G. Brand K. Vogl D. Page S. Hofmeister R. Andus T. Knuechel R. Baeuerle P.A. Scholmerich J. Gross V.

Care Med. 1998; 158: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the NF-κB system is an attractive target for therapeutic inhibition in chronic inflammatory conditions (7Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptionally active NF-κB proteins, RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB are characterized by a conserved region known as the Rel homology domain, after homology to the viral oncogene v-Rel. The Rel homology domain contains motifs essential for dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding of NF-κB. The activity of NF-κB is highly regulated. In the basal unstimulated state, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm as homo- or heterodimers bound to a family of inhibitory molecules termed IκB, which mask the nuclear localization signal. Stimuli that activate NF-κB initiate a cascade of signaling events that culminate in phosphorylation, ubiquination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation of IκB (8May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Consequently, NF-κB is freed to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of a variety of genes, including a gene encoding one of its cytosolic inhibitors, IκBα. Recently it has been demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of NF-κB can be regulated by mechanisms other than cytosolic sequestration by IκB. The NF-κB protein RelA can be inducibly phosphorylated by the same stimuli that cause degradation of IκB. Several reports have demonstrated that the DNA binding (9Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 10Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26790-26795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transactivating capacity of NF-κB (11Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) are up-regulated by inducible phosphorylation of RelA. Thus, pathways that regulate the phosphorylation status of RelA and possibly other transcriptionally active NF-κB proteins constitute another potential mechanism for control of transcriptional activity. Salicylate drugs are in widespread use as inhibitors of inflammation in a variety of disease states. Sodium salicylate and acetyl salicylic acid inhibit NF-κB by preventing inducible degradation of IκB, and this action may underlie the in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of these agents (14Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). Aminosalicylates such as sulfasalazine (an azo-conjugated aminosalicylate) and mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid, a free aminosalicylate) inhibit gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (15Egan L.J. Sandborn W.J. Drugs Today. 1998; 34: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Like conventional salicylates, sulfasalazine has been reported to inhibit NF-κB activity by preventing inducible IκBα degradation (16Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In this report we show that mesalamine is an inhibitor of inducible NF-κB-dependent transcription in intestinal epithelial cells and T lymphocytes. However, unlike conventional salicylates and sulfasalazine, mesalamine does not prevent IL-1-induced IκBα or β degradation. The transcriptionally active NF-κB proteins RelA, RelB, and c-Rel translocate to the nucleus and bind to κB sites on DNA but are unable to initiate transcription in the presence of mesalamine. Further experiments demonstrated that mesalamine inhibits IL-1-induced phosphorylation of RelA. This suggests that mesalamine regulates NF-κB activity by modulating the phosphorylation of one of its transcriptionally active proteins and that the pathways leading to inducible RelA phosphorylation constitute an independent mechanism for the regulation of NF-κB activity. Unless otherwise stated, materials were purchased from Sigma. Affinity purified rabbit antibody to IκBα has been previously described (17McKean D.J. Huntoon C. Bell M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and affinity purified antibodies to RelA (sc-372), c-Rel (sc-70), and RelB (sc-226) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant human IL-1β (R&D 201-LB) was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). A Caco-2 cell line from American Type Culture Collection (HTB 37) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 nm folic acid, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). Jurkat T cells expressing the type I IL-1 receptor (Ju.1 cells) (17McKean D.J. Huntoon C. Bell M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. An NF-κB reporter construct, consisting of the firefly luciferase gene under control of three copies of the consensus NF-κB site from the IgG promoter was used to quantify NF-κB transcriptional activity (18McKean D.J. Bell M. Huntoon C. Rastogi S. Van Norstrand M. Podzorski R. Nilson A. Paya C. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A Renilla luciferase reporter under control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, pRLTK (Promega, Madison, WI), was used to normalize the NF-κB reporter gene activity, to prevent nonspecific drug effects such as cytotoxicity confounding the results. Caco-2 cells were first brought into suspension by trypsinization. Caco-2 or Ju.1 cells (107) were mixed with 10 μg NF-κB reporter gene, 20 ng of pRLTK and 20 μg of filler DNA and pulsed once with 325 V for 10 ms using a square wave electroporater (BTX, San Diego, CA). For experiments, 107 transfected Caco-2 cells were distributed into 30 wells of a 48-well tissue culture plate, and 107 transfected Jurkat cells were distributed into 6 wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate. Experiments were performed 12–48 h after transfection. For luciferase assays, cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activities were read according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dual luciferase, Promega), using a model LB 9501/16 Lumat luminometer (Berthold Systems, Aliquippa, PA). Results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Caco-2 cells (2.5 × 105) were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were depleted of leucine by replacing the medium with leucine free RPMI supplemented with 2% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 4 h, which was changed once. After addition of mesalamine or control, 25 μCi of [3H]leucine (l-4,5-[3H]leucine, 136 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each well. After various durations, [3H]leucine incorporation into precipitable protein was quantified. Medium was aspirated, and the monolayers were washed twice with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. Cells were scraped, transferred to microtubes, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. Protein was precipitated by addition of 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid to the cell pellet, which was then vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the protein precipitation step was repeated once. The precipitated protein was resolubilized by addition of 500 μl of 0.3n NaOH in 1% SDS for 30 min with vortexing. [3H]Leucine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting of aliquots of the resolubilized protein. Caco-2 cells (6 × 106) were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. After various experimental procedures, cytosolic lysates were prepared as follows: medium was aspirated, and the Caco-2 monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mmNa2VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.6, supplemented immediately before use with 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, was added to each monolayer and allowed to lyse the cells for at least 30 min at 4 °C. Ju.1 cells in suspension culture were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in the same buffer. Lysates were then transferred to sialized microtubes and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. IκBα was immunoprecipitated from cytosolic preparations using antibody to IκBα conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads as described previously, under conditions of antibody excess (18McKean D.J. Bell M. Huntoon C. Rastogi S. Van Norstrand M. Podzorski R. Nilson A. Paya C. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 8.75% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Blots were probed using antibody to IκBα as described previously (18McKean D.J. Bell M. Huntoon C. Rastogi S. Van Norstrand M. Podzorski R. Nilson A. Paya C. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and immunoreactive protein was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Caco-2 cells (6 × 106) were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. After various experimental procedures, nuclear lysates were prepared as follows: medium was aspirated, and the Caco-2 monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. Cells were disrupted by incubating the monolayer for 4 min in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm NaCl, supplemented immediately before use with 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 150 μm spermine, 500 μmspermidine, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40. The disrupted monolayer was mixed in a pipette, transferred to microtubes, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was washed with buffer lacking Nonidet P-40 to remove contaminating cytosolic proteins. Nuclear extracts were prepared by vortexing the cell pellets for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% v/v glycerol, 0.4 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA supplemented immediately before use with 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 150 μm spermine, and 500 μm spermidine. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, c-Rel, RelB, and RelA were sequentially immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using the appropriate antibodies conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads under conditions of antibody excess, as described previously (18McKean D.J.

Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3140-3148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described above for cytosolic lysates. Nuclear lysates were prepared as for immunoblots, and the protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus kit (Pierce). Mobility shift reactions were carried out using 6 μg of protein from each nuclear extract incubated with 32P-labeled IL-2 NF-κB oligonucleotide probe as described previously (18McKean D.J. Bell M. Huntoon C. Rastogi S. Van Norstrand M. Podzorski R. Nilson A. Paya C. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the probe used in this study is 5′-CCCGACCAAGAGGGATTTCACCTAAATCCATT-3′ (coding strand only). Ju.1 and Caco-2 cells were labeled with 32Pi (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA), as described previously (18McKean D.J. Bell M. Huntoon C. Rastogi S. Van Norstrand M. Podzorski R. Nilson A. Paya C. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were divided into aliquots (107/sample) and, after various experimental conditions, were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 400 μm Na3VO4, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF, pH 7.4. After centrifugation, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated for c-Rel, RelB, and RelA as described above. The precipitated phosphoproteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography at −70 °C. A variety of salicylates and aminosalicylates have been shown to inhibit NF-κB-dependent transcription (14Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 16Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). To determine whether mesalamine is an inhibitor of NF-κB in intestinal epithelial cells, Caco-2 cells were stimulated with IL-1 or phorbol myristate acetate in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of mesalamine. NF-κB transcriptional activity was measured with a transiently transfected NF-κB luciferase reporter gene, and results were normalized to a cotransfected reporter under control of a minimal promoter. Mesalamine inhibited IL-1 and phorbol myristate acetate stimulated NF-κB transcription with a maximal effect at 40 mm and a half-maximal effect at 16 mm (Fig.2 a). At these concentrations, mesalamine did not inhibit transcription from the control reporter (data not shown). Consistent with previous reports (16Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), sulfasalazine also inhibited NF-κB reporter gene activity, with a maximal effect at 10 mmol/liter and a half-maximal effect at 1.4 mmol/l (Fig.2 a). To determine whether mesalamine inhibited NF-κB reporter gene activity in cell types other than epithelial cells, parallel NF-κB reporter gene experiments were performed in Ju.1 lymphoid cells. Mesalamine also inhibited NF-κB reporter gene activity in Ju.1 T lymphocytes, demonstrating that the effect is not cell type-specific (Fig. 2 b). To ensure that the mesalamine-mediated inhibition of NF-κB reporter gene activity was not simply a nonspecific blockade of translation, total protein synthesis in Caco-2 cells was estimated by the rates of incorporation of [3H]leucine into precipitable protein in the presence and absence of the drug. Mesalamine 40 mm, or vehicle were added to leucine depleted Caco-2 cells 5 min before addition of [3H]leucine tracer. After 1, 2, and 4 h of incubation, means of 17, 21, and 25%, respectively, of the added tracer was incorporated in the control cells, compared with 16, 18, and 27% in the mesalamine-treated cells (p > 0.05 at each time point; Fig. 3). Thus, mesalamine had no detectable effect on translation, at a concentration that produced maximum inhibition of reporter gene activity. Acetyl salicylic acid, sodium salicylate, and sulfasalazine inhibit NF-κB by preventing degradation of its cytosolic inhibitor, IκBα (14Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 16Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). To determine whether mesalamine inhibited IκBα degradation in intestinal epithelial cells, Caco-2 cells were stimulated with IL-1 in the presence and absence mesalamine or sulfasalazine. After stimulation, the kinetics of IκBα degradation were determined by analysis of quantitative immunoblots of cytosolic lysates. Consistent with previous reports (20Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar), stimulation of control cells with IL-1 or phorbol myristate acetate caused rapid depletion of cytosolic IκBα pools, followed by its gradual reappearance after 1 h (Fig. 4). Mesalamine treatment of Caco-2 cells did not prevent IL-1-induced IκBα degradation. However, reappearance of IκBα in the cytosol was delayed by over 2 h in mesalamine-treated cells but had reached base-line levels within 4 h. In contrast to mesalamine, sulfasalazine completely inhibited IL-1-stimulated degradation of IκBα. Mesalamine also did not prevent IL-1-stimulated degradation of IκBβ (data not shown). Because mesalamine inhibited NF-κB transactivation but did not prevent degradation of its cytosolic inhibitor, we hypothesized that this drug might be inhibiting nuclear translocation of transcriptionally active NF-κB proteins. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of mesalamine on the kinetics of IL-1-inducible RelA, c-Rel, and RelB nuclear translocation in Caco-2 cells by quantitative immunoblotting from nuclear extracts. Consistent with previous reports, IL-1 caused rapid but transient nuclear translocation of RelA, c-Rel and RelB, followed later by a decrease in abundance of these proteins in the nuclear extracts (Fig. 5). Mesalamine did not prevent IL-1-induced nuclear localization of RelA, c-Rel, or RelB in Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, nuclear extracts of Caco-2 cells treated with only mesalamine contained RelB, whereas untreated cells displayed no detectable amounts of nuclear RelB. Mesalamine inhibits NF-κB transcriptional activity without preventing degradation of IκBα or nuclear translocation of the transcriptionally active NF-κB proteins. To determine whether mesalamine interferes with the ability of NF-κB to bind to DNA κB sites, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed. Caco-2 cells were treated with mesalamine or vehicle and then stimulated with IL-1 for varying durations. Analysis of DNA binding activity in Caco-2 nuclear extracts revealed that IL-1 stimulated NF-κB DNA binding in the presence and absence of mesalamine (Fig.6). Identical results were obtained using the IL-2 and HIV NF-κB oligonucleotide probes (data not shown). Because mesalamine is absent from the nuclear extracts at the time of incubation with NF-κB oligonucleotide probes, a direct inhibitory effect of mesalamine on NF-κB DNA binding in vivo cannot be excluded. NF-κB transcriptional activity depends on the inducible degradation its cytosolic inhibitor IκB, followed by nuclear translocation and DNA binding of the transcriptionally active proteins RelA, c-Rel, and RelB. Mesalamine inhibits NF-κB-dependent transactivation without any detectable interference in this classic mechanism of regulation. This suggests that mesalamine is interfering with an alternative pathway for regulation of NF-κB. To determine whether mesalamine directly affects the post-translational modification of NF-κB proteins, we examined the inducible phosphorylation of RelA, c-Rel, and RelB in the presence and absence of this drug. In Caco-2 cells, RelA was found to be basally phosphorylated by 32P labeling. IL-1 induced further phosphorylation of RelA in control cells, but the IL-1-induced phosphorylation was inhibited by pretreatment with mesalamine (Fig.7). Comparable results were obtained in Ju.1 cells (data not shown). Low levels of IL-1-induced phosphorylation of c-Rel precluded definitive identification of mesalamine effects on c-Rel phosphorylation. RelB is not inducibly phosphorylated by IL-1 in either Caco-2 or Ju.1 cells. These data demonstrate that mesalamine inhibits a pathway that directly regulates the inducible phosphorylation of the RelA NF-κB protein. The nuclear localization and transcription regulation activity of NF-κB is stimulated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1. After exposure to IL-1, cells rapidly degrade cytosolic IκB, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and initiate specific gene transcription. Inhibition of the signaling pathways that lead to IκB degradation prevents NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, for example by the oxygen radical scavenger pyrolidine dithiocarbamate and by anti-inflammatory drugs, such as salicylates (7Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a novel pharmacologic mechanism for control of NF-κB activity. Pretreatment of cells with mesalamine, an anti-inflammatory aminosalicylate, prevented IL-1-stimulated NF-κB-dependent transcription without affecting IκB degradation, NF-κB nuclear translocation, or DNA binding. IL-1 stimulation of colonic epithelial cells and T lymphocytes inducibly phosphorylated RelA. Mesalamine-mediated inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity was accompanied by inhibition of IL-1-stimulated RelA phosphorylation. This suggests that the inducible phosphorylation of RelA positively regulates gene transcription by NF-κB and that RelA phosphorylation constitutes an independent mechanism for the control of NF-κB activity. The activity of transcription factors is highly regulated to control the timely and co-ordinated expression of different genes. Increased transcriptional activity of NF-κB has been identified in a number of different disease states, including chronic inflammatory disorders (2Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar), cancers (21Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), and the anti-viral state (1Wulczyn F.G. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 749-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because of the need for fine control of transcription factor activity, multiple levels of regulation have evolved. Regulation can result from subcellular localization or post-translational modifications by phosphorylation on tyrosine, threonine, or serine residues. The control of the Rel/NF-κB family of transcription factors has been extensively studied, notably with regard to the cytoplasmic sequestration of NF-κB proteins by their natural inhibitors, IκB. Like many other transcription factors, including AP-1 and CREB, NF-κB activity can also be regulated by the phosphorylation state of its transcriptionally active components, especially RelA. Using a variety of experimental conditions and stimuli, it has been demonstrated that the DNA binding of NF-κB (9Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar,10Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26790-26795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and NF-κB-dependent transcription (11Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) are positively regulated by RelA phosphorylation. Identification of the sites of inducible RelA phosphorylation and the responsible signaling pathways and kinases are currently active fields of investigation. Zhong et al. (12Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) showed that lipopolysaccharide treatment of cells stimulated protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of RelA on serine 276. In a cell-free system, it appeared that protein kinase A could directly phosphorylate RelA. Phosphorylation of this serine residue did not affect DNA binding but greatly increased RelA transcriptional activity by promoting interaction with the coactivator, cAMP response element binding protein/p300 (22Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Wang and Baldwin demonstrated that TNF-α stimulates phosphorylation of RelA on serine 529 (13Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Inducible NF-κB transcription but not DNA binding was dependent upon this phosphorylation. It has recently been shown that IKK α and β, in addition to phosphorylating IκB proteins, can directly phosphorylate RelA (23Mercurio F. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Young D.B. Li J.W. Pascual G. Motiwala A. Zhu H. Mann M. Manning A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, different NF-κB-inducing stimuli appear to cause phosphorylation of RelA at unique sites, at least two distinct kinases can directly phosphorylate RelA, and phosphorylation of RelA appears to promote transactivation. Our experimental results are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation of RelA can positively regulate NF-κB-dependent transcription, because inhibition of this process with mesalamine prevented transactivation without affecting DNA binding. What is the likely mechanism for the mesalamine-mediated inhibition of IL-1-stimulated RelA phosphorylation? The pathways that transduce the signal from the activated IL-1 receptor that culminate in phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα are incompletely characterized. After ligand binding, the activated IL-1 receptor associates with the transmembrane protein, IL-1 receptor-accessory protein. The IL-1 receptor-accessory protein complex recruits IL-1 receptor-activated kinase (24Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), a serine threonine kinase, and TRAF-6 (25Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). TRAF-6 transduces the activation signal to a complex consisting of a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase called NIK. TRAF-6-mediated activation of NIK initiates the phosphorylation and activation of IKKα and β. Once activated, the IKK α/β heterodimer directly phosphorylates IκBα and IκBβ on N-terminal serine residues. The kinases responsible for IL-1-stimulated phosphorylation of RelA, and the target for inhibition of this process by mesalamine are not known. However, because mesalamine inhibits IL-1-stimulated RelA phosphorylation without preventing IκB degradation, IL-1 receptor-activated kinase, TRAF-6, NIK, and IKK should not be inhibited by mesalamine. Rather, a kinase with specificity for RelA and not IκBα/β is implicated. It has been shown that aspirin and sodium salicylate inhibit IKKβ but not IKKα by competing with ATP for enzyme binding (26Yin M. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Similarly, recent studies from IKKα−/− and IKKβ−/− mice show that TNF-α and IL-1 activate NF-κB through IKKβ and not IKKα (27Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 28Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 29Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although IKKβ−/− mice did not respond to TNF-α by degrading IκB proteins and activating NF-κB, the IL-1-initiated NF-κB response was only partially inhibited (29Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-1 may activate an IKKα/β independent kinase that phosphorylates IκB polypeptides. Such redundant IL-1-inducible kinases could exhibit overlapping but preferential interactions with IκB and RelA substrates. Mesalamine may selectively inhibit a kinase that preferentially interacts with RelA without inhibiting another kinase that preferentially interacts with IκB polypeptides. Mesalamine should be a valuable reagent to further characterize IL-1-inducible signaling events that regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity. Uncontrolled overactivity of NF-κB may be prevented by positive transcriptional regulation of the IκBα gene by NF-κB proteins. Newly synthesized IκBα has been reported to down-regulate NFκB activity by directly interacting with transcriptionally active NF-κB proteins in the nucleus and cytosol (30Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although mesalamine completely inhibited NF-κB reporter gene activity, the late (4 h post stimulation) cytosolic reappearance of IκBα was not blocked (Fig.4). This suggests that not all NF-κB-regulated gene transcription is blocked by mesalamine. RelB is not inducibly phosphorylated, so mesalamine may be unable to prevent activation of genes responsive to this transcription factor. In contrast to its effects on RelA and c-Rel, mesalamine caused nuclear translocation of RelB in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 5), further supporting a differential sensitivity to mesalamine among the NF-κB family members. Alternatively, it is also possible that the late reappearance of IκBα in mesalamine-treated cells is due to activity of a transcription factor other than NF-κB. The IκBα promoter is known to contain Sp-1 binding sequences (31Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and this ubiquitous transcription factor may be responsible for late appearing IκBα in mesalamine-treated cells. These data demonstrate that aminosalicylates can inhibit NF-κB activity by two different mechanisms. Sulfasalazine, the azo-conjugated aminosalicylate studied here, is considered a pro-drug, which is activated when bacterial azo-reductase enzymes in the colon split the molecule to release the active component mesalamine and sulfapyridine (32Azad Khan A.K. Piris J. Truelove S.C. Lancet. 1977; ii: 892-895Abstract Scopus (634) Google Scholar). If inhibition of NF-κB is the true anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of aminosalicylates in vivo, sulfasalazine may in fact have dual anti-NF-κB actions, as a pro-drug of mesalamine and as an active compound itself. It has recently been demonstrated that acetyl salicylic acid inhibits IKKβ but not IKKα (26Yin M. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). Currently it is unknown whether any of the aminosalicylates inhibit IKKα or β or other NF-κB regulatory kinases. A more detailed understanding of the biochemical interactions of the structurally related aminosalicylates with the proteins of the NF-κB system is necessary. These findings suggest that a novel, pharmacologically manipulable mechanism for regulation of NF-κB activity exists. Identification of the IL-1-stimulated signaling pathway responsible for the selective phosphorylation of RelA that is inhibited by mesalamine will be an important extension of this work. This pathway is an attractive potential target for therapeutic inhibition in inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2016466873,"Voltage-gated sodium channels isolated from mammalian brain are composed of α, β1, and β2 subunits. The α subunit forms the ion conducting pore of the channel, whereas the β1 and β2 subunits modulate channel function, as well as channel plasma membrane expression levels. β1 and β2 each contain a single, extracellular Ig-like domain with structural similarity to the neural cell adhesion molecule (CAM), myelin Po. β2 contains strong amino acid homology to the third Ig domain and to the juxtamembrane region of F3/contactin. Many CAMs of the Ig superfamily have been shown to interact with extracellular matrix molecules. We hypothesized that β2 may interact with tenascin-R (TN-R), an extracellular matrix molecule that is secreted by oligodendrocytes during myelination and that binds F3-contactin. We show here that cells expressing sodium channel β1 or β2 subunits are functionally modulated by TN-R. Transfected cells stably expressing β1 or β2 subunits initially recognized and then were repelled from TN-R substrates. The cysteine-rich amino-terminal domain of TN-R expressed as a recombinant peptide, termed EGF-L, appears to be responsible for the repellent effect on β subunit-expressing cells. The epidermal growth factor-like repeats and fibronectin-like repeats 6–8 are most effective in the initial adhesion of β subunit-expressing cells. Application of EGF-L to αIIAβ1β2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes potentiated expressed sodium currents without significantly altering current time course or the voltage dependence of current activation or inactivation.

This homology is most striking in the third Ig-like domain and to the region just proximal to the transmembrane segment of F3/contactin. Two members of the tenascin family bind directly to purified rat brain sodium channels (5Srinivasan J. Schachner M. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using immobilized GST fusion proteins, it was shown that purified, heterotrimeric brain sodium channels, as well as a recombinant β2 extracellular domain, bind specifically to the fibronectin repeat regions of TN-R and TN-C. Tenascin molecules play important roles in cellular interactions in the developing nervous system, such as neuronal migration, neuritogenesis, and neuronal regeneration (6Bartsch U. Prog.

TN-R co-localizes with other glial-derived molecules (i.e. myelin-associated glycoprotein and a phosphacan-related molecule) at high density in central nervous system myelinated axons (15Xiao Z.C. Hillenbrand R. Schachner M. Thermes S. Rougon G. Gomaz S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TN-R has been shown to have disparate effects resulting from interaction with one of its neuronal receptors, F3/contactin: promotion of neurite outgrowth when presented as a uniform substrate for some neuronal cell types and inhibition of growth cone advance and axonal outgrowth from retinal ganglion cells when offered as a sharp substrate boundary. TN-R also induces axonal defasciculation in vitro (15Xiao Z.C. Hillenbrand R. Schachner M. Thermes S. Rougon G. Gomaz S. J. Neurosci.

We postulated that β subunits might function as CAMs in terms of interaction with extracellular matrix molecules. To determine whether sodium channel β subunits are functionally modulated by TN-R, we used stably transfected fibroblasts expressing β1 or β2 subunits plated on substrates that contained TN-R or recombinant TN-R domains synthesized as GST fusion proteins. We show that cells expressing β1 or β2 subunits initially recognize TN-R plated on a nitrocellulose substrate. This event is then followed by repulsion. Application of a recombinant peptide domain of TN-R, EGF-L, resulted in the rapid and specific potentiation of sodium currents expressed by coinjection of α, β1, and β2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. We hypothesize that functional interactions between sodium channel β subunits and TN-R may be important for neuronal defasiculation or growth cone guidance during central nervous system development and may represent a critical communication link between the axon and the node of Ranvier. Purification of TN-R from adult mouse brains by immunoaffinity chromatography was performed as described (13Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against multiple-antigenic peptides by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Multiple-antigenic peptides specific to an extracellular domain of β1 (KRRSETTAETFTEWTFR) or a cytoplasmic domain of β2 (KCVRRKKEQKLSTD) were synthesized by the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Core facility at the University of Michigan. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected using Westdura chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). 4-well or 24-well tissue culture dishes were coated with methanol-solubilized nitrocellulose as described (23Lagenaur C. Lemmon V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7753-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). 2.5-μl aliquots of TN-R (15 μm) or GST fusion domains of TN-R (25 μm) were applied to the nitrocellulose/poly-dl-ornithine (PO)-coated surfaces of the dishes and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere as described previously (21Xiao Z.C. Taylor J. Montag D. Rougon G. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The dishes were then washed three times with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (CMF-HBSS). The coating efficiency was determined as described previously (21Xiao Z.C. Taylor J.

The source of nitrocellulose (see under “Materials”) was critical to obtaining consistent results in this assay. Parental 1610 or transfected cells were plated at a density of 105cells/ml.

Xenopus oocytes were isolated by collagenase treatment of pieces of ovary, as described previously (24McPhee J.C. Ragsdale D.S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12025-12034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). On the day after isolation, oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of RNA encoding the αIIA β1, and β2 subunits. The concentration of αIIA subunit RNA was 20–50 ng/μl, and the concentration of β1 and β2 subunit RNA was 100–200 ng/μl. Two-electrode voltage clamp recording was performed 2–5 days after injection, using a Turbo TEC 10C amplifier (Adams & List, Westbury, NY) and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of <0.5 MΩ. Data were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 2.5 kHz. Capacity transients, as well as leak currents, were subtracted using the P/4 procedure (25Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1974; 63: 533-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Recordings were performed at room temperature in a 200-μl chamber filled with frog Ringer solution (115 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Fusion proteins were added directly to the bath and subsequently washed out by superfusion. As controls for the electrophysiological effects of the recombinant EGF-L domain of TN-R, the fusion protein was treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) overnight at 56 °C. The enzyme was then inactivated by heating at 90 °C for 15 min. This procedure digested the fusion protein such that no silver-stained bands were visible after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% acrylamide gels. To determine whether sodium channel β subunits are modulated by TN-R, we examined the growth behavior of transfected 1610 cells (26West J.W. Scheuer T. Maechler L. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 59-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We created stable cell lines that express β1 alone (1610β1, clone 4), and β2 alone (1610β2, clone 1). We also created mock-transfected 1610 cells that contained pcDNA3 alone. Characterization of β1 or β2 expression in these cell lines by Northern and Western blot analyses is shown in Fig. 1. Because 1610 cells do not express endogenous sodium channel α, β1, or β2 subunits (22Isom L.L. Scheuer T. Brownstein A.B. Ragsdale D.S. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3306-3312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) or F3/contactin (data not shown), we were able to examine the effects of TN-R on sodium channel β subunits in isolation. We predicted that β2 subunits may interact with TN-R because of their homology to F3/contactin. β1 also contains an extracellular CAM domain and is structurally homologous to β2 (4Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 307-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We observed that CHL cells transfected with β2 (1610β2) or β1 (1610β1) subunits were strongly repelled by TN-R substrate coated on top of PO on nitrocellulose when allowed to settle in culture for 20 h (Fig. 2). Parental 1610 cells adhered well to TN-R during this time. These results are similar to observations in which cerebellar neurons expressing F3/contactin were repelled from a TN-R substrate (15Xiao Z.C. Hillenbrand R. Schachner M. Thermes S. Rougon G. Gomaz S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Pesheva P. Gennarini G. Goridis C. Schachner M.

Neurosci. 1996; 8: 766-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One or both of the auxiliary β subunits may elicit signaling events similar to those described for F3/contactin upon interaction with TN-R (15Xiao Z.C. Hillenbrand R. Schachner M. Thermes S. Rougon G. Gomaz S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 698-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Parental 1610 cells and cells transfected with β1 or β2 subunits were not repelled from NCAM or laminin (data not shown). Thus, β1 and β2 subunits appear to be modulated specifically by TN-R to produce a repellent effect of the transfected cells away from the TN-R substrate. This effect could be the result of other processes (for example, apoptosis or anti-adhesion), although previous studies describing the repulsion of cerebellar neurons from a TN-R substrate excluded cell death as a reason for detachment (18Pesheva P. Gennarini G. Goridis C. Schachner M. Neuron. 1993; 10: 69-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We used recombinant peptides of TN-R (summarized in Fig. 3) along with 1610β1 and 1610β2 cells to determine which domains are responsible for the observed repellent effects. TN-R has a modular structure containing a cysteine-rich amino-terminal domain followed by EGF-like repeats, fibronectin type III (FN III) domains, and a fibrinogen-like knob at the carboxyl terminus (6Bartsch U.

Both the 1610β1 and 1610β2 cell lines were strongly repelled by EGF-L (Figs. 4 and 5) but adhered well to EGF-S, FN 6–8, FG, and GST (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting that the cysteine-rich amino-terminal domain of TN-R may be involved in modulating both the β1 and β2 subunits.Figure 4Repulsive effects of TN-R domains on 1610β1–4 and 1610β2–1 cells.

The second region of homology (SRH) is a highly conserved motif among AAA family members and distinguishes these proteins in part from the wider family of Walker-type ATPases. Despite its conservation across the AAA family of proteins, very little is known concerning the function of the SRH. To address this question, we introduced point mutations systematically into the SRH of FtsH and studied the activities of the mutant proteins. Highly conserved amino acid residues within the SRH were found to be critical for the function of FtsH, with mutations at these positions leading to decreased or abolished ATPase activity. The effects of the mutations on the protease activity of FtsH correlated strikingly with their effects on the ATPase activity. The ATPase-deficient SRH mutants underwent an ATP-induced conformational change similar to wild type FtsH, suggesting an important role for the SRH in ATP hydrolysis but not ATP binding. Analysis of the data in the light of the crystal structure of the hexamerization domain of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein suggests a plausible mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by the AAA ATPases, which invokes an intermolecular catalytic role for the SRH.

Duguet M. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 639-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Beyer A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2043-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Walker-type ATPases have two consensus motifs, Walker A and B. In addition to these consensus motifs, AAA proteins have another highly conserved amino acid sequence within their ATPase domain that has been termed the second region of homology (SRH)1 (4Swaffield J.C. Bromberg J.F. Johnston S.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A 200–250-amino acid residue sequence that encompasses the Walker A and B motifs and the SRH is named the AAA module, and proteins that contain one or two copies of this module are classified into the AAA protein family. Thus, the SRH is the defining feature that distinguishes the AAA family from other Walker-type ATPases. FtsH of Escherichia coli is the first identified prokaryotic member of the AAA family (5Ogura T. Tomoyasu T. Yuki T. Morimura S. Begg K.J. Donachie W.D. Mori H. Niki H. Hiraga S. Res.

It possesses one copy of the AAA module and at its C terminus possesses a Zn2+-binding motif, which is thought to be the catalytic center for proteolysis.

Kitagawa M. Mori H. Karata K. Ogura T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several findings have also raised the possibility that FtsH has a chaperone-like activity. Some ftsH mutations cause abnormal protein translocation and defects in protein export. In particular, it has been shown that the PhoA moiety of SecY-PhoA fusions, in which PhoA is attached to the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of SecY, is abnormally translocated (Std phenotype) in ftsH mutant strains (19Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Akiyama Y. Shirai Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5225-5229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These phenotypes are differentially suppressed by overproduction of other chaperones (22Shirai Y. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The data also indicated that FtsH binds to denatured but not intact PhoA polypeptide and that this binding does not result in proteolysis of PhoA (23Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The AAA family has been growing rapidly for the past several years with more than 200 family members identified to date. Members of this family are spread among various species in all kingdoms, archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes and participate in various cellular activities. The AAA family can be divided into at least six subfamilies: metalloproteases including FtsH, subunits of the 26 S proteasome, proteins involved in vesicle-mediated secretion, homotypic fusion, peroxisome biogenesis, and meiosis/mitochondrial functions. No clue to the common function of AAA proteins, besides ATP binding and/or hydrolysis, has yet emerged. There appears to be a confusing contrast between the extreme sequence conservation within the module and the diversity of function of the AAA proteins. There must be a very important reason for this high conservation of sequence both among proteins with a common function in evolutionarily distant species, as well as among AAA proteins with a variety of functions within the cell of a given species. Elucidation of the basic function of the module represents an exciting challenge, and it must provide a clue to understanding the common function of the AAA proteins. Because the SRH is a part of the ATPase domain, it is assumed to have some relation to the ATPase activity. However, there have as yet been no reports of an experimental investigation into the function of the SRH. To elucidate SRH function, we introduced a series of mutations into the SRH sequence of E. coli FtsH and studied their consequences both in vivo and in vitro. The results indicate that the SRH is important for the ATPase activity. AR3289 (sfhC21 zad220::Tn 10) (10Ogura T. Inoue K. Tatsuta T. Suzaki T. Karata K. Young K. Su L.-H. Fierke C.A. Jackman J.E.

L medium (10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g NaCl/liter, pH 7.4) was used. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added for growing strains carrying plasmids. pUC118 carries the gene for ampicillin resistance (amp R). pET29b is a plasmid vector of the pET system carrying the T7 promoter (Novagen). pKY297 carries a truncated ftsH gene that lacks the sequence encoding the two transmembrane segments and the Walker motifs (21Akiyama Y.

We checked the whole sequence of the cloned ftsH gene on pIFH108 and found a silent mutation of Ala163 (GCA to GCG) in the ftsH coding region. All mutant ftsH plasmids were constructed by replacing a segment of ftsH on pIFH108 with a mutated fragment. The numbering of amino acid residues of FtsH was according to Wang et al. (27Wang R.-F.

The Kpn I-Nco I segment of pIFH108 was replaced with each mutated fragment. 3) E418Q (GAA to CAG): the mutated fragment was produced by sequential polymerase chain reaction steps.

Tokuda H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Conformational changes of FtsH induced by ATP were analyzed according to the procedures described by Akiyama et al. (23Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of 2.5 μg/ml of trypsin. Samples were removed at intervals, and analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by immunoblotting using the anti-FtsH serum and detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 1 ml of culture (Klett unit = 50) was harvested by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were suspended in 100 μl of the SDS loading buffer. 20 μl of the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-FtsH or anti-ς32 serum (29Gamer J. Bujard H. Bukau B. Cell. 1992; 69: 833-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and detected by ECL. To examine the activity of mutant FtsH proteins in vivo and to purify them without contamination from wild type FtsH, it is necessary to use a strain lacking the ftsH gene as a host. Recently, we have identified a suppressor mutation, sfhC, that allows cells lacking ftsH to survive (10Ogura T. Inoue K. Tatsuta T. Suzaki T. Karata K. Young K. Su L.-H. Fierke C.A. Jackman J.E. Raetz C.R.H. Coleman J. Tomoyasu T. Matsuzawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 20Tatsuta T. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Kitagawa M. Mori H. Karata K. Ogura T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To take advantage of the efficient pET expression vectors that utilize the T7 promoter, we constructed a derivative of BL21(DE3) carrying ΔftsH and sfhC, AR5088, and cloned the ftsH gene on a derivative of pET29b, pIFH108. In this system, intact FtsH protein is expressed from pIFH108, and its expression is inducible by IPTG. We found that this system has an additional merit. In the absence of IPTG, expression of FtsH from pIFH108 in AR5088 was leaky such that levels of FtsH comparable with that derived from the wild type chromosomal ftsH gene are produced (see Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1, 2, and 5). This property allows the in vivo activity of mutant FtsH proteins in AR5088 to be assayed. In principle, FtsH cannot be induced from pIFH108 in host strains other than λDE3 lysogens owing to the absence of T7 RNA polymerase. Indeed as expected, we observed negligible expression of FtsH from pIFH108 in such strains in the absence of IPTG. However, somewhat surprisingly, in the presence of IPTG, the level of expression of FtsH from pIFH108 was comparable with that from the chromosomal ftsH gene (data not shown). Although the mechanism underlying this observation is not understood, this property was exploited in the complementation experiments with the temperature-sensitive mutant strain (see Fig.3). Several amino acid residues such as Thr300, Asn301, Asp307, Ala309, Arg312, and Arg315 in the SRH of FtsH are very highly conserved among the AAA family proteins (Fig. 1 B), whereas others are less well conserved. Changing each residue to Ala, in what is termed “alanine scanning,” is a useful strategy for identifying functionally important residues in proteins (30Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the SRH is important for FtsH function and, if so, which amino acid residues in the SRH are important, we introduced Ala substitutions into some conserved and less conserved residues in the SRH. Plasmids expressing wild type or mutant FtsH were introduced into AR5088, and the levels of ς32, which is one of the known specific substrates of the FtsH protease (8Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 9Herman C. Thévenet D. D'Ari R. Bouloc P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). In untransformed AR5088 (ΔftsH) or AR5088 harboring the vector pIFH100, ς32 accumulated (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). When wild type FtsH was expressed from pIFH108, the accumulation of ς32 was not observed (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). In the case of mutants of less conserved residues such as V296A, P303A, D304A, and G314A, the accumulation of ς32 was not observed (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6, 9, 10, and 14), indicating that these mutants have almost the same activity as wild type FtsH and that these less conserved residues are not important for the in vivo protease activity of FtsH. On the other hand, with the mutants of the highly conserved residues N301A, D307A, R312A, and R315A, ς32 accumulated to the same levels as those in AR5088 harboring the vector (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8, 11, 13, and 15), indicating that these highly conserved residues are essential for the in vivo protease activity of FtsH. In cells expressing the T300A or L310A mutants, the accumulation of ς32 was partially suppressed (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 12), suggesting that these mutants have a low protease activity. This implies that Thr300 and Leu310 are less important. Overall, these results indicate that the SRH is important for FtsH function and that there is good correlation between the functional importance and the extent of conservation of the amino acid residues in the SRH. Because highly conserved residues such as Asp307, Arg312, and Arg315 were found to be important for FtsH function by alanine scanning mutagenesis, we constructed further mutants that introduce less drastic substitutions at these positions. Specifically, we changed Asp307 (negatively charged) to Asn (polar but uncharged) or Glu (similarly negatively charged) or Arg312 and Arg315 (positively charged) to Leu (bulky and uncharged) or Lys (similarly positively charged). The mutants D307N, R312L, R312K, R315L, and R315K showed no detectable protease activity (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–12). The mutant D307E exhibited a low but nevertheless significant protease activity similar to T300A and L310A. Thus, the negative charge of the Asp307 side chain seems to be important for FtsH activity. On the other hand, the two conserved Arg residues, Arg312and Arg315, could not be functionally substituted by Lys even though the positive charge is retained with this substitution. For comparison, we constructed additional mutants that have mutations outside the SRH. The K201N substitution resides in the Walker A motif, which is believed to be essential for ATPase activity, whereas the E418Q and H421Y mutations are in the Zn2+-binding motif believed to form the active site of the protease domain. As expected, the mutants E418Q and H421Y had no protease activity (Fig.2 B, lanes 13 and 14). The mutant K201N also showed no detectable protease activity (Fig. 2 B, lane 6), confirming the notion that the protease activity is dependent on the ATPase activity. To determine whether or not SRH mutants retain the essential functions of FtsH for cell growth, the ability of the mutants to complement the temperature-sensitive ftsH1 mutation was examined. Wild type and mutant pIFH108 plasmids were introduced into the ftsH1 strain AR754, and the growth of the transformants was examined at 42 °C in the presence of IPTG (Fig.3). Under these conditions, wild type and mutant plasmid encoded FtsH proteins are expressed at levels comparable with that from the chromosomal ftsH gene (data not shown). Wild type FtsH and the mutants T300A and D307E, which exhibit a low in vivo protease activity, complemented ftsH1, whereas the other SRH mutants lacking the protease activity did not. Because the mutants K201N and H421Y also failed to complement ftsH1, it is clear that the ability of FtsH to complement ftsH1 is related to the in vivo protease activity. To examine the activities of these mutants in vitro, we purified wild type FtsH and the mutants K201N, T300A, D307N, D307E, R312L, R315L, and H421Y to near homogeneity. All of the mutant proteins purified in this study behaved as high molecular mass complexes upon Superose 6 size fractionation (see “Experimental Procedures”) similar to the wild type protein (data not shown), indicating that their oligomeric states are not significantly affected by the mutations. Using these purified FtsH proteins, we tested the in vitro protease activity toward the ς32 substrate (Fig. 4). ATP-dependent degradation of C-terminally histidine-tagged ς32 was observed only with wild type FtsH. Significant proteolysis was not observed with any of the mutant FtsH proteins. The low proteolytic activities of the mutants T300A and D307E observed in vivo were not detected in the less sensitive in vitro assay used. Overall, these in vitro results seem to be consistent with in vivo results described above. We measured the NTPase activities of the purified wild type and mutant FtsH proteins (TableI). Among the four nucleotides, FtsH hydrolyzed ATP and CTP efficiently. This is consistent with the observation that CTP, but not GTP or UTP, can substitute for ATP in the degradation of ς32 and SecY (8Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31196-31201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, FtsH also hydrolyzed GTP and UTP at appreciable rates. The reason that GTP and UTP do not support the proteolysis reaction is unknown.Table INTPase activity of wild type and mutant FtsH proteinsFtsHSpecific activityKm for ATPATPGTPCTPUTPnmol/mg/minμmWild type45921249312383K201N<10<10<10<10ND1-aND, not determined.T300A70<1054<10467D307N<10<10<10<10NDD307E40<1054<10817R312L<10<10<10<10NDR315L<10<10<10<10NDH421Y1073959136621-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The specific activity of wild type FtsH in ATP hydrolysis is ∼459 nmol/min/mg. As expected, the mutant K201N showed no detectable ATPase activity. This also excludes the possibility of significant contamination of any other ATPases in FtsH preparations purified by the procedures used. Among the SRH mutants, T300A and D307E, which both have low protease activity, have low specific ATPase activities of ∼70 and ∼40 nmol/min/mg, respectively. The other SRH mutants D307N, R312L, and R315L, which have lost the protease activity completely, showed no detectable ATPase activity. Thus, it seems that the SRH is important for both the ATPase and the protease activity of FtsH, presumably because these two activities are tightly coupled. Interestingly, the ATPase activity of the mutant H421Y decreased to about a quarter of that of wild type FtsH (∼107 nmol/min/mg), even though this mutation is in the Zn2+-binding motif essential for the protease activity. The H421Y mutant did not rescue the lethality of the ftsH1 mutation at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 3), indicating that the protease activity of FtsH is essential for cell growth regardless of its ATPase activity. As some SRH mutants showed defects in nucleotide hydrolysis, it is important to establish whether or not they are defective in nucleotide binding. We have tried unsuccessfully to demonstrate ATP binding by FtsH in gel filtration assays, ATP agarose chromatography assays, and UV cross-linking assays employing radiolabeled ATP. 2K. Karata, and T. Ogura, unpublished results.We therefore followed the procedures developed by Akiyama et al. (23Akiyama Y. Ehrmann M. Kihara A. Ito K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which allowed us to detect conformational changes in FtsH induced by ATP binding. As shown in Fig. 5 A, wild type FtsH undergoes a conformational change in the presence of ATP, which is characterized by partial protection of an ∼33-kDa ATPase domain from trypsin digestion. This conformational change is not detected for the Walker motif mutant K201N, which does not bind ATP (Fig.5 B). We examined three representative SRH mutants, D307N, R312L, and R315L, which showed no detectable ATPase activity as described above, for the ATP-induced conformational change. As shown in Fig. 5 (C–E), the ∼33-kDa fragment of all three mutants was protected from proteolytic degradation by the presence of ATP to a similar extent to that seen for wild type FtsH. Thus, it is most likely that mutations in the SRH do not significantly affect the ability of FtsH to bind ATP, indicating that the SRH plays a catalytic rather than simply a binding role in ATP hydrolysis. There is no obvious difference in the pattern of fragments generated by trypsin digestion of wild type and mutant FtsH proteins, suggesting that the amino acid alterations in these mutants do not significantly affect the overall structure of FtsH. In this paper, we have investigated the function of the SRH in FtsH. The results indicate that the highly conserved residues in the SRH are important for its ATPase activity. Among the"

Using homology-based PCR,1 we previously isolated a cDNA encoding a novel angiopoietin-related protein and designated it angiopoietin-3 (Ang3) (4Kim I. Kwak H.J. Ahn J.E. So J.N. Liu M. Koh K.N.

Based on amino acid similarity, their Ang3 and Ang4 are closer to Ang1 and Ang2 than our Ang3. Importantly, their Ang3 and Ang4 bound to the Tie2 receptor but not to the Tie1 receptor. Therefore, we rename our previously isolated Ang3 as angiopoietin-related protein-1 (ARP1). In this study, we isolated a cDNA encoding another novel angiopoietin-related protein and have designated it angiopoietin-related protein-2 (ARP2) because the amino acid sequence of ARP2 is closest to ARP1. Our results indicate that ARP1 and ARP2 share 59% amino acid identity. Notably, ARP2 was preferentially expressed in the blood vessels and skeletal muscles of developing rat embryos. ARP2 is a glycosylated secretory protein that induces sprouting in endothelial cells, probably through an autocrine or paracrine activity. Partial cDNAs of human and mouse ARP2 were amplified using human and mouse adult heart cDNAs as PCR templates. PCR was performed for 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 52 °C using sense and antisense degenerate primers representing all possible codons for the following peptides of human Ang1 and Ang2: GEYWLG (Ang1, amino acids 353–358; Ang2, amino acids 351–356) and SNLNGM (Ang1, amino acids 455–460; Ang2, amino acids 453–458) (1Davis S.

A DNA band of expected size (∼300 base pairs) was amplified. The amplified DNA was sequenced by cycle sequencing using the AmpliCycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). The novel amplified DNA was cloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). To clone the remaining coding region, human and mouse adult heart cDNAs were used for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (CLONTECH). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and porcine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PPAECs) were prepared from human umbilical cords and porcine pulmonary arteries by collagenase digestion. Human umbilical vascular smooth muscle cells (HUVSMCs) were explanted from human umbilical arteries. The endothelial or muscle origin of the cultures was confirmed by the presence of factor VIII or smooth muscle actin detected by immunofluoresence. HUVECs and PPAECs were maintained in M-199 medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. HUVSMCs and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The primary cultured cells used in this study were between passages 2 and 4. A 32P-labeled human ARP2 cDNA probe (nucleotides 1–464) and a32P-labeled mouse ARP2 cDNA probe (nucleotides 1–483) were radiolabeled by random priming (Prime-a-Gene, Promega). The human probe was hybridized to a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA extractions and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (6Kang M.J. Koh G.Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1767-1777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was performed essentially as described previously (7Kim H. Ko J.P. Kang U.G. Park J.B.

In brief, Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat 18-day-old embryos (E18) were frozen in prechilled isopentane. Sagittal and frontal sections (12 mm thick) were cut and thaw-mounted onto gelatin-coated slides. The sections were fixed, treated with acetic anhydride, dehydrated, and finally air-dried. An35S-labeled mouse ARP2 antisense (nucleotides 1–483) cRNA probe was transcribed using the Riboprobe (Promega) with [α-35S]UTP (New England Nuclear). Sections were hybridized overnight with labeled probe, treated with RNase A, washed sequentially in SSC, briefly rinsed in a graded series of ethanol, and dried. Slides were placed in x-ray cassettes, exposed to a-Max film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 5 days, and developed. Human ARP2, ARP1, Ang1, or VEGF165 cDNA was inserted into the CMV promoter-driven mammalian cell expression vector, pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen). This vector contains a 63-base pair c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) and a His6 tag (HHHHHH) as open reading frames at the 3′-terminus of the coding region. Each gene construct was transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 37.5 °C for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2. The culture supernatant of the COS-7 cells was transferred to a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) to purify the recombinant proteins. All buffers contained 0.05% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) during protein purification and reconstitution. The binding protein was eluted with pH 8.0 buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluates were dialyzed extensively against 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (TBS buffer) and were concentrated using Centricon 10 (Amicon) at 4 °C. The salts were removed using a desalting column, and the proteins were reconstituted with TBS buffer. Approximately 10 μg of each recombinant protein was obtained. The purity of this protein was determined by silver staining after SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes and confirmed again by Western blot analysis (6Kang M.J. Koh G.Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 1767-1777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by incubation in blocking buffer, incubated with anti-Myc or anti-His antibody, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and signals were visualized by chemiluminescent detection according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The glycosylation status of the recombinant ARP2 and Ang1 were determined with PNGase-F treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolab). Mitogenic assays in endothelial cells were performed as described previously (4Kim I. Kwak H.J. Ahn J.E. So J.N. Liu M. Koh K.N. Koh G.Y.

HUVECs between second and third passages were plated onto gelatinized 24-well plates (2 × 104cells/well) in M-199 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated for 24 h. Purified recombinant proteins were added to the growth medium, and cells were stimulated for 24 h. [3H]Thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1 μCi/well) was added to the cells, and stimulation was continued for another 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS and were lysed with 0.5n sodium hydroxide. The incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. The sprouting assay in PPAECs was performed as described previously (8Nehls V. Drenckhahn D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 104: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Koblizek T.I.

Briefly, PPAECs were grown to confluence on microcarrier (MC) beads (diameter, 175 μm; Sigma) and placed in a 2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen gel (Sigma) containing recombinant VEGF165 (10 ng/ml), Ang1 (200 ng/ml), ARP1 (200 ng/ml), or ARP2 (200 ng/ml) and 200 units/ml Trasylol (Bayer). Fibrin gels were incubated in M-199 with a daily supplement of the same amount of recombinant protein, 2.0% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 200 units/ml Trasylol. After 3 days, the extent of sprouting was determined using a phase-contrast inverted microscope (Zeiss). The secreted extracellular domains of the Tie1 and Tie2 receptors were produced using pFLAG CMV-1 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.), which has a preprotrypsin leader sequence for secretion of the fusion protein. The extracellular domains of human Tie1 (amino acids 28–752) and Tie2 (amino acids 27–729) were cloned into pFLAG CMV-1 in an open reading frame. These constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells, and the culture supernatants were collected for 48 h for the binding assay. These fusion proteins were designated as pFLAG-eTie1 and pFLAG-eTie2. Anti-FLAG M1 affinity gel (Kodak) was used for holding pFLAG-eTie1 or pFLAG-eTie2 protein. The gels were washed with binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4), and then the culture supernatant containing recombinant Ang1, ARP1, or ARP2 was added to this gel. The gels were cleared with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween-20). The gels were boiled with sample buffer, and the samples were separated by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE. Anti-FLAG-M2 antibody was used to detect the binding of the pFLAG-eTie1 and pFLAG-eTie2 proteins. Anti-Myc antibody was used to detect the binding of Ang1, ARP1, or ARP2. We used degenerate PCR of a human heart cDNA to obtain a product with a novel sequence related to the angiopoietins. We used rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR to clone the remaining coding region and designated the gene ARP2. The human ARP2 cDNA encodes a 493-amino acid polypeptide. Mouse ARP2 was cloned by the same methods and shares 89% nucleotide identity with the human gene. The 493-amino acid mouse protein shares 95% amino acid identity with the human ARP2 product. ARP2 contains conserved fibrinogen-like domains in the COOH-terminal portion. According to the results from BlastP (NCBI) and ClustalW programs, the COOH-terminal portion of ARP2 are shared by a variety of other proteins, including the following: human fibrinogen-related protein-1 (11Yamamoto T.

According to the ProteinPrediction program (EMBL), the NH2-terminal portion of ARP2 has coiled-coil domains, as do Ang1 and Ang2. The alignment of the deduced full amino acid sequence of ARP2 with those of ARP1, Ang2, and Ang1 is shown (Fig. 1 A). Five of the nine cysteines in Ang1 are conserved in ARP2 (1Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). When gaps in the alignments are ignored in the calculations, ARP2 is 34% identical to Ang1 or Ang2, 35% identical to Ang3 or Ang4, and 59% identical to ARP1. The probable evolutionary relationships of the angiopoietin-related proteins were found using the ClustalW program (Fig. 1 B). ARP2 is closest to ARP1. ARP1 and ARP2 are closer to the angiopoietin family protein than to fibrinogen or the lectin family. Northern blotting of human adult tissues revealed a major transcript of 4.0 kilobases, and a less-abundant transcript of 2.6 kilobases (Fig. 2 A). Both ARP2 mRNAs were abundant in heart, small intestine, spleen, and stomach; they were both expressed less abundantly in colon, ovary, adrenal gland, skeletal muscle, and prostate. Among mouse tissues, the larger main transcript and the less abundant smaller transcript were present in most of the mouse adult tissues where ARP2 mRNA was detected (Fig. 2 B). Although both ARP2 transcripts were abundant in heart, tongue, lung, and skeletal muscle, they were less abundant in the kidney, epididymus, and testis. Both sizes of ARP2 mRNA were observed abundantly in HUVECs and less abundantly in HUVSMCs, whereas they were not observed in HeLa and HepG2 cells (Fig.3 C). The result seen by in situ hybridization analysis in rat embryo (E18) was consistent with that of the Northern blot analyses (Fig. 3). The ARP2 mRNA transcripts were abundant in the walls of the aortic trunk, pulmonary trunk, and descending aorta and were also present in the tongue, abdominal muscles, and back muscles (Fig.3).Figure 3In situ hybridization of ARP2 mRNA in 18-day-old rat embryos.

Scale bar, 5 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The amino acid sequence of human ARP2 has a highly hydrophobic region at the NH2terminus (∼21 amino acids) that is typical of a signal sequence for protein secretion (Fig. 1 A). The signal sequence cleavage site was predicted to lie between amino acid 21 (Ala) and 22 (Gly) using the method of von Heijne (19von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that ARP2 is a secreted protein, COS-7 cells were transfected with CMV promoter-driven mammalian cell expression vector containing human ARP2 cDNA with a 3′-terminal extension encoding a c-Myc tag and a His6 tag. As a positive control, human Ang1 cDNA was expressed in COS-7 cells using the same methods. To detect the ARP2 or Ang1 protein, both the culture medium and cell lysates were examined by Western blot analysis with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig.4 A). A major ARP2 band of ∼64 kDa was detected in the culture medium but was barely present in the cell lysate (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, a major Ang1 band of ∼75 kDa was detected in the culture supernatant but was not present in the cell lysate. The observed molecular mass of the major ARP2 band was larger than its calculated molecular mass. The amino acid sequence of ARP2 contained two potential glycosylation sites, suggesting that ARP2, like Ang1, may be a glycoprotein. Therefore, the recombinant ARP2 and Ang1 were treated with PNGase-F (Fig. 4 B). Deglycosylation reduced the apparent molecular mass of recombinant ARP2 from ∼64 kDa to the predicted 57 kDa, whereas it reduced the apparent molecular mass of recombinant Ang1 from ∼75 to 55 kDa (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that our recombinant ARP2 from transfected COS-7 cells is an efficiently secreted glycoprotein. The inability of Ang1 and ARP1 to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation has been demonstrated (1Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C.

We examined the ability of ARP2 to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation by analyzing the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into HUVECs. Two hundred ng/ml of Ang1, ARP1, or ARP2 did not alter [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of HUVECs, whereas VEGF165 (5 ng/ml) increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA approximately 2.8-fold (Fig.5 A). These results demonstrate that ARP2, like Ang1, is not an endothelial cell growth factor in vitro. Ang1 is an effective inducer of sprouting in endothelial cells in vitro (9Koblizek T.I. Weiss C.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the sprouting activity of ARP1 and ARP2 in PPAECs, using VEGF165 and Ang1 as positive controls (Fig. 5 B). Although the control buffer produced a basal sprouting activity (approximate 3 sprouts per 50 MC beads), VEGF165 (10 ng/ml) produced a 14.8 (± 4.9)-fold increased sprouting activity compared with control (mean (± S.E.); Fig. 5 C). Although Ang1 (200 ng/ml) produced an 8.4 (± 2.6)-fold increase, ARP1 (200 ng/ml) and ARP2 (200 ng/ml) produced 3.4 (± 0.8)- and 6.5 (± 1.6)-fold increases, respectively. Ang1 and Ang2 are secreted glycoproteins with considerable sequence homology (1Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C.

Both bind to the Tie2 receptor with similar affinity, but neither binds to the closely related receptor Tie1 (1Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J.

We assayed the binding activity of ARP1 or ARP2 with Tie1 and Tie2 by in vitro protein-protein interaction. The secreted extracellular domain of Tie1 or Tie2, pFLAG-eTie1 (∼96 kDa) or pFLAG-eTie2 (∼105 kDa), respectively, was bound to an anti-FLAG affinity gel (Fig.6 A). As shown in Fig.6 B, recombinant Ang1 bound to pFLAG-eTie2, but not to pFLAG-eTie1, consistent with previous results (1Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E.

Angiopoietin family proteins have characteristic protein structures that contain a coiled-coil domain in the NH2-terminal portion and a fibrinogen-like domain in the COOH-terminal portion (1Davis S.

A. 1999; 96: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel angiopoietin-related protein from human and mouse adult heart cDNAs and have designated it ARP2. The deduced amino acid sequences of human and mouse ARP2 reveal that the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal portions of the protein also contain a characteristic coiled-coil domain and a fibrinogen-like domain, respectively. However, ARP2 is not an angiopoietin family protein because ARP2 has a low homology with Ang1 and Ang2 in the NH2-terminal portion, and ARP2 does not bind to either Tie1 or Tie2. According to analyses with the BlastP (NCBI), ClustalW, and ProteinPrediction (EMBL) programs, ARP2 is a member of the fibrinogen superfamily, which includes fibrinogens, angiopoietins, and lectins. We designated this protein as an angiopoietin-related protein for the following reasons: 1) the NH2-terminal portion of ARP2 has coiled-coil domains, like Ang1 and Ang2; 2) the evolutionary analysis indicates that this protein is closer to the angiopoietin family than to the fibrinogen or lectin families; and 3) this protein, like Ang1, induces sprouting in endothelial cells. Like the angiopoietins and ARP1, ARP2 has a highly hydrophobic region at the NH2 terminus (∼21 amino acids) that is typical of a signal sequence for protein secretion. The analysis and comparison of hydrophobicity profiles among Ang1, Ang2, ARP1, and ARP2 were performed using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (20Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17287) Google Scholar). These results indicated that ARP2, like Ang1, Ang2, and ARP1, mainly consists of hydrophilic amino acids (data not shown) and is likely to be a secreted protein. Indeed, COS-7 cells transfected with CMV promoter-driven mammalian cell expression vector containing human ARP2 cDNA produced a major ARP2 protein band of ∼64 kDa in the culture supernatant, but not in the cell lysate. Deglycosylation reduced the apparent molecular mass of the secreted recombinant ARP2 from ∼64 kDa to the 57 kDa predicted by the sequence. In fact, the amino acid sequence of ARP2 contains two potential glycosylation sites. These results indicate that ARP2 is likely to be an efficiently secreted glycoprotein. The expression patterns of the angiopoietin and ARP genes shed some light on their potential functions. ARP2 mRNA is widely expressed in adult tissues but is particularly abundant in adult muscle tissues, including heart, small intestine, and stomach. ARP1 mRNA is also widely expressed in the adult tissues, but it is expressed abundantly in highly vascularized glandular tissues, including the adrenal and thyroid glands (4Kim I. Kwak H.J. Ahn J.E. So J.N. Liu M. Koh K.N. Koh G.Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Ang1 mRNA is also widely expressed in adult tissues, although it is barely expressed in heart and liver (2Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ang2 mRNA is expressed only in the ovary, uterus, and placenta, which are the three predominant sites of vascular remodeling in the normal adult (2Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that different angiopoietin-related proteins may be required for maintenance of the differentiated state of endothelial cells or for vascular remodeling in adult tissues (1Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D.

Koh G.Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis are active during development. In mid-gestational mouse embryos, Ang1 mRNA transcripts are abundant in the heart and in the mesenchymal and smooth muscle cells surrounding most blood vessels, including the dorsal aorta and vessels of neural tissues, the somites, and lung (2Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ang2 mRNA transcripts are not readily detected in the developing heart but are abundant in the dorsal aorta and major aortic branches, specifically in the smooth muscle layer beneath the vessel endothelium (2Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that ARP2 mRNA is abundant in embryonic muscle tissues, including those of the aortic trunk, pulmonary trunk, descending aorta, tongue, abdomen, and back. The distinct but overlapping expression patterns of Ang1, Ang2, and ARP2 are consistent with the possibility that these proteins may regulate vascular development at particular sites and stages with different unique functions. The Tie family of receptors consists of two members, Tie1 and Tie2, or TEK (21Partanen J. Armstrong E. Makela T.P. Korhonen J. Sandberg M. Renkonen R. Knuutila S. Huebner K. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1698-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Tie1 and Tie2 are single transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases. Tie1 and Tie2 are expressed predominantly in vascular endothelial cells and some hematopoietic cells (22Ziegler S. Bird T. Schneringer J. Schooley K. Baum P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 663-670PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mustonen T. Alitalo K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Mice with a targeted disruption of the Tie1 gene die between E14.5 and birth. Death is associated with edema and hemorrhage, suggesting that the Tie1 signals control fluid exchange across capillaries and hemodynamic resistance (24Sato T.N. Tozawa Y. Deutsch U. Buchholz K.W.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Mice with targeted disruption of the Tie2 gene die between E9.5 and E10.5. In these mice, the normal number of endothelial cells are present, but the blood vessels are immature, lacking branching networks and proper organization into large and small vessels (18Dumont D.J.

Thus, Tie2 may control the ability of endothelial cells to recruit stromal cells to encase the endothelial tubes to stabilize the structure and modulate the function of blood vessels. Ang1 and Ang2 are ligands for Tie2 and bind to it with similar affinity (1Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C.

In vivo analysis by targeted gene inactivation reveals that Ang2 is a naturally occurring antagonist of Ang1. Ang2 competes for Ang1 binding to Tie2 and blocks Ang1-induced Tie2 autophosphorylation (2Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2974) Google Scholar). Both Ang3 and Ang4 bind to Tie2 but not to Tie1 (5Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ang4, like Ang1, is an agonist for the Tie2 receptor, whereas Ang3, like Ang2, is an antagonist for Tie2 (5Valenzuela D.M. Griffiths J. Rojas J. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Zhou H. McClain J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Huang T. Papadopoulos N. Maisonpierre P.C. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, ligands for Tie1 have not been identified. Given the similarity between the angiopoietins and the ARPs, we speculated that ARP1 or ARP2 could be a ligand for Tie1 or Tie2. Therefore, we assayed the binding activity of ARP1 or ARP2 to Tie1 and Tie2 using the secreted extracellular domains of the Tie1 and Tie2 receptors. However, neither ARP1 nor ARP2 binds to the Tie1 or Tie2 receptor. Nevertheless, ARP1 and ARP2 induced sprouting significantly, although they do not induce DNA synthesis in endothelial cells. Ang1 exerts similar actions in endothelial cells (9Koblizek T.I. Weiss C. Yancopoulos G.D. Deutsch U. Risau W. Curr. Biol. 1988; 8: 529-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 10Kwak H.J. So J-N Lee S.J. Kim I.J. Koh G.Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that ARP1- and ARP2-induced sprouting activity in endothelial cells is mediated through an unidentified receptor or receptors. Additionally, our results indicate that ARP2 mRNA is present not only in endothelial cells but also in vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, ARP2 is likely to exert its sprouting activity in endothelial cells by autocrine or paracrine action. In summary, we have isolated a novel angiopoietin-related protein and have designated it ARP2. ARP2 contains the characteristic coiled-coil domains and fibrinogen-like domain found in angiopoietins but has only modest overall homology to them. ARP2 mRNA is most abundant in adult muscle tissues, including heart, small intestine, tongue, and stomach. During development, the expression patterns of ARP2 are overlapping, but distinct from, those of Ang1 and Ang2. ARP2 is a glycosylated secretory protein that induces sprouting in endothelial cells through an autocrine or paracrine action.

Although numerous receptors that bind nucleotides have been identified, the complexity of this receptor family, combined with the lack of pharmacological agents specific for these receptors, has made the assignment of particular receptors and ligands to physiological responses difficult. Because ATP and UTP appear equipotent and equieffective in regulating ion transport in many epithelia, we tested the hypothesis that the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2-R) subtype mediates these responses in mouse epithelia, with gene targeting techniques. Mice with the P2Y2-R locus targeted and inactivated (P2Y2-R(−/−)) were generated, airways (trachea), gallbladder, and intestines (jejunum) excised, and Cl− secretory responses to luminal nucleotide additions measured in Ussing chambers. Comparison of P2Y2-R(+/+) with P2Y2-R(−/−) mice revealed that P2Y2-R mediated most (>85–95%) nucleotide-stimulated Cl−secretion in trachea, about 50% of nucleotide responses in the gallbladder, and none of the responses in the jejunum. Dose-effect relationships for nucleotides in tissues from P2Y2-R(−/−) mice suggest that the P2Y6-R regulates ion transport in gallbladder and to a lesser extent trachea, whereas P2Y4and/or unidentified receptor(s) regulate ion transport in jejunum. We conclude that the P2Y2 receptor is the dominant P2Y purinoceptor that regulates airway epithelial ion transport, whereas other P2Y receptor subtypes are relatively more important in other nonrespiratory epithelia.

Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Fedan J.S. The P2 Nucleotide Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 413-424Crossref Google Scholar). Of particular interest in this context is cystic fibrosis (CF),1 a disease that reflects widespread defects in epithelial ion transport due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (2Davis P.B. Drumm M. Konstan M.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 1229-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). However, the spectrum of epithelia affected by this disease (e.g. airway, gallbladder, and intestine), the diversity of P2Y receptor subtypes (3Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Dubyak G.R. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Schwabe U. Williams M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 79-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and the absence of selective reagents to define which P2Y receptor subtypes regulate ion transport have made it difficult to initiate therapeutic programs to target specific purinoceptors in these tissues.The strongest evidence for a role for P2 receptors in the regulation of ion transport emanates from studies of airway epithelia. Recent reports indicate that extracellular triphosphate nucleotides regulate many of the airway ion transport paths, including slowing Na+absorption (4Devor D.C. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C827-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulating Cl− and K+secretion (5Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Am. J.

Pharmacological studies in the human airway epithelial cell line CF/T43 have demonstrated that UTP and ATP are equipotent and cross-desensitize in promoting phospholipase C activity, leading to the hypothesis that the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2-R) is the dominant receptor mediating these responses (7Brown H.A.

However, it is difficult to distinguish whether the actions of ATP and UTP on ion transport are mediated by a single purine/pyrimidine-sensitive receptor (e.g. P2Y2) and/or a combination of other recently cloned P2Y receptors that are potently activated by ATP (e.g. P2Y1 (9Janssens R.

Data from the murine gallbladder suggest that both ATP and UTP are active in regulating Cl− and HCO3− secretion (17Harline M.C. Price E.M. Glover G.G. Garrad R.C. Weisman G.A. Turner J.T. Clarke L.L. Pediatr. Pulmonol., Suppl. 1996; 13 (abstr.): 284-285Google Scholar, 18Glover G.G. Harline M.C. Ortero M. Camden J.M. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Clarke L.L. Pediatr. Pulmonol., Suppl. 1996; 13 (abstr.): 285Google Scholar), suggesting that the P2Y2-R may be the major P2Y-R subtype regulating ion transport in this tissue. Early studies of freshly excised rat jejunum reported regulation of ion transport by ATP but not UTP (19Kohn P.G. Newey H. Smyth D.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1970; 208: 203-220Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More recent studies of triphosphate and diphosphate nucleotides in cell lines derived from the human intestine (e.g. CaCo2 cells) suggest that ATP, UTP, and UDP regulate enterocyte Cl− secretory rates (20Inoue C.N. Woo J.S. Schwiebert E.M. Morita T. Hanaoka K. Guggino S.E. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1862-C1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We report here the use of a genetic approach (21Koller B.H. Smithies O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 705-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) combined with traditional pharmacological methodologies to define the relative role of purinoceptors in the regulation of ion transport in epithelial tissues. Based on the reports of the actions of ATP and UTP in the epithelia described above, a first approach was to target a single receptor that could transduce responses to ATP and UTP equipotently. The P2Y2-R exhibits this pharmacology, and, consequently, mice were generated with inactivated P2Y2 -R genes using the homologous recombination technique (21Koller B.H. Smithies O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 705-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because triphosphate nucleotide effects on Cl− and water secretion are projected as the major therapeutic actions of these agents in epithelial diseases such as CF (5Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C348-C356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), characterization of these mice focused on the role of the P2Y2 receptor in mediating epithelial Cl−secretory responses. In a companion paper (23Homolya L. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26454-26460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the role of P2Y2 receptor in inositol phosphate formation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in tracheas and other tissues were characterized.DISCUSSIONNumerous studies report that both purine and pyrimidine triphosphate nucleotides regulate epithelial ion transport. Because the P2Y2 receptor was the first receptor cloned that was activated by both pyrimidine and purine nucleotides, many studies have tentatively identified P2Y2-R as the receptor mediating epithelial ion transport responses to triphosphate nucleotides. Based on comparisons of Cl− secretory responses in P2Y2-R(+/+) and P2Y2-R(−/−) mice, a surprisingly wide spectrum in the P2Y2-R contribution to ATP/UTP regulated ion transport was observed in the three different epithelia studied. The contribution ranged from P2Y2-R, being the dominant ATP/UTP receptor in tracheal epithelia, to the gallbladder, where P2Y2-R appeared to transduce about 50% of the triphosphate nucleotide responses, to the intestine, where P2Y2-R appeared to transduce virtually none of the triphosphate nucleotide actions.These observations led to studies designed to identify the P2Y receptors in addition to P2Y2-R that regulate ion transport in mouse epithelia. The following are candidate P2Y receptors that may participate in this regulation, based on reports of studies of cloned human P2 receptors: P2Y1, which has a rank order potency of 2-MeSADP > ADP > 2-MeSATP > ATP (10Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 31Palmer R.K. Boyer J.L. Schachter J.B. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol.

O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30845-30848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), P2Y6, which has a rank order of potency of UDP ≫ ADP ≫ UTP/ATP (28Nicholas R.A. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Li Q. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar, 33Communi D. Motte S. Boeynaems J.M. Pirotton S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and P2Y11-R, which has a rank order potency of ATP > 2-MeSATP and is not activated by ADP, UDP, or UTP (11Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). A problem, however, in assigning a response to these previously characterized P2 receptors is that homologous murine P2 receptors have not been pharmacologically characterized in detail. For instance, it is not known whether UDP is an agonist at the cloned mouse P2Y2 receptor (34Lustig K.D. Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and what is the rank order of potencies for ATP and ADP at the cloned mouse P2Y1 receptor (32Tokuyama Y. Hara M. Jones E.M.C. Fan Z. Bell G.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The importance of rodent data is highlighted by the recent report that the rat P2Y4 receptor is activated equipotently by ATP and UTP (35Webb T.E. Henderson D.J. Roberts J.A. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1348-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Bogdanov Y.D. Wildman S.S. Clements M.P. King B.F. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 428-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Additional concerns in a pharmacological characterization of P2 receptor activity are data indicating that agonists may not be receptor-specific. For example, α,β-meATP, which was originally thought be a specific and potent agonist for P2X receptors (37Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1985; 16: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), is only a relatively weak agonist at the P2X1 and P2X3 receptors (38Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 39Chen C.C. Akopian A.N. Sivilotti L. Colquhoun D. Burnstock G. Wood J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 40Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), while 2-MeSATP, which was originally described as a selective P2Y (P2Y1) receptor agonist (37Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1985; 16: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), is a potent agonist at most P2X receptor subtypes (41Evans R.J. Surprenant A. North R.A. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Fedan J.S. The P2 Nucleotide Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 43-61Crossref Google Scholar). The availability of mice with the P2Y2 -R gene inactivated greatly supplemented our pharmacological approaches to identification of the roles of other P2Y receptors in nucleotide-mediated regulation of ion transport.The concept of nucleotide-based pharmacotherapy for CF airways disease has emphasized the importance of defining the specific purinoceptor that mediates activation of Cl− secretion in this tissue (1Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Fedan J.S. The P2 Nucleotide Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 413-424Crossref Google Scholar). The data that describe the interactions between these ligands and tracheal Cl− secretory rates in wild type mice (Fig. 1) demonstrate the difficulty in using strictly pharmacological approaches (e.g. a combination of agonist dose-response curves and desensitization protocols) to assign a specific P2Y receptor subtype to an ion transport regulatory function. However, the combination of the Cl− secretion (Figs. 1 and 2) and Ca2+i data from a companion paper (23Homolya L. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26454-26460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) comparing the wild type with P2Y2-R(−/−) mice provide strong evidence for the first definitive assignment of P2Y2-R to a physiologic function. Thus, although costly and time-consuming, the gene targeting technique appears to be the unique approach for unambiguously defining P2Y2 receptor function in specific tissues.There were small (∼15% of P2Y2-R(+/+) responses) residual ATP and UTP Cl− secretory responses in the P2Y2-R(−/−) trachea as well as a small, persistent UDP response. The detection of a relatively high potency UDP response (EC50 of ∼10−6m, Table I) in the P2Y2-R(+/+) mouse trachea and its persistence in the P2Y2-R(−/−) mouse suggest that a P2Y6receptor mediated the UDP response. This observation is consistent with recent evidence of the expression of a UDP receptor in human airway epithelia (27Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Data describing the equipotency of 2-MeSATP and ATP (Table I), coupled with their cross-desensitization (Figs. 1 and 2), suggest that the P2Y1-R, a P2X-R, or the P2Y11-R accounted for the very small residual ATP responses in the P2Y2-R(−/−) trachea. The results of intracellular Ca2+ studies in the companion paper (23Homolya L. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26454-26460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) favor P2Y1-R as the “other” P2 receptor.Investigations of purinoceptor regulation of gallbladder Cl− secretion have focused on triphosphate nucleotides (17Harline M.C. Price E.M. Glover G.G. Garrad R.C. Weisman G.A. Turner J.T. Clarke L.L. Pediatr. Pulmonol., Suppl. 1996; 13 (abstr.): 284-285Google Scholar, 18Glover G.G. Harline M.C. Ortero M. Camden J.M. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Clarke L.L. Pediatr. Pulmonol., Suppl. 1996; 13 (abstr.): 285Google Scholar, 42Cotton C.U. Reuss L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 97: 949-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the wild type murine gallbladder, both ATP and UTP were equipotent and effective agonists, consistent with a P2Y2 receptor-mediated response (Fig. 3, Table II). The effectiveness and potency of UDP was consistent with regulation of Cl− secretion in P2Y2-R(+/+) mouse gallbladder by a P2Y6 receptor. An apparent major difference between the gallbladder and the trachea is that 2-MeSATP or 2-MeSADP were ineffective in gallbladder (Fig. 3), indicating that the P2Y1 receptor (and P2Y11-R) are not functionally expressed in this tissue.The data from the P2Y2-R(−/−) gallbladder indicate that virtually all of the ATP regulation of Cl− transport is mediated via the P2Y2-R. These findings were further supported by the absence of effectiveness of P2Y1-R agonists and adenosine. In contrast, about 70% of the UTP response persisted. The cross-desensitization protocols with UDP and the potency order UDP > UTP suggested, but do not prove, that both the diphosphate and triphosphate pyrimidine nucleotide responses are mediated by the P2Y6-R and point to the need for cloning and characterizing the mouse P2Y6-R (as well as the mouse P2Y4 receptor). These data suggest a role for released pyrimidines as well as purines in the regulation of gallbladder ion transport rates.In wild type mice, the equipotency of ATP and UTP, coupled with the partial cross-desensitization, suggested that the P2Y2-R transduced the Cl− secretory responses to both purine and pyrimidine triphosphate nucleotides in jejunal epithelium (Fig. 5). We do not know why the potencies for all nucleotide agonists were shifted to the right (Fig. 5 and 6), but we speculate that this shift could reflect diffusion barriers, e.g. mucus, or high rates of cell surface nucleotide catabolism. These data contrast with previous studies in freshly excised rat and guinea pig intestines, which had suggested a regulatory role of ATP, but not UTP, in ion transport (19Kohn P.G. Newey H. Smyth D.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1970; 208: 203-220Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar,43Korman L.Y. Lemp G.F. Jackson M.J. Gardner J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 721: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the data from the P2Y2-R(−/−) mouse unequivocally established that these responses in mice were not transduced by the P2Y2 receptor (Fig. 6; Table III). This observation requires an analysis of other P2Y receptors that transduce both purine and pyrimidine responses.It appears unlikely that the UTP response is transduced by the P2Y6 receptor, because UDP appeared to be a relatively ineffective agonist in jejunal epithelium and the UTP responses were brisk (Figs. 5 and 6). It is possible that UTP responses were transduced by a P2Y4-like receptor. If the mouse P2Y4-R exhibits a pharmacology similar to the rat P2Y4 receptor (i.e. UTP = ATP), the simplest hypothesis is that mouse jejunal ion transport is functionally regulated by ATP and UTP via P2Y4-R. Alternatively, if the mouse P2Y4-R behaves like the human P2Y4-R, i.e. UTP ≫ ATP, ATP and UTP might act on different receptors, which cross-desensitize each other.The effectiveness of ADP in stimulating jejunal Cl−secretion suggested the presence of a P2Y1 receptor. However, it is unlikely that ADP (or ATP) was interacting with a luminal P2Y1-R because of the failure of A3P5P to block these responses (44Boyer J.L. Mohanram A. Camaioni E. Jacobson K.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous reports indicating a predominantly basolateral expression of P2Y1-R in other epithelia (e.g. airways (45Homolya L. Grubb B.R. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Koller B.H. Pediatr. Pulmonol., Suppl. 1997; 14 (abstr.): 234Google Scholar)) suggest that the P2Y1 receptor was not involved in the Cl−responses to luminal ADP and ATP.There is little precedent for an ADP-stimulated response not mediated by the P2Y1 receptor. The most notable action of ADP on receptors other than the P2Y1 receptor occurs in platelets. ADP-promoted platelet shape change and aggregation involves three independent receptors: the P2Y1 receptor, a P2X receptor, and a yet unidentified receptor that couples to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (46Jin J. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2030-2034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In rat C6 glioma cells, ADP also potently promotes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by a mechanism that is independent from the P2Y1 receptor (10Schachter J.B. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Besides these observations, there are no obvious additional candidates other than novel P2 receptors to mediate the jejunal response to ADP.We conclude that the jejunal epithelium transduces Cl−secretory responses to luminal nucleotides by a quite different set of receptors than are expressed on the tracheal or gallbladder epithelium. The effectiveness of luminal ADP in stimulating jejunal Cl− secretion had not been reported in gut epithelia previously and was unique in the epithelia we surveyed. These observations may have important implications for potential therapies directed at this epithelium.In summary, these studies of tissues excised from P2Y2receptor deficient mice have identified a functional role for the P2Y2 nucleotide receptor subtype in the regulation of ion secretion. These studies have also demonstrated a diverse role for the P2Y2-R in this activity, the contribution being dominant in airways, intermediate in the gallbladder, and absent in the jejunum. Further, by eliminating the P2Y2-R from tissues, the studies have led to hypotheses that other P2Y receptor subtypes have ion transport regulatory activities in these epithelia. For example, we speculate that the P2Y6-R performs a relatively large (gallbladder) and small (trachea) ion transport regulatory function in some epithelia, whereas the P2Y4-like receptors are more important in others, e.g. jejunum. Since airways presently constitute the primary target for nucleotide therapy of CF (1Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Fedan J.S. The P2 Nucleotide Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 413-424Crossref Google Scholar) and targeting a specific P2Y receptor subtype linked to Cl−secretion would appear to be an optimal strategy, these data support the notion of the development of potent and selective agonists for the P2Y2 receptor as potential therapies of CF lung disease and expand the spectrum of receptor targets for other epithelia. Metabotropic (G protein-coupled) P2Y receptors are expressed in epithelia and regulate epithelial ion transport and, consequently, have become potential targets for drug therapy of diseases that reflect abnormal epithelial ion transport (1Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Fedan J.S. The P2 Nucleotide Receptors. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 413-424Crossref Google Scholar). Of particular interest in this context is cystic fibrosis (CF),1 a disease that reflects widespread defects in epithelial ion transport due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (2Davis P.B. Drumm M. Konstan M.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 1229-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). However, the spectrum of epithelia affected by this disease (e.g. airway, gallbladder, and intestine), the diversity of P2Y receptor subtypes (3Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Dubyak G.R. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Schwabe U. Williams M. Trends Pharmacol.

The strongest evidence for a role for P2 receptors in the regulation of ion transport emanates from studies of airway epithelia. Recent reports indicate that extracellular triphosphate nucleotides regulate many of the airway ion transport paths, including slowing Na+absorption (4Devor D.C. Pilewski J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C827-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulating Cl− and K+secretion (5Clarke L.L. Boucher R.C. Am. J.

Pharmacological studies in the human airway epithelial cell line CF/T43 have demonstrated that UTP and ATP are equipotent and cross-desensitize in promoting phospholipase C activity, leading to the hypothesis that the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2-R) is the dominant receptor mediating these responses (7Brown H.A.

However, it is difficult to distinguish whether the actions of ATP and UTP on ion transport are mediated by a single purine/pyrimidine-sensitive receptor (e.g. P2Y2) and/or a combination of other recently cloned P2Y receptors that are potently activated by ATP (e.g. P2Y1 (9Janssens R.

The classic components of this system include the serpentine receptors, heterotrimeric G-proteins, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A (PKA), and numerous downstream target substrates. Evidence is accumulating that some members of this cascade are concentrated within membrane microdomains, termed caveolae and caveolae-related domains. In addition, the caveolin-1 protein has been shown to interact with some of these components, and this interaction inhibits their enzymatic activity. However, the functional effects of caveolins on cAMP-mediated signaling at the most pivotal step, PKA activation, remain unknown. Here, we show that caveolin-1 can dramatically inhibit cAMP-dependent signaling in vivo. We provide evidence for a direct interaction between caveolin-1 and the catalytic subunit of PKA both in vitro and in vivo. Caveolin-1 binding appears to be mediated both by the caveolin scaffolding domain (residues 82–101) and a portion of the C-terminal domain (residues 135–156). Further functional analysis indicates that caveolin-based peptides derived from these binding regions can inhibit the catalytic activity of purified PKA in vitro. Mutational analysis of the caveolin scaffolding domain reveals that a series of aromatic residues within the caveolin scaffolding domain are critical for mediating inhibition of PKA. In addition, co-expression of caveolin-1 and PKA in cultured cells results in their co-localization as seen by immunofluorescence microscopy. In cells co-expressing caveolin-1 and PKA, PKA assumed a punctate distribution that coincided with the distribution of caveolin-1. In contrast, in cells expressing PKA alone, PKA was localized throughout the cytoplasm and yielded a diffuse staining pattern. Taken together, our results suggest that the direct inhibition of PKA by caveolin-1 is an important and previously unrecognized mechanism for modulating cAMP-mediated signaling. cAMP-dependent processes are essential for cell growth, differentiation, and homeostasis.

Caveolin-1 contains a 41-amino acid region that self-associates and induces the formation of caveolin-1 homo-oligomers that contain ∼14–16 individual caveolin monomers. It is thought that these caveolin oligomers are the assembly units that drive the formation of caveolae in intact cells (13Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C.

Caveolae are known to participate in vesicular trafficking (i.e. endocytosis and transcytosis), as well as signal transduction processes. Biochemical and morphological experiments have shown that a variety of signaling molecules are concentrated within these plasma membrane microdomains. This is particularly true of lipid-modified signaling molecules, such as Src family tyrosine kinases, Ha-Ras, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, and heterotrimeric G-proteins (15Li S. Couet J.

The clustering of these proteins in microdomains of the plasma membrane is thought to facilitate signaling events and expedite cross-talk between distinct signaling pathways (reviewed in Ref. 1Okamoto T.

A role for the caveolin gene family in regulating such signaling cascades is emerging. Recent evidence points to a functional interaction between the caveolins and certain classes of signaling molecules. More specifically, caveolin-1 binding can functionally suppress the GTPase activity of heterotrimeric G-proteins and inhibit the kinase activity of Src family tyrosine kinases, the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, and protein kinase C through a common caveolin domain, termed the caveolin scaffolding domain (15Li S.

A wealth of information is known about the events beginning with ligand binding and the subsequent intracellular effects. Briefly, the activation of serpentine receptors by their cognate ligands causes activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gs, in turn activating adenylyl cyclase and leading to the generation of cAMP. cAMP is bound by PKA1 holoenzymes, which are composed of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. PKA catalytic subunits, the main effectors of cAMP, dissociate from cAMP-saturated regulatory subunits and phosphorylate numerous downstream targets, thereby enhancing or repressing cellular processes and gene expression (23Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 24Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Much of this cascade initially occurs at or near the plasma membrane, given that G-protein-coupled receptors and adenylyl cyclase are integral membrane proteins. Diversification and subcellular regionalization of the pathway then occurs at the level of PKA, because various protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) can sequester PKA molecules until the arrival of liberating cAMP signals (25Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 26Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that many components of the cAMP cascade are concentrated within caveolae microdomains, and the caveolins have been shown to mitigate their function in vivo and in vitro. Several G-protein-coupled receptors have been morphologically and biochemically localized to caveolae (27Feron O. Smith T.W. Michel T. Kelly R.A. J. Biol.

AV12-664 cells, a tumor-derived hamster cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, AV12 cells were washed with PBS and incubated with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 50 mm NaCl; 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Where indicated, protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA reagent (Pierce). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (to visualize protein bands) followed by immunoblot analysis. All subsequent wash buffers contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, which was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) for the blocking solution and 1% bovine serum albumin for the antibody diluent. Primary antibodies (either polyclonal or monoclonal) were used at a 1:500 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Transduction Laboratory) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies with the Supersignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). To assess PKA-mediated signal transduction in vivo, we employed the PathDetect CRE cis- reporting system (Stratagene). In this assay, the luciferase reporter is driven by a promoter containing four cAMP response element (CRE) consensus sequences. Upon PKA catalytic subunit activation, endogenous CRE binding (CREB) protein is phosphorylated thereby allowing its interaction with CRE sequences and enhancing the transcription of luciferase. Transient transfections were performed using the Effectene liposome-mediated method (Qiagen) as described previously (35Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P.

Twelve hours post-transfection, the cells were rinsed with PBS, incubated in 1% fetal bovine serum and, where indicated, supplemented with either 10 μm forskolin, 10 μm dideoxy-forskolin, or 500 μm IBMX. Twenty-four hours post-stimulation, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of extraction buffer, 50 μl of which was used to measure luciferase activity as described (42Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Hollenberg A.

For the analysis of the effects of caveolin-1, caveolin-1 deletions, and caveolins-2 and -3 directly on PKA, all points were additionally transfected with 100 ng of pFC-PKA, a vector encoding the PKA catalytic subunit (Stratagene), and the cells were not serum-starved post-transfection. Each experimental value represents the average of two separate transfections performed in parallel; error bars represent the observed standard deviation. All experiments were performed at least three times independently and yielded virtually identical results. By using this CRE assay system, we have determined that transient expression of recombinant PKA increases total PKA activity by ∼4–6-fold; thus, the ratio between exogenous and endogenous PKA activity is ∼5:1. These results are consistent with Western blot analyses showing that recombinant expression of PKA increases total PKA expression by ∼5-fold (see Fig. 1, upper panel). The construction and purification of GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins was as we described previously (13Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl.

Briefly, full-length caveolin-1 (residues 1–178) and selected caveolin-1 regions (1–101, 1–81, 61–101, and 135–178) were subcloned into the vector pGEX-4T-1. After expression in Escherichia coli (BL21 strain; Novagen, Inc.), GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins were affinity purified on glutathione-agarose beads, using the detergent sarcosyl for initial solubilization (43Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). GST alone or GST-Cav-1 fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were extensively washed first with TNET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 150 mm NaCl; 5 mm EDTA; 1% Triton X-100) (3×) and lysis buffer (1×), both containing protease inhibitors. SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining was used to determine the approximate molar quantities of the fusion proteins per 100 μl of packed bead volume. Approximately 100 μl of equalized bead volume was incubated with precleared lysates of AV12 cells transfected with PKAα catalytic subunit by rotating overnight at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were extensively washed with TNET buffer and protease inhibitors (6×). Finally, the associated proteins were eluted with TNET buffer supplemented with 20 mm glutathione and an additional 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0. The eluate was mixed 2:1 with 3× sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The immunoblotting procedure was as described above using anti-PKAα catalytic rabbit polyclonal antibody IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary antibody. The caveolin-based peptides were synthesized using standard methodology and subjected to amino acid analysis and mass spectroscopy (Massachusetts Institute of Technology Biopolymers Laboratory/Research Genetics) to confirm their purity and composition, as we described previously (15Li S.

Purified bovine PKAα catalytic subunit (5 μg/ml) was incubated with caveolin-derived synthetic peptides and the truncated (residues 1–158) PKA RIIβ subunit in 100 μl of kinase reaction buffer (30 mm KHPO4, 12.5 μm cAMP, 625 μm dithiothreitol, 12.5 mm MgCl2) at 4 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 15 min at 4 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3× sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Bands corresponding to phosphorylated RIIβ were visualized by autoradiography using an intensifying screen. The procedure was performed as we previously described (15Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). AV12 cells transfected with the PKAα catalytic subunit and/or caveolin-1 were fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde, rinsed with PBS, and quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. The cells were then incubated in permeabilization buffer (PBS; 0.2% bovine serum albumin; 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min, washed with PBS, and double-labeled with a 1:400 dilution of anti-caveolin-1 mouse monoclonal antibody 2234 (Transduction Laboratories, Inc.) and PKAα catalytic rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 60 min. After rinsing with PBS (3×), secondary antibodies (7.5 μg/ml) ((lissamine-rhodamine (LRSC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse) antibodies) were added for a period of 60 min. Cells were washed with PBS (3×), and slides were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). A Bio-Rad MR600 confocal fluorescence microscope was used for visualization of bound secondary antibodies.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20448-20455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate its possible role in PKA signaling. It is well known that one of the important downstream effectors of PKA is cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein. CREB binds CRE sequences in promoters of cAMP-responsive genes (24Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser133 of CREB elicits a conformational change that enables CREB to promote transcription of downstream target genes. Thus, we employed a well established CRE reporter system (Stratagene, Inc.) to evaluate the in vivo effects of caveolin-1 expression on PKA signaling. In this assay, a series of consensus CRE sequences drive expression of a luciferase reporter. PKA directly activates CREB which up-regulates the transcription of the luciferase reporter. AV12-664, a tumor-derived cell line from hamsters, was chosen for this and subsequent assays because of its failure to endogenously express detectable levels of caveolin-1 (Fig.1). Therefore, overexpression of recombinant caveolin-1 in this system should allow us to assess the effect of caveolin-1 on PKA signaling. As shown in Fig. 2 A, caveolin-1 expression (driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter; pCB7-Cav-1) dramatically inhibits endogenous basal PKA signaling as compared with the empty vector (pCB7) or β-galactosidase. Most likely, this reflects the ability of caveolin-1 expression to inhibit endogenous PKA activity. However, this may still reflect the ability of caveolin-1 to inhibit signaling at the level of Gsα subunits or adenylyl cyclase, as well. To assess the effects of caveolin-1 in the presence of PKA pathway activators, 10 μm forskolin (a potent stimulator of adenylyl cyclase) and 500 μm IBMX (an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase) were used in the same assay system. Treatment with either pharmacological agent enhanced PKA-mediated signaling nearly 3-fold; in"
https://openalex.org/W2072477400,"UV irradiation of cells causes ligand-independent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. On the basis of dephosphorylation kinetics, UV-induced inactivation of receptor-directed tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) has been proposed as the mechanism of receptor activation (Knebel, A., Rahmsdorf, H. J., Ullrich, A., and Herrlich, P. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 5314–5325). Here we show that four defined protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), SHP-1, RPTPα, RPTPς, and DEP-1, are partially inactivated upon UV irradiation of PTP-overexpressing cells. The dephosphorylation of coexpressed platelet-derived growth factor β (PDGFβ) receptor by RPTPα is inhibited upon UV irradiation. UV converts RPTPα into a substrate-trapping enzyme which can coprecipitate PDGFβ receptor, similarly to the PTP mutant at the active-center cysteine: C433S. In agreement with the proposed mechanism that inactivation of PTPs accounts for receptor tyrosine kinase activation, no evidence for a UV-induced receptor cross-linking could be obtained in PDGFβ receptor-enriched membrane micelle preparations and in PDGFβ receptor overexpressing 293 cells. The intrinsic activity of PDGFβ receptor kinase was required for the UV-induced enhancement of receptor phosphorylation, but was not changed upon UV irradiation. The data support a mechanism of UV-induced signal transduction involving inactivation of PTPs through an unknown reactive intermediate that oxidizes the conserved cysteine in the active sites of PTPs. UV irradiation of cells causes ligand-independent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases.

One major class of surface receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, are primed to react to specific growth factors. Upon ligand binding, the receptor subunits mutually phosphorylate each other. The phosphorylated tyrosine peptide motifs then become docking sites for numerous proteins of the signal transduction network. Most data are compatible with the idea that the ligand triggers this activity of receptor tyrosine kinase by stabilizing the association of subunits (1Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 2Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). In addition to physiologic stimuli, many adverse agents such as carcinogens, metal toxins, oxidants, and radiation can induce signal transduction cascades and changes in gene expression. Ultraviolet (UV)1 radiation of various wavelength has received most attention. The response to UV appears to depend on several primary radiation target molecules (3Herrlich P. Blattner C. Knebel A. Bender K. Rahmsdorf H.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1217-1229PubMed Google Scholar, 4Herrlich P. Bender K. Knebel A. Böhmer F.D. Groß S. Blattner C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Göttlicher M. Comp. Ren. Acad. Sci. 1999; 322: 121-125Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, part of the immediate response to UV is mediated by the ligand-independent activation of growth factor receptors (5Sachsenmaier C. Radler P.A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 6Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Bos J.L. Kruijer W.

For instance, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are autophosphorylated within seconds of UV irradiation of cells in culture. The autophosphorylation appears to lead to fully functional receptor signaling, best shown for the EGFR (5Sachsenmaier C. Radler P.A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar). Several components of signal transduction, Grb-2, phospholipase C-γ, and Shc that contain SH2 domains or phosphotyrosine-binding domains associate with the receptors in UV-irradiated cells. In consequence, Ras and the Ras-dependent signal transduction pathway to Erk and several other signaling pathways (11Iordanov M. Bender K. Ade T. Schmid W. Sachsenmaier C. Engel K. Gaestel M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) are activated. From the successful activation by UV of receptor heterodimers the conclusion has been derived that a substantial fraction of the receptor tyrosine kinases are in dimer configuration in the absence of ligand and prior to the UV stimulus (Ref. 12Weiss F.U. Daub H. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, and references therein). How can an unspecific agent such as UV lead to a gain of function: up-regulation of enzymatic activity of the receptors? One suggestion has been, that UV causes cross-links of associated receptor monomers. The dose of UV that would be needed to substantially cross-link proteins, is, however, at least 1 order of magnitude higher than that efficiently activating the receptors. Clustering has, however, been observed for the tumor necrosis factor receptor after UV irradiation (7Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the clustering represents the primary event or whether it is the result rather than the cause of activation. An alternative suggestion has been derived from comparative studies of the kinetics of receptor dephosphorylation with or without UV irradiation (9Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). UV strongly retards dephosphorylation of both, EGFR and PDGFR. In vitro, irradiation of a plasma membrane vesicle preparation containing phosphatase inactivated the enzymatic activity, compatible with the idea that specific receptor-directed protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) could be the targets of UV irradiation, resulting in the inactivation of the catalytic PTP function. Also, other ligand-independent activations of receptor tyrosine kinases (12Weiss F.U. Daub H. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 14Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

A. 1998; 95: 8985-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) may be achieved by an interference with receptor dephosphorylation. Both concepts for the mechanism of UV-mediated receptor tyrosine kinase activation, PTP inactivation and receptor cross-linking, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Here, we present evidence that decides between the two proposed modes of activation: receptor dimerization or phosphatase inactivation. Although UV strongly induced PDGFβ receptor kinase activity, it did not bring the receptor subunits into the same chemically cross-linkable configuration as did PDGF. This result was obtained both in receptor-enriched membrane micelle fractions in vitro or in vivo in intact cells. Strongly overexpressed PDGFβ receptor could, however, be chemically cross-linked in the absence of PDGF, suggesting that dimerization can occur spontaneously. Spontaneous dimers are likely responsible for the UV induced activity in that we obtained direct evidence for inactivation by UV of PTPs. Several candidate PTPs for PDGFR and EGFR overexpressed in cells: SHP-1, RPTPα, RPTPς, and DEP-1, were inhibited upon UV irradiation. Pretreatment of the cells with the thiol-protecting agent N-acetylcysteine prevented the PTP inhibition by UV suggesting that the inactivating reaction involved a thiol group and presumably an oxidative process. The highly conserved cysteines in the active center of the PTPs may represent the decisive targets. In support of this interpretation, UV irradiation provoked the generation of a substrate-trapping configuration of RPTPα similarly to that introduced by replacement of cysteine 433 by serine. cDNAs for murine RPTPα (16Matthews R.J.

For introduction of a VSV-G epitope tag into RPTPα, RPTPς, and DEP-1, the respective DNAs were subcloned into the pBluescript II KS vector (Stratagene) and a Sac I site preceding the stop codon was introduced by polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotides VSV1 (5′-CTACACCGACATCG AGATGAACCGGCTGGGCAAGGAGCT-3′) and VSV2 (5′-CCTTGCCCAGCCGGTTCATCTCGATGTCGGTGTAGAGCT-3′) coding for the VSV-G epitope flanked by sequences complementary to Sac I overhanging ends were annealed in vitro and cloned into the newly created Sac I site of the phosphatase DNAs. The resulting DNAs were subsequently subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRK5RS (21Lammers R. Bossenmaier B. Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNAs of RPTPς and DEP-1 to generate C1545S RPTPς and C1239S PTP DEP-1 mutants in pRK5RS was accomplished using the U-labeled template method of Kunkel (22Kunkel T.A.

The C433S mutation of RPTPα was generated by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis using primers that carry the desired mutations and appropriate restriction sites to substitute the mutated for the original fragment of the phosphatase DNA. The structure of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. 293 human embryonal kidney cells were grown and transiently transfected as described earlier (23Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R.

A431 cells stably transfected with SHP-1 DNA, or corresponding mock-transfected A431 cells were obtained as described elsewhere 2T. Tenev, S. A. Böhmer, R. Kaufmann, S. Frese, T. Bittorf, T. Beckers, and F. O. Böhmer, submitted for publication. and cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Sciences). Cells were cultivated in 60- or 35-mm 6-well plates and starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% fetal calf serum overnight (transfected 293 cells) or in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 h (A431 cells). The cells were mock-treated or irradiated through the medium (2 ml in 60-mm or 1 ml in 35-mm dishes, respectively) with lamps from Vetter (Wiesloch) with the following characteristics. The UVA lamp (UVL15) emitted half-maximal λ between 335 and 370 nm with 11.5 watts/m2 at a distance of 8 cm; the peak of maximal emission was at 355 nm. The UVB lamp (UVM 15) emitted half-maximal λ between 285 and 330 nm with a maximal peak at 312 nm. The overall emitted light flux was determined with 9 watts/m2 at a distance of 8 cm. For UVC treatment the Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) was used. For all irradiations, the air in the Stratalinker was substituted by nitrogen gas to avoid ozone effects, and 2 kJ/m2 were applied if not otherwise indicated. Cells were irradiated directly in the dishes and PDGF receptor preparations were irradiated on microscopic slides (8-well tissue chamber slides, Nunc). For growth factor stimulation, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB (TEBU, Frankfurt) or 10–100 ng/ml EGF (recombinant human EGF kindly provided by Dr. R. Perez) at 37 °C for 5 min. Approximately 1 × 106 mock-transfected or SHP-1-transfected A431 cells in 60-mm dishes were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 h and treated with EGF (100 ng/ml at 37 °C for 5 min) or a respective solvent and subsequently mock-treated or irradiated with UVC light (2 kJ/m2) as described above. After 30 min at 37 °C the cells were washed once with PBS and then harvested by scraping in PBS and centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 5 min. The pellets were either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C or lysed directly in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Equal amounts of total cellular protein (50 μg) were incubated in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 20 μm H7, 20 μm HA1077, 2.5 μm protein kinase I, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) containing 10 μg of recombinant Hsp25 at 30 °C for 10 min. The kinase reaction was terminated by adding 4-fold concentrated SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The 32P labeling of Hsp25 was detected and quantified after SDS-PAGE using the Cyclone Imaging System and the OptiQuant software package (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). PDGFβ receptor was partially purified from hPDGFβR overexpressing TRMP cells (24Valius M. Kazlauskas A.

Then, ATP was added (2.5 μCi, 12.5 μm final concentration) and the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. Thereafter, the reaction was either terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer or a mixture of ATP and phenyl phosphate was added to a final concentration of 2 and 6 mm, respectively, and the incubation was continued at 25 °C for 30 min and then terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For cross-linking, disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce, final concentration 0.3 mm) or the respective solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration 5%) were included during the 30-min incubation and methylamine/HCl, pH 7.4 (final concentration 70 mm), was added before stopping with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–9% gradient gels and subsequent autoradiography or immunoblotting using DIG-1 anti-PDGFR antibody (26Kovalenko M. Gazit A. Böhmer A. Rorsman C. Rönnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Waltenberger J. Böhmer F.D. Levitzki A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6106-6114PubMed Google Scholar) for detection. For cross-linking of PDGFR in intact cells, the method of Tomaska and Resnick (27Tomaska L. Resnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5317-5322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used with slight modifications. 293 cells transiently transfected with hPDGFβR were irradiated with UVC as described and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB at 37 °C or mock-treated with respective solvent. The cells were suspended, transferred into microcentrifuge tubes on ice, and washed four times with ice-cold PBS. One ml of ice-cold PBS, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, was added per tube and either cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce, 1.5 mm final concentration) or dimethyl sulfoxide (1% final concentration) were added and kept on ice for 8 min. Thereafter, the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS, 10 mm ammonium acetate for 2 min, then washed two times in PBS. The cell pellets were extracted with lysis buffer as described below and the glycoproteins were enriched by adsorption to wheat germ-agarose beads by incubating the lysates with 30 μl of a 1:1 suspension of wheat germ-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer, and the adsorbed proteins were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed using 4–9% PAGE gels and immunoblotting with DIG-1 anti-PDGFR antibodies or RC20 (E120H, Transduction Laboratories) anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. To monitor the receptor dephosphorylation kinetics, autophosphorylation was carried out as described above. The reaction was then quenched by addition of unlabeled ATP and phenyl phosphate (2 and 6 mm, final concentrations, respectively), the reaction mixture was placed at 25 °C and aliquots were removed and mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer at various times (see figure legends). UV-irradiated or mock-treated samples of partially purified PDGFβ receptor were treated with PDGF-BB (1 μg/ml, final concentration) on ice for 30 min. Subsequently, ATP was added (200 μm) and autophosphorylation was allowed to proceed in the presence of 2.5 mm MnCl2, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, at 25 °C for 30 min. The kinase reaction was quenched by addition of EDTA (2 mm) and samples were incubated at 25 °C for 60 min. The samples were transferred onto ice and substrate peptide KY751 (corresponding to the sequence around tyrosine 751 of the PDGFβ receptor (25Kovalenko M. Rönnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Loubtchenkov M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Böhmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) was added to a final concentration of 3 mm along with MnCl2 (10 mm), sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/sample) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was incubated for 20 min and then quenched by addition of 10 μl of 15 mm EDTA, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μl of 40% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After 1 h on ice, the samples were centrifuged in a cooled microcentrifuge for 10 min, and 25 μl of the supernatants were removed and subjected to analysis of KY751 peptide phosphorylation as described earlier (25Kovalenko M. Rönnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Loubtchenkov M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Böhmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Appropriately pretreated cells were harvested with ice-cold lysis buffer (0.2 ml/35-mm dish) containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate. For phosphatase assays and coprecipitation experiments, the lysates were prepared in the absence of vanadate. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min and equal amounts of lysate protein (20 μg) were directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation of the VSV-tagged phosphatases the lysates were incubated with monoclonal anti-VSV-G antibody (V-5507 Sigma, 2 μg per lysate of one 35-mm dish) on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 1 h. After addition of 2 μg of goat anti-mouse Ig (M 7023, Sigma) and another incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and the mixture was incubated further at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation (10 s, 2,000 × g) and washed three times with 0.75 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoblots were prepared using Immobilon-polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, United Kingdom). For detection of phosphotyrosine, SHP-1, or EGF receptor, the blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and probed with polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (P11230 Transduction Laboratories) at a 1:500 dilution, anti-SHP-1 antibody (P17420, Transduction Laboratories) at a 1:2500 dilution, or anti-EGFR antibody (sc-03, Santa Cruz) at a dilution of 1:1000, respectively, followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti rabbit antibody (sc-2004, Santa Cruz) at a dilution of 1:4000. For detection of PDGF receptors or VSV-tagged phosphatases, the blots were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk and developed with polyclonal anti-PDGFβR antibody (06–498, UBI) at a 1:1000 dilution followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody or with monoclonal anti-VSV-G antibody (V-5507 Sigma) at a 1:5000 dilution, followed by peroxidase conjugated goat-anti mouse antibody (sc-2005, Santa Cruz) at a dilution of 1:4000. Cell lysates, PTP immunoprecipitates, and PDGFβ receptor preparations (see above) were obtained in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, and assayed for PTP activity using [32P]Raytide as a substrate as described earlier (23Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, Raytide (Oncogene Research Products) was labeled with pp60src kinase (UBI) at 30 °C for 3 h in a total volume of 30 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.015% Brij 35, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The labeling mixture was applied to a 0.5-ml column of Dowex 1X-8, equilibrated in 30% acetic acid, and the 32P-labeled Raytide was eluted with acetic acid and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. For the assay, an aliquot was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and redissolved in assay buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 20 mm dithiothreitol). The lysates or immunoprecipitates (diluted appropriately to yield activities in the linear range of the assay) were incubated in 40 μl of assay buffer with [32P]Raytide (30,000–50,000 cpm) at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 750 μl of ice-cold stop solution (0.9 m HCl, 90 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 4% Norit A). After centrifugation for 10 min, 400 μl of the supernatant were subjected to liquid scintillation counting. As previously reported (9Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) UV irradiation of cells causes efficient autophosphorylation of both the EGF and PDGF receptors. To investigate whether ligand-independent activation of growth factor receptor by UV irradiation involved induced dimerization, we chose the PDGF receptor for which cross-linking conditions have already been established (28Heldin C.H. Ernlund A. Rorsman C. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8905-8912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to activation in intact cells we elaborated conditions of sufficiently strong UV-induced autophosphorylation in vitro: UV irradiation of the isolated PDGF receptor in Triton X-100-containing membrane fractions from TRMP cells stably transfected with a human PDGFβ receptor expression construct (25Kovalenko M. Rönnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Loubtchenkov M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Böhmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). UV treatment of these preparations strongly increased PDGFβ receptor autophosphorylation, both in the absence and presence of PDGF (Fig.1, A, lanes 3 and 8 versus 1 and 6). This increase was almost completely prevented when the reducing agent NAC had been added before UV irradiation (lanes 5 and 10). Addition of NAC after UV irradiation led to a partial reduction of the phosphorylation signal (lanes 4 and 9) suggesting that the UV effect on receptor phosphorylation can be partially reversed by the reducing agent. Treatment of the preparation with the known PTP inhibitor vanadate increased the receptor phosphorylation to similar levels as observed with UV irradiation (lanes 2 and 7), indicating that PTP(s) are present in the receptor preparation which negatively affect the receptor phosphorylation level. Although the preparation had been subjected to several purification steps, endogenous PTP activity is indeed readily detectable using [32P]Raytide as a substrate (Fig. 1 B) suggesting that RTK and PTP are possibly naturally associated in the plasma membrane. UV, as well as vanadate treatment strongly inhibited this PTP activity, while NAC prevented and partially reversed UV-imposed inactivation (Fig. 1 B). Thus, increases in the PDGFβ receptor phosphorylation observed in this experiment can be strictly correlated to inactivation of the endogenous PTP(s). Interestingly, to observe the effects of vanadate or UV on receptor phosphorylation described above, incubation of the phosphorylation reaction at elevated temperature (25 °C, see “Materials and Methods”) was required, in agreement with the earlier finding that PDGF receptor dephosphorylation by endogenous PTP(s) in membranes or receptor preparations does not occur on ice (25Kovalenko M. Rönnstrand L. Heldin C.H. Loubtchenkov M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Böhmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate that UV affected receptor-directed PTP activity in the PDGFβ receptor preparations, the kinetics of receptor dephosphorylation with and without prior UV irradiation was analyzed. For these experiments, PDGFβ receptor autophosphorylation was allowed to occur on ice, then the kinase reaction was quenched by addition of unlabeled ATP and the samples were transferred to 25 °C. At different time points, aliquots were removed to evaluate the receptor phosphorylation level. As depicted in Fig. 1, C and D, receptor dephosphorylation was clearly inhibited by UV irradiation. We also wondered whether elevated receptor phosphorylation seen in the UV-irradiated samples would be the result of intrinsic PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity or secondary to activation of some other kinase in the preparation. Both, basal phosphorylation of the receptor and the UV-imposed increase were, however, completely blocked by the specific PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1296 (26Kovalenko M. Gazit A. Böhmer A.

https://openalex.org/W2130003736,"The signaling pathways activated by the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) to promote survival of monocyte and macrophage lineage cells are not well established. In an effort to elucidate these pathways, we have used two cell types responsive to M-CSF: NIH 3T3 fibroblasts genetically engineered to express human M-CSF receptors (3T3-FMS cells) and human monocytes. M-CSF treatment induced M-CSF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to these receptors. These M-CSF receptor events correlated with activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. To clarify that PI3K products activate Akt in response to M-CSF, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing mutant human M-CSF receptors (3T3-FMS(Y809F)) that fail to activate Ras in response to M-CSF also exhibit increased Akt kinase activity in response to M-CSF challenge. Furthermore, Akt appears to be the primary regulator of survival in 3T3-FMS cells, as transfection of genes encoding dominant-negative Akt isoforms into these fibroblasts blocked M-CSF-induced survival. In normal human monocytes, M-CSF increased the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and induced Akt activation in a PI3K-dependent manner. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocked M-CSF-mediated monocyte survival, an effect that was partially restored by caspase-9 inhibitors. These data suggest that M-CSF may induce cell survival through Akt-induced suppression of caspase-9 activation.

Phosphotyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of M-CSF receptors induce translocation of intracellular signaling molecules via SH2 interactions and activate signaling cascades, resulting in the activation of both PI3K-dependent and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways (12Yeung Y.G.

Akt promotes cellular survival by suppressing the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins and by suppressing the activity of the Forkhead DNA transcription factors. In monocytes, activation of the executioner caspase-3 appears to regulate survival (33Fahy R.J. Doseff A.I. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 1999; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and recently, Akt has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate caspase-9, thereby blocking caspase-3 activation (30Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R.

Because circulating monocytes do not proliferate and are precursors to tissue macrophages, these data suggest that Akt may also be important in monocyte survival. In light of these findings, this study was directed at identifying the signaling pathway activated by M-CSF to promote cell survival and at determining the role of PI3K and Akt in this signaling pathway.We find that M-CSF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of human M-CSF receptors and recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3K to these receptors in 3T3-FMS fibroblasts. Moreover, in these cells, M-CSF induces Akt kinase activity in a PI3K-dependent manner. Akt also appears to be central to M-CSF-induced survival in these fibroblasts, as dominant-negative Akt constructs block M-CSF-induced fibroblast survival. We found a similar M-CSF-induced signaling pathway in normal human monocytes, as M-CSF leads to Akt activation in these cells in a PI3K-dependent manner. In contrast, 3T3-FMS(Y809F) fibroblasts that do not activate Ras in response to M-CSF (14Roussel M.F. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1994; 18: 105-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) display Akt kinase activity when stimulated with M-CSF. Moreover, PI3K inhibitors block M-CSF-induced Akt activation and survival in normal human monocytes. We found that monocytes express caspase-9, and consistent with an important role for Akt in monocyte survival, caspase-9 inhibitors reverse apoptosis induced by PI3K inhibitors in M-CSF-treated monocytes. These data suggest that PI3K and Akt likely play an important role in M-CSF-induced monocyte survival.DISCUSSIONThis study begins to identify the signaling pathway activated by M-CSF to induce cell survival. Initially using 3T3 fibroblasts that express human M-CSF receptors (3T3-FMS), we have shown that human M-CSF induces tyrosine phosphorylation in the M-CSF receptor, recruiting the p85 subunit of PI3K. This M-CSF-activated pathway results in transient but significant increases in Akt kinase activity, which are not dependent on Ras activation. Akt activation appears to be critical for cell survival in response to M-CSF, as transient transfection of 3T3-FMS cells with the gene encoding a dominant-negative isoform of Akt significantly reduces cell survival as compared with cells transfected with vector alone or wild-type Akt genes when M-CSF is used as the only growth factor. We extended these observations to M-CSF-induced survival in normal human monocytes, a more clinically relevant model. We found that treatment of monocytes with M-CSF results in similarly transient but significant increases in Akt activity that are blocked by pretreatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Consistent with an important role for PI3K and Akt kinase activity in monocyte survival, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 also inhibits the ability of M-CSF to protect cells from undergoing apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We found that monocytes express caspase-9 and that caspase-9 activity correlates with monocyte apoptosis in response to growth factor deprivation or to PI3K inhibitors in M-CSF-treated cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that M-CSF activates monocyte Akt kinase activity, which, in turn, suppresses caspase-9 cleavage and apoptosis. More targeted studies of the effect of dominant-negative or overexpressed wild-type forms of Akt on monocyte survival were, unfortunately, not possible due to the difficulty of transfecting monocytes.Akt is a recognized mediator of cell survival in response to growth factor signaling (38Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 39Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J. Conzen S.D. Jordan J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Although the specific mechanism by which Akt promotes cell survival is still unclear, several important mechanisms have been described. First, Akt phosphorylates the serine residue at position 136 in the pro-apoptotic protein BAD (31Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). This, in turn, causes BAD to be scavenged and neutralized by the cytosolic protein 14-3-3 (31Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). In the unphosphorylated state, BAD heterodimerizes with the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, leading to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria, which promotes apoptosis (40Gil-Gómez G. Berns A. Brady H.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7209-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 41Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). This mechanism appears to be functional in modulating cell survival in c-Kit-expressing cells (42Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second proposed mechanism by which Akt promotes cell survival is through its ability to phosphorylate caspase-9, part of the executioner caspase cascade. Phosphorylation renders caspase-9 unable to be cleaved by the apoptosis-promoting activating factor-1 complex (32Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). It was initially thought that maintenance of caspase-9 in its precursor form suppressed the ability of caspase-9 to activate caspase-3, a protease important in the genesis of the apoptotic program (43Faleiro L. Kobayashi R. Fearnhead H. Lazebnik Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 44Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that caspase-9 may maintain biological activity in the precursor form (45Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), although phosphorylation of caspase-9 appears to suppress its activation in vitro (32Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that activated Akt likely phosphorylates caspase-9, suppressing its activity to promote monocyte survival.In addition to suppressing these pro-apoptotic proteins, Akt has also been recently shown to phosphorylate and suppress the activity of FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors (46Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar). Once dephosphorylated, FKHRL1 can translocate to the nucleus and activate the production of pro-apoptotic proteins to help trigger programmed cell death (46Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Akt may promote cellular survival through mechanisms in addition to its effects on BAD and caspase-9. Our study adds to these observations to show for the first time that Akt is activated by M-CSF and that the Akt kinase pathway is potentially important in normal human monocytes, presumably by suppressing caspase-9 activation. We also demonstrate that PI3K and Akt are important mediators of survival induced by M-CSF.This study suggests that PI3K and Akt mediate monocyte survival in response to M-CSF. Findings in mutant and transgenic animals support an important role for PI3K and Akt in the monocyte survival pathway. Transgenic animals deficient in the inositol 3-phosphatase PTEN or the inositol 5-phosphatase SHIP suffer macrophage accumulation and organ dysfunction (34Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R.

Interestingly, both PTEN and SHIP can suppress Akt kinase activity (23Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P.

Based on our findings that M-CSF induces Akt kinase activity and that Akt is required for 3T3-FMS fibroblast survival in response to M-CSF as the lone growth factor, we speculate that Akt may also play an important role in monocyte survival. Consistent with this, we found evidence for an important role for Akt in monocyte survival via M-CSF. PI3K inhibitors block M-CSF-induced monocyte survival and Akt activation, which ultimately results in caspase-9-dependent apoptosis.In summary, this study shows that M-CSF induces Akt kinase activity in a PI3K-dependent manner in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing human M-CSF receptors and in normal human monocytes. M-CSF-induced recruitment of PI3K to the M-CSF receptor and subsequent PI3K activity are critical in mediating the protective effects of M-CSF on monocyte survival. Transfection studies also demonstrated that Akt is a critical determinant of survival in response to M-CSF in these M-CSF receptor-bearing fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that PI3K and Akt are important regulators of survival in cell types responsive to M-CSF, at least in part, by suppressing caspase-9 activation. Given these data, these enzymes may represent potential targets for therapies aimed at limiting inappropriate monocyte survival in inflammatory human diseases. Monocytes are produced in bone marrow and normally circulate in the bloodstream for 24–48 h (1Cline M.J. Lehrer R.I. Territo C. Golde D.W. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the absence of growth factors, circulating monocytes die of apoptosis (2Mangan D.F. Wahl S.M. J.

The growth factor M-CSF1 appears to be important in monocyte survival (5Praloran V. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1991; 33: 323-333PubMed Google Scholar), as mice lacking M-CSF suffer deficiencies in circulating monocytes and macrophages (6Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W. Urbanowska E. Aukerman S.L. Pollard J.W.

Yeung Y.G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), although the specific intracellular mediators induced by M-CSF to promote cell survival are not well understood. M-CSF is a growth factor that has its highest biological activity as a disulfide-linked dimer (10Stanley E.R. Berg K.L. Einstein D.B. Lee P.S. Pixley F.J. Wang Y. Yeung Y.G. Mol. Reprod.

M-CSF dimers cross-link two tyrosine kinase M-CSF receptors (also known as FMS or colony-stimulating factor-1 receptors), inducing auto- and transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors (11Hamilton J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains of M-CSF receptors induce translocation of intracellular signaling molecules via SH2 interactions and activate signaling cascades, resulting in the activation of both PI3K-dependent and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathways (12Yeung Y.G. Wang Y. Einstein D.B. Lee P.S. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17128-17137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Similar to normal human monocytes, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the gene encoding the human M-CSF receptor (FMS gene) also activate these intracellular signaling pathways in response to human M-CSF (13Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7924-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing mutant forms of human M-CSF receptors containing a phenylalanine residue in place of the tyrosine residue at position 809 (3T3-FMS(Y809F)) do not activate Ras or undergo mitogenesis in response to human M-CSF (14Roussel M.F.

Cell. 1988; 55: 979-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). M-CSF receptors are structurally related to platelet-derived growth factor receptors (16Heldin C.H.

To promote cellular survival, platelet-derived growth factor has been shown to recruit PI3K to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and to activate the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) (18Franke T.F.

Compared with many different amylases that are able to hydrolyze only α-d-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds, maltogenic amylases exhibit catalytic versatility: hydrolysis of α-d-(1,4)- and α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds and transglycosylation of oligosaccharides to C3-, C4-, or C6-hydroxyl groups of various acceptor mono- or disaccharides. It has been speculated that the catalytic property of the enzymes is linked to the additional ∼130 residues at the N terminus that are absent in other typical α-amylases.

It is the polymer of glucose, linked by either α-d-(1,4)- or α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds. Starch is hydrolyzed by several different types of hydrolytic enzymes widespread in nature, most of which can be grouped in the α-amylase family (1Jespersen H.M. MacGregor E.A. Henrissat B. Sierks M.R. Svensson B. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Amylases are classified according to their enzymatic action pattern. Glucoamylases (EC 3.2.1.3) and β-amylases (EC 3.2.1.2) are exo-type enzymes cleaving glucose and maltose units, respectively, from the nonreducing end of starch materials by hydrolyzing α-d-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds. α-Amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) are endo-type enzymes catalyzing the cleavage of the internal α-d-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds of starch, glycogen, and various oligosaccharides. Pullulanases (EC 3.2.1.41) cleave the internal α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds of the substrate pullulan, which is the polymer of maltotriose linked by α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bond. Several groups of starch-hydrolyzing enzymes are known to harbor more than single enzyme activity. One group of these, maltogenic amylases (MAases;1 EC 3.2.1.133) exhibit unique characteristics that are different from other α-amylases (2Kim I.-C. Cha J.-H. Kim J.-R. Jang S.-Y. Seo B.-C.

The enzymes prefer cyclodextrins (CDs) to starch or pullulan as substrates in that the hydrolysis of β-CDs (seven glucose units) is ∼100 times faster than that of starch or pullulan (5Kim T.-J. Kim M.-J. Kim B.-C. Kim J.-C. Cheong T.-K. Kim J.-W. Park K.-H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1644-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the other α-amylases with the single hydrolysis activity cannot hydrolyze CDs or pullulan. MAases cleave α-d-(1,4)-glycosidic bond much more efficiently than α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bond. The enzymes hydrolyze CDs and starch mainly to maltose at low concentration of the substrates, thereby they are named “maltogenic amylase”. Different sugar molecules, including glucose, fructose, maltose, and cellobiose, can serve as acceptors for the transglycosylation. Compared with cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases (CGTases; EC 2.4.1.19), which catalyze the formation of CDs from starch by transglycosylation, the transglycosylation activity of MAases is much more inefficient because they convert the substrates mainly to hydrolysis products. The property, if not all, is shared by other amylolytic enzymes with different names, including neopullulanases (NPases; EC 3.2.1.135) (6Takata H. Kuriki T. Okada S. Takesada Y. Iizuka M.

The three groups of amylases are high molecular weight amylases because of a unique addition of about 130 residues at the N terminus compared with the other α-amylases containing the single activity of hydrolyzing α-d-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds. The C-terminal region of the enzymes (about 490 amino acids) exhibits some extent of sequence homology with the smaller α-amylases and contains invariant catalytic residues (1Jespersen H.M. MacGregor E.A. Henrissat B. Sierks M.R. Svensson B. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Unlike other starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, the three groups of the enzymes are intracellular enzymes. In Klebsiella oxytoca, the open reading frames for CDase and an extracellular enzyme CGTase are clustered on the chromosomal DNA together with genes coding for products homologous to the maltose and linear maltodextrin uptake system (10Fiedler G. Pajatsch M. Bock A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The finding suggested a starch degradation pathway where CDase is involved in the intracellular degradation of CDs that are generated and transported into the cell by CGTase and by a specific uptake system, respectively.

Biol. 1998; 277: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and references therein) revealed that this family of proteins has a common folding scaffold, the (α/β)8 barrel, and that the active site is located on top of the barrel. However, structural information of MAases has been lacking. We have determined the structure of maltogenic amylase from a Thermus strain (ThMA). ThMA shows optimum temperature of 60 °C, which is higher than that of any other maltogenic or similar enzyme reported so far. The structure reveals how the unique ∼130 extra residues at the N terminus modify the common active site preserved throughout the α-amylase family to achieve the distinct property of the enzyme. Initial effort was put into the structure determination of Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase (BSMA) whose crystallization condition we have reported (13Cho M.-J. Cha S.-S. Park J.-H. Cha H.-J. Lee H.-S. Park K.-H. Oh B.-H. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 416-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We suffered because of fragility of the crystals, especially in the presence of a heavy metal compound, and subsequently switched to the crystallization of ThMA which led to the structure determination of the both enzymes. Gene cloning and overproduction of ThMA was described recently (5Kim T.-J. Kim M.-J. Kim B.-C. Kim J.-C. Cheong T.-K. Kim J.-W. Park K.-H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 1644-1651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ThMA crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion from droplets containing 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 20 mm maleate, pH 6.8) plus 0.5 μl of precipitant solution containing 0.5 m lithium sulfate, 0.3 mammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6), and 4% ethanol (v/v), which were equilibrated against 1 ml of the same precipitant solution at 22 °C. The crystals belong to the space group P 61, with cell dimensions of a = b = 118.04 Å, c = 266.88 Å, and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Because of the large unit cell dimensions of ThMA crystals, all x-ray diffraction data were collected from flash-cooled crystals by using synchrotron radiation from TARA and BL18B beamlines at Photon Factory, Japan. The cryoprotectant solution contained 0.5m lithium sulfate, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1m BES (pH 6.5), 4% ethanol (v/v), and saturated erythritol. Data reduction, merging, and scaling were accomplished with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, 1997: 307-326Google Scholar). While searching for heavy atom derivative crystals, the (α/β)8 structures of various amylases were used as search models in the MR (molecular replacement) method. Low sequence homologies of ThMA to other typical α-amylases prevented us from obtaining a correct solution. To our surprise, the (α/β)8 structure of β-amylase (Protein Data Bank code1BYA) as a search model, which bears no meaningful sequence homology to ThMA, yielded correct positions of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit with CCP4 version of AMoRe (15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) (for the first solution) and with X-PLOR (16Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.843. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) (for the second solution). The translation functions were calculated with the highest peak with a correlation of 7.3% in a rotation search using AMoRe. The search found the highest peak with a correlation of 10.8% and an R-factor of 56.5%. The increase in the correlation coefficient suggested that the peak was a correct solution. However, efforts to find the position of the second molecule after fixing the position of the first solution did not yield a promising solution. A self-rotation search with X-PLOR yielded a very strong peak for ϕ = 7.5, ψ = 0, κ = 180. The first solution was rotated according to the noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS), and a translation search along the xy plane was performed, which was followed by a translation search along the z-axis to correlate the relative z-positions of the two solutions. The calculations generated the final solutions with an R-factor of 49.9% after a rigid body refinement. When examined on a graphics computer, the two molecules showed no overlap with symmetry-related molecules. Furthermore, the phase derived from MR solutions identified a holmium position in a Fourier difference map which coincides with the position located from 3.0 Å resolution isomorphous Patterson difference map. The successful MR demonstrates that initial phase information can be derived using available structures coupled with a correct prediction of the tertiary folding pattern of an interested protein. However, we do not understand why the (α/β)8 barrel of TAKA-amylase A, which should be more homologous to ThMA than the β-amylase (see below), failed to give a correct solution. It was not at all straightforward to solve the structure by using the phase information derived from MR, and additional phase information was obtained from three heavy atom derivative crystals (TableI) by MIR (multiple isomorphous replacement) method. Heavy atom binding sites were identified by Fourier difference analysis using the phases derived from MR. The heavy atom positions were used to calculate MIR phases. The MIR phases with the three derivative data had a mean figure of merit of 0.47 at 3.1 Å resolution and were improved by solvent flattening and by 2-fold NCS density averaging. Some parts of the partial model inconsistent with the MIR map were further truncated. A combination of the partial model and the MIR phases and a 2-fold NCS averaging at 8–3.1 Å resulted in a significantly improved electron density map in which many regions could be traced. The MIR phasing and density modifications were carried out using the CCP4 suite (17CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Crystallographic refinements, iterative map calculations, and model buildings were done using X-PLOR, CCP4 suite, respectively. The 2-fold NCS restraints were maintained until the last refinement. From the beginning of the refinement, 5% of total reflections from the native data set were set aside for monitoring Rfree value. The final model at 2.8 Å resolution consists of 574 amino acids with an R value of 20.9% and an Rfree of 27.0%. The model does not contain highly disordered residues 160–163, 259–264, and 277–280 for which electron densities are lacking.Table IStructure determination and crystallographic statisticsNativeHoCl3PtCl2(NH3)2Se-MetSourcePF BL6BPF BL6BPF BL6BPF BL18BWavelength (Å)1.07151.07151.07150.9789Resolution range20.0–2.820.0–3.020.0–3.020.0–3.1Rsym (outer shell) (%)1-aRsym = Σ‖Iobs −Iavg‖/ΣIobs3.4 (12.0)3.7 (13.6)4.0 (12.2)4.4 (13.6)Completeness (%)94.387.685.784.8 (outer shell)(87.3)(75.4)(67.8)(67.6)Rscale (%)12.116.113.2Phasing power (acen/cen)0.7/0.91.0/1.30.8/1.1Rcullis(acen/cen)0.81/0.720.82/0.730.88/0.75Number of sites1137Figure of merit (20–3.1 Å)1-bFigure of merit = <‖ΣP (α)e iα/ΣP (α)‖>, where α is the phase and P (α) is the phase probability distribution.(acen/cent/all)0.46/0.59/0.47Number of refined atoms, Protein/water/erythritol9312/285/2R-factor/Rfree1-cR-factor = Σ∥Fo‖ − ‖Fc∥/Σ‖Fo‖, where ‖Fo‖ and ‖Fc‖ are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes respectively.,1-dRfree was calculated with 5% of the data.20.9/27.0r.m.s.deviation bond lengths/angles0.005/1.1171-a Rsym = Σ‖Iobs −Iavg‖/ΣIobs1-b Figure of merit = <‖ΣP (α)e iα/ΣP (α)‖>, where α is the phase and P (α) is the phase probability distribution.1-c R-factor = Σ∥Fo‖ − ‖Fc∥/Σ‖Fo‖, where ‖Fo‖ and ‖Fc‖ are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes respectively.1-d Rfree was calculated with 5% of the data. Open table in a new tab The refined dimeric structure of ThMA was used to determine the structure of BSMA by MR, which shares 69% sequence identity to ThMA. Contrary to our earlier prediction that the asymmetric unit of BSMA crystals would contain three to four molecules (13Cho M.-J. Cha S.-S. Park J.-H. Cha H.-J. Lee H.-S. Park K.-H. Oh B.-H. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 416-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), only one dimer is present with a high solvent content of 70.1%. The BSMA structure is very similar to that of ThMA and is not discussed in detail in this report. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed at 20 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, using a four-hole rotor with standard double sector cell at a rotor speed of 10,000 rpm. The values of the two variables, absorbances at 280 nm versus radial positions were obtained. The apparent molecular weight of ThMA was calculated by fitting data sets to a single species model using the software BMPD-Nonlinear regression. The partial specific volume of ThMA and solvent density were calculated as described by Zamyatnin (18Zamyatnin A.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 145-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Fig. 1shows sequence alignments of MAases, NPase, CDase, and Aspergillus oryzae TAKA-amylase A, which is listed as the most homologous smaller α-amylase in a sequence alignment search using the BLAST algorithm (19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 129 amino acids and the C-terminal ∼30 amino acids in the former three enzymes are completely absent in TAKA-amylase A. The central region exhibits a low degree of sequence homology, but the three catalytic residues, Asp-328, Glu-357, and Asp-424 (ThMA numbering) are invariant. The structure of ThMA can be divided into three distinct domains, the N-domain (residues 1–124) composed of β-strands exclusively, the central (α/β)8barrel domain, and the C-domain composed of eight β-strands (residues 505–588) (Fig. 3). Superposition of the structures of ThMA and TAKA-amylase A reveals that the C-domain as well as the (α/β)8 barrel of the two enzymes are structurally conserved in contrary to the sequence alignment. However, a structural domain corresponding to the N-domain of ThMA is totally absent in the structure of TAKA-amylase A. It is a β-sandwich-like structure composed of 12 anti-parallel β-strands (Fig. 3). The domain is distinctively separated from the central body of the ThMA structure, but it is involved in extensive interactions with the (α/β)8 domain of the adjacent molecule in the asymmetric unit. A total of 1390 Å2 in solvent accessible surface of one molecule is excluded by the interactions, which is an indication of a dimer formation of the enzyme in solution. More than two-thirds of the excluded surface is hydrophobic surface. The observation led us to run ThMA on a size exclusion column to find that the enzyme was eluted as if the apparent molecular weight of the enzyme is ∼130,000, close to the calculated dimeric molecular weight (136, 414) (Fig. 2 a). An ultracentrifugation analysis further evidenced the dimerization of ThMA in solution as shown in Fig. 2 b. BSMA exhibits the same chromatographic profile and is also dimeric with tertiary and quaternary structures nearly identical to those of ThMA. Therefore, it is firmly established that MAases are dimeric in solution. Very recently, the crystal structure of a related enzyme, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris R-47-amylase II (TVAII) hydrolyzing cyclodextrins and pullulan, was reported (20Kamitori S. Kondo S. Okuyama K. Yokota T. Shimura Y. Tonozuka T. Sakano Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 907-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) which shows 44% sequence identity to ThMA. The overall structure of TVAII is very similar to that of ThMA. Two molecules of TVAII were also contained in the asymmetric unit of the crystals of the enzyme (space group P 212121). The two molecules exhibit the same molecular contacts as the ThMA dimer does. Although the oligomerization state of TVAII was not investigated, the cumulative evidence strongly suggest that TVAII and other homologous enzymes classified as CDases and NPases should be dimeric in solution. Therefore, the substrate profile and catalytic property of these enzymes would be best explained by the active site configuration in the dimeric state.Figure 3a, stereoview of Cα tracings of the ThMA monomer.

The N-terminal domain of one subunit covers a part of the top of the (α/β)8 barrel of the other subunit, which corresponds to the active site cleft of all the known α- or β-amylases. As a result, the dimer interface at the top of the barrel forms a narrow and deep groove that is ∼17 Å in length, ∼8 Å in width, and ∼18 Å in depth, distinctively different from the wide and shallow active site clefts of the smaller α-amlyases. The groove must be the active site cleft because the three invariant catalytic residues are located at the bottom of the groove. They are found in the same relative position in space as the corresponding residues in TAKA-amylase A. The shape of the active site cleft of ThMA explains much slower hydrolysis of starch than CDs by the enzyme. The ring structures of CDs should be narrower in width than that of starch segment (amylose), which assumes a coiled helical structure composed of six, seven, or eight glucose residues per turn of the helix in aqueous solution (21Szejtli J. August S. Richter M. Biopolymers. 1967; 5: 5-10Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A CD fits into the groove snugly as it can be represented by a hypothetical binding mode of β-CD, docked computationally into the groove (Fig.3 c) using the “solid docking” module in QUANTA (Molecular Simulation, Inc.). The program allows a successful docking only when an electrostatic and geometric complementarity is accomplished between a host and a guest molecule. The deep groove is well occupied by the ring structure of the β-CD and many residues from both the (α/β)8 barrel and N-terminal domains are involved in favorable interactions with the modeled β-CD as shown in a close-up view of the substrate-binding model (Fig. 5). At the bottom of the cleft, one of the glycosidic bonds of the β-CD is located close to the catalytic residues. The catalytic residues of ThMA would be reached only by the disordered part of starch. Pullulan, a branched molecule by the presence of α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bond, would not reach the catalytic residues as easily as CDs either. Unlike CGTase, ThMA mainly cleaves glycosidic bonds at the beginning of the enzyme reaction, and transglycosylation products are detected after a time lag when cleavage products are accumulated. The observation raises a possibility that the transglycosylation by ThMA is the reverse reaction of the hydrolysis driven by a high concentration of small oligosaccharide products. We established that it is not the case for ThMA. Acarbose, a pseudo-tetrasaccharide that acts like a transition-state analogue with α-amylases, is cleaved by ThMA to produce pseudo-trisaccharide (PTS), glucose, and branched PTSs as transglycosylation products (Fig. 4). PTS can be recovered in pure form from an enzyme reaction mixture. When PTS and glucose, both in large amounts, reacted with ThMA, no transglycosylation product was formed. Therefore, the transglycosylation reaction by ThMA is concomittant with the hydrolysis of glycosidic bond. Catalysis by α-amylases is widely believed to proceed via a double-displacement reaction, in which a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is formed and subsequently hydrolyzed (22Koshland Jr., D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 23Tao B.Y. Reilly P.J. Robyt J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 995: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Given this mechanism and the fact that the transglycosylation reaction requires a high concentration of an acceptor sugar, it is reasonable to think that the acceptor molecule competes with a water molecule at the active site for attacking the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. The assumption requires a sugar-binding site adjacent to the main substrate-binding site. Consistently, an extra space, lined by both the N-domain and the (α/β)8barrel, is found deep at the bottom of the active site cleft (Fig.5). A corresponding space is not found in the smaller amylases. Restrained substrates, such as CD, cannot reach the space as the bound β-CD model suggests. The size of the space appears to accommodate a disaccharide such as maltose rather easily, as a maltose molecule can be successfully docked into the space (Fig.5 b). In this model, the C4-OH group of a maltose at the nonreducing end is 3.6 Å away from Glu-357. There is some degree of freedom to rotate and translate the model without steric clash. We propose that the space (referred as “extra sugar-binding space”) is responsible for the transglycosylation activity of ThMA. A mono- or disaccharide occupying the space could serve as an acceptor molecule to compete with a water molecule for attacking enzyme-substrate intermediate catalyzed by the same catalytic armory as shown in Fig.6. In the extra sugar-binding space, an acceptor sugar molecule may be able to position either the C3-, C4-, or C6-OH group in a proper orientation for nucleophilic attack of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. The idea of extra sugar-binding space playing an important role in the transglycosylation explains the effect of Glu-332 mutation. We found that Glu-332 is absolutely conserved among 13 different related enzymes known so far, and the corresponding residue in the smaller α-amylases is conserved as histidine (24Nakajima R. Imanaka T. Aiba S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1986; 23: 355-360Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). While the latter is known to be important for substrate-binding, Glu-332 in ThMA is located at the extra sugar-binding space and does not interact with the bound β-CD model. Substitution of the residue by histidine results in the drastic reduction of α-d-(1,6)-transglycosylation products without affecting the hydrolysis activity. The residue is at hydrogen bonding distance from the modeled maltose molecule. In the context of our proposal, Glu-332 appears to play an important role in the binding of small oligosaccharide acceptors.Figure 6Proposed mechanism for competition of transglycosylation and hydrolysis reaction at the active site of ThMA. A proposal for a double-displacement reaction is followed. The third conserved residue Asp-424, which may play a role in raising the p Ka of Glu-357 (30McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), is not drawn.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ThMA is able to cleave α-d-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds of pullulan, although it does so inefficiently. It can also cleave α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds of pullulan and small oligosaccharides. The cleavage is inefficient, and therefore, branched products resulting from the α-d-(1,6)-transglycosylation can be accumulated. The extra sugar-binding space, we propose, is also responsible for accommodating branched substrate into the active site cleft for cleavage. It was able to place a short pullulan molecule containing two maltotriose units into the active site cleft without a severe steric clash so that an α-d-(1,4)-glycosidic bond after a maltose unit is positioned close to the catalytic residues. Clearly, the extra sugar-binding space was necessary in fitting the molecule. MAases, NPases, and CDases are intracellular enzymes, which implicates their biological roles in metabolizing small oligosaccharides, including CDs imported into the cells for energy generation, and storing them in the form of branched oligosaccharides under the condition of high concentration of glucose or maltose. A closely linked enzyme, CGTase, is hypothesized to have evolved from an ancestral hydrolase on the basis of sequence and phylogenetic analysis (26del-Rio G. Morett E. Soberon X. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The conservation of the common (α/β)8 barrel and C-domain in the structure of ThMA also indicates that the three groups of the enzymes are likely to have evolved from a common ancestor. Probably, these enzymes add a significant adaptive value to organisms by enabling efficient metabolism of starch materials. Most members belonging to the α-amylase family exhibit the single activity of hydrolyzing α-d-(1,4)-glycosidic bond. The unique addition of ∼130 residues at the N terminus of these enzymes compared with the other amylases has been speculated to be responsible for a rarely found example of an enzyme acquiring a new catalytic activity. We proved that ThMA is a homodimer in solution. As far as we know, there is no small molecular weight α-amylase whose functional unit is a multimer. The most salient feature of the dimer is that the unique N-terminal domain of one subunit comprises the active site together with the (α/β)8 barrel of the other subunit. The active site is otherwise similar to those of the smaller α-amylases in that it is located at one end of the (α/β)8 barrel and contains the invariant catalytic residues at similar spatial position. The unique N-terminal domain of ThMA and probably of the related enzymes plays a major role in the modification of the common active site structure through the dimer formation for acquiring the distinct substrate profile and new catalytic property. Both the transglycosylation and the hydrolysis of α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bond by ThMA are explained on the basis of the structural analysis and modeling with support from the biochemical and the mutagenesis studies. It is surprising that the new catalytic activities are gained not by creating a new catalytic residue, but most likely by creating the extra sugar-binding space at the active site. Although our explanation needs elaboration by structural elucidation of the enzymes in complex with different substrates or analogues, the current model may serve as a paradigm for other members of amylases with the activities of transglycosylation and hydrolysis of α-d-(1,4)- and α-d-(1,6)-glycosidic bonds. Finally, the natural design of the transglycosylation activity of the enzyme at high concentration of acceptor sugar molecules may now be altered for biotechnological applications to produce branched oligosaccharides with higher efficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2076458548,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a potent cytokine with multiple biological activities and exists in two forms as follows: a 17-kDa soluble form that is a cleaved product of the 26-kDa transmembrane form (mTNFα). It has been suggested that the transmembrane form of TNFα is mainly responsible for localized responses via cell-cell contact. Here, we have examined the activities of transmembrane TNFα in cultured adipocytes. A non-cleavable transmembrane form of TNFα (mTNFΔ1–9K11E) was expressed in several preadipocyte cell lines using retroviral gene transfer. In wild type preadipocytes carrying both TNF receptors, expression of mTNFΔ1–9K11E resulted in inhibition of the differentiation program. The extent of this varied depending on the nature and strength of the adipogenic stimuli. The TNF receptor responsible for this function was determined by expressing mTNFΔ1–9K11E in preadipocyte cell lines lacking either TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), 2 (TNFR2), or both. In order to confirm the results in the same cellular background, TNF receptors were also reconstituted in the cell lines lacking corresponding receptors. These experiments demonstrated that TNFR1 was necessary and sufficient for mediating mTNFΔ1–9K11E-induced inhibition of adipogenesis and that this action was similar to that of soluble TNFα. In conclusion, our results indicate that mTNFΔ1–9K11E is biologically active in cultured adipocytes and can alter the adipogenic program of these cells by selectively activating TNFR1. This may have physiological implications where local TNFα actions are thought to be generated at sites such as adipose tissue.

It exists in two forms as follows: a 17-kDa soluble form (sTNFα) that is cleaved from the 26-kDa transmembrane protein (mTNFα) at the cell surface by TNFα-converting enzyme (5Moss M.L. Jin S.L. Milla M.E. Burkhart W. Carter H.L. Chen W.J. Clay W.C. Didsbury J.R. Hassler D. Hoffman C.R. Kost T.A. Lambert M.H. Leesnitzer M.A. McCauley P. McGeehan G. Mitchell J. Moyer M. Pahel G. Rocque W.

Cell. 1988; 53: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Although the majority of TNFα-induced responses has been attributed to sTNFα, a few studies have shown that mTNFα is also biologically active and capable of mediating similar responses including apoptosis, proliferation, B cell activation, and some inflammatory responses (7Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Schearich P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mTNFα has been implicated in some disease states such as experimental hepatitis where serum sTNFα levels were found to be within the normal range (9Kusters S. Tiegs G. Alexopoulou L. Pasparakis M. Douni E. Kunstle G. Bluethmann H. Wendel A. Pfizenmaier K. Kollias G. Grell M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), indicating the relevance of localized TNFα responses. The existence of two different forms of TNFα makes its physiology more complicated. Furthermore, the fact that mTNFα relies on cell contact-dependent signaling may render the actions of mTNFα cell type-specific in vivo. In support of this, mTNFα has been reported to trigger inflammatory responses in astrocytes but not in neurons, whereas sTNFα can induce similar effects in both cell types (10Akassoglou K. Probert L. Kontogeorgos G. Kollias G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 438-445PubMed Google Scholar). The biological functions of both mTNFα and sTNFα can be signaled by two distinct TNF receptors: TNFR1 (55 kDa) and TNFR2 (75 kDa). The lack of homology in intracellular domains of two TNF receptors indicates that they can mediate distinct biological activities. Indeed, whereas a broad array of cellular responses has been attributed to TNFR1, many other effects are mediated by TNFR2 (11Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 12Grell M. J. Inflammat. 1995; 47: 8-17PubMed Google Scholar). These two receptors can also act in concert under many circumstances (9Kusters S. Tiegs G. Alexopoulou L. Pasparakis M. Douni E. Kunstle G. Bluethmann H. Wendel A. Pfizenmaier K. Kollias G. Grell M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Lazdins J.K. Grell M. Walker M.R. Woods-Cook K. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The role of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in mediating the actions of sTNFα and the downstream signaling mechanisms has been studied extensively. In contrast, little information is available regarding the pathways and mechanisms utilized by mTNFα. Some early studies have demonstrated that transmembrane TNFα is superior to sTNFα in activating TNFR2 (7Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Schearich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 12Grell M. J. Inflammat. 1995; 47: 8-17PubMed Google Scholar). However, subsequent reports have indicated that transmembrane TNFα can signal through both receptors depending on the cellular context (8Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Other studies have used TNFR-deficient mice to demonstrate that both receptors were required as in the case of experimental hepatitis (9Kusters S. Tiegs G. Alexopoulou L. Pasparakis M. Douni E. Kunstle G. Bluethmann H. Wendel A. Pfizenmaier K. Kollias G. Grell M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and arthritis (14Alexopoulou L. Pasparakis M. Kollias G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2588-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas TNFR2 alone is sufficient to mediate the effects of transmembrane TNF in experimental cerebral malaria (15Lucas R. Juillard P. Decoster E. Redard M. Burger D. Donati Y. Giroud C. Monso-Hinard C. De Kesel T. Buurman W.A. Moore M.W. Dayer J.M. Fiers W. Bluethmann H. Grau G.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1719-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Soluble TNFα plays an important role in regulation of energy metabolism. It has profound effects on adipocytes, including mobilization of triglycerides and inhibition of insulin action (2Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biotherapy. 1991; 3: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In adipocytes, it can regulate the expression of several genes (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar) and modulate the secretion of free fatty acids and leptin which play active roles in systemic energy balance (16Hotamisligil G.S.

Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2777-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that TNFα is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity. The expression level of TNFα in adipose tissue is elevated in a variety of rodent obesity models (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar) and also in obese humans (18Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin.

Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4854-4858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) and other cell types (21Feinstein R. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1678-1683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies on various models of rodent obesity demonstrated increased insulin sensitivity upon genetic loss of TNFα function (26Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 27Ventre J. Doebber T. Wu M. MacNaul K. Stevens K. Pasparakis M. Kollias G. Moller D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1526-1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4832-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although one recent report could not demonstrate this in TNFR −/− R2−/− mice with dietary obesity (29Schreyer S.A. Chua S.C. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Similar to genetic studies, pharmacological blocking of TNF activity also results in significant reversal of insulin resistance in obesity (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar, 30Cheung A.T. Ree D. Kolls J.K. Fuselier J. Coy D.H. Bryer-Ash M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4928-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite strong evidence of a role for TNFα in obesity-related insulin resistance, circulating levels of sTNFα appear to be very low or undetectable (3Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that obesity might be one example where TNFα action is localized to the site(s) of production, such as adipose tissue. Thus, mTNFα may be a potential candidate mediator of such local events. However, the effects of mTNFα on adipocyte biology and energy metabolism remain unknown. In this study, we have examined the effects of transmembrane TNFα on cultured 3T3-F442A adipocytes and determined the TNF receptor responsible for its functions by using TNFR1−/−, TNFR2−/−, and TNFR1−/−R2−/− preadipocyte cell lines developed in our laboratory. 2J.

Hotamisligil, submitted for publication. These studies demonstrate that transmembrane TNFα is indeed biologically active in cultured adipocytes and that it alters the differentiation program of adipocytes by selectively activating TNFR1. TNFR1−/−, TNFR2−/−, and TNFR1−/−R2−/− fibroblast cell lines were established from day 16–17 mouse embryos with targeted mutations in the corresponding TNFR(s) using the classic 3T3 protocol. Multiple fibroblast cell lines were established for each genotype and tested for their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes. For each genotype, one cell line with the highest rate of differentiation was selected and used for the experiments. 3T3-F442A, TNFR1−/−, TNFR2−/−, and TNFR1−/−R2−/− preadipocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone). Infected cells were maintained in the same medium in the presence of appropriate selection drugs. For differentiation, cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 per well on 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone). Cells were grown to confluency and exposed to adipogenic reagents for 3 to 4 days, followed by culturing for 4 more days in medium containing insulin only. Recombinant murine soluble TNFα (Genzyme, MA) treatments were started at confluency and continued throughout the experiments with a new dose applied every 2 days at the indicated concentrations. Cells were then either stained with oil red O for microscopy or processed for RNA collection. Unless otherwise indicated, insulin was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, dexamethasone at 1 μm, isobutylmethylxanthine at 0.5 mm, and BRL49653 at 1 μm. The polyclonal rabbit anti-murine TNF antibody was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). The fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). The polyclonal rabbit anti-human aP2 antibody was provided by Dr. Rex Parker (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.). The polyclonal rabbit anti-rat Na,K-ATPase antibody was provided by Dr. Lorraine Santy (Harvard University). The polyclonal rabbit anti-murine ACRP30 antibody was provided by Dr. Philip Scherer (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). Fully differentiated adipocytes (1 × 107) were collected from 10-cm dishes in the presence of breaking buffer (500 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, and 200 μg/ml Pefabloc). After homogenization for 1 min at the speed of 25,000 rpm per min with a Polytron (model PT3000, Brinkmann), cell lysates were centrifuged at 4,700 × g (Megafuge 3.0R, Heraeus Instruments) for 100 min, and the pellet containing plasma membranes was collected. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 450,000 × g (L8-M ultracentrifuge, Beckman) for 2 h to precipitate the remaining subcellular membranes and harvest cytosolic material. The pellets were extracted in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mmEDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μmpepstatin, and 200 μg/ml Pefabloc) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants, which contain solubilized membrane proteins, were collected, and equal amounts of protein from each fraction were used for immunoblot analysis. To analyze secretion of sTNFα, 48-h conditioned medium (10 ml) was collected from each cell line and concentrated to a final volume of 1 ml. The polyclonal rabbit anti-murine TNF antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, as described previously (26Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against human insulin receptor and aP2, mouse ACRP30, and rat Na,K-ATPase, respectively. Cells were stained with oil red O (Sigma) for visualizing the lipid droplets and hematoxylin (Sigma) for nuclei according to conventional methods. The percentage of differentiation was calculated as number of cells containing visible lipid droplets divided by the total number of nuclei per microscopic field, under 400-fold magnification. Three representative fields were counted for each sample, and the mean ± S.D. was used for comparisons. The cDNA of the noncleavable murine membrane TNFα (mTNFΔ1–9K11E) was provided by Dr. Els Decoster and Dr. Walter Fiers (Gent University, K. L. Ledeganckstraat, Belgium) in vector pSV235 (7Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Schearich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (5′ primer, CTAGATCTCCCTCCAGAAAAGACA, and 3′ primer, GGATCCAGAGTAAAGGGTCAGAGTG) and cloned into the PCRII vector (Invitrogen). The integrity of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. The coding region was then excised with Xba I/Bam HI digestion followed by Klenow fill-in. The 0.76-kilobase pair mTNFΔ1–9K11E cDNA fragment was cloned in sense orientation into the Sna BI site of the retroviral vector, pBabe-hygro, which contains the hygromycin B resistance gene (32Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). The cDNA of TNFR1 was obtained by performing reverse transcription-PCR (5′ primer, TGCGAGGTCCTGGAGGACC, and 3′ primer, AAGGTTGTGGGTGTGGCTTTAT) using mouse spleen cDNA (strain C57BL/6). The final 1.37-kilobase pair PCR product was cloned into PCRII vector. One point mutation was detected by sequencing and corrected by site-directed mutagenesis based on the published sequence (33Lewis M. Tartaglia L.A. Lee A. Bennett G.L. Rice G.C. Wong G.H. Chen E.Y. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2830-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The coding region of TNFR1 was excised with Nae I/Eco RI digestion and cloned into the Sna BI/Eco RI site of the retroviral vector, pBabe-puro, which contains the puromycin resistance gene (32Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). The cDNA of murine TNFR2 was obtained from Immunex (34Goodwin R.G. Anderson D. Jerzy R. Davis T. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Smith C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3020-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The coding sequence was excised with Bam HI (followed by Klenow fill-in)/Eco RI digestion and cloned into the Sal I (followed by Klenow fill-in)/Eco RI site of the retroviral vector, pBabe-bleo, which contains the bleomycin resistance gene (32Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). All the expression constructs were sequenced to confirm the integrity and correct orientation of the cloned cDNAs. Packaging of the viral particles was achieved by transfecting the expression plasmids into Bosc 23 cells, a human kidney cell line (35Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar), with the Cell Phect calcium phosphate coprecipitation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, supernatant from packaging cells was collected and filtered through sterile 0.45-μm syringe filters. Twenty-four hours before infection, recipient cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 per 75 cm2. For infection, recipient cells were incubated with viral supernatant plus fresh DMEM (3:1) containing a final concentration of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After a 24-h incubation, cells were fed with fresh DMEM and allowed to grow to 80% confluency in 2–3 days. Cells were re-seeded at a density of 6 × 105 per 75 cm2 for selection, and corresponding antibiotics were added the following day. Puromycin (Sigma) selection was completed in 3–4 days, while hygromycin B (Sigma) and zeocin (a derivative of bleomycin, Invitrogen) lasted 1 week and 1 month, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were maintained in appropriate antibiotics throughout experiments to maintain stable expression levels of mTNFΔ1–9K11E, TNFR1, and TNFR2. RNA samples were extracted according to the guanidinium thiocyanate method (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). Following denaturation, RNAs were loaded on a 1% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, RNAs were transferred to a biotran membrane (ICN), UV cross-linked, and baked at 80 °C for 1 h. Hybridization with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products)-labeled cDNA probes and subsequent washings were done as described previously (4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). Northern blots were quantitated by using NIH image program, and 18 S rRNA was used for loading adjustment. Cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates. After being rinsed 5 times with modified phosphate-buffered saline (PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2), cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. Following 5 min incubation in PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl, cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS and 2 times with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. This was followed by a 45-min incubation at room temperature in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 1:500 dilution of a rabbit anti-murine TNF antibody (Genzyme, MA). Cells were then washed 5 times with PBS and 2 times with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After a 30-min incubation with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), cells were washed 8 times with PBS, once with water and mounted with fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.). Photographs were taken under fluorescence microscope as described previously (36Gutierrez J.A., Yu, J. Rivera S. Wessling-Resnick M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The mTNFΔ1–9K11E expression construct or control vector was cotransfected with a NF-κB promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene (provided by Dr. Christopher K. Glass, University of California, San Diego) using LipofectAMINE-plus kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) The luciferase activity was determined by a luminometer and corrected for transfection efficiency as assessed by β-galactosidase assays. To study the potential effects of transmembrane TNFα in cultured adipocytes, we have ectopically expressed a non-cleavable transmembrane form of murine TNFα in several preadipocyte cell lines. These include the 3T3-F442A cells and the newly developed preadipocyte cell lines deficient in TNFR1, TNFR2, or both.2 The non-cleavable form of TNFα (mTNFΔ1–9K11E) has been generated by deleting amino acids 1–9 and mutating residue 11 from Lys to Glu in the N-terminal part of mature TNFα and previously characterized in L929, CT6, PC60-R55/R75, and U937 cells (8Decoster E. Vanhaesebroeck B. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18473-18478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we chose a retroviral expression system to express constitutively the non-cleavable mutant (Fig.1 A) because of its high integration efficiency. This system also allowed expression in a large number of cells and prevented the common problem of clonal variability. The exogenous TNFα message was readily identified in infected cells since it is larger than the endogenous one produced by LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 macrophages (Fig. 1 B). Comparable levels of mTNFΔ1–9K11E expression were demonstrated by Northern blot analysis in all stably infected preadipocyte cell lines (Fig. 1 B). Messenger RNA levels of both TNF receptors were also determined in all cell types to demonstrate the presence and potential regulation of the relevant TNF receptors. The TNFR2 mRNA level in 3T3-F442A cells expressing mTNFΔ1–9K11E was substantially higher than those expressing vector alone (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). Expression of mTNFΔ1–9K11E in TNFR1−/− cells did not affect TNFR2 mRNA level (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). This indicates that either the regulation of TNFR2 mRNA expression by mTNFΔ1–9K11E requires the presence of TNFR1, or base-line TNFR2 expression in these cells is already at maximum levels. Endogenous TNFR1 mRNA levels were unaffected by the presence of mTNFΔ1–9K11E. Proper expression and localization of mTNFΔ1–9K11E as a membrane protein was determined by both indirect immunofluorescence in intact cells and immunoblot analysis of cellular fractions. As shown in Fig.1 C, expression of mTNFΔ1–9K11E protein on TNFR1−/−R2−/− cells could be visualized by the use of a polyclonal rabbit anti-murine TNFα antibody (left panel) followed by a fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The peripheral distribution of fluorescence is consistent with plasma membrane-associated localization. To confirm this further, we performed immunoblot analysis of cellular fractions of adipocytes (Fig. 1 D, top panel) which showed that mTNFΔ1–9K11E was predominantly detected in a high density membrane-containing fraction. This fraction is enriched with plasma membranes as confirmed by the detection of Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 1 D, middle panel) which is a commonly used plasma membrane marker (37Mahadik S.P. Bharucha V.A. Stadlin A. Ortiz A. Karpiak S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 32: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Insulin receptor was also detected in this fraction (data not shown). The mTNFΔ1–9K11E protein was expressed as a 25-kDa protein compared with the wild type 26-kDa mTNFα. In both mTNFΔ1–9K11E and wtTNFα-expressing cells, two additional smaller molecular weight bands have been consistently detected in the membrane fractions. These are likely to be products of alternative initiation sites as previously reported (38Tang P. Hung M.C. Klostergaard J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8226-8233Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transmembrane TNFΔ1–9K11E protein level in total cell extracts from different cell lines was also similar as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). The protein expression level of the non-cleavable mutant in our system is estimated to be 5% of the endogenous counterpart produced by LPS-stimulated macrophages quantitated by densitometry scanning of immunoblots. No mTNFΔ1–9K11E protein was detected in cytosol. This fraction is indeed enriched with cytosolic proteins as confirmed by immunoblotting for cytosolic adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, aP2 (Fig. 1 D, bottom panel). Finally, we also examined whether in our experimental system, the mTNFΔ1–9K11E could be aberrantly cleaved at other sites to yield sTNFα products. Immunoblot analysis of concentrated conditioned media did not reveal any detectable TNFα immunoreactivity from vector and mTNFΔ1–9K11E-expressing cells but did show the presence of sTNFα from wtTNFα-expressing cells (Fig. 1 E, top panel).

We identify interacting amino acid pairs by using double mutants to test which modification in the catalytic domain complements a given change in the auto-inhibitory domain. Our studies identify the core pseudosubstrate sequence (residues 297–300) but reveal that distinct sequences centered about the autophosphorylation site at Thr-286 are involved in the critical auto-inhibitory interactions. Individual changes in any of the residues Arg-274, His-282, Arg-283, Lys-291, Arg-297, Phe-293, and Asn-294 in the auto-inhibitory domain or their interacting partners in the catalytic domain produces an enhanced affinity for calmodulin or generates a constitutively active enzyme. A structural model of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II that incorporates these interactions shows that Thr-286 is oriented inwardly into a hydrophobic channel. The model explains why calmodulin must bind to the auto-inhibitory domain in order for Thr-286 in that domain to be phosphorylated and why introduction of phospho-Thr-286 produces the important Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent state of the enzyme."

In the wild type fibroblasts, the rank order of potencies for nucleotide-induced ΔCa2+iwas as follows: UTP ≥ ATP ≫ ADP > UDP. The responses induced by these agonists were completely absent in the P2Y2-R(−/−) fibroblasts. Inositol phosphate responses paralleled those of ΔCa2+i in both groups. ATP and UTP also induced Ca2+i responses in wild type airway epithelial cells. In the P2Y2-R(−/−) airway epithelial cells, UTP was ineffective. A small fraction (25%) of the ATP response persisted. Adenosine and α,β-methylene ATP were ineffective, and ATP responses were not affected by adenosine deaminase or by removal of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that neither P1 nor P2X receptors mediated this residual ATP response. In contrast, 2-methylthio-ADP promoted a substantial Ca2+i response in P2Y2-R(−/−) cells, which was inhibited by the P2Y1 receptor antagonist adenosine 3′-5′-diphosphate. These studies demonstrate that P2Y2-R is the dominant purinoceptor in airway epithelial cells, which also express a P2Y1 receptor, and that the P2Y2-R is the sole purinergic receptor subtype mediating nucleotide-induced inositol lipid hydrolysis and Ca2+mobilization in mouse lung fibroblasts.

Both ATP and UTP equipotently regulate epithelial electrolyte and water transport (3Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a common receptor for ATP and UTP is expressed on the airway epithelia, which pharmacologically is most likely to be the P2Y2-R. However, receptors that are activated by UDP (31Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and adenosine (32Lazarowski E.R. Mason S.J. Clarke L.L. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) may also be expressed on these cells and thus complicate this analysis.In this study, we generated a mouse line carrying a mutant P2Y2 allele. We used these mice to examine the relative role of P2Y2-R in the nucleotide-promoted Ca2+ signaling in mouse lung fibroblasts and airway epithelial cells. The role of P2Y2-R was tested by comparison of nucleotide-stimulated Ca2+i responses in cells from P2Y2-R (−/−) mice with those from wild type animals. In the accompanying paper (33Cressman, V. L., Lazarowski, E., Homolya, L., Boucher, R. C., Koller, B. H., and Grubb, B. R. (1999) 274, 26461–26468Google Scholar), the role of P2Y2-R in mediating Cl− secretory responses in freshly excised tracheal, gallbladder, and jejunal tissues is described.DISCUSSIONThe murine P2Y2-R gene was disrupted by homologous recombination in embryonic stem lines and mice homozygous for the disrupted P2Y2-R gene generated from these lines. These P2Y2-R-deficient mice provide a unique tool for characterization of extracellular nucleotide regulation of cell signaling.We investigated three different cell types isolated from lungs of wild type and P2Y2 receptor (-/-) mice: lung fibroblasts and tracheal and nasal epithelial cells. Because of the absence of specific and potent antagonists, binding assays have not been useful in studies characterizing tissue-specific expression of nucleotide receptors (39Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have measured nucleotide-induced Ca2+responses and, when possible, inositol lipid hydrolysis to characterize nucleotide receptor function in cells from these wild type and P2Y2 receptor-deficient mice.A good correlation between Ca2+i responses and inositol phosphate formation was observed in lung fibroblasts (Fig. 2, A and B). The dose-effect relationships for nucleotide agonists and Ca2+i and inositol phosphate measurements were identical. The rank orders of agonist potencies (UTP ≥ ATP ≫ ADP > UDP) were similar in both assays and were consistent with the pharmacological profile of the P2Y2 receptor. However, the recently cloned rat P2Y4 receptor displays a similar pattern of triphosphate nucleotide responses (40Webb T.E. Henderson D.J. Roberts J.A. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1348-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 41Bogdanov Y.D. Wildman S.S. Clements M.P. King B.F. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 428-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that its mouse homologue may do so as well.A definitive description of which nucleotide receptor subtype(s) accounted for the effect of UTP and ATP in the murine lung fibroblast resulted from the experiments with cells isolated from P2Y2-R(−/−) mice (Fig. 2, C and D). These data, demonstrating that disruption of the gene encoding the P2Y2 receptor completely abolished nucleotide-induced inositol phosphate and Ca2+ responses, establish that the P2Y2 is the only P2 receptor functionally expressed in mouse lung fibroblasts. Further studies will be required to extend this characterization to nonlung fibroblasts and the potential influence of continuous culture to assess the relevance of this conclusion to those in previous reports.Because of smaller numbers and limited growth capacity of the epithelial cells, we focused on nucleotide-induced Ca2+i responses rather than on inositol lipid hydrolysis in this cell type. Tracheal epithelial cells from wild type mice exhibited a rank order of nucleotide-induced responses (Fig.3 A) similar to that reported with the cloned human and mouse P2Y2 receptor (7Lustig K.D. Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 10Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Desensitization studies carried out with wild type tracheal cells provided further support for the hypothesis that a common UTP/ATP receptor is expressed in these cells (Fig. 4).Direct, unambiguous evidence for P2Y2 expression in the murine trachea was provided by studies with P2Y2-R(−/−) tracheal cells. The complete abolition of UTP-induced Ca2+i responses clearly demonstrated that P2Y2 receptor accounted for the effect of UTP in wild type tracheal cells, and no other UTP-activated receptor (i.e. P2Y4 receptor) was present (Fig. 5 A). The absence of effect of UDP in the P2Y2-R(−/−) cells also ruled out involvement of P2Y6 receptors. The major (75%) reduction in ATP-stimulated Ca2+ response clearly demonstrated that P2Y2 receptor was the predominant but not unique receptor for ATP in this cell type. The reduction in the magnitude of the response to 2-MeSATP suggests that this nonselective P2Y1/P2X receptor agonist also stimulates the P2Y2 receptor at high concentrations. This observation is consistent with the effect of 2-MeSATP reported with the cloned P2Y2 receptor (10Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).Mouse nasal epithelial cells exhibited a profile of nucleotide-stimulated responses similar to that observed in tracheal cells (Figs. 3 and 4). The ATP/UTP responses were generally larger in wild type tracheal cells than in nasal cells, whereas the magnitude of residual ATP-stimulated responses in P2Y2-R(−/−) cells was similar in cells from each region (Fig. 5). This observation suggests a higher level of expression of the P2Y2 receptor in tracheal cells than nasal cells.A second objective of our study was to identify additional nucleotide receptor(s) that might be expressed in mouse airway epithelial cells. The absence of specific agonists and antagonists for most of the P2 receptors makes it difficult to classify multiple receptors in a complex system. However, the P2Y2-R(−/−) mouse model facilitated these studies.Our results provide direct evidence for the functional expression of P2 receptor(s) other than P2Y2 that are activated by adenine nucleotide agonists in murine tracheal and nasal epithelial cells. The involvement of P1 adenosine receptors in the ATP-induced Ca2+ response was ruled out on the bases that adenosine did not stimulate elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels and that adenosine deaminase pretreatment did not affect the response to ATP in P2Y2-R(−/−) cells. α,β-meATP, originally thought to be specific for all P2X receptors (4Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1985; 16: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), is now known to be active only at P2X1 and P2X3 receptors (36Evans R.J. Surprenant A. North R.A. Turner J.T.

Nature. 1995; 377: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). In mouse airway epithelial cells, α,β-meATP was inactive in terms of Ca2+ signaling (see “Results”) as well as Cl− secretion (33Cressman, V. L., Lazarowski, E., Homolya, L., Boucher, R. C., Koller, B. H., and Grubb, B. R. (1999) 274, 26461–26468Google Scholar). We cannot entirely rule out the involvement of P2X receptors solely on the basis of the absence of α,β-meATP-induced responses. However, the experiments carried out in Ca2+-free buffer (Fig. 6) clearly demonstrated that ATP-stimulated Ca2+ responses primarily reflected release from internal stores and not direct opening of plasma membrane P2X (Ca2+) channels. These findings strongly suggest that the P2X receptors are not functionally expressed in these cells.The residual effects of ATP, ADP, 2-MeSATP, and 2-MeSADP found in P2Y2-R(−/−) cells (Fig. 5), coupled with the desensitization studies (Fig. 7), are more consistent with the expression of P2Y1 receptor (44Webb T.E.

Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) than a P2Y11 receptor, because the latter is not activated by the diphosphate analogues (13Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The substantial Ca2+iresponses elicited by ADP and 2-MeSADP in the P2Y2-R(−/−) cells (Fig. 5), coupled with the antagonistic effect of A3P5P on the Ca2+i response to 2-MeSADP-induced responses (Fig.8), strongly supports the hypothesis that the residual nucleotide receptor in the P2Y2-R(−/−) airway cells is in fact the P2Y1 receptor.The results of Ca2+i measurements with tracheal epithelial cells can be compared with the data obtained from the tracheal Cl− secretory studies in the accompanying paper (33Cressman, V. L., Lazarowski, E., Homolya, L., Boucher, R. C., Koller, B. H., and Grubb, B. R. (1999) 274, 26461–26468Google Scholar). Our studies were carried out on isolated tracheal cells grown on glass coverslips, providing access of added agonists to apical and basolateral membrane surfaces. In contrast, the Cl−measurements were performed with freshly excised tracheas with additions only to the apical surface. Despite these differences, the pharmacological profiles determined by theses two methods were generally similar in tracheal specimens and revealed that the P2Y2 receptor was the dominant receptor mediating both Ca2+i and Cl− secretory responses in wild type mice. A slight difference was that in P2Y2-R(−/−) tracheal epithelia UDP had a minor but potent effect on Cl− secretion (33Cressman, V. L., Lazarowski, E., Homolya, L., Boucher, R. C., Koller, B. H., and Grubb, B. R. (1999) 274, 26461–26468Google Scholar), whereas negligible UDP responses were observed in the Ca2+i studies (Fig.5). The simplest explanation for this discrepancy is that the UDP-activated receptor, probably P2Y6, was down-regulated during culture on glass coverslips.In summary, murine lung fibroblasts as well as tracheal and nasal epithelial cells from wild type mice exhibit P2Y2-like pharmacologic responses to extracellular nucleotide additions. Comparative studies of cells from P2Y2-R(+/+) and P2Y2-R(−/−) mice provided direct evidence for P2Y2 receptor function in all three cell types. The P2Y2 receptor appears likely to be the only P2 receptor in mouse lung fibroblasts and is the predominant P2 receptor in airway epithelial cells. In addition, the P2Y2-R(−/−) mouse model made it possible to functionally characterize and identify another P2 receptor in airway epithelia, which was masked by the activity of the dominant P2Y2 receptor. The residual nucleotide receptor in mouse tracheal and nasal epithelial cells is most likely the P2Y1 receptor. Although conclusions regarding humans cannot be directly drawn from studies performed in mice, the P2Y2-R(−/−) mouse model system provides a unique tool for tissue-specific nucleotide receptor function. Extracellular ATP induces a wide variety of responses in many cell types, including muscle contraction and relaxation, vasodilation, neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, ion transport regulation, and cell growth (1Gordon J.L.

The excessive ferritin production in HHCS patients arises from aberrant regulation of l-ferritin translation caused by mutations within the iron-responsive element (IRE) of thel-ferritin transcript. IREs serve as binding sites for iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), iron-sensing proteins that regulate ferritin translation. Previous observations suggested that each unique HHCS mutation conferred a characteristic degree of hyperferritinemia and cataract severity in affected individuals. Here we have measured the in vitro affinity of the IRPs for the mutant IREs and correlated decreases in binding affinity with clinical severity. Thermodynamic analysis of these IREs has also revealed that although some HHCS mutations lead to changes in the stability and secondary structure of the IRE, others appear to disrupt IRP-IRE recognition with minimal effect on IRE stability. HHCS is a noteworthy example of a human genetic disorder that arises from mutations within a protein-binding site of an mRNA cis-acting element.

Haematologica. 1999; 84: 489-492PubMed Google Scholar). This condition is characterized by a combination of elevated levels of serum ferritin and congenital nuclear cataract. Human ferritin is composed of two different types of subunit (H-ferritin and l-ferritin), although the relative proportion of each subunit in the ferritin copolymer varies among tissues (13Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2278) Google Scholar). Through the use of monoclonal antibodies specific for either H- or l-ferritin, the excess serum ferritin in HHCS patients has been shown to be predominantlyl-ferritin (3Beaumont C. Leneuve P. Devaux I. Scoazec J.-Y. Berthier M. Loiseau M.-N. Grandchamp B. Bonneau D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 444-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 7Cazzola M. Bergamaschi G. Tonon L. Arbustini E. Grasso M. Vercesi E. Barosi G. Bianchi P.E. Cairo G. Arosio P. Blood. 1997; 90: 814-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A close relationship has also been established between monocyte l-ferritin content and serum ferritin concentration (7Cazzola M. Bergamaschi G. Tonon L. Arbustini E. Grasso M. Vercesi E. Barosi G. Bianchi P.E. Cairo G. Arosio P. Blood. 1997; 90: 814-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the excess production ofl-ferritin in cells is directly responsible for the hyperferritinemia. Although serum ferritin is thought to reflect body iron stores, individuals with HHCS do not appear to suffer from iron overload (1Girelli D. Oliviero O. De Franceschi L. Corrocher R. Bergamaschi G. Cazzola M. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 2Bonneau D. Winter-Fuseau I. Loiseau M.-N. Amati P. Berthier M. Oriot D. Beaumont C. J. Med. Genet. 1995; 32: 778-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The expression of both H-ferritin and l-ferritin is normally regulated according to intracellular iron concentration by means of iron-responsive elements (IREs) that are found within the 5′-untranslated regions of their transcripts (14Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 15Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). These regulatory elements interact with the iron regulatory proteins IRP1 and IRP2, which are both capable of sensing cellular iron status. Under conditions of intracellular iron depletion, both IRP1 and IRP2 bind to IREs with high affinity. The binding of an IRP to the ferritin IRE prevents the binding of the 43 S translation initiation complex to the transcript (16Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3882-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Muckenthaler M. Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and thus blocks translation of the ferritin protein. When intracellular iron concentrations rise, IRP1 acquires a [4Fe-4S] cluster that prevents its association with IREs and activates its function as a cytosolic aconitase (reviewed in Refs. 18Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 494-499Google Scholarand 19Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, IRP2 is targeted for degradation by the proteasome (20Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21Guo B. Phillips J.D., Yu, Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the absence of bound IRP, the ferritin transcript is readily translated. IREs are also found within the transcripts of other iron uptake and iron utilization proteins and have a highly conserved stem-loop secondary structure (Fig.1 b). The absence of iron overload in HHCS patients suggested that the elevated serum ferritin resulted from misregulation ofl-ferritin expression. Analysis of thel-ferritin genetic locus in HHCS patients led to the identification of mutations occurring within the IRE ofl-ferritin (Fig. 1 a), most of them occurring as single point mutations (2Bonneau D. Winter-Fuseau I. Loiseau M.-N. Amati P. Berthier M. Oriot D. Beaumont C. J. Med. Genet. 1995; 32: 778-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Girelli D. Corrocher R. Bisceglia L. Olivieri O.

Blood. 1998; 91: 367-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although a double point mutation (7Cazzola M. Bergamaschi G. Tonon L. Arbustini E. Grasso M. Vercesi E. Barosi G. Bianchi P.E. Cairo G. Arosio P. Blood. 1997; 90: 814-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a 29-base deletion (8Girelli D. Corrocher R. Bisceglia L. Olivieri O. Zelante L. Panozzo G. Gasparini P. Blood. 1997; 90: 2084-2088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also been reported. Several of these mutations have been shown to disrupt IRE-IRP binding in vitro, and it seems likely that the others would have similar effects, leading to increased expression ofl-ferritin in vivo. As patients with HHCS have been characterized, however, it has become clear that not all are equally affected by the disorder. Some patients have serum ferritin levels more than 5-fold higher than normal and a history of severe cataracts, whereas others have only slightly elevated serum ferritin and are asymptomatic for cataract. Studies of non-HHCS IRE mutations have demonstrated that some mutations affect in vitro IRE-IRP binding affinities much more severely than others (22Jaffrey S.R. Haile D.J. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4627-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), so we hypothesized that all or part of the range of severity seen among HHCS patients might arise from differences in the ability of each mutation to disrupt IRE-IRP interactions. We were also interested in evaluating whether HHCS mutations might affect the affinities of IRP1 and IRP2 differently. As studies have demonstrated, both IRP1 and IRP2 are capable of recognizing their own unique substrates in vitro (23Butt J. Kim H.-Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify any correlation between HHCS severity and IRP affinity, and to reveal any differences in the behavior of the two IRPs, we determined the dissociation constants (KD values) for the binding of the HHCS IREs to both IRP1 and IRP2. The identification of the HHCS mutations has also provided us with an opportunity to understand more precisely the structural features of the IRE required for IRP binding. Recent NMR studies of the consensus IRE have revealed intriguing features of its three-dimensional structure (25Addess K.J. Basilion J.P. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Pardi A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Laing L.G. Hall K.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13586-13596Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Hall K.B. Tang C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9323-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); however, it has been difficult to ascertain the importance of those features for IRP recognition. We have used thermal denaturation methods to determine the effects of each HHCS mutation on the thermodynamic stability of the IRE. Analysis of the resulting melting curves has allowed us to identify HHCS mutations that are likely to disrupt direct contacts between the IRE and IRPs and other mutations located both near and distant from putative contact points whose predominant effect is to alter IRE stability. The RNAs used for both the band-shift competition assays and thermal denaturation experiments were prepared by T7 RNA polymerase transcription from single-stranded DNA templates using published methods (28Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). A series of 94-nucleotide template DNAs were used to encode the 77-nucleotide RNAs and were purchased from either Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA) or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). For example, the template for the wild-type l-ferritin IRE was 5′-CTGGAAGAGA GTCCCCGGAT CTGTTCCGTC CAAACACTGT TGAAGCAAGA GACAGACCCG CGGGACCGCC GAACTCC TAT AGTGAGTCGT ATTA-3′ (the T7 RNA polymerase promoter region is italicized). A typical 1-ml transcription reaction contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μmspermidine, 0.01% Triton X-100, 2 mm each NTP, 0.2 μm DNA template, and 1.5 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Transcribed RNAs were purified on 8% (7 m urea) polyacrylamide gels, extracted from the gel, and desalted by dialysis against a solution of 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 10 mm KCl using Spectra/Por CE 500 molecular weight cut-off DispoDialyzers (Spectrum). All RNAs were quantitated by UV absorbance spectroscopy and were folded prior to use by heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by renaturation on ice for 20 min. Internally33P-radiolabeled wild-type Ferritin IRE was transcribed from the same DNA template described above. RNA was transcribed in a 25-μl transcription reaction containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm spermidine, 0.01% Triton X-100, 4 mm GTP, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm CTP, 0.8 mm UTP, 1.7 μm (125 μCi) [α-33P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.2 μm DNA template, and 2 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase. RNA was purified as described above except that following isolation from the gel the RNA was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. The RNA was quantitated and folded as described above. Human IRP1 and IRP2 proteins for these studies were expressed and purified as previously reported (29Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All competition reactions were prepared as follows: 0.8 pmol (40 nm) of 33P-labeled wild-typel-ferritin IRE was mixed with either 0, 0.8, 1.6, 4.0, 8.0, or 80.0 pmol (0, 40, 80, 200, 400, or 4000 nm) of unlabeled competitor in the presence of 5% glycerol, 0.025 units/μl RNase inhibitor (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), 0.15 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, and 0.6 pmol (30 nm) of IRP1 or IRP2. These reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then electrophoresed on 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 130 V for 4 h. After drying, the gels were exposed to either Kodak BioMax MR film or a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImaging screen. Quantitation of band-shift competition gels was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and the Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software package. We calculated KD values using a method previously reported for competition assays (30Drake S.K. Lee K.L. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, quantitation of the gels yielded f0 (the fraction of radiolabeled RNA shifted in the absence of competitor), f (the amount of radiolabeled RNA shifted in lanes with competitor), and f1, where f1 =f/f0. From these values, the following equations were used to determine the apparent KD (Kapp):Kapp = [C]free(f1/(1 −f1)), where [C]free = [C]i − [H]i (f0 −f) and represents the amount of unbound competitor RNA; [C]i represents the initial concentration of competitor RNA, and [H]i represents the initial amount of radiolabeled RNA. Using Kapp, [H]free (the concentration of unbound radiolabeled IRE) and the KD(known) for the wild-type IRE (as previously reported, see Ref. 23Butt J. Kim H.-Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the following equation can be used to determine KD(comp), the KD of the competitor RNA: KD(comp) = (Kapp KD(known))/(KD(known) + [H]free). The relative KD, KRel, equals KD(comp)/KD(known). For each HHCS mutant, KD(comp) is listed as the mean of at least three separate experiments ±1 S.D. in Table I.

The change in free energy of the resultant IRE·IRP complexes was calculated from ΔΔG25(complex) =RT ln KRel. Data were stored, analyzed, and reported with the package Exstatix (Select Micro Systems, Inc., Yorktown Heights, NY) and DeltaGraph Pro 3 (DeltaPoint, Inc., Monterey, CA). Results were expressed as a mean ± 1 S.D. unless otherwise stated. Simple and multiple linear regression and nonlinear regression analyses were employed to identify the parameters most closely related to KRel. The correlations of ln (serum ferritin)versus 1/KRel were statistically significant for both IRP1 (n = 37, F = 32.886, p < 0.00001) and IRP2 (n = 37, F = 29.435, p < 0.00001). The fit of ln (max ferritin) versus 1/KRelcorrelated with R 2 = 0.978 (IRP1) and R 2 = 0.991 (IRP2). Frequencies were compared by nonparametric analysis (2 × 2 table). p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All thermal denaturation experiments were performed on a Beckman DU 640 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a high performance temperature controller and a 6-position mini-cuvette holder. All measurements were made using 0.350-ml volume Teflon-stoppered quartz cuvettes with a 1.0-cm light path. To ensure that RNAs were monomers, melting curves for each RNA were measured at a range of RNA concentrations (0.1 to 10 μm). All RNAs appeared to behave as monomers and gave similar melting profiles on both heating and cooling (data not shown). Data for thermodynamic curve-fitting analysis were collected on 1.0 μm RNA samples in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 40 mm KCl. Both A260 and A280 were measured at 0.5 °C intervals as the temperature was ramped from 18 to 95 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min. Data were analyzed using the MeltFit software package designed and provided by David Draper (31Draper D.E. Gluick T.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 281-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). From the raw absorbance data, the first derivative of the absorbance versus temperature plot was determined using the Savitsky-Golay option in MeltFit and was normalized to the absorbance at 25 °C. In each case except for the Pavia 2 mutant, fitting of the first derivative curves to four sequential transitions was performed simultaneously at both 260 and 280 to improve the quality of the fit. From the ΔH and Tm values of each transition provided by MeltFit, values for both ΔG25 and ΔS25 were calculated as ΔG25 = ΔH (1 −T/Tm) and ΔS25 = (ΔH − ΔG25)/T, where T = 298.15 K, and Tm is the melting temperature, also expressed in Kelvin. Theoretical values of ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS (at 1m NaCl) were determined for the wild-typel-ferritin IRE using the Turner Rules for nearest neighbor approximation (32Serra M.J. Turner D.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 242-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We used band-shift competition assays to determine the affinities of IRP1 and IRP2 for IREs containing HHCS mutations. These experiments measured the ability of the mutant IREs to compete with33P-labeled wild-type l-ferritin IRE for the binding of the IRPs, as detected by the gradual disappearance of a shifted band on the gel in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor. As a control, we included an experiment in which wild-type l-ferritin IRE was used as the competitor. In these and all subsequent experiments, we used RNA oligonucleotides that had been designed to include the first 77 nucleotides of thel-ferritin transcript in an effort to conserve some of the natural context of the IRE (Fig.1 a). These constructs differed from the actual transcript only in lacking the normal 5′ cap modifications and having a G instead of C at the +2 position to permit efficient translation by T7 RNA polymerase. Gel sections showing the IRP-shifted band from each experiment have been assembled in Fig.2. The appearance of the IRP1-shifted band as a fine doublet is the result of changes in the oxidative state of a disulfide couple that does not affect IRE binding activity (data not shown). By visual inspection, we can readily distinguish the mutations that most severely impair the ability of the IRE to compete for IRP binding from those that only modestly impair competition. The most ineffective competitors are the Verona, Paris 2, and perhaps Paris 1 mutations. IREs containing these mutations only begin to show significant competition when present at 100-fold excess. Another group of mutations, including London 1, London 2, and Pavia 1, compete effectively at somewhat lower concentrations, between 5- and 10-fold excess. In contrast, the Pavia 2 mutation nearly rivals the wild-typel-ferritin IRE in its ability to compete for binding. Qualitatively, the competition profile for each mutation appears to be similar for both IRPs. To characterize further these mutations, we quantitated the amounts of shifted and unshifted RNA in each of the competition experiments. By using the previously determined KD values for the interactions of a consensus IRE with IRP1 (50 pm) or IRP2 (30 pm) (23Butt J. Kim H.-Y. Basilion J.P. Cohen S. Iwai K. Philpott C.C. Altschul S. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4345-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we were able to calculate the KD values of each mutant IRE, and the ratio of the KD(mutant) to KD(wild type), expressed as KRel (TableI). By this method, KRel >1 indicates weaker binding, whereas KRel <1 indicates stronger binding. The KD values calculated in control competition experiments with wild-type l-ferritin were 50 ± 2 pm for IRP1, and 41 ± 2 pm for IRP2, in good agreement with the previously reported values. The Verona mutation had the lowest affinity for both IRP1 and IRP2, with KD values of about 109 (2200-fold reduction) and 9.1 nm (220-fold reduction), respectively. The Paris 2 mutation also showed large reductions in affinity, 620-fold for IRP1 and 220-fold for IRP2. Although the Pavia 1 and Paris 2 mutations involve the same nucleotide position, immediately 5′ of the conserved unpaired cytosine, the Pavia 1 mutation is less deleterious to binding. The Paris 1 mutation caused a 220-fold reduction in affinity for IRP1 but had a somewhat more modest effect on IRP2, with only an 83-fold change in KD. Both of the London 1 and London 2 mutations retained modest affinities for the IRPs. The KDvalues of the IRPs for the Pavia 2 mutant differed from the wild-type affinities by less than 2-fold, similar to the those measured for a wild-type l-ferritin IRE truncated immediately below the C23:G57 base pair (see Fig. 1 b; KD and KRel for the truncated IRE are listed in TableI, but the corresponding gel slices are not shown in Fig. 2). One striking pattern that emerged from the measurement of the KD values is that each mutation appears to diminish affinity for IRP1 affinity more than for IRP2. However, the arrangement of the mutations from highest to lowest affinity remains the same for either protein. Data regarding the serum ferritin in HHCS patients was compiled from several sources (1Girelli D. Oliviero O. De Franceschi L. Corrocher R. Bergamaschi G. Cazzola M. Br. J.

Haematologica. 1999; 84: 489-492PubMed Google Scholar). For both IRP1 and IRP2, we plotted the KRel of each mutation versus its clinically measured values of serum ferritin (Fig.3), and in both cases there appeared to be a correlation. Nonlinear regression analysis (regression of ln (serum ferritin) versus 1/KRel) showed that there was a significant relationship between serum ferritin and KRel values of both IRP1 and IRP2. As Fig. 3illustrates, serum ferritin levels vary dramatically among patients with the same mutation or even within a single patient on different occasions. Yet we noticed that the greatest serum ferritin for each mutation, denoted as max ferritin and appearing in Fig. 3 as filled circles, appears to be strongly linked to KRel. Therefore, we performed regression analysis of ln (max ferritin) versus 1/KRel and found further evidence of a correlation for both IRP1 and IRP2. The absence of a quantitative measurement for the severity of cataract in HHCS patients made it difficult to establish any clear relationship between variations in KRel and severity of cataract. We therefore defined cataract as severe when there was a marked loss in visual acuity in the 1st decades (with some individuals requiring surgery), mild when the defect in visual acuity could be corrected with the use of appropriate eyeglasses, and asymptomatic when it did not impair visual acuity. By using nonparametric analysis, values of KRel(IRP1) <100 and KRel(IRP2) <80 were significantly associated with asymptomatic to mild cataract, whereas KRel(IRP1) >100 or KRel(IRP2) >80 were found in association with mild to severe cataract (χ2 = 29.68, p < 0.00001).

Nyborg J.K. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of malignant transformation by the virus is poorly understood; however, expression of the virally encoded Tax protein appears to be a critical event in the leukemogenic pathway (2Grassmann R.

Tax is a regulatory protein that is critical for high level HTLV-I transcription and thus is required for propagation of the virus. To activate viral gene expression, Tax participates in a series of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, forming a stable nucleoprotein complex on the HTLV-I promoter (4Franklin A.A.

Within this complex, Tax serves as a high affinity binding site for the recruitment of the pleiotropic cellular coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP) (13Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R.

Once associated with the viral promoter, CBP is believed to remodel chromatin and/or facilitate communication with the basal transcription machinery. To recruit CBP, Tax has been shown to specifically bind to a region of CBP called the KIX domain (13Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H.-M Connor L.M. Marriott S.J.

This region of CBP also interacts with several other transcription factors, including Ser-133-phosphorylated CREB (Ref. 15Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bächinger H.P.

Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Loss of p53 activity has been identified in 60% of the human malignancies examined (28Harris N. Brill E.

J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for p53 in genome surveillance and the suppression of oncogenic transformation. The tumor suppressor functions of p53 are strongly linked to its transcriptional activation properties. To stimulate transcription, the p53 activation domain binds to a poorly defined carboxyl-terminal region of CBP, tethering the coactivator to promoters of target genes (30Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G.

These observations suggest that CBP plays a critical role in supporting p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Although most human malignancies carry p53 mutations, the protein is generally present and wild type in HTLV-I-transformed cells (18Reid R.L. Lindholm P.F. Mireskamdari A. Dittmer J. Brady J.N.

Paradoxically, these cells do not respond appropriately to a variety of stimuli that typically activate p53 (21Gartenhaus R.B. Wang P. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 2082-2086PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cereseto A.

Blood. 1997; 90: 4924-4932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, γ irradiation, which normally induces p53 transcriptional activity, has little or no effect on the expression of a panel of known p53-responsive genes in HTLV-I-transformed cell lines (24Pise-Masison C.A. Kyeong-Sook C. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.-J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects appeared to be due to Tax, as expression of the Tax protein increased the sensitivity of a mouse cell line to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage and abrogated both p53-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (25Santucci M. Holland C. Anklesaria P. Das I. FitzGerald T.J. McKenna M.G. Sakakenny M. Greenberger J.S. Radiat. Oncol. Invest. 1993; 1: 131-136Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tax expression specifically inhibited p53 transcriptional activity, as measured by a p53-responsive reporter construct (20Akagi T. Ono H. Tsuchida N. Shimotohno K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cerresto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C.-Z. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data provide strong evidence suggesting that Tax inactivates p53, inhibiting the physiologically relevant transcription functions of this tumor suppressor protein (26Mulloy J.C. Kislyakova T. Cerresto A. Casareto L. LoMonico A. Fullen J. Lorenzi M.V. Cara A. Nicot C. Giam C.-Z. Franchini G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation of p53 by Tax likely represents a pivotal event in the transformation pathway. At present, the molecular basis for Tax inactivation of p53 transcription function is unknown. Because both Tax and p53 utilize CBP to activate transcription, we considered direct coactivator competition as a conceivable mechanism for the observed Tax repression of p53 function in vivo. It is noteworthy that CBP protein is generally present at limiting concentrations within the cell nucleus, creating an environment of coactivator competition between transcription factors and providing an additional layer of regulated gene expression (33Petrij F.

However, in a recent report describing the solution structure of phosphorylated CREB bound to the KIX domain of CBP, the authors integrate several recent findings that may resolve this apparent paradox (41Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson J.H. Montiminy M.R. Wright P. Cell. 1997; 91: 7441-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In that study, specific amino acids within the kinase-inducible domain of CREB were shown to interact within a hydrophobic groove on the surface KIX. The authors noted that sequences within the activation domain of p53 share similarity with the kinase-inducible domain of CREB. Furthermore, they pointed out that the crystal structure of the mdm2-p53 complex shows that the activation domain of p53 binds to a hydrophobic groove on the surface of mdm2 (42Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). From these two seminal observations, Radhakrishnan et al. (41Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson J.H. Montiminy M.R. Wright P. Cell. 1997; 91: 7441-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (601) Google Scholar) predicted that p53 directly interacts with the hydrophobic groove on the surface of KIX. If the prediction is correct, it would provide strong support for direct coactivator competition between Tax and p53. In this study, we examined the proposed interaction between p53 and the KIX domain of CBP. We show that both recombinant and endogenous forms of p53 specifically interact with KIX. The activation domain of p53 participates in KIX binding, and this interaction appears to be important for p53 transcription function. We extend these studies to show that Tax repression of p53-mediated transcription occurs through competition for the p53-KIX interaction. We also show that p53 represses Tax transcription function, as would be predicted from coactivator competition. Our evidence indicates that reciprocal repression between p53 and Tax arises directly from intracellular competition for the KIX domain of CBP. Finally, we show that Tax and p53 bind to KIX in a mutually exclusive fashion in vitro, providing a molecular basis for the intracellular competition. Together, these data suggest that Tax may inactivate p53 by specifically competing for the p53-KIX interaction. These observations may contribute key insight into the molecular events that lead to HTLV-I-associated leukemogenesis. GST-KIX451–719, the GST-ΔKIX deletion mutants, and the GST-KIX point mutants have previously been described in detail (14Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. Van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E. Escudero K.E.

GST-CH/1-KIX was made by PCR amplification of the CBP cDNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 302–683 (pRC/RSV-CBP) (44Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and insertion of the fragment into the Bam HI site of pGex2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-CH/1 was made by digestion of the GST-CH/1-KIX PCR product with Eco RI, releasing a 471-base pair fragment corresponding to CBP amino acids 302–451. This fragment was inserted into the Bam HI/Eco RI site of pGex2T. Both expression plasmids were transformed into SCS1 cells (Stratagene), and the proteins were purified as described previously (43Yan J.-P. Garrus J.E. Giebler H.A. Stargell L.A. Nyborg J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Three GST fusion proteins encompassing the carboxyl-terminal region of CBP were made by PCR amplification of the appropriate sequences from pRc/RSV-CBP (44Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The PCR fragment from region 1, which carries sequences corresponding to amino acids 1514–1894, was inserted into the Bam HI site of pGex2T. PCR fragments from both region 2, which carries sequences corresponding to amino acids 1894–2221, and region 3, which carries sequences corresponding to amino acids 2212–2441, were inserted into the Eco RI/Bam HI site of pGex2T. The expression plasmids for regions 1 and 3 were transformed into SCS1 cells, and region 2 was transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS (45Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were expanded and induced, and the GST proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography. Histidine-tagged p53 (His6-p53) was cloned by PCR amplification of the full-length, wild type p53 cDNA (p53-H-19) (28Harris N. Brill E. Shohat O. Prokocimer M. Wolf D. Arai N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4650-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The PCR product was inserted into the Eco RI/Bam HI site of pRSETA, transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS, expanded, and induced as described previously (45Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). p53 was purified to greater than 90% homogeneity by Ni+2-NTA agarose chromatography (Qiagen). The purified protein was dialyzed against p53 dialysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, 20% glycerol), aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. The histidine-tagged double point mutant of p53 (L22Q/W23S) was created as described above using the wild type His6-p53 plasmid and Stratagene's Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit. The DNA was transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS, expanded, induced, and purified exactly as wild type His6-p53. Tax protein was expressed from the pTaxHis6 expression plasmid (46Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (14Giebler H.A. Loring J.E. Van Orden K. Colgin M.A. Garrus J.E.

All GST pull-down experiments were performed using 12.5 μl of glutathione-agarose beads equilibrated in 0.5× Superdex buffer (1× Superdex contains 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μmZnSO4, 150 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA). The indicated amount of purified GST-CBP fusion protein was incubated with the beads for 1–2 h at 4 °C and then washed two times with 0.5× Superdex buffer. The indicated amount of the second protein was then added to the washed beads and incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice as before, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample dyes. Bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the appropriate antibody. The following antibodies were used in this report: anti-Tax antibody (epitope corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids), anti-p53 antibody (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (epitope corresponding to amino acids 11–25), anti-p53 antibody (Ab-1, Calbiochem) (epitope corresponding to amino acids 371–380), and anti-His antibody (H-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The antibody inhibition pull-down experiments were performed as above, except that the indicated amount of p53 was preincubated with the indicated amount of either anti-p53 (DO-1), anti-p53 (Ab-1), or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (cell surface epitope) for 15 min at 4 °C prior to addition to either GST alone or GST-KIX588–683. HTLV-I negative Jurkat T-cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. For transient cotransfection assays, cells were grown to a density of 106 cells/ml and transfected with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a constant amount of DNA for 5 h. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before harvest. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with a Turner Designs model TD 20-e luminometer.

The expression plasmid for the double point mutant of p53 (L22Q/W23S) was created using the wild type pC53-SN3 plasmid and Stratagene's Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit. HTLV-I-infected SLB1 human T-cells were grown to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. The nuclei were prepared using an adaptation of a previously published nuclear extract protocol (51Dynan W.S. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering. 9. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1987: 75-87Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1 g/liter MgCl2. The cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) and homogenized, and the nuclei were isolated by centrifugation. Aliquoted nuclear pellets were frozen until immediately prior to use. To perform the GST pull-out experiments, thawed nuclei were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors and sonicated three times (30 s each) at 50% output with a Branson sonifier. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and total protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Glutathione-agarose beads (25 μl) were equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then incubated with 50 μg of the indicated GST fusion protein at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with equilibration buffer and then incubated with 1.5 mg of SLB1 nuclear extract at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed twice in equilibration buffer and resuspended in SDS sample dyes. The eluted proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellose, and probed with an anti-p53 antibody (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using chemiluminescence (Pierce). Previous studies have shown that p53 physically interacts with a poorly defined carboxyl-terminal region of CBP to activate transcription (30Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G.

We were interested in testing whether p53 may also interact with the KIX domain of CBP, as a recent study suggested that p53 may possess structural features enabling interaction with KIX (41Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson J.H. Montiminy M.R. Wright P. Cell. 1997; 91: 7441-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (601) Google Scholar). To directly test this idea, a purified GST-KIX fusion protein (GST-KIXaa588–683; see Fig.1 A) was bound to glutathione-agarose beads and used in a GST pull-down assay with full-length purified, recombinant p53. This KIX construct has previously been shown to represent the minimal region of KIX required for interaction with other transcription factors (41Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D.

For comparison, we also tested the binding of p53 to the other regions of CBP reported to interact with p53. These include C/H1 (aa 302–451), a CBP domain involved in p53 degradation (53Grossman S.R.

Recombinant p53 bound strongly and specifically to C/H1, C/H1-KIX, KIX, and carboxyl-terminal region 2 (aa 1894–2221) (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 4, 6, 9, and 10). These data reveal that p53 binds the KIX domain with an apparent binding affinity comparable to that observed with the previously described carboxyl-terminal region of CBP (GST-C-region 2; Fig.1 A).

Tachystatins exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Of these tachystatins, tachystatin C was most effective. Tachystatin A is homologous to tachystatin B, but tachystatin C has no significant sequence similarity to tachystatins A and B. Tachystatins A and B showed sequence similarity to ω-agatoxin-IVA of funnel web spider venom, a potent blocker of voltage-dependent calcium channels. However, they exhibited no blocking activity of the P-type calcium channel in rat Purkinje cells. Tachystatin C also showed sequence similarity to several insecticidal neurotoxins of spider venoms. Tachystatins A, B, and C bound significantly to chitin. A causal relationship was observed between chitin binding activity and antifungal activity. Tachystatins caused morphological changes against a budding yeast, and tachystatin C had a strong cell lysis activity. The septum between mother cell and bud, a chitin-rich region, was stained by fluorescence-labeled tachystatin C, suggesting that the primary recognizing substance on the cell wall is chitin. As horseshoe crab is a close relative of the spider, tachystatins and spider neurotoxins may have evolved from a common ancestral peptide, with adaptive functions.

Innate immunity is phylogenetically older than acquired immunity, and a certain form of innate immunity is present in all multicellular organisms. Insects respond to septic injury by the rapid and transient synthesis of defense molecules, as an acute phase reaction (1Hoffmann J.A. Hetru C. Reichhart J-M.

These hemocytes are highly sensitive to lipopolysaccharides, which are major outer membrane components of Gram-negative bacteria. The defense molecules stored in both granules are secreted by exocytosis after stimulation with lipopolysaccharides.

The fungal suspension, 10 μl, was mixed with 10 μl of a 2-fold serial-diluted tachystatins A, B, or C with the same buffer and placed in each well of a 12-well slide glass and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Morphological changes were assessed using an Olympus microscope, model BX 50. For fluorescence microscopic analysis, tachystatin C was labeled using an AlexaTM 488 protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and a protocol provided by the manufacturer. The suspension of P. pastoris was mixed with the labeled tachystatin C (a final concentration of 0.18 mg/ml) or the fluorescence ligand coupled with bovine serum albumin (a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) as a negative control and incubated at 22 °C for 15 min. Under these conditions, tachystatin C caused little cell lysis of P. pastoris. A chitin binding fluorescence agent, calcofluor (a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml) was also used for positive staining of the cell wall. Fluorescence microscopy was done using an Olympus fluorescence microscope, model BX-FLA. Chitin (0.5 mg) was mixed with antimicrobial substances in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 2 mmCaCl2, then incubated at room temperature for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and the precipitate was washed with 1 ml of the same buffer and eluted with 100 μl of 0.1 m HCl. The concentrations of the bound form were determined using a micro BCATM protein assay kit from Pierce. Antimicrobial substances dissolved in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15m NaCl were mixed with the same volume of sheep erythrocytes in the same buffer (final 1%, v/v) and incubated at 37 °C. An aliquot was taken at a 1-h interval and centrifuged to obtain supernatant. The hemolytic activity was determined by measuring the absorbance at 546 nm as a result of hemoglobin released from erythrocytes and compared with complete lysis (100% hemolysis) obtained by adding deionized water instead of saline. The samples were reduced and S-alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine as described (23Charbonneau H. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 15-30Google Scholar). The S-alkylated tachystatin A was digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin (E/S = 1/25, w/w) in 0.1 mNH4HCO3 containing 2 m urea at 37 °C for 12 h. The S-alkylated tachystatin B was digested with endoproteinase Asp-N (E/S = 1/25, w/w) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m urea at 37 °C for 12 h. The S-alkylated tachystatin C was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (enzyme/substrate = 1/25, w/w) in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 containing 2m urea at 37 °C for 12 h. The resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC1 using a Cosmosil 5C18 MS (2.0 × 150 mm, Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto) or a μBondasphere 5C8 (2.1 × 150 mm, Waters, Millipore, Milford, MA) column with a linear gradient of 0–48% acetonitrile in 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid for 90 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 210 nm. Amino acid analysis was performed on a Waters PICO-TAG system. Protein concentrations for determining extinction coefficients of tachystatins were calculated from the amino acid mass/A280. An internal standard, norleucine, was added to the protein hydrolysates to allow for correction for losses. Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 477A or 473A gas phase sequencer. The ESI-mass spectrometry spectra were obtained using a JMS-HX/HX110A double-focusing mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo) equipped with an ESI ion source (Analytical of Branford, Branford, CT). Experimental details were as described (24Shimizu T. Takao T. Hozumi K. Nunomura K. Ohta S. Shimonishi Y. Ikegami S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12071-12079Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The degenerate nucleotide sequences of the primers used for polymerase chain reaction were based on the amino acid sequences of QGFNCV (residues 7–12) and YFPGST (residues 32–37) of tachystatin A. Sense and antisense nucleotides were synthesized with an Eco RI site at the 5′ end. Reactions for polymerase chain reaction contained the cDNA template (corresponding to 0.1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA) and 100 pmol each of the primer was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler. The polymerase chain reaction products were treated with Eco RI and purified using agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments of interest were then ligated into plasmid Bluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for sequence analysis, as described by Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One clone that contained the sequence of tachystatin A was used as a probe. A λZipLox cDNA library was screened by the probe, as described (15Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A positive clone with a 0.55-kilobase pair insert was sequenced in both orientations using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer, using sequencing primers. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Computer-assisted homology search was made using the Internet BLAST Search of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Cultivation of Purkinje cells and the electrophysiological experiments were done as described (27Kasahara J. Sugiyama H. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cerebella were dissected from rat fetuses around embryonic days 18 to 20, treated with 1% trypsin, and dispersed in serum-free defined medium (28Fischer G. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 28: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) by gentle pipetting, then plated on 10-mm round glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. Purkinje cells after the days 25 to 35 in vitro were voltage-clamped at −80 mV and depolarized periodically to −10 mV for 60 ms to record Ca2+ currents using the whole-cell patch clamp recording system (27Kasahara J. Sugiyama H. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The compositions of external and patch internal solutions were as follows: external solution, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.35, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.003 mm tetrodotoxin, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, and 1 mm4-aminopyridine; patch internal solution, 10 mm Hepes-CsOH, pH 7.35, containing 140 mm CsCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgATP, and 0.4 mm NaGTP. ω-Agatoxin IVA and tachystatins A and B were dissolved in deionized water and diluted with external solution just before use. The hemocyte debris (36 g, wet weight) was extracted twice by homogenizing with 200 ml of 30% acetic acid, and the supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min was lyophilized. The dried material was dissolved in 50 ml of 10% acetic acid and applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (3.6 × 110 cm) equilibrated with 10% acetic acid (Fig.1 A). SDS-PAGE in a 15% gel of every two tubes indicated the presence of peptides within molecular masses of 6 to 8 kDa in fractions 66–72 (data not shown). These fractions were collected, lyophilized, and then applied to an S-Sepharose fast flow column (2 × 32 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl. After washing with the equilibration buffer, peptides were eluted with two steps of a linear NaCl gradient of 0.1 to 0.4 m and then 0.4 to 1.0 m in the same buffer (Fig. 1 B). Two separated peaks were eluted with the first gradient, and both peaks contained an 8-kDa peptide on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The partial NH2-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the first and second peaks contained the previously characterized antimicrobial substances, tachycitin (21Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Lal Agarwala K. Saito T. Cho J. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and big defensin (20Saito T. Kawabata S. Shigenaga T. Takayenoki Y. Cho J. Nakajima H. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), respectively. The second step of the NaCl gradient yielded three separated peaks (A, B, and C in Fig. 1 B), and each contained peptides of 6.8, 7.4, and 7.1-kDa on SDS-PAGE, respectively (Fig. 1 C). These peptides had antimicrobial activity and were named tachystatin A, tachystatin B, and tachystatin C, respectively. The NH2-terminal sequence analysis for tachystatin A showed a sequence of YSR X without contamination. However, the ESI-mass spectrometry gave two peaks at m/z= 5039.4 and 5055.5 (Fig. 2 A), indicating the presence of the two isoforms, named tachystatin A1 and tachystatin A2, respectively. The two isoforms, however, could not be separated by reverse-phase HPLC. The NH2-terminal sequence of Y(V/I)(S/T)X L for tachystatin B was determined with the ratio of Val:Ile at the second cycle of 5.9:4.1. Tachystatin B could be partially separated into two peaks by reverse-phase HPLC, named tachystatin B1 and tachystatin B2 (Fig. 2 B). Based on their peak heights, tachystatins B1 and B2 were present at the ration of 6:4. By sequencing of the two peptides, Val-Ser and Ile-Thr at the second and third positions were identified for tachystatin B1 and for tachystatin B2, respectively. For tachystatin C, the NH2-terminal sequence of DYDWS was determined, and no isoforms were found. All of the antimicrobial components so far identified in small granules of the horseshoe crab hemocytes have a characteristic chitin binding activity (21Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Lal Agarwala K. Saito T. Cho J. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The three types of tachystatins isolated here also bound to chitin and could be eluted by 10% acetic acid and then lyophilized. The extinction coefficients of tachystatins at 280 nm for a 1% solution in deionized water were calculated from the data on amino acid analyses. The values of 18.5 for tachystatin A, 15.2 for tachystatin B, and 51.8 for tachystatin C were used to estimate the peptide concentrations. The yields from 100 g of hemocyte debris were 6.0 mg for tachystatin A, 7.0 mg for tachystatin B, and 1.4 mg for tachystatin C. The isopeptides of tachystatins A and B could not be completely separated by reverse-phase HPLC, and the lyophilized samples, after desalting by the chitin-column chromatography, were used for subsequent assays. No significant contamination other than the isopeptides in these samples was confirmed by amino acid analysis (see Table III).Table IIIAmino acid compositions of tachystatins A, B, and CAmino acidTachystatin ATachystatin BTachystatin CAnalysisSequenceAnalysisSequenceAnalysisSequenceA1A2B1B2Residues/moleculeResidues/moleculeResidues/moleculeAsp1.3(1)(1)2.1(2)(2)3.1(4)Glu3.0(3)(3)1.5(1)Ser3.0(4)(4)3.6(5)(4)1.8(2)Gly5.1(5)(5)5.0(5)(5)3.5(2)Arg6.0(6)(6)7.5(8)(8)5.5(6)Thr2.5(3)(3)1.5(1)(2)1.9(2)Ala1.1(1)(1)2.3(2)Pro3.4(3)(3)1.1(1)(1)5.2(5)Tyr4.3(4)(5)4.0(4)(4)1.8(2)Val1.9(2)(2)1.7(2)(1)Cys6.53-aDetermined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation.(6)(6)5.93-bDetermined as pyridlethyl cysteine.(6)(6)6.03-aDetermined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation.(6)Ile1.0(1)(1)1.5(1)(2)Leu3.0(3)(3)0.9(1)(1)2.0(2)Phe2.4(3)(2)5.1(5)(5)0.8(1)TrpND3-cNot determined.(3)Lys2.7(3)Total(44)(44)(42)(42)(41)Compositions are calculated from 20-h hydrolysates.3-a Determined as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation.3-b Determined as pyridlethyl cysteine.3-c Not determined. Open table in a new tab Compositions are calculated from 20-h hydrolysates. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of tachystatins for growth of various bacteria and fungi were determined, as summarized in TableI. Tachystatins A and B exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus) and fungi (C. albicans and P. pastoris) than Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli). Tachystatin B was inactive against E. coli up to 100 μg/ml. In contrast, tachystatin C showed strong activity against E. coli with an IC50 value of 1.2 μg/ml. Tachystatin C was also very active against S. aureus, C. albicans, and P. pastoris, with the equivalent potency of IC50 values.Table IAntimicrobial activities of the horseshoe crab chitin binding peptidesAmino acid residuespI1-aEach pI value of the peptides was calculated from the amino acid compositions (46).IC501-b50% growth inhibitory concentration.E. coliS. aureusC. albicansP. pastorisμg/mlTachystatin A4411.8254.23.00.5Tachystatin B4212.0NI1-cNo inhibition at 100 μg/ml.7.43.00.1Tachystatin C4111.91.20.80.90.3Tachyplesin1712.3<2.50.30.20.1Big defensin7910.62.5<2.52042Tachycitin7310.1335652411-a Each pI value of the peptides was calculated from the amino acid compositions (46Skoog B Wichman A.

Open table in a new tab Morphological changes of fungi by tachystatins were observed using a budding yeast P. pastoris (Fig.3). In the presence of tachystatin C at 0.1 μg/ml, one-third of IC50, P. pastoris shrank, and the diameter was reduced to about one-half (Fig. 3, A and B). At 3 μg/ml, a 10-fold higher concentration of IC50, tachystatin C clearly caused cell lysis (Fig. 3 C). To compare quantitatively the chitin binding ability, different amounts of the horseshoe crab antimicrobial components were mixed with the constant amount of chitin, and the amounts bound were quantitated. Chitin binding activity was expressed, as the half-maximum concentration required for reaching a plateau of chitin binding. A progression curve of tachystatin C bound to chitin is shown in Fig.4, and parameters of the chitin binding activities are summarized in Table II. The three tachystatins bound to chitin at the half-maximum concentrations of 4.3–8.4 μm, equivalent to those obtained for tachyplesin and a plant chitin binding lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (29Lotan R. Sharon N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 1340-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Privat J.P. Delmotte F. Mialonier G. Bouchard P. Monsigny M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These data indicate that tachystatins also belong to the family of chitin binding antimicrobial substances.Table IIChitin binding activities of the horseshoe crab antimicrobial peptidesConcentration required for 50% bindingμmTachystatin A8.4Tachystatin B4.3Tachystatin C5.2Tachyplesin6.6Big defensin25.4Tachycitin19.5Wheat germ agglutinin2-aWheat germ agglutinin was calculated as the dimer (Mr, 37,510).9.02-a Wheat germ agglutinin was calculated as the dimer (Mr, 37,510). Open table in a new tab The broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and chitin binding activity of tachystatins suggested that tachystatins recognize bacterial cell wall components. The cell wall of budding yeasts contains several polysaccharides, such as mannan, glucan, and chitin. During budding in the cell cycle, chitin has been identified mainly in a primary septum at the constriction between mother cell and budding daughter cell (31Cabib E. Roberts R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 763-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This region can be visualized by a fluorescent brightener, calcofluor (32Elorza M.V. Rico H. Sentandreu R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 1577-1582PubMed Google Scholar, 33Roncero C. Durán A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When P. pastoris was treated with calcofluor, the septum region between mother cell and bud was clearly stained (Fig.5 B). To visualize tachystatins bound to the cell wall, tachystatin C was fluorescence labeled by Alexa 488. The labeled tachystatin C was mixed with P. pastoris, and photomicroscopy was done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The labeled tachystatin C was localized at the P. pastoris envelope and seems to be concentrated at the septum region (Fig. 5 A). The cell wall was not stained by fluorescence-labeled bovine serum albumin, used as a control (data not shown). Because tachystatin C could lyse P. pastoris cells, effects of three types of tachystatins on sheep erythrocytes were investigated and compared with findings in other horseshoe crab antimicrobial substances. Tachystatin C caused hemolysis in time- and dose-dependent manners, but tachystatins A and B and the antimicrobial substances, including tachyplesin, big defensin, and tachycitin, had little or no effect on the erythrocytes under the same conditions (Figs.6, A and B). Several hemolysins and hemolytic lectins form ion-permeable pores in erythrocyte membranes, and their hemolytic activities are protected by the addition of polyethylene glycols or dextrans, an osmotic protection (34Scherrer R. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 718-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether or not the hemolytic activity of tachystatin C is due to the formation of ion-permeable pores on the plasma membranes, osmotic protection assay was done. Sheep erythrocytes were incubated with tachystatin C in the presence of several protectants with different molecular sizes. The hemolysis was inhibited strongly as the molecular sizes of polyethylene glycols or dextrans increased; polyethylene glycol 600 (molecular diameter = 1.6 nm) and polyethylene glycol 1540 (2.4 nm) afforded little or no protection against lysis, whereas dextran 4 (3.5 nm) and polyethylene glycol 4000 (3.8 nm) gave 88 and 95% protection against hemolysis, respectively (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate the presence of ion-permeable pores on the erythrocyte membranes with a diameter of about 3.5 nm. The amino acid sequences of tachystatins A1, A2, B1, B2, and C were determined by NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the S-pyridylethylated tachystatins and their peptide fragments produced by proteolytic digests (Fig.7). Tachystatins A1 and A2 could not be separated by reverse-phase HPLC, but the amino acid sequence analysis of tachystatin A containing A1 and A2 established the first 42 residues, indicating the amino acid difference between the isoform is located at the COOH-terminal region. Furthermore, the chymotryptic digest of tachystatin A yielded two kinds of the COOH-terminal peptides, C9F containing Phe at the COOH terminus and C5Y containing Tyr at the COOH terminus, indicating that two peptides are derived from tachystatin A1 and tachystatin A2, respectively. The theoretical masses of tachystatins A1 (5039.8) and A2 (5055.8) from the primary structures were consistent with those obtained by ESI-mass spectrometry (Fig.2 A). Amino acid analyses indicated that the compositions of the tachystatins A, B, and C were closely consistent with the sum of their sequences (Table III). A nucleotide sequence was also determined to obtain information on a precursor form of tachystatins, using a probe for tachystatin A as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A positive clone with the longest insert was sequenced. The cDNA contained 545 base pairs starting with the ATG codon for an initiation Met at nucleotide position 55 and the stop codon at position 256 followed by a poly(A) tail at position 509 (Fig. 8). An open reading frame coded for an NH2-terminal signal sequence of 23 residues and a mature tachystatin A2. The precursor contained no propeptide with an Arg-Xaa-Lys/Arg-Arg motif at the cleavage site found in big defensin (35Kawabata S. Saito T. Saeki K. Okino N. Mizutani A. Toh Y. Iwanaga S. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, there was no COOH-terminal extension peptides found in tachyplesin (36Shigenaga T. Muta T. Toh Y. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21350-21354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tachycitin (21Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Lal Agarwala K. Saito T. Cho J. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Tachystatin A1 and A2 had 42% sequence identity with tachystatin B1 and B2, respectively (Fig.9 A). Tachystatin C, however, exhibited no significant sequence similarity to tachystatins A and B. Homology search revealed interesting sequence identity (22%) of tachystatins A and B with ω-agatoxin-IVA (Fig. 9 A). ω-Agatoxin-IVA, a neurotoxin isolated from the venom of the funnel web spider (Agelenopsis aperta), is a potent blocker of voltage-dependent P-type Ca2+ channels in mammals (37Mintz I.M. Venema V.J. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Bean B.P. Adams M.E. Nature. 1992; 355: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). On the other hand, tachystatin C had 30–33% sequence identity to insecticidal peptides isolated from spider venoms, such as μ-agatoxin II from A. aperta (38Skinner W.S. Adams M.E. Quistad G.B. Kataoka H. Cesarin B.J. Enderlin F.E. Schooley D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2150-2155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aptotoxin VII from Aptostichus schlingeri (39Skinner W.S. Dennis P.A. Li J.P. Quistad G.B. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and curtatoxins II and III from Hololena curta (40Stapleton A. Blankenship D.T. Ackermann B.L. Chen T.M. Gorder G.W. Manley G.D. Palfreyman M.G. Coutant J.E. Cardin A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2054-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 9 B). μ-Agatoxin II is a neurotoxin that modifies the kinetics of voltage-dependent Na+ channels in insects (41Adams M.E. Herold E.E. Venema V.J. J. Comp. Physiol. A Sens. Neural. Behav. Physiol. 1989; 164: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine if tachystatins block Ca2+channel activity, voltage clamp recording was done using cultured rat cerebellar Purkinje cells. Depolarization of the Purkinje cells resulted in the inward currents (data not shown). When the external solution replaced the Ca2+-free solution, the currents completely disappeared, and these currents were also blocked almost completely with 75 nm ω-agatoxin IVA. The relative amplitudes were 0% ± 0% (mean ± S.E.) by Ca2+-free solution and 5% ± 3.5% by 75 nm ω-agatoxin IVA, respectively. These results clearly indicate that the currents are P-type Ca2+ currents. In contrast, tachystatins A and B had no apparent effects on P-type Ca2+ currents. Relative amplitudes were 96% ± 2.4% by 100 nm tachystatin B and 95% ± 2.2% by 300 nm tachystatin A. Antimicrobial peptides named tachystatins A, B, and C were newly identified from hemocytes of the Japanese horseshoe crab T. tridentatus. Furthermore, their isoforms with amino acid replacements for tachystatins A, tachystatins A1 and A2, tachystatin B, and tachystatins B1 and B2 were identified. Tachystatins A (A1 and A2), B (B1 and B2), and C consist of a total 44, 42, and 41 amino acid residues, respectively. The sequence identity between tachystatins A and B is 40%. Tachystatin C showed no significant sequence similarity to tachystatins A and B. A homology search revealed that tachystatins A and B show sequence similarity to ω-agatoxin-IVA of funnel web spider (A. aperta) venom, a potent blocker of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Tachystatin C also shows sequence similarity to those of insecticidal neurotoxins isolated from spider venoms, μ-agatoxin, aptotoxin VII, and curtatoxins II and III. However, tachystatins A and B exhibited no blocking activity of the P-type calcium channel in rat Purkinje neuron. Kim et al. (42Kim J.I. Konishi S. Iwai H. Kohno T. Gouda H. Shimada I. Sato K. Arata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that the removal of eight amino acid residues from the COOH-terminal region of ω-agatoxin IVA led to a marked reduction in channel-blocking activity, thereby indicating the importance of this region for expressing channel-blocking activity. The hydrophobic COOH-terminal extension found in ω-agatoxin IVA is missing from the sequences of tachystatins, and this may explain the lack of blocking activity of tachystatins for the ion channel. Antimicrobial peptides from scorpion blood also have sequence similarity to several neurotoxins, which are ion channel blockers (43Ehret-Sabatier L. Loew D. Goyffon M. Fehlbaum P. Hoffmann J.A. Van Dorsselaer A. Bulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29537-29544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The horseshoe crab is a close relative of spiders and scorpions, all of which belong to Chelicerata. Therefore, these tachystatins and spider neurotoxins may have evolved from a common ancestral peptide, with adaptive functions. Tachystatin C but not tachystatins A and B exhibits hemolytic activity. Moreover, osmotic protection assays suggest that tachystatin C forms ion-permeable pores with a diameter of about 3.5 nm on the membranes (Fig. 6). Several proteins and peptides with cytolytic properties possess a common sequence feature of a cationic site flanked by a hydrophobic surface (44Kini R.M. Herbert J.E. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1989; 34: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). ω-Agatoxin IVA (42Kim J.I. Konishi S. Iwai H. Kohno T. Gouda H. Shimada I. Sato K. Arata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and μ-agatoxin (45Omecinsky D.O. Holub K.E. Adams M.E. Reily M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2836-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) consist of a triple-stranded β-sheet. If the three kinds of tachystatins have a common structural motif, the COOH-terminal part of tachystatin C appears to form an amphiphilic β-sheet, but the corresponding β-sheets of tachystatins A and B do not have the amphiphilic character (Fig. 10). Therefore, the amphiphilic COOH-terminal region of tachystatin C may have an important role in hemolytic activity and cell lysis of P. pastoris. Tachystatins have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Among them, tachystatin C is the most effective with the same potency against these microorganisms (Table I). Tachystatins, therefore, could recognize different types of cell wall components, such as lipopolysaccharides of Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acids of Gram-positive bacteria, in addition to mannan, β-glucan, or chitin of fungi. Cell wall binding activity of tachystatin C was visualized on a budding yeast P. pastoris using the fluorescence-labeled tachystatin C. The septum region between mother cell and bud, a chitin-rich site of the yeast, was strongly stained. Thus, the primary recognizing substance on the cell wall of fungi is likely to be chitin. Based on these results, there appears to be a causal relationship between chitin binding activity and antifungal activity, since big defensin and tachycitin with lower chitin binding affinity have one or two orders higher IC50 values for fungi than those of tachystatins and tachyplesin with higher chitin binding activity (Tables I and II). Interestingly, the small granule-derived antimicrobial substances so far identified, including tachyplesin, big defensin, tachycitin (21Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T. Lal Agarwala K. Saito T. Cho J. Nakajima H. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and tachystatin A, all bind to chitin. On the other hand, horseshoe crab lectins found in the large granules of hemocytes, named tachylectins 1–4, have no apparent binding ability to chitin (data not shown). Thus, the chitin binding property may be a common feature of the small granular components. Chitin is a component of the cell wall of fungi, and it is also the major structural component of arthropod exoskeletons. The antimicrobial substances released from hemocytes probably recognize chitin exposed at the site of a lesion, and they appear to serve not only as antibacterial defense molecules against invading microbes but also in wound healing, which may stimulate and accelerate biosynthesis of chitin at sites of injury.

Analysis of the Escherichia coli genome has revealed the presence of 5 paralogues of EI and 5 paralogues of HPr, most of unknown function. The ptsP gene encodes an EI paralogue designated Enzyme Initrogen(EINtr), and two genes located in the rpoN operon encode PTS protein paralogues, NPr and IIANtr, both implicated in the regulation of ς54 activity. The ptsP gene was polymerase chain reaction amplified from the E. coli chromosome and cloned into an overexpression vector allowing the overproduction and purification of EINtr. EINtr was shown to phosphorylate NPr in vitro using either a [32P]PEP-dependent protein phosphorylation assay or a quantitative sugar phosphorylation assay. EINtr phosphorylated NPr but not HPr, whereas Enzyme I exhibited a strong preference for HPr. These two pairs of proteins (EINtr/NPr and EI/HPr) thus exhibit little cross-reactivity. Phosphoryl transfer from PEP to NPr catalyzed by EINtr has a pH optimum of 8.0, is dependent on Mg2+, is stimulated by high ionic strength, and exhibits two Km values for NPr (2 and 10 μm) possibly because of negative cooperativity. The results suggest that E. coli possesses at least two distinct PTS phosphoryl transfer chains, EINtr → NPr → IIANtr and EI → HPr → IIAsugar. Sequence comparisons allow prediction of residues likely to be important for specificity. This is the first report demonstrating specificity at the level of the energy coupling proteins of the PTS.

Characterized PTS proteins include the cytoplasmic Enzyme I and HPr, which lack sugar specificity, and membranous Enzyme II complexes, each specific for one or a few sugars. The latter complexes usually consist of three proteins or protein domains that are designated IIA, IIB, and IIC (4Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphoryl relay proceeds sequentially from PEP to Enzyme I, HPr, IIA, IIB, and finally to the incoming sugar that is transported across the membrane and concomitantly phosphorylated by IIC. The PTS is present in a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but PTS protein homologues have not been found in archaea or eukaryotes. In addition to its primary functions in sugar transport, sugar phosphorylation, and chemoreception, the PTS is involved in regulatory processes such as catabolite repression and inducer exclusion (5Saier Jr., M.H.

Protein phosphorylation involving NPr and IIANtr was suggested to function in linking carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and IIANtr has also been implicated in the regulation of the essential GTPase, Era, which appears to function in cell cycle progression and the initiation of cell division (10Powell B.S.

Analysis of the E. coli genome revealed a gene, ptsP, encoding Enzyme INtr (EINtr), consisting of 2 domains, an N-terminal domain of 127 amino acids homologous to the N-terminal “sensory” domain of the NifA protein of Azotobacter vinelandii (16Austin S. Buck M. Cannon W. Eydmann T. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3460-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal domain of 578 amino acids homologous to all currently sequenced enzymes I. EINtr was suggested to serve a sensory function linking carbon and nitrogen metabolism (17Reizer J. Reizer A. Merrick M.J. Plunkett III, G. Rose D.J. Saier Jr., M.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A mutation in the orthologous EINtr-encoding ptsP gene of A. vinelandii resulted in impaired metabolism of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate as well as diminished respiratory protection of nitrogenase under carbon-limiting conditions (18Segura D. Espin G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4790-4798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we report the cloning and overexpression of the ptsP gene from E. coli, the purification of EINtr, and the characterization of its biochemical activities. The results of these studies establish for the first time the existence of parallel but independent PTS phosphoryl transfer chains in which distinct Enzyme I paralogues exhibit specificity for their cognate HPr paralogues. Residues are identified that may account for this specificity. Salmonella typhimurium strain SB2950(ΔcysKptsHIcrrΔtrpB223) has been described (19Cordaro J.C. Roseman S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 17-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning vector pCR2.1TM was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Plasmid pJRENtr used for overexpression of EINtr is described below. Purified ppGpp was kindly provided by Mike Cashel (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). [U-14C]d-Mannitol (specific activity 32 mCi/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity >4000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Other chemicals were of analytical grade. A DNA fragment containing the ptsP gene encoding EINtrwas amplified by polymerase chain reaction using E. coli genomic DNA. The top strand primer (Ntr1) contained a Nde I site within the initiation codon (underlined) of ptsP, 5′-ACACGAATTCCATATGCTCACTCGCCTGCGCGAAATAG-3′. The bottom strand (Ntr2) contained a Sal I site (underlined) 5′-CTAAGTCGACATGATCCGCGCTATAACCCTCCGCGAA-3′. Amplification was performed with a Hybaid thermal reactor (Hybaid Ltd., Teddigton, Middlessex, United Kingdom) in a reaction mixture containing Taq DNA polymerase, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 15 mm MgCl2, and 250 mm KCl (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in a total volume of 100 μl. The amplification mixture was overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil and subjected to 30 cycles of amplification as follows: 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 55 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA was ligated to pCR2.1TM (Invitrogen), and the Nde I-Sal I fragment encompassing the complete ptsP gene was then excised from this plasmid and cloned between the Nde I and Sal I sites of the overexpression vector pROEXTM-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to create the plasmid pJRENtr. Cloning of ptsP was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using polymerase chain reaction dye terminator sequencing on an ABI 373 sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with a series of oligonucleotides specific for ptsP. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained commercially from either GenSet (La Jolla, CA) or Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). E. coli DH10B was transformed with the expression vector pJRENtr encoding EINtr. DH10B cells bearing the overexpression plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and diluted 50–100-fold into fresh LB medium containing the same concentration of ampicillin. When the optical density of the culture growing at 37 °C reached an A600 of 0.5–1.0, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and incubation was continued for an additional 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in TP buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and ruptured as described previously (20Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The crude extract was centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 rpm (SS34 rotor, RC5-centrifuge; Sorvall-DuPont, Wilmington, DE), and the overexpressed EINtr, which was found primarily in the pellet, was solubilized with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. Following centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 rpm (SS34 rotor, RC5-centrifuge), the supernatant containing the overexpressed protein was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.9) containing 0.5m NaCl and 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride. The column was washed with 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, and EINtrwas eluted with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 1m NaCl, 0.3 m imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 6m guanidinium hydrochloride. The fraction containing EINtr was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. E. coli EI, HPr, and NPr were overproduced and purified as described previously (10Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol.

Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). [32P]PEP was separated from [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]Pi by ion-exchange chromatography on AG-1-X8 bicarbonate resin (analytical grade anion exchange resin, 20–50 mesh, chloride form (Bio-Rad)). Protein phosphorylation reactions were modified after Powell et al. (10Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol.

The EINtr-specific phosphorylation reaction (at 37 °C for 15 min; 20 μl final volume) contained 250 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.125 mm[32P]PEP (1.2 × 105 counts/min/nmol), 0.6 μg of EINtr, and 10 μg of NPr. The EI-specific phosphorylation reaction (at 37 °C for 15 min, 20 μl final volume) contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.125 mm [32P]PEP (1.2 × 105counts/min/nmol), 0.6 μg of EI, and 1.25 μg of HPr. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (20Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Saier Jr., M.H. Stewart G.C. Peterkofsky A. Reddy P.

Proteins labeled with [32P]PEP were detected by autoradiography as described (24Reizer J. Novotny M.J. Hengstenberg W. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 333-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of soluble PTS proteins, EINtr, EI, NPr, and HPr, were determined according to the method described by Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in butanol-urea-extracted membranes were measured using the DC Protein Assay as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Bovine plasma γ globulin was used as a standard. Membrane samples and standards were boiled for 5 min in the presence of 1% SDS or N-octyl-3-d-glucopyranoside prior to the addition of the reagents. Membranes containing high levels of Enzyme IICBAMtl, used for assaying EI and EINtr, were prepared from strain SB2950, which lacks EI, HPr, and IIAGlc (26Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Batch cultures (5 liters) of strain SB2950 were grown overnight in nutrient broth (Difco). Cultures were centrifuged at 16,000 × g (GSA rotor, RC-5 centrifuge) for 5–10 min at 4 °C, washed in mineral medium (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 15 mm(NH4)2SO4 and 1.7 mmMgSO4), and resuspended in 25 ml of 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 μg/ml DNase I. The cells were ruptured at 10,000 p.s.i. in a French pressure cell, and intact cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,500 × g (SS34 rotor, RC-5 centrifuge) for 10 min at 4 °C. Membranes were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g (Ti rotor, L7–65 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments) and resuspended in a few ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm DTT and 1 mmEDTA. These membranes were extracted with urea and 1-butanol (27Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Urea (480 mg/ml) was added and dissolved by stirring on ice. Then 1-butanol (40 μl/ml) was added, and this solution was gently stirred for 2 h on ice. Membranes were recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g (Ti rotor) for 4 h at 4 °C. Extracted membranes from 5 liters of stationary phase cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA to a final protein concentration of 11–32 mg/ml and transferred to boiled dialysis tubes (MWCO: 12–14.000, Spectrum Medical Industries Inc., Houston, TX). Membranes were dialyzed 3 times for 8 h against the same buffer and were then aliquoted in small plastic vials for storage at −20 °C. Extraction of peripheral proteins from the membranes eliminated background sugar phosphorylation activity. The [32P]PEP-dependent protein phosphorylation assay described above does not provide a rate but instead represents an equilibrium situation. To allow estimation of relative rates of phosphoryl transfer via various PTS proteins, a quantitative assay was required. We found that phosphorylation of [14C]mannitol (or another PTS sugar) could be used for this purpose although the rate of phosphoryl transfer involving EINtr and NPr was very low relative to that involving EI and HPr. [14C]Mannitol was selected as the phosphoryl acceptor because this sugar is PTS-specific, and no phosphatase cleaving the product ([14C]mannitol-1-phosphate) is known. The standard assay for PTS sugar phosphorylation employs membranes isolated from disrupted E. coli cells that overproduce several Enzyme II complexes because of a pts operon deletion (28Rephaeli A.W. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 658-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the inverted membrane preparations are “leaky,” protein components and sugar phosphate products are not compartmentalized. Thus, this assay provides a useful measure of relative rates of overall phosphoryl transfer employing EINtr and NPr as well as EI and HPr, even though the former reaction is not physiologically significant. The sugar phosphorylation assay used was modified from the method described by Kundig and Roseman (27Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as required by the exceptionally low activity of EINtr in this assay. The reaction mixture (50 μl) generally consisted of 0.1 μg of EINtr, 5 μg of NPr, 5–10 μl of extracted membranes, 10 mm PEP, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KF, 2.5 mm DTT, 250 mm HEPES or potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 1.5 μm[U-14C]d-mannitol (specific activity 32 mCi/mmol). The reaction mixture was usually preincubated for 1 h in the absence of [U-14C]d-mannitol, and the reaction was started by the addition of the labeled sugar. After incubation (usually at 37 °C for 2 h), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold deionized water. The sugar phosphorylation assay for EI was in general carried out in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 3 ng of EI, 0.1 μg of HPr, 10 μl of extracted membrane, 10 mm PEP, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KF, 2.5 mm DTT, and 1.5 μm[U-14C]d-mannitol (specific activity 32 mCi/mmol). EINtr or EI was present in rate-limiting amounts, whereas all other components of the assay mixtures were present in excess. [U-14C]d-Mannitol-phosphate was separated from the nonphosphorylated [U-14C]d-mannitol by ion exchange chromatography. The reaction mixture was transferred to Poly-Prep® chromatography columns (0.8 × 4 cm, Bio-Rad) containing analytical grade Bio-Rad anion exchange resin (AG 1-X2, 50–100 mesh, chloride form, Bio-Rad) (27Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonphosphorylated [U-14C]d-mannitol was washed from the columns by the addition of three 10-ml aliquots of water. [U-14C]d-Mannitol-phosphate was then eluted with three 3-ml aliquots of 1 mm LiCl and collected in liquid scintillation vials. After the addition of 9 ml of Bio SafeII counting mixture (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, CA), the radioactivity was measured. To study the properties of EINtr, we developed a sugar phosphorylation assay coupling phosphoryl transfer from PEP via purified EINtr, NPr, and Enzyme IICBAMtl to [14C]mannitol (see “Materials and Methods”). Under the condition described by Kundig and Roseman (27Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5), EINtr showed only marginal activity, but activity was greatly enhanced using 250 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0. Potassium phosphate buffer could be replaced by HEPES but not by MOPS, TES, TRIZMA, or Tris. The HEPES-based buffer system was used when precipitation of cations by phosphate was problematic. The pH range for EINtr was examined using the phosphate-buffered assay system. In contrast to Enzyme I, which has a pH optimum of 7.0–7.5 (29Waygood E.B. Steeves T. Can. J. Biochem. 1979; 58: 40-48Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Saier Jr., M.H. Schmidt M.R. Lin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8579-8584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), EINtr activity was optimal at pH 8.0 (Fig. 1). The dependence of EINtr activity on divalent cations was tested with the HEPES-buffered system (31Weigel N. Kukuruzinska M.A. Nakazawa A. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Mn2+ allowed activity of EINtr only at low concentrations (Fig. 2). In the presence of low concentrations of Co2+ or Ni2+, activity could be measured, but at concentrations above 0.2 mm, strong inhibition was observed.Figure 2Dependence of EINtr activity on the concentration of Mg2+.

The dependence of EINtr activity on the concentration of PEP was examined using the [14C]mannitol phosphorylation assay in phosphate buffer with three different concentrations of NPr (Fig. 3). Regardless of the concentration of NPr used, EINtr proved to be saturated at PEP concentrations higher than 10 mm. The data shown in Fig. 3 A were converted to a double reciprocal plot (1/v versus 1/S, Fig. 3 B). As can be seen, a single straight line could not be drawn through the data obtained with any one NPr concentration, but they could be fitted to two distinct lines with differing slopes. This feature is characteristic of an enzyme population that either consists of two distinct enzyme species with differing kinetic properties or of a single enzyme species exhibiting the property of negative cooperativity. The y intercepts (1/Vmax apparent) shown in Fig. 3 B were plotted versus 1/NPr for the two parts of the curves (Fig. 3 C). Straight lines were observed in each case, and these lines extrapolated to give Vmax and Km values, respectively, of 1 μmol of [14C]mannitol phosphate/mg of EINtr/min and 10 μm for the high velocity, low affinity curve, and 0.3 μmol of [14C]mannitol phosphate/mg of EINtr/min and 2 μm for the low velocity, high affinity curve. Analysis of time courses for EINtractivity showed that the enzyme exhibited a lag phase of 30–40 min under our standard assay conditions (Fig.4). When the otherwise complete reaction mixtures were preincubated for 1 h without either [U-14C]d-mannitol or the extracted membranes, no lag for sugar phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 4). However, the absence of extracted membranes during preincubation yielded lower activity than when mannitol was omitted, suggesting that the membranes might facilitate EINtr-NPr association. In contrast, when either EINtr or NPr was absent during the preincubation, a lag was still observed. Preincubation of EINtr with NPr was therefore required for optimal activity, suggesting that a slow association of these two proteins accounts for the lag phase observed in the control sample. Selective phosphoryl transfer by EI and EINtrcould be demonstrated using the 32P-protein phosphorylation assay. NPr was found to be a specific protein substrate of EINtr as the latter could not phosphorylate HPr (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, Enzyme I was found to be specific for HPr and could barely phosphorylate NPr (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1 and 2). These observations were confirmed using the [14C]mannitol phosphorylation assay. In a previous report, a regulatory function was suggested for the N-terminal domain of EINtr (17Reizer J. Reizer A. Merrick M.J. Plunkett III, G. Rose D.J. Saier Jr., M.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We employed the sugar phosphorylation assay to screen various compounds for effects on the NPr-dependent phosphoryl transfer activity of EINtr. The following salts increased the activity of EINtr when added to the potassium phosphate (50 mm, pH 8.0) -buffered reaction mixture: (NH4)2SO4, NH4Cl, Na2SO4, NaCl, K2SO4, KCl, and LiCl (tested in a concentration range of 10–400 mm). This demonstrated that EINtr activity requires high ionic strength, but no evidence for a specific effect by any one ionic species was obtained. Other compounds (concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mm) tested in the presence of 20 mm Mg2+ (to avoid Mg2+ limitation because of chelation) were l-glutamine,l-glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, GDP, GMP, UDP, ppGpp, and adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phophosulfate. Only GDP and ppGpp at concentrations of 5 mm or higher had effects on the activity of EINtr (50–60% inhibition at 10 mm). The inhibitory effect of GDP was confirmed using the [32P]PEP-dependent protein phosphorylation assay. EINtr-dependent phosphorylation of NPr was significantly reduced although the amount of phosphorylated Enzyme INtr remained similar (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 2). Although phosphorylation of EI was not affected, the inhibition of NPr phosphorylation is not likely to be of physiological significance. Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP were without effect in the concentration range 0.01–1 mm. A number of redox cofactors were examined with respect to potential regulatory effects. The following compounds were tested in the concentration range of 1–10 mm: NAD, NADH, NADP, NADPH, and FAD. Of these compounds, only FAD was inhibitory (50% with 1 mm FAD). EI was similarly inhibited. EINtr resembles the classical EI except for the N-terminal NifA-like putative sensory domain of EINtr. Both enzymes catalyze PEP-dependent phosphoryl transfer to an HPr-like protein in a pH-, salt-, and Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent process (30Saier Jr., M.H. Schmidt M.R. Lin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8579-8584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hoving H. Koning J.H. Robillard G.T.

Chem. 1982; 257: 14470-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of ionic strength may be because of stabilization of the dimeric forms of these enzymes, and Mg2+ may similarly promote association (35Misset O. Brouwer M. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Han M.K. Knutson J.R. Roseman S. Brand L. J. Biol.

However, EINtr exhibits biphasic kinetics with respect to PEP concentration, whereas EI exhibits monophasic kinetics; EINtr exhibits essentially absolute specificity for NPr, whereas EI could phosphorylate NPr at a rate that was only a small fraction of that at which it phosphorylates HPr. The turnover number (38Segel I.H. Enzyme kinetics. Behaviour and analysis of rapid equilibrium and steady-state enzyme systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar) for EINtr using the sugar phosphorylation assay proved to be 0.8 pmol/pmol EINtr/min, whereas that for EI is 1.34 nmol/pmol EI/min (39Mattoo R.L. Waygood E.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 61: 29-37Google Scholar). This 1000-fold difference explains, in part, why EI is absolutely required for sugar phosphorylation under in vivo conditions. ptsI deletion mutants can be mutated so as to express an EI paralogue that can phosphorylate HPr (40Chin A.M. Sutrina S. Feldheim D.A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 894-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but preliminary evidence suggests that this enzyme is not EINtr. 2R. Rabus, J. Reizer, I. Paulsen, and M. H. Saier, Jr., unpublished results. The nearly absolute specificity of EINtr for NPr and of EI for HPr provides the first evidence that two different EIs in a single organism exhibit specificity at the level of their phosphoryl acceptor PTS proteins. This finding clearly leads to both functional and mechanistic predictions. EINtr does not appear to function in sugar phosphorylation and may function exclusively in regulation, possibly controlling the activities of NPr and IIANtr. These latter proteins are encoded within the rpoN operon of E. coli and have been implicated in the regulation of ς54-dependent transcriptional initiation of genes concerned with organic nitrogen utilization (10Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Moreover, in A. vinelandii, the EINtr-encoding ptsP gene has been shown to play a role in poly-β-hydroxybutyrate metabolism and respiratory protection of nitrogenase under carbon-limiting conditions (18Segura D. Espin G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4790-4798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and R. etli, IIANtr has been shown to function in capacities similar to those demonstrated for E. coli (12Michiels J. Van Soom T. D'Hooghe I. Dombrecht B.

Saier Jr., M.H. Res. Microbiol. 1996; 147: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EINtr, NPr, and IIANtr have all been identified in the fully sequenced genome of P. aeruginosa. 3J. Reizer and M. H. Saier, Jr., manuscript in preparation. As for E. coli, these Pseudomonas proteins presumably comprise a phosphoryl transfer chain that functions in parallel with EI, HPr, and various IIAsugar proteins with entirely different physiological consequences (see Fig. 7). Phylogenetic data have shown that NPr is a distant homolog of HPr (10Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas EINtr is a distant homolog of EI (17Reizer J. Reizer A. Merrick M.J. Plunkett III, G. Rose D.J. Saier Jr., M.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mechanistic implications of our biochemical observations are that specific residues in EI versus EINtr and/or HPr versus NPr must control the interactions and phosphoryl transfer reactions between these proteins. Alignments of two segments of all sequenced EINtrs (Fig.6 A, top) with representative EIs (Fig. 6 A, bottom) as well as of recognized NPrs (Fig. 6 B, top) and HPrs (Fig.6 B, bottom) revealed such candidate residues. Residues that are fully conserved among all homologous proteins are presented in bold print, whereas residues that are fully conserved in one group, but of a different type in the other group, are shaded. In comparing EINtr with EI, we found that residues conserved in one of these two sets of proteins but not the other were scattered unevenly throughout the alignment. The greatest abundance of such residues was found to immediately surround the active site histidine (Fig. 6 A, top), a region of catalytic importance. This fact is particularly significant as the active site region is well conserved among either the EIs or the EINtrs. The second region of the multiple alignment exhibiting a high frequency of residues conserved in only one set of these two proteins occurred far downstream of the active site histidine in a region of unknown function (Fig. 6 A, bottom). Neither of these two regions is at the EI-HPr interface (42Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the region that defines the EI-HPr interaction surface, two residues were markedly different in the EIs versus the EINtrs. These residues are the (A/G)H dipeptide in the EIs, which corresponds to the (V/L)Y dipeptide in the EINtrs. Fig. 6 B shows the full alignment of NPr sequences with HPr sequences. As for the EIs, the greatest abundance of residues fully conserved in the NPrs, but of a different nature in the HPrs, surrounds the active site histidine. These dissimilar residues may control relative rates of phosphoryl transfer. A second region exhibiting this characteristic is found C-terminal to the regulatory serine (43Saier Jr., M.H. Chauvaux S. Cook G.M. Deutscher J. Paulsen I.T. Reizer J. Ye J.-J. Microbiology (Read.). 1996; 142: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Both of these regions comprise interaction sites with EI (42Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Gronenborn A. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Of possible significance to the specificity of EINtr for NPr is the A XX M sequence in the NPrs that is lacking in the HPrs (positions 49–52 in the E. coli HPr). The C termini of NPrs additionally possess a fully conserved N XX FDE sequence that is not found in any of the HPrs. These observations provide a guide for site-directed mutagenic studies aimed at defining their functional differences. The presence of a NifA protein-like putative sensory domain in EINtr led to the postulate that this domain might sense the availability of a ligand that could control the phosphoryl transfer activity of the enzyme. Our search for such a small compound has been unsuccessful until now. Thus, GDP exerted an inhibitory effect but only at superphysiological concentrations. FAD also exerted an inhibitory effect at superphysiological concentrations, but because this effect was shared with EI, it cannot be attributed to the presence of the N-terminal NifA-like domain. It is possible that we have not identified the correct effector molecule, but it is equally possible that the effector we seek is a macromolecule such as the PII nitrogen regulatory protein (44Magasanik B. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1344-1356Google Scholar) rather than a small metabolite. Aravind and Ponting (45Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) have noted that the NifA domain is homologous to a family of so-called GAF domains found in a variety of signal-transducing proteins, but the significance of this observation to EINtr function is not known. In summary, we have found that EINtr exhibits virtually absolute specificity for NPr, whereas EI is highly specific for HPr (Figs. 5 and 7). This finding demonstrates for the first time that a single organism can possess two complete and independent PEP-dependent phosphoryl transfer chains, which presumably serve completely different physiological functions. The fact that E. coli possesses 5 paralogues of both EI and HPr (46Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) now leads to the possibility of multiple parallel and independently functioning phosphoryl transfer chains, each playing a different physiological role in the cell. Determination of the physiological functions of these PTS phosphoryl transfer chains provides exciting challenges for the future.

We examined the rates of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis and the activity, membrane affinity, and intracellular localization of the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of PC, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) during this transition. The addition of serum to quiescent IIC9 fibroblasts resulted in a wave of PC synthesis beginning at ∼10 min, peaking at ∼3 h with a >10-fold increase in rate, and declining to near basal rates by 10 h. CT activity, monitored in situ, was elevated ∼3-fold between 1 and 2 h postserum. Neither CT mass nor its phosphorylation state changed during the surge in PC synthesis and CT activity. On the other hand, the ratio of particulate/soluble CT surged and then receded in concert with the wave of PC synthesis. During quiescence, CT was confined to the nucleus, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Within 10 min after serum stimulation, a portion of the CT fluorescence appeared in the cytoplasm, where it intensified until ∼4 h postserum. Thereafter, the cytoplasmic CT signal waned, while the nuclear signal increased, and by 8 h CT was once again predominantly nuclear. The dynamics of CT's apparent translocation in and out of the nucleus paralleled the wave of PC synthesis and the solubility changes of CT. Cytoplasmic CT co-localized with BiP, a resident endoplasmic reticulum protein, in a double labeling experiment. These data suggest that the wave of PC synthesis that accompanies the G0 → G1 transition is regulated by the coordinated changes in CT activity, membrane affinity, and intracellular distribution. We describe for the first time a redistribution of CT from the nucleus to the ER that correlates with an activation of the enzyme.

Phospholipid synthesis is required, not only to double the membrane mass, but also to replace phospholipid degraded by phospholipases. There are data suggesting regulated and periodic fluctuation of phospholipid synthesis and turnover rates during the cell cycle (1Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20219-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For example, in BAC1.2F5 macrophage cells, phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 turnover rates were high during G1 and low during S (2Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC is typically the major phospholipid of animal cells, and is a precursor to the synthesis of three other phospholipids: phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylserine. There is evidence that cell cycle progression may be sensitive to membrane PC content. Choline deprivation of WI-38 fibroblasts, L6 myoblasts, or C3H/10T½ fibroblasts led to decreased PC synthesis and mass and arrest in G1 (3Cornell R. Grove G.L. Rothblat G.H. Horwitz A.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 109: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Terce F. Brun H. Vance D.E. J Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of choline (or lyso-PC, which is rapidly acylated to form PC) restored PC content and progression into S phase. Delipidated serum on its own did not effectively restore cell cycling (4Terce F. Brun H. Vance D.E. J Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that serum growth factors cannot substitute for choline in the re-establishment of the cell cycle following choline starvation and that PC rather than another choline metabolite is the regulating molecule. The timing of the addition of choline during G1 to allow normal entry into S phase suggested a requirement for PC late in G1 (4Terce F. Brun H. Vance D.E. J Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2130-2142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells harboring a temperature-sensitive CT do not synthesize PC at 40 °C, and the cells accumulate in G1. If not rescued by the addition of PC or lyso-PC, the cells undergo apoptosis rather than allowing DNA synthesis to occur (5Cui Z. Houweling M. Chen M.H. Record M. Chap H. Vance D.E. Terce F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14668-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells by the CT inhibitor, edelfosine, was prevented by overexpression of CT or by lyso-PC (6Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2169-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis in A549 cells by farnesol and geranylgeraniol, which act as competitive inhibitors of the final enzyme in the PC synthesis pathway, can be prevented by PC (7Miquel K. Pradines A. Terce F. Selmi S. Favre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26179-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest the possibility that the membrane PC content could relay to a cell cycle check point late in G1. What regulates the synthesis of PC during the cell cycle? Under most conditions, the rate-limiting and regulated step in PC synthesis is the formation of CDP-choline, catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT). CT is regulated post-translationally by reversible association with membrane lipids, which are required for its activity (8Tronchere H. Record M. Terce F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Cornell R.B. Gross R. Advances in Lipobiology. 1. JAI Press, London1996: 1-38Google Scholar, 10Cornell R.B. Biochem. Soc.

The equilibrium between soluble and membrane-bound forms is influenced by the lipid composition of the target membrane and by the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. Phosphorylation on multiple C-terminal sites stabilizes the soluble form of the enzyme (12Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17843-17849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 314: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In Bac1.2F5 cells, CT activity, assayed in cell extracts, was high in middle to late G1, declined during S, and reached a minimum in G2 (2Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pattern in activity was paralleled by changes in the enzyme's phosphorylation state. Activity was lowest when the level of phosphorylation was highest (2Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane interactions of the enzyme were not examined in this study. Using in situ methods, CT has been localized to the nucleus in some cells, the cytoplasm in others, and to both sites in still others (19Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Houweling M. Cui Z. Anfuso C.D. Bussiere M. Chen M.H. Vance D.E. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical fractionations of cells have yielded CT in the cytosol, nuclear, ER, and even Golgi fractions (21Vance J.E. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5898-5909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Morand J.N. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13785-13792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Terce F. Record M. Tronchere H. Ribbes G. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1084: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CT contains a functional nuclear localization signal near its N terminus (24Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Deletion of this signal resulted in mostly cytoplasmic rather than nuclear localization when expressed in the Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking endogenous CT, but disruption of the nuclear localization did not perturb cell growth or PC synthesis (24Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results suggest that nuclear localization of CT is not required for PC synthesis. Since other enzymes of phospholipid synthesis are ER residents, including cholinephosphotransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the step subsequent to the CT step, the ER localization makes functional sense. However, the role of the enzyme in the nucleus remains a mystery. The focus of the present work is on the changes in PC synthesis and CT activity and intracellular localization during progression from the quiescent G0 stage into the cell division cycle. Growth factors that release cells from G0 stimulate PC turnover and the production of lipid second messengers at early steps (1Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Friedkin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6006-6011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas angiotensin (31Tran K. Man R.Y. Choy P.C. Biochim. Biophys.

J. 1995; 312: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) stimulated only CT. Our studies have employed IIC9 fibroblasts. The kinetics of lipid second messenger production in response to growth factors have been carefully dissected in IIC9 cells (25Wright T.M. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. Biochem.

J. 1992; 285: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), making them ideal for analysis of the coupling between phospholipid degradation and synthesis during exit from G0. We show that exit from G0 is accompanied by a wave of PC synthesis that is coordinated with CT activation, CT translocation to membranes, and redistribution from the nucleus to the ER. The data give rise to the novel hypothesis that it is the ER-associated and not the nuclear form of CT that is enzymatically active with respect to PC synthesis. Monoclonal anti-Grp78 (BiP) was purchased from StressGen. Anti-cyclin D-1 (H-295) and purified cyclin D-1 protein (amino acids 1–295) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Generation of anti-M (rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 256–288 of rat liver CT) has been previously described (36Johnson J.E. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antibody to CT-β was a generous gift from Dr. Suzanne Jackowski (St. Judes Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Oregon Green and Texas Red-conjugated antibodies, rhodamine hexyl ester, and rhodamine phalloidin were all purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Sigma. IIC9 cells (a generous gift from Dr. D. Raben, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD) were maintained in α-MEM/F-12 (1:1), 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described (34Wright T.M. Rangan L.A. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were used at passage numbers 30–40. To generate quiescent cells, cultures (80% confluent) were washed twice with serum-free α-MEM/F12 and incubated for 48 h in starvation medium containing DMEM, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mg/ml radioimmunoassay grade BSA (Sigma), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml human transferrin (Calbiochem). Nonadherent cells were removed at ∼30 h by aspiration, and fresh serum starvation medium was replaced. For each analysis described below, following serum starvation for 48 h, FBS was added to one set of cultures to a final concentration of 10%. The control set was maintained on serum starvation medium. To measure DNA synthesis rates, [3H]thymidine (NEN Life Science Products) was added to duplicate 30-mm dishes to a concentration of 2 μCi/ml in a volume of 2 ml. After 2 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the dishes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, twice with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and once with ice-cold ethanol. The acid-insoluble material was solubilized with 0.2% SDS in 0.1 n NaOH, and the label was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Duplicate 60-mm dishes were labeled for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μCi of [methyl-3H]choline (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 3 ml of medium. Incorporation of label was quenched by removing the medium, washing three times with ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and extracting into methanol. The 3H incorporated into PC was analyzed in the CHCl3 fraction of a Bligh-Dyer extraction (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 62: 983-988Google Scholar). To measure choline transport into the cells, triplicate dishes were pulsed for 5 min with 10 μCi of [3H]choline in 3 ml of medium. Incorporation of label was quenched as above. The cells were scraped from the dish into methanol and sonicated. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Duplicate 100-mm dishes were washed three times with buffer A, and cells were released from the dishes with buffer A containing 2.5 mm EDTA and counted with a hemocytometer. The lipids were extracted into CHCl3 by the method of Bligh-Dyer (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 62: 983-988Google Scholar). The CHCl3 fraction was dried under N2 and dissolved in 30 μl of CHCl3. PC was separated from the other lipids by TLC on Silica Gel G (Analtech) using CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH (65:35:5). The PC was visualized by I2 staining and quantitated using the Bartlett assay (38Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Egg PC (Avanti) was used as a standard. IIC9 cells were labeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]choline in DMEM (28 μm choline) per 60-mm dish during the final hour of serum starvation. This labeling time was sufficient to saturate the aqueous choline metabolites in the serum-starved cells. Cultures were chased with fresh, unlabeled DMEM containing 250 μm choline with or without 10% FBS. At times after chase, the medium was aspirated, and dishes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and quenched with 1.4 ml of MeOH. The cells were scraped into the methanol, and the aqueous phase of a Bligh-Dyer extraction was obtained. Choline (3.75 μmol), phosphocholine (4.2 μmol), and CDP-choline (0.46 μmol) were added as carriers to the samples, followed by evaporation to dryness in a Speed Vac. The residue was redissolved in 130 μl of water, and the choline metabolites were separated as described (39Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digitonin permeabilization was carried out in a 3 °C room. Duplicate 100-mm dishes were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and placed on a Bellco rocker platform. 1.3 ml of permeabilization buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1m KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem)) was added to each dish. At intervals thereafter, the medium was collected, and the cell ghosts were scraped in 1.2 ml of permeabilization buffer. Both fractions were transferred to tubes containing 25 μl of 5 mm PC/oleic acid (1:1) vesicles to stabilize the CT. The ghost fraction was sonicated for 20 s on ice, and aliquots were removed immediately from both fractions for assay of CT activity (40Cornell R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 100-mm dishes were grown to subconfluence, washed twice in cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and starved for 30 min in the same medium. The cells were then incubated with cysteine- and methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5% FBS. After 4 h, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer was added to each plate. Immunoprecipitation of cell extracts was carried out as described below. 150-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS, and the cells were scraped into 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (PBS containing 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were homogenized by freeze-thaw followed by five passages through a 27-gauge needle. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 2 μl/ml of rabbit polyclonal anti-M overnight at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A beads were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, 40 μl of Laemmli buffer was added to the washed beads, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated CT was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For Western blots, proteins were transferred from 12% gels to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) at 150 mA for 1 h. The transfer buffer consisted of 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 20% methanol, 0.0375% SDS. Immunoblots were blocked in PBS containing 6% powdered milk, 0.5% Tween 20 and probed with anti-M (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h. The blots were washed three times with PBS-Tween, and CT was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection of cyclin D1 followed a similar protocol, using an anti-cyclin D1 antibody at a dilution of 1:500 . IIC9 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes and serum-starved as described above for 32 h. Dishes were then washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated for 16 h with the same medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.1 mCi/ml). This labeling time was sufficient to saturate the ATP pools and the 32P label in CT. FBS or BSA was added to the dishes to final concentrations of 10 or 5%, respectively, and the incubation was continued. At various times, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed as described above using 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 60 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 mm Na3VO4. Lysates were immunoprecipitated and resolved as described above.32P-Labeled CT was detected by autoradiography. IIC9 cells were grown on coverslips to 80% confluence and serum-starved as described above. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 20 min and permeabilized by incubation in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The fixed, permeabilized cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1:100) in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% BSA for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (1:200) for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and mounted in Prolong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). For double labeling, the primary antibodies and their corresponding secondary antibodies were incubated sequentially. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM-410 confocal microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser (Omnichrome), using a 63 × 1.4 NA lens. To set the background fluorescence, the gain and slope settings for the photomultipliers were adjusted using cells treated with normal rabbit serum followed by secondary antibody. In the colocalization analysis, a yellow pixel represents equal intensities from the red and green channel. IIC9 fibroblasts were arrested in G0 by serum starvation for 48 h. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was negligible in the serum-starved cells (Fig.1 A). The addition of 10% serum resulted in a wave of [3H]thymidine incorporation beginning ∼14 h poststimulation, peaking at ∼22 h, and declining thereafter. Since at the peak (22 h) the thymidine incorporation rate was ∼3 times that of nonsynchronized cells at the onset of serum starvation, this suggests that 3 times as many cells were in S phase. S phase typically occupies 30–40% of the cell cycle time. Thus, nearly all of the cells participated in the DNA synthesis wave, suggesting that they were synchronized initially in G0. To further assess the cell cycle status of the serum-starved cells, the level of cyclin D1 was examined by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates. The expression of cyclin D1 is low in G0 cells, increases during the period of entry into G1, and plummets during S phase (41Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Serum-starved IIC9 cells had low but detectable levels of cyclin D1. This low expression level persisted at 2, 4, 6, and 8 h postserum, rose markedly between 8 and 10 h, and remained high until at least 24 h postserum (Fig. 1 B). The incorporation of [3H]choline into PC during 10-min pulses was stimulated 3-fold as early as 10 min after the addition of serum compared with serum-starved cells (Fig.1 C). A dramatic elevation in PC synthesis rates continued for 3–4 h, at which time there was an 11 ± 3-fold (n = 6) increase over control rates. The rate of PC synthesis declined to near basal levels between 4 and 10 h postserum. The return to basal PC synthesis rates probably coincides with the G0/G1 boundary (42Zetterberg A. Thomas N.S.B. Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Control in Cancer. Bios Scientific, Oxford1996: 17-35Google Scholar). To determine whether the burst in the PC synthesis rate resulted in accumulation of PC, we quantified the mass of PC in cells following stimulation by serum. In two independent determinations, the PC content of quiescent cells was 23 ± 2 nmol of PC/106 cells. The PC content at 4 and 7 h postserum was 26 ± 3 and 24 ± 3 nmol of PC/106 cells, respectively. Thus, the synthesis wave was accompanied by a nearly equivalent wave of PC degradation, as has been observed previously, for example in macrophages re-entering the cell cycle in response to CSF1 (2Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of the rate of [3H]choline incorporation into PC was not due to an acceleration of choline transport. Uptake of [3H]choline into the cells, monitored by 5-min pulses, was not significantly different for serum-starved and serum-stimulated cultures. The uptake rates were constant over a 4-h time course in both serum-starved and serum-stimulated cultures (not shown). The increase in choline incorporation into PC could be due to acceleration of the reactions catalyzed by choline kinase, cytidylyltransferase, cholinephosphotransferase (CPT), or a combination of these. The specific radioactivity of the pools of choline, phosphocholine, and CDP-choline reached equilibrium within 1 h of labeling with 2–3 μCi/ml [3H]choline (28 μm), and the relative pool sizes in serum-starved cells were as follows: choline, 3 ± 2%; phosphocholine, 83 ± 4%; and CDP-choline, 14 ± 2% (n = 3). These ratios suggest a rate-limiting step at the conversion of phosphocholine into CDP-choline, catalyzed by CT. The relative pool sizes were altered in cells treated with serum for 2–3 h: choline, 1%; phosphocholine, 73 ± 1%; and CDP-choline, 26.4 ± 0.6%. The phosphocholine:CDP-choline ratio decreased >2-fold, indicative of an acceleration of the CT-catalyzed step. The flux of [3H]choline through the CDP-choline pathway was monitored by a pulse-chase regime (43Vance D.E. Trip E.M. Paddon H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1064-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The label associated with intracellular choline completely turned over within 20 min after the onset of the cold chase in both control and serum-stimulated cultures. The turnover of phosphocholine and CDP-choline is shown in Fig. 2. The turnover times determined from these plots reflect the rates of the CT and CPT reactions in situ. The t12values for both phosphocholine and CDP-choline were reduced ∼3-fold in the serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 2, A and B). These data suggest that the stimulation of PC synthesis during exit from G0 is accompanied by acceleration of the CT and CPT reactions. We further examined the regulation of CT by serum. The serum-stimulated increase in the CT reaction was not due to an increase in the levels of the enzyme in the cell. Endogenous CT was immunoprecipita"

Using a reconstituted [3H]norepinephrine release assay in permeabilized PC12 cells, we found that essential proteins that support the triggering stage of Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis are enriched in an EGTA extract of brain membranes. Fractionation of this extract allowed purification of two factors that stimulate secretion in the absence of any other cytosolic proteins. These are calmodulin and protein kinase Cα (PKCα). Their effects on secretion were confirmed using commercial and recombinant proteins. Calmodulin enhances secretion in the absence of ATP, whereas PKC requires ATP to increase secretion, suggesting that phosphorylation is involved in PKC- but not calmodulin-mediated stimulation. Both proteins modulate release events that occur in the triggering stage of exocytosis. The half-maximal increase was elicited by 3 nm PKC and 75 nmcalmodulin. These results suggest that calmodulin and PKC increase Ca2+-activated exocytosis by directly modulating the membrane- or cytoskeleton-attached exocytic machinery downstream of Ca2+ elevation.

A series of protein-protein interaction cascades have been proposed to lead to vesicle docking and fusion (1Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 2Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 3Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1049-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The SNARE protein family, including syntaxin, SNAP-25, and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP, also called synaptobrevin), plays an essential role in promoting membrane fusion, and is thought to comprise the basic fusion machinery (4Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 5Chen Y.A. Scales S.J. Patel S.M. Doung Y.-C. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis, many additional proteins are important in the Ca2+ regulation of the basic membrane trafficking apparatus. Calcium not only triggers rapid fusion of release-competent vesicles, but is also involved in earlier processes which replenish the pool of readily releasable vesicles (6Neher E. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears to be critical in initiating several forms of synaptic plasticity including post-tetanic potentiation (7Kamiya H. Zucker R.S. Nature. 1994; 371: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulates these processes is not well understood.PC12 cells have often been utilized to study Ca2+-activated exocytosis, as they offer a homogeneous cell population that possesses the same basic exocytic machinery as neurons (8Corradi N. Borgonovo B. Clementi E. Bassetti M. Racchetti G. Consalez G.G. Huttner W.B. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27116-27124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, we used an established cracked cell assay, in which [3H]norepinephrine (NE)1 labeled PC12 cells are permeabilized by mechanical “cracking” and then reconstituted for secretion of NE in the presence of test proteins (9Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Transmitter-filled vesicles and intracellular cytoskeletal structures remain intact in these cells, while cytosolic proteins leak out (10Martin T.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 168: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These cracked cells readily release NE upon addition of ATP, brain cytosol, and 1 μm free Ca2+ at an elevated temperature. We term this a “composite assay,” as all essential components are added into one reaction mixture. Alternatively, cracked cells can be first primed with cytosol and ATP, washed, then reconstituted for NE release with cytosol and Ca2+ (11Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This sequential priming-triggering protocol is useful for determining whether a protein acts early or late in the exocytic pathway and whether its effect is dependent on Ca2+ or ATP.This semi-intact cell system serves as a bridge between an in vitro system comprised of purified components and electrophysiological systems that monitor release in vivo. It provides information on protein functions in a cell with an intact membrane infrastructure while being easily manipulatable. Ca2+ regulation by membrane depolarization is no longer a concern, as intracellular Ca2+ concentration can be controlled by a buffered solution. Indirect readout of neurotransmitter release using a postsynaptic cell is replaced by direct readout of [3H]NE released into the buffer. Complications associated with interpreting overlapping exo- and endocytotic signals are also eliminated as only one round of exocytosis is measured. Finally, concentration estimates are likely to be accurate, since added compounds do not need to diffuse long distances along axons and dendrites to their sites of action.Using this assay, several proteins required for NE release have been purified from rat brain cytosol, including phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (12Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (13Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS) (9Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The validity of the cracked cell system is confirmed by the finding that phosphatidylinositol transfer protein and CAPS are mammalian homologues of yeast SEC14p (12Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and nematode UNC31p, respectively (14Ann K. Kowalchyk J.A. Loyet K.M. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19637-19640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), both proteins involved in membrane trafficking (15Bankaitis V.A. Aitken J.R. Cleves A.E. Dowhan W.

Some early studies showed that calmodulin inhibitors (17Burgoyne R.D. Geisow M.J. Barron J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1982; 216: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Ganguly A.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1501-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) inhibited Ca2+-activated exocytosis. However, in other studies, calmodulin-binding peptides and an anti-calmodulin antibody led to the conclusion that calmodulin is only involved in endocytosis, not exocytosis (23Artalejo C.R. Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C. Neuron. 1996; 16: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that Ca2+/calmodulin signals the completion of docking and triggers a late step of homotypic vacuole fusion in yeast, thus suggesting an essential role for Ca2+/calmodulin in constitutive intracellular membrane fusion (24Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). If calmodulin indeed plays an important role in exocytosis, a likely target of calmodulin is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a multifunctional kinase that is found on synaptic vesicles (25Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and has been shown to potentiate neurotransmitter release (26Nichols R.A. Sihra T.S. Czernik A.J.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 591-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Another Ca2+ signaling molecule, PKC, has also been implicated in regulated exocytosis. In various cell systems, it has been shown that the phorbol esters stimulate secretion (28Hilfiker S. Augustine G.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 1Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Byrne J.H.

It is usually assumed that phorbol esters effect on exocytosis is through activation of PKC, but Munc13-1 was recently shown to be a presynaptic phorbol ester receptor that enhances neurotransmitter release (30Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Südhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 31Maruyama I.N. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5729-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which complicates the interpretation of some earlier reports. The mode of action of PKC remains controversial. There is evidence that PKC increases the intracellular Ca2+ levels by modulating plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (32Swartz K.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), that it increases the size of the release-competent vesicle pool (34Gillis K.D. Mossner R. Neher E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1209-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 35Stevens C.F. Sullivan J.M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 885-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), or that it increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of the membrane trafficking apparatus (36Yawo H. J. Physiol. 1999; 515.1: 169-180Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, no consensus on these issues has been reached.PKC substrates that have been implicated in exocytosis include SNAP-25 (37Shimazaki Y. Nishiki T. Omori A. Sekiguchi M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14548-14553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), synaptotagmin (28Hilfiker S. Augustine G.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 1Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), CAPS (38Nishizaki T. Walent J.H. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23972-23981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and n-sec1 (39Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kotani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It is believed that upon phosphorylation, these PKC substrates might interact differently with their binding partners, which, in turn, leads to the enhancement of exocytosis. In addition, evidence is accumulating that PKC and calmodulin interfere with each others actions, as PKC phosphorylation sites are embedded in the calmodulin-binding domains of substrates such as neuromodulin and neurogranin (40Chakravarthy B. Morley P. Whitfield J. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 12-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that PKC could modulate exocytosis via a calmodulin-dependent pathway by synchronously releasing calmodulin from storage proteins.In this study, we fractionated an EGTA extract of brain membranes in order to identify active components that could reconstitute release in the cracked cell assay system. We identified calmodulin and PKC as two active factors. Thus, we demonstrate that calmodulin and PKC play a role in the Ca2+ regulation of exocytosis, and provide further insight into the mechanisms of their action.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsBisindolylmaleimide I, PKC inhibitor peptide(19–36), human recombinant PKCα, rat brain PKC, and anti-PKC monoclonal antibody (Ab2) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Calmodulin from bovine brain was obtained from Sigma, annexin VI (annexin 67 kDa) from bovine liver was obtained from Sigma and Biodesign (Kennebunk, ME), and anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Calmodulin-binding peptide (CaMKII aa 291–312) was synthesized at Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and high pressure liquid chromatography purified.Rat Brain Cytosol PreparationFrozen rat brains (Harlan, IN) were homogenized in 3 ml/g of ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm sucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a VirTishear homogenizer (Virtis, NY). The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was rapidly frozen in aliquots and stored at −80 °C.Membrane EGTA Extract PreparationFrozen rat or bovine brains (RJO Biologicals, Kansas City, MO) were homogenized as above, except that the buffer lacks 2 mm EGTA and 2 mm EDTA (1 liter/bovine brain). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 3,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The 100,000 × g supernatant, if kept, was rapidly frozen and stored as cytosol. It is referred to in the text as “cytosol prepared in the absence of EGTA.” The pellet of the 100,000 × g spin was washed once by rehomogenization into homogenization buffer without protease inhibitors, using a Teflon/glass homogenizer, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The washed membrane pellet was then rehomogenized into homogenization buffer without protease inhibitors at about 0.5 ml/g of starting material. EGTA was added to reach 2 mm final concentration, and the extraction was carried out at 4 °C for a few hours or overnight. The membrane homogenate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant collected as “membrane EGTA extract.”The protein concentration of cytosol and membrane EGTA extract was estimated using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In a typical preparation, the protein concentration of rat brain cytosol ranges from 7 to 9 mg/ml, and the membrane EGTA extract 0.3 to 0.6 mg/ml. About 3% of total membrane proteins can be extracted into the EGTA extract.Cracked Cell AssayPC12 cells were maintained and [3H]NE labeled as described previously (11Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Labeled cells were harvested by pipetting with ice-cold potassium glutamate buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 105 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mmpotassium acetate, 2 mm EGTA) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. All subsequent manipulations were carried out at 0–4 °C unless otherwise stated. Labeled cells (1–1.5 ml/dish) were mechanically permeabilized by a single passage through a chilled stainless steel ball homogenizer. The cracked cells were adjusted to 11 mm EGTA and incubated on ice for 0.5–3 h, followed by three washes in which the cells were centrifuged at 800 ×g for 5 min and resuspended in potassium glutamate buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin.Composite AssayEach release reaction contains 0.5–1 million cracked cells, 1.5 μm free Ca2+, 2 mm MgATP, and the protein solution to be tested in a total volume of 200 μl of potassium glutamate buffer. Release reactions were initiated by incubation at 30 °C and terminated by returning to ice after a 15-min incubation. The supernatant of each reaction was isolated by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the released [3H]NE was quantified by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6000IC). Cell pellets were dissolved in 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% azide and similarly counted. NE release was calculated as a percentage of total [3H] in the supernatant.Priming AssayA priming reaction contains about 1–2 million cracked cells, 2 mm MgATP, and the protein solution to be tested in a total volume of 200 μl of potassium glutamate buffer. Note that Ca2+ is omitted. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. The primed cells were then spun down, washed once with fresh potassium glutamate buffer, and distributed into two triggering reactions, each containing 10 μl of rat brain cytosol and 1.5 μm free Ca2+ in a total volume of 200 μl of potassium glutamate buffer. The triggering reaction was performed at 30 °C for 3 min, and the NE release was measured as in a composite assay.Triggering AssayCracked cells were primed in potassium glutamate buffer containing 0.7–1 mg/ml rat brain cytosol and 2 mm MgATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The primed cells were centrifuged, washed once with potassium glutamate buffer, and distributed into triggering reactions containing 1.5 μmfree Ca2+ and the protein solution to be tested. To inhibit any ATP dependent activity in the triggering reaction, where indicated, an ATP depletion system of 5 units/ml hexokinase (Sigma), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (5 mm; Sigma) was added into the triggering reaction. NE release was measured as above.Free Ca2+ Concentration DeterminationThe range of [Ca2+]free in the release reaction (Fig. 2 B) was achieved by adding Ca2+into potassium glutamate buffer to reach final [Ca2+]total values of 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 1.9, and 2.0 mm. The pH of the reaction was 7.24 when no Ca2+ was added and 7.04 when 2.0 mmCa2+ was added, in the absence of protein extracts or cracked cells. Free Ca2+ concentrations were determined using video microscopic measurements of fura-2 fluorescence. Imaging was performed as described previously (41Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 365-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]free was calculated from the equation [Ca2+]free = Kd* × (R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R) (42Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The values of Rmin, Rmax, and Kd* were determined in the following solutions: 1) Rmin: potassium glutamate buffer containing 8 × 106 cracked cells/ml, 2 mm MgATP, and 10 mm additional EGTA; 2)Rmax: potassium glutamate buffer containing 8 × 106 cracked cells/ml, 2 mm MgATP, and 10 mm total Ca2+; 3) Kd*: potassium glutamate buffer containing 8 × 106 cracked cells/ml, 2 mm MgATP, 28 mm additional EGTA, and 18 mm total Ca2+, pH 7.2 ([Ca2+]free = 169 nm, determined in the absence of cells and MgATP based on fura-2 calibration in cell-free solutions). These solutions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, mixed with fura-2 pentapotassium salt (100 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and imaged. This procedure allowed us to take into account changes in fura-2 properties caused by the presence of permeabilized cells. Duplicate measurements of the above range of [Ca2+]total gave the following average [Ca2+]free values: 106, 146, 277, 462, 971, 1468, 1847, and 2484 nm.Purification of Active ProteinsAll procedures were carried out at 4 °C or on ice unless noted otherwise. Membrane EGTA extract of one or two bovine brain(s) (usually 150 ml/brain) was filtered through cheesecloth and loaded overnight onto a 10- or 20-ml DEAE column packed with DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with wash buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.25 mmsucrose, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and step eluted with 10 column volumes of elution buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). 100 μl of every other fraction was dialyzed overnight into potassium glutamate buffer, and 20 μl tested in a composite release assay for activity. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed into zero salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA) and batch bound to 10 ml of Affi-Gel Blue beads (Bio-Rad) or DyeMatrex-Green A beads (Amicon) for a few hours. Blue beads were used in earlier experiments, and Green beads were used later to specifically deplete CAPS, which was known to bind to Green beads (9Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The unbound material was collected, concentrated to about 2 ml using a Centriprep-10 (Amicon), and loaded onto a 120-ml HiPrep Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were run on the S-200 column in potassium glutamate buffer at a flow rate of 7 ml/h. 10–50 μl of every other fraction was tested for activity in the cracked cell composite assay, and two peaks of activity were observed (Fig. 3).Figure 3Gel filtration chromatography reveals two stimulatory factors in the membrane EGTA extract. In order to purify the active component(s) in the membrane EGTA extract, the crude extract from one bovine brain was fractionated chromatographically (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fractions from a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column were tested for their activity in stimulating NE release in the composite assay. The two activity peaks have predicted molecular masses of 85 and 25 kDa, respectively. The arrows indicate the retention volume of standard proteins run on the same column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The first peak of activity had a predicted molecular mass of 85 kDa. The corresponding material was adjusted to 10 mm potassium phosphate concentration (pH 7.2) and loaded onto a 1-ml hydroxyapatite column packed with hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HT (Bio-Rad). The bound material was eluted with a linear potassium phosphate gradient from 10 to 500 mm (pH 7.2) in a 30-ml total volume at a flow rate of about 0.1 ml/min, and 0.4–0.5-ml fractions were collected. 200 μl of each fraction was dialyzed into potassium glutamate buffer and 20 μl was tested for activity. Meanwhile, the fractions (10 μl each) were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Sigma silver stain kit). The active material was concentrated and resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Two Coomassie-stained protein bands that matched the activity profile (Fig. 6) were excised from the gel, minced into small pieces, dried, and sequenced by the Stanford PAN facility. The two polypeptide sequences obtained from the upper band were: LLNQEEGEYYNVPIXEGD and IRSTLNPRWDESFT. The only bovine protein that contains both polypeptides is PKCα. The four polypeptide sequences obtained from the lower band were: YELTGKFERLIVGLMRPPAY, LIEILASRTNEQIHQLVAA, MLVVLLQGTREEDDVVSEDL, and EMSGDVRDVFVAIVQSVK. Based on these sequences, the protein band was unambiguously identified to be bovine annexin VI.Figure 6Purification of the high molecular weight active factor. A, crude membrane EGTA extract of two bovine brains was subjected to sequential fractionation on DEAE, Matrex Green, Sephacryl S-200, and HA columns. The active material after each column was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The first three lanes were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The fourth lane and the gel showing HA fractions (10 μl/fraction) were visualized by silver staining. The two arrowheads indicate the two bands that were identified in panel C as PKCα and annexin VI.B, the activity of HA fractions 12–25 in a composite release assay (20 μl/fraction). C, the active HA fractions (fraction 16–21), were pooled, concentrated, and resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The two candidate Coomassie bands corresponding to the activity (arrowheads) were excised and sequenced. They were identified as PKCα and annexin VI (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The second S-200 peak has a predicted molecular mass of 25 kDa. The corresponding material was dialyzed into zero salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA) and injected onto a Mono-Q HR 5/5 FPLC column (Pharmacia). The FPLC run was performed at 18 °C at 1 ml/min and 1-ml fractions were collected with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl over 71 ml. The fractions containing proteins (determined by A280) were dialyzed into potassium glutamate buffer and tested in the cracked cell assay.Western BlotAnti-calmodulin antibody and anti-PKC antibody were used at 1:2000 and 1:100 dilution at room temperature for 1 h. ECL (Amersham) was used for detection.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we first identified an EGTA extract of brain membranes as a protein source capable of reconstituting Ca2+-activated exocytosis in cracked PC12 cells. EGTA only extracts a small pool of Ca2+-dependent membrane-associating proteins, and thus it served as an efficient initial purification step. Further protein chromatography led to the identification of two active factors in the starting extract, calmodulin and PKC, which together accounted for about half of the starting activity. Upon confirmation with commercially obtained proteins, this result unambiguously demonstrated that calmodulin and PKC mediate aspects of Ca2+-dependent processes in exocytosis.The finding that brain membrane EGTA extract alone is able to replace cytosol in supporting Ca2+-triggered NE secretion in PC12 cells is somewhat surprising. We suggest that the likely explanation is 2-fold. First, some cytosolic proteins essential for exocytosis have a membrane-bound pool within permeabilized cells, whose activity might be sufficient for a normal level of exocytosis. Second, although the 100,000 × g membrane pellet was washed to remove as many cytosolic proteins as possible, some cytosolic proteins that associate with membranes in a Ca2+-independent manner are probably present in the membrane EGTA extract. However, these proteins likely constitute only a small percentage of the proteins in the extract, as the characteristics of the activity triggered by the membrane extract are quite different to that of cytosol (Fig. 2).Using an unbiased biochemical purification method, we demonstrated that calmodulin and PKC directly modulate the exocytotic machinery downstream of Ca2+ entry, and furthermore, that they signal through membrane-attached molecules to increase exocytosis. These targets include integral and peripheral membrane proteins, and cytosolic proteins that have a significant membrane-bound pool. The modest stimulation by calmodulin and PKC on secretion might suggest a regulatory role. However, it is also possible that some intermediates in their signaling pathways are in limiting amounts in the cell ghosts, so that their full effects were not observed. Half-maximal stimulation was obtained at about 3 nm for PKC and at about 75 nm for calmodulin. This is consistent with an enzymatic role for PKC, and predicts a high-affinity interaction between calmodulin and its substrate protein.Ca2+ regulates exocytosis at many different levels. Prior studies indicated that Ca2+ signaling occurs in the priming steps as well as in triggering steps (49Bittner M.A. Holz R.W. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2026121960,"To determine whether nitric oxide (NO) modulates the β-adrenergic signaling pathway, we treated cells expressing β2-adrenergic receptors (β2AR) with the NO donors, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) and 1,2,3,4-oxatriazolium,5-amino-3-(3-chloro-2-methylphenyl)chloride and determined the intracellular production of cAMP after exposure to β-adrenergic receptor agonists, cholera toxin and forskolin. NO significantly decreased the potency of the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, to stimulate cAMP production without affecting the stimulatory action of forskolin and cholera toxin, which directly activate adenylyl cyclase and Gs, respectively. Treatment with the NO donor increased the guanyl nucleotide-sensitive high affinity constant for the agonist, isoproterenol, thus suggesting that it reduced functional coupling between the receptor and Gs. Stimulation of endogenous NO production by lipopolysaccharide in RAW 264.7 macrophages also caused a significant increase in the EC50 for isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production. SIN-1 treatment also led to a reduction in both basal and isoproterenol-stimulated incorporation of [3H]palmitate into the β2AR. Signaling through the nonpalmitoylated, Gly341β2AR mutant was unchanged by SIN-1 treatment. Given the link between β2AR palmitoylation and its responsiveness to agonist, these results suggest that the primary action of NO was depalmitoylation of the β2AR resulting in decreased signaling through the β2AR.

Its synthesis by the enzyme NO synthase (NOS) from arginine and oxygen is finely regulated and can be achieved through both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent pathways (3Stamler J.S.

At the cellular level, the best characterized effect of NO is the activation of guanylate cyclase by the formation of a heme-NO complex that enhances the catalytic activity of the enzyme and increases cGMP production (10Murad F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 239-248PubMed Google Scholar). Although several of the effects of NO have been attributed to cGMP formation, NO also leads to nitrosylation of thiol groups on cysteine residues (3Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E.

Nature. 1993; 366: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The β2AR and its cognate G protein (Gs) both undergo palmitoylation on cysteine residues. This post-translational modification is dynamically regulated on the receptor and Gs upon β-adrenergic stimulation (14Mouillac B. Caron M. Bonin H. Dennis M. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

Moreover, it has been proposed that regulation of the palmitoylation state of these proteins may have important effects on their biological activity (16Moffett S. Mouillac B. Bonin H. Bouvier M.

The aims of the present study were to determine if NO can directly modulate the signaling efficiency of the β-adrenergic-Gs-adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway and to assess if regulation of the palmitoylation state of the receptor or Gs could play a role in such a regulatory process. We found that NO reduces the potency of a β-adrenergic agonist to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and promotes depalmitoylation of the β2AR. Cell culture supplies were from Biofluids, Rockville, MD; COS7 cells were from American Type Culture Collection; [9,10-3H]palmitate (60 Ci/mmol) and [8-3H]adenine (18 Ci/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; pluronic acid was from Life Technologies, Inc.; SIN-1 was from Biomol and Alexis Corp.; GEA and N G-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) were from Alexis Corp.; 8-bromo-cGMP, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were from Research Biochemical International; forskolin, isoproterenol, terbutaline, procaterol, hemoglobin-Ao, IBMX, alumina, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were from Sigma; α2-macroglobulin was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; cholera toxin was from List Biologicals; and AG 50W-X4 (Dowex) resin was from Bio-Rad. The wild type β2AR was inserted in the modified pcDNA3, with an RSV promoter, at Bam HI and Eco RI sites. The generation of pcDNA3-RSV-Gly341β2AR, in which cysteine 341 was replaced by a glycine, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using wild type pcDNA3-RSV-β2AR (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Positive clones were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The wild type β2AR and the mutant were stably transfected in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells line using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Mellon P.L. Parker V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Neomycin-resistant cells were selected by culturing in medium containing G418 (450 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Resistant clones were then screened for β2AR expression by radioligand assays using 125I-labeled iodocyanopindolol (CYP) as the ligand. COS, NIH 3T3, and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Macrophage RAW 264.7 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS without antibiotic. Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in Grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% FBS (10%) and pluronic acid to prevent cell tearing due to agitation. They were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding the wild type human β2AR at a density of 1 × 106 to 2 × 106 cells per ml for 48 h with multiplicities of infection varying from 2 to 6 (21Loisel T.P. Adam L. Hebert T. Bouvier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15923-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling with [3H]palmitate, COS7 and HEK293 cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 2 and 1 h, respectively. The cells were then labeled with [3H]palmitate (200 to 500 μCi/ml) for 1 h. They were rinsed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, to stop the labeling and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were then stored at −70 °C. HEK293 cells were thawed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine), disrupted by sonication, and the lysates centrifuged 5 min at 500 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pelleted membranes were solubilized for 90 min at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 0.3% n-dodecyl maltoside and the above protease inhibitor mixture. COS cells were thawed in buffer composed of 5 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm mannitol, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmEDTA, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 milliunits/ml α2-macroglobulin. They were homogenized by passage through a 25-gauge needle 15 times. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer. Protein concentrations of the cellular fractions were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye kit with IgG as the standard or the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217486) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) and 1,2,3,4-oxatriazolium,5-amino-3-(3-chloro-2-methylphenyl)-chloride (GEA) were used to generate NO. Cells were incubated with 1 mm SIN-1 or 1 mm GEA for the indicated time. When in aqueous solution, SIN-1 degrades spontaneously to SIN-1A and subsequently to SIN-1C, with NO being generated in the latter step (23Böhme E. Grossmann G. Herz J. Mülsch A. Spies C. Schultz G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 17: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). At 37 °C, the rate constants governing these steps are 0.11 and 0.04 min−1, respectively (23Böhme E. Grossmann G. Herz J. Mülsch A. Spies C. Schultz G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 17: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar), and the half-life of NO is about 10 s (24Hess D.T. Lin L.-H. Freeman J.A. Norden J.J. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NO-depleted SIN-1 was thus generated by keeping a 100 mm solution of SIN-1 at room temperature or at 37 °C for at least 24 h. The polyclonal, affinity purified RM antibody, which recognizes the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of Gαs, was used (25Jones T.L.Z. Simonds W.F. Merendino Jr., J.J. Brann M.R. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed on equal amounts of the particulate fraction (0.5–1 mg of total protein) in a solubilization buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5 (25 °C), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mm EDTA. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by incubation with protein A-Sepharose, washed, and prepared for SDS-PAGE (23Böhme E. Grossmann G. Herz J. Mülsch A. Spies C. Schultz G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1984; 17: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar). Fixed gels were treated for 45 min with En3Hance (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to XAR-2 film (Kodak) at −70 °C. Alprenolol-Sepharose affinity purification matrix was synthesized according to the method of Benovic et al. (26Benovic J.L. Shorr R.G.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4510-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This matrix was used to purify the β2AR as previously reported (27Shorr R.G.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5820-5826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using n-dodecyl-maltoside as the detergent instead of digitonin. The affinity purified preparations were concentrated using Centriprep and Centricon cartridges (Amicon), and the amount of β2AR in each sample was determined by soluble radioligand binding assays using [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) as described (28Bouvier M. Hnatowich M. Collins S. Kobilka B.K. De Blasi A. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 133-139PubMed Google Scholar). Samples with equal numbers of receptor were then transferred into sample buffer, and SDS-PAGE was conducted under nonreducing conditions. Fixed gels were incubated in 1 msalicylic acid for 45 min, dried, and exposed to Dupont ReflectionTM film at −80 °C. Radioligand binding assays were conducted essentially as described in Bouvier et al. (26Benovic J.L. Shorr R.G.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4510-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) using 10 μl of membrane suspension (5 μg) in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA. Competition binding assays with isoproterenol were conducted using 50 pm[125I]CYP as the radioligand. The concentration of the β-adrenergic agonist was varied from 0 to 100 μm in the presence or absence of 100 μm Gpp(NH)p. For determination of receptor number, the assay was performed in triplicate with a nearly saturating concentration of [125I]CYP (200 pm) in the presence or absence of 10 μmalprenolol to define specific binding. Approximately 2–6 × 105 cells/well of COS, NIH 3T3, or HEK293 cells were incubated in 24-well plates with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine in complete DMEM for 24 h. The cells were washed once with PBS and incubated for 15 min in Hepes/DMEM with 0.5 mm IBMX. They were then treated for 45 min with β-adrenergic agonists, forskolin, cholera toxin, 8-bromo-cGMP or vehicle in Hepes/DMEM with 0.5 mm IBMX. The reaction was stopped following aspiration of the medium by adding 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid or 1 ml of 0.2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mmTris, pH 7.4. One mm of unlabeled cAMP was added to decrease enzymatic degradation of [3H]cAMP. The cAMP was then separated by sequential chromatography over Dowex and Alumina columns as described previously (29Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The cAMP accumulation was expressed as ([3H]cAMP cpm/([3H]cAMP cpm + [3H]ATP cpm)) × 103). To rule out the possibility that treatment with NO donors could promote oxidation of the β-adrenergic agonist, the concentration of isoproterenol before and after SIN-1 treatment was assessed by amperometry (30Hjemdahl P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Willemsen J.J. Ross H.A. Jacobs M.C. Lenders J.W.M. Thien T. Swinkels L.M.J.W. Benraad T.J. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1455-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Isoproterenol (10 μm) was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in PBS with 1 mm SIN-1. The mixture was then separated by cation-exchange chromatography using a Spherisorb-OD52, 10 cm × 4.6 mm column, and a Waters HPLC system. Isoproterenol was detected using a Coulochem II (ESA); amperometric system set at +0.6 V. Calibration was carried out using known concentrations of isoproterenol. Since the amperometric method is based on the recording of current produced by voltage-dependent oxidation, only the non-oxidized isoproterenol can be detected (30Hjemdahl P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 32Cook J.A. Wink D.A. Blount V. Krishna M.C. Hanbauer I. Neurochem. Int. 1996; 28: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) thus allowing the assessment of NO-promoted oxidation. Macrophages (RAW 264.7) were treated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h to induce nitric oxide synthase and thus stimulate endogenous NO production. Nitrite (NO2) was then used as an indicator of NO synthesis and measured in the culture media as described previously (33Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10879) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μl of Griess solution (1 part of 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride and 1 part of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid) was added to 400 μl of cell medium. The formation of azochromophore was detected by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 550 nm (A550). Standard curves were generated using known concentrations of sodium nitrite in culture medium. Palmitoylation levels were estimated by densitometric analysis of the fluorograms using an LKB 2202 UltroScan laser densitometer or an AGFA/ARCUS II scanner and NIH Image 1.61. The Allfit (34De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) software was used to calculate the EC50 from the dose-response curves. Radioligand binding data were analyzed using the computer program GraphPAD Prism. To determine if NO can modulate β-adrenergic signaling, the effect of the NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) on isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was assessed in COS cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment with 1 mm SIN-1 for 45 min decreased the potency of the β-adrenergic agonist from an EC50 of 1.7 ± 0.4 μm in control condition to 19.8 ± 6.0 μm in the presence of the NO donor. The isoproterenol potency returned to control values within 30 min following removal of the NO donor indicating that the effect was readily reversible (data not shown). To rule out the possible contribution of SIN-1C, the stable degradation product of SIN-1, a NO-depleted SIN-1C solution obtained by incubation of SIN-1 at 37 °C for 48 h, was used. Such solution was without effect on the β-adrenergic-stimulated cAMP production (data not shown) thus indicating that the released NO, rather than accumulated SIN-1 C, caused the rightward shift in the isoproterenol dose-response curve. This is also supported by the observation that treatment with another NO donor, 1,2,3,4-oxatriazolium,5-amino-3-(3-chloro-2-methylphenyl)chloride (GEA, 1 mm), for 45 min also inhibited receptor-stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the SIN-1-induced rightward shift in the cAMP accumulation dose-response curve was such that the response evoked by 10 μm isoproterenol in control cells was almost abolished by the SIN-1 treatment. Therefore, further studies aimed at characterizing the effect of the NO donor in other cell types were carried out using this concentration of isoproterenol. SIN-1 blocked the stimulating effect of 10 μm isoproterenol on cAMP production in HEK293, COS, and NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.2) indicating that the effect was not cell type-specific. This effect was not unique to isoproterenol since SIN-1 treatment substantially decreased the responses to all β-adrenergic agonists tested (epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and procaterol) (Fig. 2 C). In contrast to the dramatic effect on the receptor-stimulated cAMP production, SIN-1 was without effect on either forskolin or cholera toxin-stimulated activity (Fig. 2, B and C) indicating that neither the adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity nor Gs-stimulated activity are affected. SIN-1 was also without effect on cAMP accumulation when concentrations of forskolin that gave submaximal cAMP responses were used (data not shown). NO can increase the hydrolysis of cAMP by activating phosphodiesterases through a cGMP pathway (9Han X. Shimoni Y. Giles W.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the blunting effect of NO on the response to isoproterenol is unlikely to be due to increased degradation of cAMP since a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, was present in all these experiments. In addition, treatment with 1 mm 8-bromo-cGMP did not alter cAMP production in response to isoproterenol (0.63 for isoproterenol alone and 0.76 with 1 mm 8-bromo-cGMP, the values are the mean of two independent experiments, calculated as [3H]cAMP cpm/([3H]ATP cpm + [3H]cAMP cpm) × 103). Finally, if the effect of NO resulted from an activator of the phosphodiesterase, reduction in the cholera- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase would have also been observed. Since it has been previously suggested that NO can promote oxidation of catecholamines (11Wink D.A. Hanbauer I. Grisham M.B. Laval F. Nims R.W. Laval J. Cook J. Pacelli R. Liebmann J. Krishna M. Ford P.C. Mitchell J.B. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 159-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 35d'Ischia M. Costantini C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we tested whether NO could cause the oxidative degradation of isoproterenol thus reducing its effective concentration. Starting from a concentration of 10 μm isoproterenol, incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with or without 1 mm SIN-1 led to a loss of 12 ± 3 and 8 ± 2%, respectively, of the agonist as assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrochemical detection. Since amperometry only detects the non-oxidized form of the agonist, these data indicate that incubation with SIN-1 did not promote any significant oxidation of the β-adrenergic agonist and cannot account for the biological effect observed. In addition, the inhibitory effect on SIN-1 on the isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was also observed in the presence of the anti-oxidant, ascorbate (10 μm). The ability of β2AR to mediate agonist stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity has been correlated with the propensity of the receptor to adopt a guanyl nucleotide-sensitive high affinity state that is thought to reflect the formation of a ligand-receptor-Gs ternary complex (36Kent R.S. De Lean A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 14-23PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test if NO could mediate its action by affecting the coupling of the β2AR to Gs, the agonist binding properties of the receptor were tested in membranes derived from HEK293-β2AR cells treated or not with 1 mmSIN-1. As shown in Fig. 3, competition of [125I]CYP binding with isoproterenol was biphasic and the curve best resolved by a two-affinity state model. The guanyl nucleotide sensitivity of the high affinity state is illustrated by the observation that upon addition of Gpp(NH)p the curve is best fitted to a single low affinity state model. Both high and low affinity states for agonist were observed in membranes derived from cells treated with SIN-1, but the high affinity constant (Ki(H)) was found to be significantly increased with SIN-1 treatment compared with control cells (TableI). In contrast, the SIN-1 treatment did not affect the low affinity value (Ki(L)). Similarly, the total number of binding sites detected by [125I]CYP was not changed by the treatment. Neither the high nor the low affinities for isoproterenol were affected by treatment of the cells with SIN-1 depleted of NO (data not shown).Table IEffect of SIN-1 on the isoproterenol binding parameters of the β-AR in HEK293 cellsKI(H)1-aEquilibrium inhibition constant for isoproterenol.

The values are the mean ± S.E. η, number of independent experiments. Experiments described above used chemical NO donors. To determine if endogenously produced NO could also have an effect on receptor-stimulated cAMP production in a more physiologically relevant system, a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) naturally expressing the β-adrenergic receptor was used. As expected, treatment of these cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to the activation of iNOS as indicated by the marked increase in nitrite accumulation promoted by the treatment (Fig. 4 A). In agreement with the results obtained using a NO donor, LPS treatment caused a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the EC50 for isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production (156 ± 64 versus 20 ± 6 nm) (Fig.4 B). Both the nitrite production and the rightward shift of the isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation were blocked by the NO synthase inhibitor l-NMMA (Fig. 4) suggesting that the endogenous production of NO is responsible for the decrease potency of isoproterenol. Neither receptor number nor forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was affected by LPS (data not shown). A large body of evidence suggests that NO can modulate the activity of various proteins by directly interacting with accessible thiol groups within the protein to form nitrosocysteine (13Hess D.T.

Endocytosis occurs from both apical and basolateral surfaces in epthelial cells (1Simons K. Fuller S.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 1: 243-288Google Scholar, 2Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Clathrin-coated vesicles derived from the apical or basolateral plasma membrane lose their coat and fuse with early endosomes. Endocytosed cell surface receptors and other membrane proteins, as well as fluid phase markers, therefore appear first in early endosomes. Early endosomes comprise at least two functionally distinct compartments (3Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Internalized receptors and ligands first enter the peripheral sorting endosomes. In these compartments, some membrane proteins are sorted away from those proteins destined for degradation. In particular, some receptor-ligand complexes and the remaining solutes are transported to late endosomes and lysosomes to be degraded, whereas the transferrin receptor (Tf-R)1 recycles back to the basolateral cell surface (4Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recycling back to the plasma membrane can occur directly from the so-called sorting endosome (fast cycle) or indirectly via the recycling endosome (5Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Strickland D.L. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Work on endocytic compartments in epithelial MDCK cells has demonstrated that apical early endosomes are distributed below the apical microvilli above the ring of tight junctions and that basolateral early endosomes are found alongside the lateral as well as the basal membranes (6Parton R.G. Prydz K. Bomsel M. Simons K. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3259-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Bomsel M. Prydz K. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Simons K. J.

In vitro fusion assays with endosomes derived from the MDCK cell line have confirmed that there is a specific set of early endosomes associated with each plasma membrane domain. These endosomes show homotypic fusion but no heterotypic fusion activities with each other (7Bomsel M. Prydz K. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Simons K. J.

Recent evidence suggests that in epithelia, apical and basolateral endocytic pathways converge in an apically located, pericentriolar endosomal compartment termed the apical recycling endosome. In this compartment, apically and basolaterally internalized membrane constituents are thought to be sorted for recycling back to their site of origin or for transcytosis to the opposite plasma membrane domain. Up to now, marker proteins for early endosomes, such as Rab5, were found on both apical and basolateral early endosomes (9Harder T. Gerke V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1119-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Other proteins, such as annexin II, show, in addition to miscellaneous subcellular localizations, an association with peripheral transferrin-labeled endosomes in epithelial cells (10Bucci C. Wandinger-Ness A. Lütcke A. Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Zerial M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas Rab25 and Rab11a were found to be associated with the apical recycling system of polarized MDCK cells (11Casanova J.E. Wang X. Kumar R. Bhartur S.G. Navarre J. Woodrum J.E. Altschuler Y. Ray G.S. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that recycling of endocytosed transferrin and transferrin receptor through this pericentriolar endosomal compartment requires hydrolysis of GTP on Rab11 (12Ren M. Xu G. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 13Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The complexity of endocytic recycling and the limited number of marker proteins identified to date suggests that there are many yet unidentified molecules involved in regulating endocytic trafficking in polarized cells. One approach to gain more knowledge about the apical and basolateral specifities for endocytosis is to analyze the overall molecular composition and organization of apical and basolateral early endocytic vesicles. For this purpose, the lipophilic fluorescent probe trimethylamino-diphenylhexatriene (TMA-DPH) that intercalates in membrane structures has been used for studying endocytosis (14Illinger D. Poindron P. Fonteneau P. Modollel M. Kuhry J.-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Cupers P. Veithen A. Kiss A. Baudhuin P. Courtoy P.J. J.

TMA-DPH is a cationic analogue of DPH that has also proven useful as a probe for studying bulk-phase endocytosis (14Illinger D. Poindron P. Fonteneau P. Modollel M. Kuhry J.-G. Biochim. Biophys.

Haberfellner M. Gruenberg J. Huber L.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 63-69Google Scholar). In addition, the dye does not diffuse through tight junctions, and for this reason, it has been used successfully in anisotropy experiments to estimate in situ the lipid order of the plasma membrane of polarized MDCK II cells (23Le Grimellec C. Friedlander G. Giocondi M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F22-F32PubMed Google Scholar). Here we combined the use of TMA-DPH with conventional density gradient centrifugation (24Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. Magee A.I. Wileman T. Protein Targeting: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 187-216Google Scholar) with high speed organelle sorting in a flow cytometer (fluorescence-activated organelle sorting (FAOS)) to analyze the apical and basolateral endosomal proteins in MDCK cells (22Böck G. Steinlein P. Haberfellner M. Gruenberg J. Huber L.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 63-69Google Scholar, 25Böck I. Steinlein P. Huber L.A. Tr. Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 499-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using high resolution 2D gel electrophoresis (2DE) and protein microsequencing, we identified the adaptor protein syntenin in apical endocytic vesicles. Syntenin contains a tandem repeat of two PDZ domains. PDZ domains mediate protein-protein interactions and typically bind to short amino acid motifs at the carboxyl terminus of interacting proteins, including certain ion channels and transmembrane receptors. As such, syntenin reacts with the FYA carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of syndecans (26Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and with the carboxyl terminus of B-type ephrins (27Lin D. Gish G.D. Songyang Z. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3726-3733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). By combining a novel strategy for subcellular fractionation with biochemical analysis and transient overexpression of syntenin, we could for the first time demonstrate an association of this recently identified adaptor molecule with the apical recycling compartment of MDCK cells. MDCK I and II cells were cultured and seeded on filters (Costar; pore size, 0.4 μm) as described previously (10Bucci C. Wandinger-Ness A. Lütcke A. Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Zerial M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Huber L.A. Pimplikar S. Parton R.G. Virta H. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Before each experiment, the confluency of the monolayer was confirmed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance. In vivo staining with TMA-DPH was carried out with a baby hamster kidney cell line (BHK-21) grown on coverslips (29Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-human Tf-R antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin and annexin II were from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal antibodies against Rab4, Rab5, and Rab7 were raised against synthetic peptides derived from the carboxyl terminus and prepared in our laboratory as outlined (30Zerial M. Parton R. Chavrier P. Frank R. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 398-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against Rab11 (31Urbé S. Huber L.A. Zerial M. Tooze S.A. Parton R.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies against Rab5 (9Harder T. Gerke V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1119-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) were used as described previously. Myc-tagged syntenin was detected with an anti 9E10 monoclonal antibody or a polyclonal affinity-purified antibody generated in our laboratory against a Myc peptide (32Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). All secondary antibodies were obtained from Dianova. Lyophilized TMA-DPH was from Molecular Probes and reconstituted as a 20 mmstock solution in Me2SO (Fluka). BHK-21 cells were washed 2–3 times with prechilled PBS2+(PBS, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2) at 4 °C. Drops of TMA-DPH diluted to 100 μm in NaOAc transport buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.15 m NaOAc, 25 mm MgCl2) were added on top of the monolayer. After incubation for 3–4 min on an ice-cold metal plate, the dye was removed by briefly washing with prechilled PBS2+. Internalization was carried out in an incubator at 37 °C for various time points. Double stainings with acridine orange were peformed as described (33Matteoni R. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1253-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Filter-grown MDCK II cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS2+ for 5 min at 4 °C and once for 2 min in prechilled NaOAc buffer. TMA-DPH diluted to 50 μm in NaOAc transport buffer was added to the apical or basolateral cell surface and the cells incubating for 2 min at 4 °C. Immediately after TMA-DPH binding, the filters were incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 2 min with prewarmed medium. Following internalization, MDCK II cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped, and a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared as described previously (22Böck G. Steinlein P. Haberfellner M. Gruenberg J. Huber L.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 63-69Google Scholar, 24Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. Magee A.I. Wileman T.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The PNS from one and a half filter inserts was loaded on top of one SW60 tube (Beckman) containing a continuous sucrose gradient (10–40% sucrose). After centrifugation (100,000 × g at 4 °C for 16 h), 20 fractions were collected with an Auto Densi-Flow fraction collector (Labconco Corp.) and analyzed. To generate amounts suitable for preparative FACS sorting, up to 10 filter inserts were used. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (5–10 mg/ml; Sigma) was internalized from fetal calf serum-free medium into early endosomes and further chased into late endosomes as described previously (24Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. Magee A.I. Wileman T. Protein Targeting: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 187-216Google Scholar). HRP activity was assayed using o-dianisidine and peroxide as substrates as described (24Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.-P. Magee A.I. Wileman T. Protein Targeting: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 187-216Google Scholar). Specific activity of the fractions is given as ng of HRP/mg of protein. Protein concentrations were measured using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's specifications. All protein precipitations were carried out with the CHCl3/methanol method (35Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). Precipitated proteins were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by semidry electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected using specific antibodies as outlined previously (34Fialka I. Pasquali C. Lottspeich F. Ahorn H. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). TMA-DPH was titrated by flow cytometry using labeled PNS to avoid complex quenching effects from the Förster-type fluorescence resonance autotransfer (18Illinger D. Duportail G. Mely Y. Poirelmorales N. Gerard D. Kuhry J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1239: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The best compromise between the highest amount of sortable material and the minimum of false positive structures was obtained at 50 μm TMA-DPH (data not shown). Fractions enriched in TMA-DPH-labeled endosomes were diluted 1:100 in PBS and analyzed using a FACS Vantage Turbo Sort Option (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) equipped with an Argon laser tuned to 40 MW multiline UV and 210 mW 488 nm output using a 4xx/44-nm bandpass filter and a 50-μm nozzle. System threshold was set on forward light scatter, and photomultiplier tube voltage was adjusted using unlabeled PNS. Fractions containing more than 10% of labeled vesicles were gated for preparative sorts. The concentration of these fractions was adjusted to give event rates of approximately 15,000 events/s at lowest possible sample differential pressure at a sheath pressure of 45 psi. Droplet formation frequency was adjusted to approximately 70 kHz. The large volumes (typically more than 20 ml) of sorted material was concentrated by several steps of sec-butanol extraction and finally CHCl3/methanol precipitated (35Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). 2DE was performed following in-gel sample reswelling as described (34Fialka I. Pasquali C. Lottspeich F. Ahorn H. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Pasquali C. Fialka I. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with ammoniacal silver, scanned, and analyzed as described (34Fialka I. Pasquali C. Lottspeich F. Ahorn H. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Pasquali C. Fialka I. Huber L.A.

Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,36Pasquali C. Fialka I. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) were precipitated, dissolved, and separated as outlined for analytical gels and stained with Coomassie (34Fialka I. Pasquali C. Lottspeich F. Ahorn H. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Pasquali C. Fialka I. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2573-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Candidate proteins were identified in several gels and spots collected for microsequencing. Microsequencing was performed as described (34Fialka I. Pasquali C. Lottspeich F. Ahorn H. Huber L.A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction fragment amplified with Bam HI-Xho I linkers encoding the cDNA of syntenin (amino acids residues 2–298) was generated from a human syntenin cDNA clone obtained from the IMAGE Consortium (unique IMAGE Consortium identifier 33203 and GenBankTM accession number R19118). This Bam HI-Xho I fragment was subcloned in frame, into a Bam HI-Xho I downstream of a Myc epitope in a pcDNA-3 expression vector (Invitrogen) containing a Kozak consensus sequence. Thus, an amino-terminally Myc-tagged human syntenin cDNA was created that could be recognized by the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody (32Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the integrity of this pcDNAIII-Myc-syntenin construct. Filter-grown MDCK I Rab5 cells were transfected with pcDNAIII-Myc-syntenin using a PEI/Ad5 system as described previously (38Bischof J. Vietor I. Cotten M. Huber L.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 269-273Google Scholar). For internalization of transferrin, the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated in serum-free medium containing 50 μmdesferoxamine mesylate (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C to deplete the cells from Fe2+ and enrich ligand-free transferrin receptor on the plasma membrane. Thereafter, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS2+. The filters were then placed on a drop of prewarmed medium (on a piece of parafilm) containing 100 μg/ml transferrin-Alexa 488™ (Molecular Probes), overlaid with prewarmed medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Internalization was stopped by placing the filters in ice-cold PBS2+, followed by three washes to remove free transferrin. Subsequently, cells were extracted with 0.05% saponin in cytoskeleton buffer (10 mmPIPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm MgCl2) and processed for immunofluorescence as described (28Huber L.A. Pimplikar S. Parton R.G. Virta H. Zerial M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The filter pieces were mounted in 50% glycerol in cytoskeleton buffer containing 4%n-propyl gallate (Sigma), and confocal microscopy images were obtained using a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Images were processed using the Imaris and Colocalization software packages (Bitplane AG, Zürich, Switzerland) after deconvolution using measured point-spread functions with the Huygens software (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, Netherlands). TMA-DPH has been shown to interact with living BHK-21 cells by instantaneous incorporation into the plasma membrane. To confirm the predicted properties of TMA-DPH as endocytic membrane tracer (14Illinger D. Poindron P. Fonteneau P. Modollel M. Kuhry J.-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Illinger D. Poindron P. Kuhry J.G. Biol. Cell. 1991; 73: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Illinger D. Poindron P. Kuhry J.G. Biol. Cell. 1991; 71: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we established an internalization protocol in BHK-21 cells, in which filling kinetics of endosomes are well characterized. For this purpose, we prebound TMA-DPH to the cell surface at 4 °C and internalized for 2 and 30 min by warming up the sample to 37 °C. The distribution of TMA-DPH in living cells was analyzed by direct fluorescence microscopy (Fig.1). TMA-DPH bound to the plasma membrane at 4 °C (Fig. 1 A) and could be internalized into an early endocytic compartment 2 min after raising the temperature to 37 °C (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the perinuclear compartment (Fig.1 C) that was labeled after 30 min of TMA-DPH internalization was colocalized with acridine orange, a marker for acidic late endocytic/lysosomal compartments (Fig. 1 D). This confirms that TMA-DPH is rapidly incorporated into the plasma membrane and follows the normal intracellular traffic of internalization, thus behaving as a suitable marker for membrane endocytosis under the applied conditions. We first compared the distribution of fluid phase internalized HRP with internalized TMA-DPH after subcellular fractionation of cells on sucrose gradients. We internalized HRP in filter-grown MDCK II cells through the apical or basolateral medium. Cells were homogenized, and the PNS was then loaded on top of a continuous sucrose gradient (10–40%) and centrifuged to equilibrium. A total of 20 fractions per gradient were collected and analyzed for their HRP activity and total amounts of protein (Fig.2 A). The apical and basolateral internalization profiles showed a peak area that spanned fractions 10–16, corresponding to 25–35% of sucrose concentration (1.104–1.151 g/cm3). We next examined the gradient distribution for TMA-DPH-labeled early endocytic structures. After binding TMA-DPH to the basolateral or apical plasma membrane for 2 min at 4 °C, the fluorescent dye was internalized for 2 min at 37 °C (Fig. 2 B), and cells were fractionated as in Fig.2 A. When compared with the distribution profiles obtained by HRP labeling of apical and basolateral endocytic vesicles of MDCK II cells, TMA-DPH labeling revealed a largely overlapping peak area between fractions 14 and 16, corresponding to 30–35% concentration of sucrose. Immunoblotting of these fractions revealed the presence of Tf-R, Rab5, and Rab4 as early endosomal markers (10Bucci C. Wandinger-Ness A. Lütcke A. Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Zerial M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) in the overlapping peak areas (outlined in Fig. 2 C). However, this sucrose concentration corresponded to the density of early endocytic organelles rather than to the reported density of late endocytic vesicles (42Aniento F. Gruenberg J. Cold. Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), emphasizing that conventional gradient fractionation is not sufficient to separate (a) early from late endocytic structures, or (b) apical from basolateral endosomes in MDCK II cells. Gradient fractions containing >10% TMA-DPH-labeled apical or basolateral vesicles, as referred to the PNS fraction, were pooled and subsequently sorted in a flow cytometer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins of sorted fractions were concentrated and precipitated, and their protein content was determined. 5 μg of protein (equivalent to about 40 million sorted fluorescent events) derived from apical or basolateral sorts and 5 μg of protein precipitated from the starting fraction were separated by 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, stained with Ponceau-S to confirm equal loading of samples (Fig.3 A), and prepared for immunodetection. Apical as well as basolateral fractions revealed an enrichment of early endocytic markers after FACS sorting (Fig.3 B). Rab5a is a common component of the apical and basolateral endocytic machinery in polarized MDCK cells (9Harder T. Gerke V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1119-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and was strongly enriched in both fractions. However, Tf-R, a basolaterally endocytosed and recycling transmembrane protein (43Nunez M.T. Tapia V. Arredondo M. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2151-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Odorizzi G. Pearse A. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was only enriched in basolateral fractions but was clearly present in the apical compartment. A marker protein for the plasma membrane, E-cadherin, was significantly decreased in the sorted fractions, as well as the late endosomal GTPase Rab7. Annexin II, a Ca2+-, phospholipid-, and actin-binding protein implicated in the regulation of vesicular traffic (10Bucci C. Wandinger-Ness A. Lütcke A. Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Zerial M. Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W2061241175,"The antizyme family consists of closely homologous proteins believed to regulate cellular polyamine pools. Antizyme1, the first described, negatively regulates ornithine decarboxylase, the initial enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for polyamines. Antizyme1 targets ornithine decarboxylase for degradation and inhibits polyamine transport into cells, thereby diminishing polyamine pools. A polyamine-stimulated ribosomal frameshift is required for decoding antizyme1 mRNA. Recently, additional novel conserved members of the antizyme family have been described. We report here the properties of one of these, antizyme2. Antizyme2, like antizyme1, binds to ornithine decarboxylase and inhibits polyamine transport. Using a baculovirus expression system in cultured Sf21 insect cells, both antizymes were found to accelerate ornithine decarboxylase degradation. Expression of either antizyme1 or 2 in Sf21 cells also diminished their uptake of the polyamine spermidine. Both forms of antizyme can therefore function as negative regulators of polyamine production and transport. However, in contrast to antizyme1, antizyme2 has negligible ability to stimulate degradation of ornithine decarboxylase in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate.

Both forms of antizyme can therefore function as negative regulators of polyamine production and transport. However, in contrast to antizyme1, antizyme2 has negligible ability to stimulate degradation of ornithine decarboxylase in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. antizyme enhanced green fluorescent protein repeat of 6 histidine residues ornithine decarboxylase open translational reading frame glutathione S-transferase polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline The mammalian antizyme (AZ)1 was first described as an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (reviewed in Ref. 1Hayashi S. Cannellakis E.S. Hayashi S. Ornithine Decarboxylase: Biology, Enzymology, and Molecular Genetics. Pergamon Press, New York1989: 47-58Google Scholar). ODC is a key enzyme in polyamine metabolism. It is induced by growth signals, and overexpression is observed in many tumor cells. Further, forced expression of ODC can transform mouse fibroblast cells (2Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Hölttä E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). AZ is induced when cellular polyamine levels rise. AZ mRNA has two overlapping open reading frames, a short ORF1 and a second ORF2, which encodes most of the AZ protein, but lacks an initiation methionine (3Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). A +1 translational frameshift, favored by elevated polyamines, aligns the two ORFs, thus producing the full-length functional AZ protein. AZ1 regulates ODC activity by dissociating the enzymatically active ODC dimer, forming the inactive ODC:AZ1 heterodimer (4Murakami Y. Fujita K. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). ODC is a substrate for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, and is much more efficiently degraded when associated with AZ1 (6Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 7Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This accelerated form of ODC proteolysis is ATP-dependent but, distinct from most proteasome substrates, does not require ubiquitination (8Glass J.R. Gerner E.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Bercovich Z. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. Eur. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AZ1 thus takes part in a form of feedback regulation that restricts polyamine pools. Two activities of AZ1 are relevant to its limitation of ODC activity. The first is stoichiometric with respect to ODC, depends on dissociation of the ODC homodimer, and is, in principle, reversible. The second is catalytic with respect to ODC, because the enzyme is destroyed while AZ1 is recycled. In addition to its effects on ODC, AZ1 also negatively regulates polyamine transport into cells (11Mitchell J.L.A. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki T. He Y. Kashiwagi K. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both the structure of AZ proteins and the polyamine-induced frameshifting mechanism are highly conserved; they have been found in a spectrum of organisms from man to Drosophila. Recently, a second AZ (AZ2) gene has been reported in human and mouse (13Kajiwara K. Nagawawa H. Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Ookura T. Kimura M. Sugaya E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 219: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); their transcripts also retain the characteristic pseudoknot structure that mediates AZ1 frameshifting (3Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 15Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Wils N. Gesteland R. Atkins J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GenBankTM search shows the additional existence of a third form of AZ (AZ3) in humans. AZ1 and AZ2 are each more conserved across species than they are within a single species, implying that AZ1 and AZ2 have maintained independent lineages since their divergence from a common ancestral gene. This suggests that they mediate distinct functions. AZ1 is known to limit polyamine accumulation in three ways: 1) it binds to and inactivates ODC; 2) it causes the degradation of ODC; and 3) it inhibits cellular uptake of polyamines. Here we assess the capacity of AZ2 to carry out these activities, using AZ1 as a reference for comparison. We find that AZ2, like AZ1, binds to ODC and inhibits polyamine transport. AZ2 expression accelerates ODC degradation in cultured cells but has negligible degradative activity compared with AZ1 in an in vitro system. Throughout this paper, we enumerate the first amino acid or the first nucleotide of AZ ORF1 as position 1. Z1 is a rat AZ1 partial cDNA clone, which lacks the first 45 nucleotides of ORF1 (3Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). GST-AZ169–227, a fusion of Z1 to GST, has been described previously (16Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AZ2 sequences were amplified from a human cDNA library (17Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Primers used were upstream primer AZ2b (5′-ccgaggatgataaacaccc), and downstream primer AZ2c (5′-gcctatactcaggagccc). PCR products were cloned into the vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) by TA cloning and sequenced. GST-AZ233–189 was made by PCR (primers: 5′-cgg aattc(Eco RI)ggcctgatgcccctgac and 5′-cggaattc(Eco RI)cccgggctccccctctaggc) and then cloning of the product into the Eco RI site of pGex2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For baculovirus-based expression we used the BacPAK system (CLONTECH). To construct a baculovirus vector for expression of AZ1, we excised the AZ1ΔT205 sequence, containing a single T nucleotide deletion that aligns ORF1 with ORF2, from pGem4AZ1ΔT205(3Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) by Nco I/Eco RI digestion and cloned this fragment into the Nco I/Eco RI sites of pBakPAKHis1 (CLONTECH) to make pBakPAK.AZ1ΔT205. To create a comparable baculovirus vector for expression of His6-tagged AZ2, AZ2ΔT97, which contains a single T nucleotide deletion analogous to that present in AZ1ΔT205, was engineered by overlapping PCR (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6770) Google Scholar) and cloned into the Eco RV site of Bluescript KS (Stratagene) by TA cloning (19Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). This construct was cleaved by double digestion with Kpn I/Sma I and the resultant fragment was subsequently inserted into pBacPAKHis1 at Kpn I and blunted Hin dIII sites to make pBacPAK.His6AZ2ΔT97. To create a baculovirus vector that requires frameshifting for expression of AZ2, AZ2 sequences were excised from pCR2.1 by Eco RV/Kpn I digestion and inserted into pBakPAKHis1 digested with Hin dII/Kpn I to make pBakPAK.His6AZ2. The amino acid tag sequences that precede native AZ2 are for His6AZ2: MG(H)6VVICRIRLPRM and for His6AZ2ΔT205: MG(H)6VVDKLGCRNSIPRM. The underlined M indicates the native initiation methionine of AZ2. A baculovirus expression vector for His6-tagged mouse ODC, pBakPAK.His6ODC, was made by PCR cloning. An ODC fragment containing the whole ORF (461 amino acids) of ODC was PCR amplified from pOD48 (20Gupta M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2941-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-agcagctttactaaggacg and 5′-ggggtacc(Kpn I)tggtccccccaaatgcc. The product was blunt-ended by treating with T4 DNA polymerase, digested with Kpn I and inserted into the Pml I/Kpn I sites of pBakPAKHis1 to make pBakPAK.His6ODC. These constructs were packaged for delivery to Sf21 insect cells as recombinant baculovirus and cells infected following the protocols recommended by CLONTECH. Virus purification, amplification, and expression of heterogeneous proteins were according to standard protocols (21O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). pBacPAK6 virus encoding Escherichia coli β-galactosidase was purchased fromCLONTECH. GST-AZ169–227 and GST-AZ233–197were expressed in E. coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted from the beads with 30 mm glutathione, 75 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2.5% Sarkosyl. Sf21 cell extracts were prepared by freezing and thawing of cells in ODC assay buffer (66 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 4 mmdithiothreitol, 80 μm EDTA, 50 μm pyridoxal 5-phosphate, 400 μml-ornithine). To measure inhibition of ODC enzymatic activity, crude extract from ODC baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells was mixed with purified GST-AZ or crude extracts from AZ-infected Sf21 cells. The mixture was pre-incubated on ice for 30 min, and ODC activity was then assayed as described (5Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells were labeled with35S-Express (NEN Life Science Products) as described (21O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Cells were starved for 1 h, labeled for 1 h, and chased for 30 min in medium containing excess cold methionine. Cells were extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 mmsodium orthovandate, and 10 μg/ml each of phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, aprotonin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin. Radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared against recombinant mouse ODC. For Western blotting, cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with peroxidase-coupled anti-His6 antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To assess association of ODC with AZs, in vitro translated and metabolically labeled ODC was incubated with purified GST-fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Triton X-100. Bound ODC was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). [35S]methionine-labeled ODC and AZ were generated by coupled in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) as described (22Li X. Stebbins B. Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4441-4446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A DNA template for transcription by T7 RNA polymerase was generated by PCR. Primers used were the following: ODC1–461(5′-gtaatacgactcactatagggaccatgagcagctttactaag and 5′-ccggaattcctacacattgatcctagc), AZ170–227(5′-gtaatacgactcactatagggaccatggatgtccctcacccaccc and 5′-gggtcgactagtcctcctcagccgg), AZ233–189(5′-gtaatacgactcactatagggaccatggatgcccctcacccactg and 5′-gggtcgactattagtcctcatcggacaag). T7 promoter sequences are underlined. [35S]methionine labeling of AZs and ODC, and ODC degradation were as described (22Li X. Stebbins B. Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4441-4446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with modification. An AZ dilution series was prepared using a 1:1 v/v mixture of reticulocyte lysate and ATP regenerating system as diluent, and 8 μl of the resulting diluted AZ170–227 or AZ233–189translation product and 5 μl of ODC translation product were mixed and placed on ice for 5 min. The samples were then removed from ice and 13 μl of an ATP regenerating system (60 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 3.2 mg/ml phosphocreatine kinase) were added. Degradation was allowed to take place at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer. ODC and AZ were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, or by PhosphorImager analysis. Sf21 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus carrying the indicated constructs. Approximately 48 h post-infection, polyamine transport was measured as described (23Sakata K. Fukuchi-Shimogori T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with modification. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of serum-free Grace's medium (∼5 × 106cells/ml). [3H]spermidine (NEN Life Science Products) was added (2.2 μm), and cells were incubated at room temperature for the indicated time with gentle rotation. Cells were then washed two times with 1 ml of Grace's medium and lysed in 200 μl of 1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. [3H]spermidine uptake was measured by scintillation counting, and transport activity was normalized to cell extract, determined by OD measurement at 260 nm; normalization factors differed among experimental samples by less than 25%. Recently a second mammalian AZ gene has been cloned (13Kajiwara K. Nagawawa H. Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Ookura T. Kimura M. Sugaya E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 219: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using sequence data presented by Kajiwara et al. (13Kajiwara K. Nagawawa H. Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Ookura T. Kimura M. Sugaya E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 219: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and in EST data bases (GenBankTM accession number W76088), we independently cloned the putative coding region of AZ2 from a human cDNA library (17Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) using PCR amplification. Nucleotide sequencing confirmed that AZ2 is related to AZ1. First the predicted AZ2 protein is structurally similar to AZ1 (Fig. 1). Also, as is true for AZ1, AZ2 has two overlapping ORFs, and the second ORF lacks an initiation codon. Translation of the second ORF therefore requires a programmed +1 or −2 ribosomal frameshift. Notional alignment and translation of the two ORFs predicts a protein of 21 kDa. Second, the putative translation product of human AZ2 shares 54% sequence identity with the human AZ1. Third, the frameshift region is more conserved between AZ1 and AZ2 than the rest of the coding regions, 62 of 77 nucleotides (81%) compared with 60% for the whole of both coding regions. Furthermore, the proposed pseudoknot structure that promotes the frameshift of rat AZ1 mRNA (3Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 15Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Wils N. Gesteland R. Atkins J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) is also conserved in human AZ2. The sequence of the gene we cloned agrees exactly with that reported (14Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There is also evidence of a third AZ gene in humans. A single EST sequence (GenBankTM accession number AI186032) distinct from AZ1 and AZ2 has been deposited in the GenBankTM (Fig. 1). Two forms have been reported in the zebra fish Danio rerio (GenBankTMaccession numbers AB017117 and AB017118). In invertebrates, AZ has been found in Drosophila (24Ivanov I.P. Simin K. Letsou A. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Salzberg A. Golden K. Bodmer R. Bellen H.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 183-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Caenorhabditis elegans genome contains one AZ-like ORF encoding an 80-amino acid peptide (26Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number 2746910). Interestingly, that sequence is also preceded by an upstream overlapping ORF. A +1 frameshift that aligns the two ORFs would extend the putative translation product to 160 amino acids and would improve slightly its similarity to other AZ proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, a search of C. elegans ESTs showed that the transcription start site is at least 45-nucleotide 5′ of the putative ATG of ORF1. Sequence comparisons of AZ1 and AZ2 of rodents and humans show that each is more highly conserved across species lines than are AZ1 and AZ2 when compared within species (Fig. 1) (14Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such conservation of both AZ1 and AZ2 suggests they may have distinct cellular functions. We therefore compared AZ1 with AZ2 to determine which activities of the former are also found in the latter. Sequence similarities between AZ1 and AZ2 suggest that AZ2 may also be a negative regulator of ODC. To test this idea, the second ORF of AZ1 and AZ2 were each expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. Similar to GST-AZ169–227, GST-AZ233–189 bound to ODC (Fig. 2 A). As expected, both AZ1 and AZ2 inactivated ODC enzymatic activity. A parallel dilution series of each fusion protein showed that they were approximately equipotent in inhibiting ODC activity (Fig.2 B). Similar to AZ1, the functional domain of AZ2 for ODC binding and inactivation is within ORF2. Native AZ proteins are the product of expression of both ORF1 and 2. To test in vivo function of the full proteins in cells, we used a point deletion of a single nucleotide to align the two ORFs. We thereby made expression independent of cellular polyamine status and avoided the requirement for frameshifting, a process that reduces the efficiency of expression. We expressed full-length AZ1 and AZ2 using a baculovirus expression system (21O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). This system was developed to facilitate high level expression of cloned gene products in insect cells, and uses virus-derived vectors for transient expression. The two ORFs were aligned by a single base deletion, ΔT205 for AZ1 and ΔT97 for AZ2. Infection of Sf21 cells with viruses encoding AZ1 or AZ2 resulted in the cellular production of similar amounts of ODC inhibitory proteins. Titration of extracts prepared from cells infected with AZ1 (AZ1ΔT205) or AZ2 (His6AZ2ΔT97) against active ODC showed that they differed by only 2-fold (AZ1 > AZ2) in inhibitory activity (Fig. 3). Full-length AZ1 (AZ1ΔT205) or AZ2 (His6AZ2ΔT97), when co-expressed with His6-tagged ODC in Sf21 cells, form a complex (Fig.4). ODC·AZ co-infected Sf21 cells were metabolically labeled and extracts immunoprecipitated with an anti-ODC antibody. Both AZ1ΔT205 and His6AZ2ΔT97 were pulled down together with His6ODC by anti-ODC antibody (Fig. 4).Figure 4ODC and AZ form intracellular complexes. Sf21 cells were singly or doubly infected with the viruses indicated and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-ODC antibody and visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Arrows mark the positions of His6ODC and of co-immunoprecipitated proteins encoded by AZ1ΔT205, His6AZ2ΔT97, or His6AZ2 vectors. The position of migration of marker proteins of the indicated molecular masses (kDa) are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether AZ2 is capable of frameshifting in vivo, we also expressed AZ2 cDNA in Sf21 cells with an N-terminal His6 tag. As no mutagenesis was performed on this construct to align ORF1 and ORF2, expression of the protein should require an in vivo frameshift. Although expressed at a lower level compared with His6AZ2ΔT97, which does have the reading frames artificially aligned, His6AZ2 was nevertheless expressed in Sf21 cells (Fig. 4). Note that His6AZ2 migrated a little faster than His6AZ2ΔT97, because they differ slightly in sequence between the His6tag and the first native amino acid of AZ2. That the frameshift has produced functional protein was supported by the following evidence. First, it bound to ODC and was immunoprecipitated with ODC by an anti-ODC antibody (Fig. 4). Second, Sf21 cells expressing His6AZ2 but not cells infected with a control virus contained ODC inhibitory activity (data not shown). We also constructed a fusion of the AZ2 frameshift region to EGFP such that ORF2 of AZ2 was in frame with the EGFP reading frame. When this construct was transiently expressed in COS-7 or ODC-deficient Chinese hamster ovary C55.7 (27Steglich C. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4603-4609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mammalian cells and protein products detected with an anti-EGFP antibody, protein of the size expected for the frameshift product was observed. 2C. Zhu and P. Coffino, unpublished observations. These data are consistent with the in vitro data showing AZ2 frameshift reported earlier (14Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition to inactivating ODC by dissociating the functional ODC homodimer, AZ1 also targets ODC for degradation. To test whether AZ2 can also target ODC for degradation, we co-infected Sf21 cells with baculoviruses expressing ODC and AZ. We first measured ODC activity. As expected, co-infection with baculovirus expressing ODC and AZ1 or AZ2 from AZ1ΔT205 and His6AZ2ΔT97, respectively, resulted in much less ODC activity than was expressed upon co-infection with ODC and PAK6 vectors, a control construct encoding β-galactosidase, or with virus encoding only ODC (Fig.5 A). There are two possibilities to explain the lesser ODC activity caused by co-expression of either AZ. The first is that ODC is inactivated by AZ binding, but ODC protein remains present. The second is that ODC is actively degraded in Sf21 cells expressing AZ. In the latter case AZ expression should cause steady-state levels of ODC to decline. Western blotting with an antibody against the His6 tag at the N terminus of the ODC protein (Fig. 5 B) revealed that ODC protein was indeed reduced to an undetectable level by expression of AZ, compared with a minor reduction seen with the control β-galactosidase construct. Similar results were obtained when the anti-ODC antibody was used for Western blotting (data not shown), which ruled out the possibility that the N terminus of His6ODC fusion had been cleaved in AZ-infected cells. It is not likely that the reduced ODC level results from reduced replication of the virus encoding ODC in cells infected by the virus encoding AZs. AZ expression had little or no effect on ODC expression as measured by metabolic labeling (Fig. 4), which detects newly synthesized proteins instead of steady state protein levels. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that ODC degradation in Sf21 cells is accelerated by both AZ1 and AZ2. (Pulse-chase experiments were not carried out to confirm this conclusion, as we could not establish effective chase conditions for these cells.) The expression level of AZ2 from His6AZ2ΔT97 in Sf21 cells was much lower than the ODC expression level when cells were infected with ODC baculovirus alone (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that in this experimental system, 1 molecule of AZ2 can catalyze the degradation of more than 1 ODC molecule. Extensive previous studies have used both crude and purified cellular extracts as constituents of an in vitro system for study of ODC degradation (10Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Such investigations have shown proteolysis to be independent of ubiquitination and dependent on ATP, AZ1, and the 26 S proteasome. Using a rabbit reticulocyte extract supplemented with an ATP regenerating system, we examined the capacity of proteins corresponding to AZ1 or AZ2 ORF2 to direct degradation of ODC. The AZs and ODC were produced by in vitro translation. They were radiolabeled using incorporation of [35S]methionine to provide a means for following their amount and stability. A semi-quantitative assessment of the relative potencies of AZ1 and AZ2 was obtained by comparing the degradative activity of a dilution series of the two proteins (Fig.6). Relative intensity of labeling, normalized to the respective methionine content of each protein, was used to estimate relative protein stoichiometry. At the highest concentration of each AZ used in the experiment shown, the AZs and ODC were initially present at approximately equimolar concentrations. In the case of AZ1, an 8-fold dilution resulted in approximately the same extent of ODC degradation as the highest concentration examined, and a 16-fold dilution produced more ODC degradation than a control with no AZ1 added. In the control with no exogenous AZ1 added, the intensity of the ODC signal was reduced about 2-fold compared with an identical sample, but one not subjected to the 1-h incubation period used to elicit degradation. This “AZ-independent background degradation” is prevented by the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal peptide (results not shown) and is probably due to the presence of endogenous AZ in the reticulocyte lysate (28Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The effect of adding AZ2 is very different from that seen with AZ1. AZ2 produced no degradation, even when added at a 1:1 molar ratio with respect to ODC. In fact, even the lowest concentration used provided a modest ODC-protective effect compared with a control sample incubated without either AZ1 or AZ2. These results imply that under the experimental conditions used, AZ2 is at least 16-fold less potent than AZ1 in directing the degradation of ODC. In addition to regulating ODC activity, AZ1 also inhibits polyamine transport into cells. In mammalian cells transfected with AZ1 under the control of an inducible promoter, polyamine uptake was reduced severalfold when AZ1 was expressed (11Mitchell J.L.A. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki T. He Y. Kashiwagi K. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We measured spermidine uptake in Sf21 cells infected with AZ-expressing baculoviruses (Fig.7). Spermidine uptake was measured approximately 48 h post-infection, by which time almost all the cells would have been infected and expressing high levels of AZ protein. Compared with cells infected with a control virus, spermidine uptake was reduced 3–5-fold in AZ1- or AZ2-expressing cells. These data support the conclusion that AZ2, like AZ1, functions as a negative regulator of polyamine pools by diminishing uptake. AZ1 is known to have two activities that diminish cellular polyamine levels: it reduces the level of ODC, a key enzyme in polyamine synthesis and inhibits polyamine uptake. AZ1 directly inhibits the enzyme activity of ODC and accelerates its degradation. The degradation depends on ATP and the 26 S proteasome but is ubiquitin-independent. AZ1 activity is induced by elevated polyamines, which induces the +1 translational frameshift. It has now become apparent that multiple copies of AZ genes are present in vertebrates and AZ genes are also found in invertebrates such as Drosophila and C. elegans. It is not clear, however, whether all AZ family members share the same biochemical functions of mammalian AZ1. In this paper we compared the biochemical activities of rat AZ1 and human AZ2 and found that they have similar biochemical activities. First, both AZ1 and AZ2 bound to and inactivated ODC. ORF2 was sufficient for binding and inactivation. Second, using the baculovirus system, we demonstrated that ODC protein level in ODC·AZ2-co-infected Sf21 cells was reduced. The result suggested that AZ2 also regulated ODC activity by targeting it for degradation. Third, both AZ1 and AZ2 inhibited spermidine uptake in Sf21 cells. Similarities between AZ1 and AZ2 goes even further, we also demonstrated an AZ2 translational frameshift in Sf21 cells as well as in mammalian cells,2 which is consistent with the in vitro data reported earlier (14Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In summary, AZ2, like AZ1, is a negative regulator of polyamine metabolism. The evidence suggests that all known AZ genes (except perhaps AZ3, whose 5′ sequences have not yet been reported) require a frameshift to produce functional full-length proteins. AZ1 frameshifting has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo (3Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For AZ2, polyamines enhance frameshifting efficiency in vitro (14Ivanov I.P. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Genomics. 1998; 52: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and our present results show that frameshifting also takes place in Sf21 cells (Fig. 4) and in mammalian cells (data not shown). The mRNA secondary structure that promotes polyamine-induced frameshifting of rat AZ1 gene is conserved in all known vertebrate AZ genes. The characteristic secondary structure, however, is not apparent in the Drosophila and C. elegans AZ genes (24Ivanov I.P. Simin K. Letsou A. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,26Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Nature. 1994; 368: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar), which could be interpreted to imply that invertebrate AZ does not use a programmed frameshift. Sequence data strongly suggests otherwise. Although the pseudoknot secondary structure is absent in invertebrate AZ, approximately 20 nucleotides of the mRNA sequences surrounding the frameshift site, including the ORF1 stop codon UGA, are highly conserved for all known AZs (where sequences are available). Indeed, translational frameshifting of Drosophila AZ, which lacks the pseudoknot, and its enhancement by spermidine has been demonstrated in vitro in wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (24Ivanov I.P. Simin K. Letsou A. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). AZ proteins are most highly conserved in the C terminus where the functional domains required for binding to ODC have been mapped. The N terminus, including all of ORF1 and the initial part of ORF2, is more diverged, and the N terminus, at least for AZ1, is dispensable for all known biochemical functions. We have shown here that ORF1 of AZ2 is not required for ODC binding and inactivation. It is possible that the only evolutionary constraint on the N terminus is that a polyamine-responsive frameshift signal has to be maintained. On the other hand, the N terminus may also contain additional signals for regulating AZ activities. For instance AZ itself could be subject to regulation of proteolysis. Using a baculovirus expression system, we found that ODC is efficiently degraded when AZ1 or AZ2 is present. We also tested AZ-dependent ODC degradation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, an in vitro system that has been widely used for studying ODC degradation (10Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Murakami Y.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this system, we found that in vitro translated ODC was degraded in the presence of AZ1 ORF2 protein but no degradative activity was detected using AZ2 ORF2 protein. What explains this apparent contradiction between our data from cultured insect cells and the in vitro system? There are several possibilities. 1) AZ2 may be capable of directing ODC degradation but does so inefficiently compared with AZ1. Expression at high level in insect cells may produce amounts sufficient to elicit degradation. The data shown in Fig. 6 makes it possible to estimate the minimum difference in relative potency of AZ1 versus AZ2. AZ1 is at least 16-fold more active than AZ2 using this assay. 2) The in vitro system lacks components that promote degradative function in vivo. AZ1 compared with AZ2 is less dependent on such components or depends on different components that are present in amounts sufficient to evoke activity. 3) AZ2 is more susceptible than AZ1 to loss of activity in vitro. 4) AZ2 may fail to become active in vitro. For example, AZ2 may not fold properly, or post-translational modification of AZ2 may be required for activating its degradative function. Ichiba et al. (30Ichiba T. Matsufuji S. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Hayashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have identified a 6-amino acid sequence (113–118, TRVLSI for rat and TRILNV for human) in AZ1, deletion of which maintains the ODC binding/inhibition activity of AZ1 but disrupts its in vitro ODC degradation activity. The equivalent sequences present in AZ2 (77–82, PHIVHF) bear no similarity to those in AZ1. If these sequences are indeed critical determinates of AZ1 degradative activity observed in vitro, this might explain the observation that AZ2 does not target ODC for degradation. Closer examination of the sequence shows that residues 113–118 are part of a predicted β-sheet secondary structure that follows a long region of predicted loop structure (31Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). A β-sheet structure following a loop structure is also predicted for AZ2 (Fig. 1). Deletion of 113–118 in AZ1 might have disturbed the overall three-dimensional structure of the AZ protein, rather than removed residues specifically critical for degradative function. The capacity of AZ1 residues 16–112 to confer lability on ODC when grafted to the N terminus of ODC (22Li X. Stebbins B. Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4441-4446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is consistent with this interpretation. It is therefore unclear whether dissimilarity of amino acids 113–118 will prove to explain the distinctive properties of AZ1 versus AZ2. The opposite degradative properties of AZ2 we observed in two different systems suggest that this function may be subject to physiologic regulation. AZ2 may have the capacity to reversibly inhibit ODC, and thus provide transient inhibitory regulation or a means to store inactive ODC in a form available for rapid use. AZ2 cDNA was originally described in a screen for seizure-inducible brain mRNAs (13Kajiwara K. Nagawawa H. Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Ookura T. Kimura M. Sugaya E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 219: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ODC has been found to be present in adult mouse brain in an inactive complex with antizyme that can be activated on further purification (33Laitinen P.H. Hietala O.A. Pulkka A.E. Pajunen A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 34Onoue H. Matsufuji S. Nishiyama M. Murakami Y. Hayashi S.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The AZ activity present in mouse brain has been found to be unreactive with a series of monoclonal antibodies reactive with rat liver AZ (34Onoue H. Matsufuji S. Nishiyama M. Murakami Y. Hayashi S.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), a result consistent with distinctive tissue distributions of the AZs. If the brain ODC complex contains AZ2, it may represent a stored form of ODC available for activation, perhaps by displacing AZ2 with antizyme inhibitor, a catalytically inactive AZ-binding homolog of ODC (35Murakami Y.

However, the mechanisms by which PKA regulates BMP function are unknown. During kidney development, BMP-2 and high doses of BMP-7 inhibit branching morphogenesis, whereas low doses of BMP-7 are stimulatory (Piscione, T. D., Yager, T. D., Gupta, I. R., Grinfeld, B., Pei, Y., Attisano, L., Wrana, J. L., and Rosenblum, N. D. (1997) Am. J. Physiol. 273, F961–F975). We examined the interactions between PKA and these BMPs in embryonic kidney explants and in the mouse inner medullary collecting duct-3 model of collecting duct morphogenesis. H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, stimulated branching morphogenesis and enhanced the stimulatory effect of low doses of BMP-7 on tubule formation. Furthermore, H-89 rescued the inhibition of tubulogenesis by BMP-2 (or high doses of BMP-7) by attenuating BMP-2-induced collecting duct apoptosis. In contrast, 8-bromo-cAMP, an activator of PKA, inhibited tubule formation and attenuated the stimulatory effects of low doses of BMP-7. To determine mechanisms underlying the interdependence of BMP signaling and PKA activity, we examined the effect of PKA on the known signaling events in the BMP-2-dependent Smad1 signaling pathway and the effect of BMP-2 on PKA activity. PKA did not induce endogenous Smad1 phosphorylation, Smad1-Smad4 complex formation, or Smad1 nuclear translocation. In contrast, BMP-2 increased endogenous PKA activity and induced phosphorylation of the PKA effector, cAMP-response element-binding protein, in a PKA-dependent manner. We conclude that BMP-2 induces activation of PKA and that PKA regulates the effects of BMPs on collecting duct morphogenesis without activating the known signaling events in the BMP-2-dependent Smad1 signaling pathway.

Organogenesis of the Kidney. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1987: 51-87Google Scholar). These interactions are mediated by secreted peptide growth factors. Members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)1family, a subset of the TGF-β superfamily, are expressed in a temporal and spatial pattern consistent with their role as regulators of tubular growth and branching (2Dudley A.T. Robertson E.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 3Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar). BMP-2 inhibits renal branching morphogenesis, whereas BMP-7 is stimulatory at low doses and inhibitory at higher doses (3Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar). Although a growing body of evidence suggests that signals derived from inhibitory and stimulatory BMPs, as well as other growth factors, are integrated by the ureteric bud/collecting duct cells to determine the number and phenotype of tubules (4Lechner M.S. Dressler G.R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the intracellular events that act in concert with these signals are largely undefined. Protein kinase A (PKA), an intracellular kinase, has been implicated in the control of morphogenesis in diverse nonrenal tissues including the central nervous system (5Hammerschmidt M. Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Epstein D.J. Marti E. Scott M.P. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 122: 2885-2894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the eye (7Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 543-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the limb (8Lepage T. Cohen S.M. Diaz-Benjumea F.J. Parkhurst S.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Lee Y.-S. Chuong C.-M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Within these tissues, PKA interacts with growth factor signaling pathways to regulate morphogenetic responses to BMPs (7Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 80: 543-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 8Lepage T. Cohen S.M. Diaz-Benjumea F.J. Parkhurst S.M.

Within the embryonic limb, BMP-2-mediated stimulation of chondrogenesis is dependent on PKA (9Lee Y.-S. Chuong C.-M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the interdependence between PKA and BMP-2 signaling within the limb may be controlled by BMP-2 because treatment with BMP-2 induces PKA activity (9Lee Y.-S. Chuong C.-M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The function of PKA during kidney morphogenesis is undefined. However, evidence in cell culture models suggests a role for PKA in growth factor signaling in the kidney. In the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell model of tubulogenesis, PKA modulates responses to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a known regulator of renal branching morphogenesis (10Santos O.F.P. Moura L.A. Rosen E.M. Nigam S.K. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 535-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Additionally, in renal mesangial cells, TGF-β stimulates PKA by a cAMP independent mechanism (11Wang L. Zhu Y. Sharma K. J Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8522-8527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which provides further evidence that PKA can act downstream of TGF-β superfamily members. We demonstrate here that PKA inhibits renal branching morphogenesis and modulates the effects of both inhibitory and stimulatory BMPs. Using embryonic renal explants and an in vitro cell culture model of tubulogenesis, we demonstrate that inhibition of PKA rescues ureteric buds or collecting ducts from the inhibitory effects of BMPs by decreasing tubular cell apoptosis. Consistent with these effects, activation of PKA abrogates the stimulatory effects of low dose BMP-7. To determine whether the effect of PKA is mediated by known signaling events in the BMP-dependent Smad1 signaling pathway, we showed that PKA has no effect on endogenous Smad1 phosphorylation, Smad1-Smad4 complex formation, or Smad1 nuclear translocation. To determine whether the dependence of inhibitory BMPs on PKA is mediated by regulation of the PKA signaling pathway by BMPs, we demonstrated that BMP-2 increases endogenous PKA activity and induces phosphorylation of its downstream effector, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Taken together, our results show that PKA acts via a pathway parallel to ligand-induced Smad1 to inhibit renal branching morphogenesis and that PKA activity is positively regulated by BMP-2. Murine embryos were surgically resected from embryonic (E) day 12 pregnant CD1 mice and the kidneys were cultured as described previously (3Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar). Explants were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (DMEM-F12) with Richter's modification (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 50 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma) and either no ligand, 5 nm BMP-2 (kindly provided by Genetics Institute), 0.25 nm BMP-7 (originally named OP-1) (kindly provided by Creative Biomolecules), 30 nm BMP-7 alone, or combinations of each of these growth factors with 5–10 μm H-89 (Calbiochem) for 48–60 h. Explants were fixed in 4% fomaldehyde for 10 min, washed four times with PBS, and then embedded in paraffin. 5-μm tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and imaged by light microscopy. Tubulogenesis assays were performed in type I collagen in 96-well culture plates using mIMCD-3 cells, as described previously (3Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture medium was supplemented with either 5 nm BMP-2, 0.25 nm BMP-7, 30 nmBMP-7, 25 ng/ml HGF (Collaborative Biomolecules), or combinations of these growth factors with either 1–50 μm H-89, 0.0001–500 μm 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), or 1–100 nm protein kinase A inhibitor (PKI) amide 14–22 (Calbiochem). After 48 h, gels were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, washed in PBS, and then imaged by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. The number of tubular structures in an area of standardized dimensions was determined in four randomly selected positions of the gel for each treatment condition by an observer blinded to the treatment condition, as described previously (3Piscione T.D.

Data were analyzed using the Statview statistical analysis program (version 4.01; Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). The mean differences between the various treatment groups was analyzed in a Student's t test (two-tailed). To study nuclear translocation of Smad1, mIMCD-3 cells were grown in monolayer on glass coverslips in DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 12 h. Cells were treated for 1 h with either 5 nm BMP-2, 5 μm H-89, or 5 μm 8-Br-cAMP or combinations of BMP-2/H-89 or BMP-2/8-Br-cAMP and then fixed in 4% formaldehyde. After three washes in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with methanol for 15 min at room temperature and then blocked with 10% goat serum and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with anti-Smad 1 antibody (12Macías-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) (1:50 dilution) overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson Immunologicals; 1:200 dilution) for 60 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted and imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop confocal laser microscope. mIMCD-3 cells were labeled with [32P]phosphate as described previously (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphate-labeled cells were incubated in DMEM-F12 with 0.2% FBS in the presence of either 5 nmBMP-2, 5 μm H-89, 5 μm 8-Br-cAMP, BMP-2/H-89, or BMP-2/8-Br-cAMP. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Smad1 antibody followed by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. To analyze Smad1-Smad4 complex formation, mIMCD-3 cells were incubated in DMEM-F12 with 0.2% FBS in the presence of either 5 nmBMP-2, 5 μm H-89, 5 μm 8-Br-cAMP, BMP-2/H-89, or BMP-2/8-Br-cAMP. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-Smad1 antibody or anti-Smad4 antibody followed by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Analysis by immunoblotting was performed using a rabbit anti-Smad4 antibody (12Macías-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) (1:1000 dilution) followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) and chemiluminescence. To analyze phosphorylation of CREB, cell lysates were immunoblotted using a rabbit anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133) antibody (New England Biolabs) (1:1000 dilution) followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000) and chemiluminescence. Identical blots were probed with a rabbit anti-CREB antibody (New England Biolabs) (1:1000 dilution) to measure CREB protein expression. mIMCD-3 cells were grown in DMEM-F12 with 0.2% FBS and treated with 5 nmBMP-2, 5 μm 8-Br-cAMP, 5 μm H-89, 8-Br-cAMP/H-89, or BMP-2/H-89. Cell lysates were prepared by suspending the cells in cold extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and then homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and then the supernatant was used in a nonradioactive assay for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA assay system, Promega). The amount of protein added to the kinase assay was standardized by measuring absorption by cell lysates at 280 nm using a Hewlett-Packard UV spectrophotometer. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the PKA peptide substrate were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and imaged by UV light. In situ TUNEL assays were performed in embryonic kidney explants and collagen gels using commercially available reagents (Apop Tag kit, Oncor). E12 embryonic kidneys were cultured for 2 days in Richter's modified DMEM-F12 in the presence of 10 μm H-89, 5 nm BMP-2, or both. Deparaffinized tissue sections were treated with proteinase K followed by 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were preincubated with 100 μl of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase equilibration buffer for 15 min at 37 °C and then incubated with 100 μl of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mixed in reaction buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was stopped by immersing slides in 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 8.0 (stop/wash buffer), for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were blocked in blocking buffer for 1 h and subsequently treated with 100 μl of sheep monoclonal anti-digoxigenin F(ab) fragments antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:20 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing sections in PBS, 100 μl of DAB substrate diluted 1:10 in 1× DAB buffer was added for 5–7 min and then sections were rinsed in distilled water. Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin and mounted with DPX mountant (VWR Scientific). Collagen gels containing mIMCD-3 cells were individually transferred from wells of a 96-well culture plate to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and treated with 0.2% trypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. Gels were washed four times in PBS, preincubated in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase equilibration buffer for 1 h, and subsequently treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in reaction buffer for 5 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated in stop/wash buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were left overnight in blocking buffer at 4 °C and then incubated with 100 μl of anti-digoxigenin antibody diluted 1:20 in blocking buffer for 4 h at 37 °C. After four 5-min washes in PBS, cells were stained with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 10–20 min and rinsed with PBS. Cells were counterstained with 1 μg/ml bisbenzamide (Hoechst No. 33258; Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by two washes in PBS. Cells were directly imaged by DIC and fluorescent microscopy. We investigated the role of PKA and its interaction with BMPs that control renal morphogenesis because PKA has been implicated in the control of cellular responses to BMPs (9Lee Y.-S. Chuong C.-M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKA regulates renal development, we manipulated its activity in embryonic kidney explants and identified alterations in collecting duct morphogenesis. H-89 is a direct reversible antagonist of the activated catalytic subunit of PKA (14Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). E12 murine metanephric explants were grown for 48 h in the presence or absence of 10 μm H-89. As shown in Fig. 1, in control explants, elongated, branched ureteric bud/collecting ducts were formed. H-89 induced stimulation of branching morphogenesis with the formation of wider, longer, and more branched tubules. To determine the function of PKA in the context of the inhibitory BMPs, BMP-2, and high dose BMP-7, kidney explants were grown for 48 h in the presence of 5 nm BMP-2, 30 nm BMP-7, H-89/BMP-2, or H-89/BMP-7. Treatment of explants for 48 h with 5 nmBMP-2 inhibited collecting duct formation resulting in short, unbranched tubules that failed to grow into the peripheral cortex. However, H-89 reversed the BMP-2 effect and promoted the formation of longer and more branched collecting tubules. Similar results were obtained in the cultures treated with high doses of BMP-7 and H-89/BMP-7. We were not able to demonstrate enhancement of tubule formation by H-89 in the presence of low doses of BMP-7 because BMP-7, alone, exerted a potent stimulatory effect (3Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). In summary, these results suggest that antagonism of PKA promotes branching morphogenesis in embryonic explants and attenuates the inhibitory effects of BMPs. The cellular complexity of the organ culture explant precludes analysis of PKA effects on specific cells within the collecting duct system. We have used mIMCD-3 cells, which are derived from the terminal inner medullary collecting duct of the SV40 transgenic mouse and form branched tubules in three dimensional matrices (3Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cantley L.G. Barros E.J.G. Gandhi M. Rauchman M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F271-F280PubMed Google Scholar), to investigate the direct effects of PKA on branching morphogenesis. mIMCD-3 cells were seeded in type I collagen, cultured for 48 h in the presence of H-89 or the specific activator of PKA, 8-Br-cAMP (17Orellana S.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4726-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and then imaged by DIC microscopy. Tubules treated with H-89 were longer and more highly branched than tubules grown under control conditions consistent with our observations in renal explants (Fig. 2 A). Tubules treated with 8-Br-cAMP were similar in phenotype to control tubules (data not shown). Because we also observed an effect of H-89 and 8-Br-cAMP on tubule number, we quantitated the number of tubules formed in the presence of these agents. 10 μm H-89 increased tubule number by 883% compared with control (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2 B). At 50 μm H-89, no tubules were formed secondary to toxic effects on the cell, as indicated by morphologic evidence of cell death. In contrast, 8-Br-cAMP exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect with 61% inhibition at 1 nm (p < 0.005) (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, the opposing effects of H-89 and 8-Br-cAMP on mIMCD-3 tubulogenesis suggest that PKA directly controls renal branching morphogenesis at the level of tubule number. Having determined that PKA potently modulates renal branching morphogenesis, we determined its interactions with the BMP signaling pathway. The results of our experiments in embryonic kidney explants (Fig. 1) suggested that BMP-mediated inhibition of ureteric bud/collecting duct growth and branching is dependent on PKA activity because antagonism of PKA rescued the inhibitory effects of BMPs. To test this more directly, we determined the interactions between BMPs and PKA in the mIMCD-3 culture model. Addition of H-89 to cultures treated with 5 nm BMP-2 induced a rescue of BMP-2-mediated inhibition (Fig. 3 A). Quantitation of these effects showed that 5 μm H-89 enhanced tubule formation in the presence of BMP-2 by 328% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 B). To obtain independent evidence that H-89 was acting to inhibit PKA, we determined the effects of the PKI amide 14–22 in our in vitro model of tubulogenesis. PKI rescued tubule formation in BMP-2-treated cultures in a dose-dependent manner (maximum effect: 1 nm, 190%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 C). In contrast to H-89 and PKI, when 5 nm BMP-2 was combined with 1 μm 8-Br-cAMP, tubulogenesis was inhibited to the same degree as observed with BMP-2 treatment alone (Fig.2 B). Because BMP-2 exerts a strong inhibitory effect on tubule formation, we were not able to determine whether 8-Br-cAMP acted synergistically with BMP-2 to inhibit. Similarly, addition of H-89 to mIMCD-3 cultures treated with high doses (30 nm) of BMP-7 induced a rescue of BMP-7-mediated inhibition by 70% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 D). However, when 30 nm BMP-7 was combined with 1 μm 8-Br-cAMP, the inhibitory effect of BMP-7 was unchanged. In summary, these data indicate that inhibitory BMPs, including BMP-2 and high dose BMP-7, are dependent on PKA to exert their inhibitory effects on renal branching morphogenesis. BMP-7, at low doses (<0.25 nm), acts to stimulate renal branching morphogenesis (3Piscione T.D. Yager T.D. Gupta I.R. Grinfeld B. Pei Y. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Rosenblum N.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F961-F975PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PKA might also play a role in modulating this stimulatory pathway, we tested the interactions between H-89, 8-Br-cAMP and low doses of BMP-7. H-89 enhanced BMP-7 stimulated tubulogenesis by 52% compared with BMP-7 alone (p < 0.05) (Fig.4 A). In contrast, 8-Br-cAMP decreased the stimulatory effect of BMP-7 by 37% (p < 0.05). These results indicate that PKA negatively modulates stimulation by BMP-7 and are consistent with the dependence of inhibitory BMPs on PKA. To determine whether PKA modulates other stimulatory pathways, including those downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases, we tested the interaction of H-89 or 8-Br-cAMP with HGF. As shown in Fig.4 B, H-89 enhanced the stimulatory effect of HGF on tubulogenesis by 13% (p < 0.005). In contrast, 8-Br-cAMP exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect in the presence of HGF. Taken together, these data suggest that PKA modulates stimulatory pathways mediated by both receptor tyrosine (HGF) and receptor serine/threonine (BMPs) kinases. Our studies in embryonic kidney explants and in the mIMCD-3 model of branching morphogenesis indicate that PKA acts at a morphogenetic level to alter the phenotype of renal collecting tubules. The morphogenetic pathway for any particular tissue or structure is derived from a composite of cellular events, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell shape change and cell migration (18Larsen E. McLaughlin H.M.G. BioEssays. 1987; 7: 130-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because antagonism of PKA rescues BMP-mediated inhibition of tubulogenesis, we determined whether this was due to a change in collecting duct cell number. Specifically, we determined the effects of BMP-2, H-89, and both together on apoptosis in the developing collecting system. E12 embryonic kidney explants were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 5 nm BMP-2, 10 μm H-89, or both. Histologic sections were then prepared from fixed tissue, and ureteric bud/collecting ducts were identified by staining with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, and apoptotic cells were assessed using an in situ TUNEL assay (Fig.5 A). BMP-2 markedly enhanced the number of apoptotic cells in collecting tubules and decreased tubule formation. In contrast, H-89 induced the formation of large, elongated, and highly branched collecting tubules in which apoptotic cells were rarely observed. Treatment with H-89 in the presence of BMP-2 partially rescued the BMP-2 phenotype and ameliorated the extent of apoptosis. The effect of these treatments on ureteric bud/collecting duct apoptosis was quantitated by determining the ratio of apoptotic cells to the total number of ureteric bud/collecting duct cells in each tissue section. Because there was no statistically significant difference between the number of ureteric bud or collecting duct cells in control compared with BMP-2-treated explants (control, 774 ± 60 versus BMP-2, 604 ± 110; p = 0.21), and in BMP-2 compared with BMP-2/H89-treated explants (BMP-2, 604 ± 110 versus BMP-2/H-89, 503 ± 212; p = 0.53), the ratio of apoptotic to the total number of cells reflects only the effect of these treatments on apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5 B, BMP-2 increased apoptosis by 1.4-fold compared with control (no ligand), whereas antagonism of PKA attenuated collecting duct apoptosis in embryonic kidney explants by 0.4-fold compared with control and by 2.0-fold compared with BMP-2-treated explants (p < 0.05). Treatment with H-89 in the presence of BMP-2 attenuated apoptosis to an extent similar to that observed with H-89 alone (2.0-fold) (p < 0.05).Figure 5Effect of PKA on BMP-2-mediated ureteric bud/collecting duct cell apoptosis. A and B, E12 embryonic mouse kidneys were cultured in serum-free medium containing 5 nm BMP-2 or both 5 nm BMP-2 and 10 μm H-89. After 48 h, paraffin-embedded 5 μm tissue sections were generated from fixed explant tissue.

https://openalex.org/W2114781679,"β-Defensins are microbicidal peptides implicated in host defense functions of phagocytic leukocytes and certain surface epithelial cells. Here we investigated the genetic structures and cellular expression of BNBD-4, -12, and -13, three prototypic bovine neutrophil β-defensins. Characterization of the corresponding cDNAs indicated that BNBD-4 (41 residues) derives from a 63-amino acid prepropeptide and that BNBD-12 (38 residues) and BNBD-13 (42 residues) derive from a common 60-amino acid precursor (BNBD-12/13). The peptides were found to be encoded by two-exon genes that are closely related to bovine epithelial β-defensin genes. BNBD-4 and BNBD-12/13 mRNAs were most abundant in bone marrow, but were expressed differentially in certain non-myeloid tissues. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that BNBD-4 synthesis is completed early in myelopoiesis. BNBD-12 was localized exclusively to the novel dense granules, organelles that also contain precursors of cathelicidins, antimicrobial peptides that undergo proteolytic processing during phagocytosis. In contrast to cathelicidins, Western blot analyses revealed that mature β-defensins are the predominant organellar form in myeloid cells. Stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate induced secretion of BNBD-12, indicating that it is co-secreted with pro-cathelicidins.

In addition to their production of microbicidal reactive oxygen intermediates, PMNs also inactivate microorganisms by exposing them to antimicrobial peptides and proteins in the phagolysosomal vacuole. In recent years several classes of phagocyte-derived antimicrobial peptides have been purified from mammalian phagocytes (reviewed in Refs. 1Zanetti M. Gennaro R. Romeo D.

The cytoplasm of ruminant neutrophils is populated with unique, dense (so-called large) granules that were reported to contain most of the cellular antimicrobial protein activity (8Gennaro R. Dolzani L. Romeo D. Infect. Immun. 1983; 40: 684-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Romeo, Gennaro, and co-workers purified from dense granules three cationic antimicrobial peptides termed bactenecins, peptides now known to be members of the cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide family (9Savoini A.

Bovine neutrophil granules also contain β-defensins, a family represented by 13 cationic, tridisulfide-containing peptides containing 38–42 residues (12Selsted M.E. Tang Y.-Q. Morris W.L.

Although β-defensins are similar in conformation to α-defensins, the disulfide bonding patterns of the two defensin families are distinct (13Selsted M.E. Harwig S.S.L. J. Biol.

Here we report studies on neutrophil β-defensin genes, their expression during myelopoiesis, and the accumulation of β-defensin peptide in cytoplasmic organelles. The genes and cDNAs encoding three prototypical β-defensins, BNBD-4, -12, and -13, were cloned and sequenced, demonstrating a high degree of similarity between bovine neutrophil and epithelial β-defensins at the mRNA and protein levels. Expression of β-defensins in various tissues was assessed by Northern blot analysis, and the pattern of expression during myelopoietic differentiation was determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining of neutrophils and neutrophil progenitors. In addition, the organellar site of β-defensin stores in mature neutrophils was established by immunogold electron microscopy. The extent of post-translational processing of the peptide precursor in immature and mature neutrophilic cell populations was determined, and studies were performed to establish the fate of β-defensin peptide during stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate. Neutrophils were obtained from anticoagulated whole blood of dairy cows as described previously (12Selsted M.E. Tang Y.-Q. Morris W.L. McGuire P.A. Novotny M.J. Smith W. Henschen A.H. Cullor J.S. J.

Approximately 1 × 106 recombinant phage were screened using a degenerate oligonucleotide probe (GCGGATCCRAARCAIGTICCIATYTGICKCAT) designed by back-translation of a region conserved in β-defensins BNBD-2–6 and -10–12/13 (12Selsted M.E.

Of approximately 80 positive plaques, 40 were plaque purified and six were subcloned into pGEM-7Zf+ (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA encoding both BNBD-12 and BNBD-13 was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. The first strand of bone marrow cDNA was used as template, and the oligonucleotides BNBD-12/3a (TGGTCCTCTAAGCTGTGGTA) and BNBD-10/1 s (CCAGCATGAGGCTCCATCA) were used as PCR primers. The 5′-RACE protocol of Frohman (35Frohman N.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A bovine genomic library in EMBL-3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with32P-labeled TAP48a (5′-CCAAGCAGACAGGACCAGGAAGAGGAGCGCGAGGAGCAGGTGATGGAGCCTCAT) as described (31Diamond G. Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). TAP-48a-positive plaques were rescreened at lower phage density through tertiary screens until pure. Phage DNA was isolated from liquid culture (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and Eco RI restriction enzyme fragments of phage insert DNA were subcloned by ligation into the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II SK+ plasmid DNA (Stratagene). Preliminary sequence analysis indicated that two of the phage clones encoded BNBD-4 and BNBD-12/13, and these were selected for further analysis. Sequence data were analyzed using MacVector 6.0 (IBI, New Haven, CT) or Geneworks 2.4 (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA) software packages. cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences were compared within and between species using the sequence alignment function of Geneworks 2.4. cDNA and genomic sequences and the predicted cDNA translation product were compared with the GenBank™ data base using BLAST (37Altschul S.F.

DNA samples were size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with a probe, BNBD-4/251a (GGTGTGTTGAAGGGCGCAGTTTCTGACTCCGCATTGG) using standard techniques (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 39Reed K.C. Mann K.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7207-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The hybridization conditions were 40% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's (1× concentration = 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 1% (w/v) SDS at 42 °C overnight, and the high stringency wash conditions were 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 62 °C for 20 min (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filter was then subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C in the presence of a Cronex Lightening Plus intensifying screen (NEN Life Science Products) for 4 weeks. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described (31Diamond G. Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The β-defensin probes were BNBD-4/251a (see above) and BNBD-12/239a (GTTCTGTCGAAGGGCACAGTTTCTGTCTCCGCGTAGG). Labeled probes were hybridized overnight to immobilized RNA in 37.5% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 1% (w/v) SDS at 42 °C, and then washed at high stringency in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 57 °C for 30 min (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A bovine α-tubulin cDNA probe was used as a control for RNA integrity (31Diamond G. Jones D.E. Bevins C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The filter was stripped of oligonucleotide label by incubation in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 70 °C for 30 min and exposed to film to assure removal of probe prior to hybridization with another probe. Heparinized bovine bone marrow cells were cytocentrifuged onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides, fixed, and dehydrated as described previously (34Yount N.Y. Wang M.-S.C. Yuan J. Banaiee N. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4476-4484PubMed Google Scholar). UTP-digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were transcribed from linearized plasmid containing the full-length BNBD-4 cDNA using T7 or Sp6 RNA polymerases (40Martin R. Hoover C. Grimme S. Grogan C. Holtke J. Kessler C. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 762-768PubMed Google Scholar), and hybridized to fixed cells as described previously (34Yount N.Y. Wang M.-S.C. Yuan J. Banaiee N. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4476-4484PubMed Google Scholar). RNA-RNA hybrids were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium (40Martin R. Hoover C. Grimme S. Grogan C. Holtke J. Kessler C. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 762-768PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were prepared against synthetic linearized (reduced and carboxymethylated) BNBD-12, and separately against folded and oxidized peptide. Details of the BNBD-12 synthesis will be described elsewhere. Briefly, the peptide chain was assembled using automated Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis, and following acidolytic cleavage and deprotection of the peptide resin, the linear peptide was purified by reversed phase HPLC. Five mg of reduced peptide was oxidized by stirring a solution containing 100 μg/ml peptide in 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 8.0, for 48 h in room air. Following oxidative folding, the peptide was purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC. The purified peptide was shown to be identical to natural BNBD-12 by acid-urea PAGE, RP-HPLC, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectroscopy. Linearized BNBD-12 was prepared by reducing 1 mg of the purified, oxidized/folded peptide with DTT, followed by alkylation with iodoacetic acid as described previously (41Selsted M.E. Brown D.M. DeLange R.J. Lehrer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14485-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The linearized, S-carboxymethylated peptide was dialyzed exhaustively against 5% acetic and lyophilized. Folded/oxidized (2.0 mg) and linearized (1.0 mg) BNBD-12 preparations were individually conjugated to an equal weight of crystallized ovalbumin (Sigma) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 6.6 mm glutaraldehyde. The conjugation mixtures were stirred for 4 h at room temperature, then quenched by addition of glycine to 150 mm final concentration, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. New Zealand White rabbits were separately immunized with the resulting conjugates to generate anti-native BNBD-12 or anti-linear BNBD-12 antibodies. Antibody titers obtained from each rabbit were greater than 1:10,000 as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The IgG fraction of each antiserum preparation was generated using DEAE Econo columns (Bio-Rad) per manufacturer's instructions. Antisera or IgG preparations were used for immunocytochemistry, immunogold electron microscopy, and Western blotting as indicated. Cytospin slides were prepared using suspensions of peripheral blood leukocytes and suspensions of calf bone marrow cells. Slides were blocked for 30 min with 5% normal goat serum and incubated with anti-native BNBD-12 antibody at the indicated dilutions at 8 °C for 18 h. Negative control incubations were performed using preimmune serum or peptide-preabsorbed antiserum. Slides were washed and developed using biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG using a VectaStain avidin-biotin-glucose oxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) per the manufacturer's recommendations. Nuclear Fast Red was used as counterstain. Peripheral blood neutrophils were prepared for transmission electron microscopy using standard methods. Briefly, cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 msodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and counterstained with uranyl acetate. Samples were then dehydrated in a series of graded ethanols, immersed in propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon 812/araldite resin. Sections (600–900 Å) were prepared using an Ultracut E microtome (Reichert) and evaluated with a Zeiss 10A transmission electron microscope. Cells were stained for peroxidase prior to transmission electron microscopy. For immunogold labeling, leukocytes were suspended in PBS and fixed by adding an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde, 10% sucrose, in PBS, pH 7.4. After 1 h at room temperature, the suspension was washed three times with PBS containing 5% sucrose, and then embedded in 10% gelatin, 5% sucrose in PBS by centrifugation at 200 × g. The gelatin plug was cut into small pieces, infiltrated with 2.3 msucrose/PBS overnight at 4 °C, mounted on grids, frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Thin sections were cut as described previously (42Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Szklarek D Harwig S.S.L. Daher K. Lehrer R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), and incubated for 1 h with 1:10 anti-native BNBD-12 IgG as primary antibody. The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10 nm gold beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and was used at 1:50 dilution. Preimmune rabbit serum was used in the primary incubation as a negative control. Peripheral blood leukocytes and fresh bone marrow cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2.5 mm MgCl2. Cell suspensions were counted, pelleted by centrifugation, and snap-frozen. Some cell preparations were treated for 10 min at 0 °C with 2 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), a cell-permeable serine protease inhibitor, as described previously (43Selsted M.E. Novotny M.J. Morris W.L. Tang Y.-Q. Smith W. Cullor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4292-4295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prior to freezing. Extracts of DFP-treated or untreated cells were obtained by one of the following methods. (i) A frozen cell pellet was immersed in a boiling water bath. Simultaneously, 250 μl of preheated (∼95 °C), DTT-containing SDS-PAGE sample buffer (44Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) was added, the suspension was mixed and boiled for 5 min. DNA in some samples was sheared with a 22-gauge needle, and these samples were boiled once again for 5 min. (ii) Alternatively, the cell pellet was suspended in 5–10 ml of ice-cold 10% acetic acid, briefly sonicated, and stirred for 18 h at 0 °C. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was lyophilized in aliquots of 0.5–1.0 × 107 cell eq/tube. Lyophilized material was dissolved in DTT-containing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immediately prior to electrophoresis, DTT-reduced samples were alkylated with a 3m excess of iodoacetic acid in the dark for 5–20 min, and the alkylation reaction was quenched by addition of excess DTT. Samples were electrophoresed on Tricine-SDS gels containing 15% acrylamide (44Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), and electroblotted onto 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes (MSI, Westborough, MA) using a semidry blotting apparatus. Lyophilized samples obtained by acid extraction were also analyzed by acid-urea (AU)-PAGE on 12.5% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (45Wang M.-S.C. Pang J.S. Selsted M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For immunodetection of blots from SDS gels, the primary incubation employed 1:1000 or 1:5000 dilutions of anti-linear BNBD-12 IgG; for blots of AU gels, 1:3000 diluted anti-native BNBD-12 antiserum was used. In all cases, the second antibody was 1:100,000 goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Blots were developed by exposing x-ray film to the chemiluminescence signal obtained using Ultra or Super Signal substrates (Pierce). Freshly prepared neutrophils (>95%) were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, without calcium, 2.5 mm MgCl2 to a cell density of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Suspensions were activated by addition of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in 0.1% Me2SO to a final concentration of 30 or 100 nm, and incubated with gentle tumbling for 30 and 60 min at 37 °C. At the specified intervals, cells were tested for viability by trypan blue exclusion (>90% at each time point), and the incubation mixtures were centrifuged at 234 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed, placed on ice, acidified with 10% acetic acid, and lyophilized. Cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold 10% acetic acid and sonicated for 15 s on ice. Sonicates were stirred overnight at 8 °C, clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant samples were lyophilized. Supernatant and cell pellet extracts of PMA-treated samples and controls were reduced and alkylated and analyzed on SDS-PAGE Western blots as described above. To facilitate studies on the temporal and tissue-specific patterns of neutrophil β-defensin expression, we initially isolated and characterized the cDNA encoding BNBD-4. Six cDNA clones encoding BNBD-4 were isolated from a bone marrow library screened with an oligonucleotide corresponding to a 10-amino acid sequence conserved in β-defensins BNBD-2–6 and -10–12/13 (12Selsted M.E. Tang Y.-Q. Morris W.L. McGuire P.A. Novotny M.J. Smith W. Henschen A.H. Cullor J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6641-6648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The longest of these clones extended 19 nucleotides upstream of the putative initiation methionine, and the 125-nucleotide 3′-untranslated region contained a polyadenylation consensus signal 35 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail (Fig.2). The cDNA encoding BNBD-12/13 was obtained following reverse transcription-PCR of bone marrow mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) and confirmed by comparison with the sequence of the corresponding genomic clone (see below). The BNBD-4 and -12/13 cDNAs predict precursors of 63 and 60 amino acids, respectively, each containing an 18–22-residue segment containing a signal sequence. The mature BNBD-4, -12, and -13 peptides are composed of the carboxyl-terminal 41, 38, and 42 residues of the respective precursors (Figs. 2 and 3). For both peptide precursors, the presumed translation start was implied by the presence of a Kozak consensus sequence just proximal to the AUG (Fig. 2) and coding sequences for signal peptides, which are highly similar to those in other epithelial β-defensin precursors (Fig. 3). The 4-residue (SGIS) “pro-segment” in BNBD-12 is identical to that of the first 4 amino acids of BNBD-13 previously isolated from peripheral blood neutrophils, suggesting that BNBD-12 a"

Using an ultrastructural, biochemical, and functional approach, we have studied the mechanism by which Kapβ1·RanGTP is recycled at the nuclear pore complex for repeated rounds of import. In vitro, Kapβ1 bound to the RanBP1-homologous (RBH) domains of Nup358 in the presence of either RanGTP or RanGDP, forming trimeric complexes. The Kapβ1·RanGTP·RBH complex resisted dissociation by RanBP1 and GTP hydrolysis by Ran GTPase activating protein 1. Ran-dependent binding of gold-conjugated Kapβ1 to the cytoplasmic fibers of the nuclear pore complex in digitonin-permeabilized cells and RanBP1 competition confirmed the in vitro binding data. Interaction of karyopherin α and a classical nuclear localization sequence peptide with the Kapβ1·RanGTP·RBH complex stimulated GTP hydrolysis by Ran GTPase activating protein 1 both in vitro and in permeabilized cells. This GTP hydrolysis was required for reinitiation of import of a nuclear localization sequence-bearing substrate in permeabilized cells.

In digitonin-permeabilized cells, nuclear import of NLS-bearing proteins is mediated by a karyopherin α·karyopherin β1 (Kapα·Kapβ1) heterodimer. Kapα and Kapβ1 are also called importins α and β, respectively. Kapα binds to the NLS, whereas Kapβ1 interacts with the nuclear pore complex (NPC), resulting in docking of the cargo at the NPC. Other soluble factors including the small GTPase Ran, p10 (also called NTF2), and the small Ran-binding protein RanBP1 help to translocate the cargo-carrier complex through the NPC and release the cargo inside the nucleus in the presence of free GTP. The NPC is a large complex of proteins (nucleoporins) that spans the nuclear membrane and has filamentous projections into both the nucleus and cytoplasm (3Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 4Bastos R. Pante N. Burke B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162B: 257-302PubMed Google Scholar, 5Doye V. Hurt E.

Cell. 1998; 1: 223-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Although several nucleoporins interact with Kapβ1 in vitro, the exact sequence of interactions between Kapβ1, nucleoporins, and other soluble factors that result in translocation from the cytoplasmic to the nuclear side of the NPC and back is not well understood. Ran binds to guanine nucleotides and cycles between a GDP-bound form (RanGDP) and a GTP-bound form (RanGTP). Nuclear transport is thought to require interconversion between these two forms (7Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Moore M.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: R368-R372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interconversion of RanGTP and RanGDP is regulated by two factors. Ran GTPase activating protein 1 (RanGAP1), located predominantly in the cytosol and the cytoplasmic surface of the NPC, activates Ran GTPase activity and thus converts RanGTP to RanGDP. RanGAP1 is targeted to the NPC by covalent modification with a small ubiquitin-like molecule (SUMO-1) (10Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 11Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). SUMO-RanGAP1 is attached to the C terminus of Nup358 and is the only species of RanGAP1 retained in digitonin-permeabilized cells (10Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 12Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 13Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). RCC1, a predominantly intranuclear guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran, allows the release of bound nucleotide and reloading of Ran (7Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 8Moore M.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 87: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of GTP is higher than that of GDP; therefore, RCC1 is thought to favor the formation of RanGTP. The cellular distribution of these two factors suggests that nuclear Ran is predominantly in the GTP-bound form, whereas cytoplasmic Ran is mostly GDP-bound. RanGTP binds to Kapβ1 leading to the release of Kapα along with the bound cargo into the nucleus (17Rexach M. Blobel G.

In vitro studies with yeast proteins have shown that RanBP1 in concert with Kapα and a C-terminal portion of the nucleoporin Nup1p can reverse the inhibition of RanGAP activity imposed by binding of RanGTP to Kapβ1 (36Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similar results have been reported with mammalian factors (37Bischoff F.R. Gorlich D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether and where these reactions occur in cells. Recent studies provide evidence that GTP hydrolysis is not required for translocation of cargo through the NPC (38Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 39Englmeier L. Olivo J.C. Mattaj I.W. Curr.

This leaves open the possibility that GTP hydrolysis is required for recycling of the Kapβ1·RanGTP complex for repeated rounds of import. Nup358 (also termed RanBP2) is a 358-kDa nucleoporin located at the tips of the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC (41Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol.

Its domains include a leucine-rich region, four RanBP1-homologous (RBH) domains, a zinc finger region, scattered FG and F X FG repeats characteristic of a subset of nucleoporins, and a cyclophilin-homologous domain (41Wu J.

RanGTP binds to Nup358 in overlay and microtiter plate assays (25Melchior F. Guan T. Yokoyama N. Nishimoto T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 41Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol.

Aebi U. et al.Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of rat liver nuclear envelope preparations shows that Ran loaded with GTP or its nonhydrolyzable analog GMPPNP interacts with the cytoplasmic side of the NPC (25Melchior F. Guan T. Yokoyama N. Nishimoto T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 41Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14209-14213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with an interaction between RanGTP and Nup358 at the NPC. In addition, Nup358 appears to form a trimeric complex with RanGTP and Kapβ1 in vitro (43Delphin C. Guan T. Melchior F. Gerace L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2379-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The binding properties of Nup358 are reminiscent of those of RanBP1, suggesting that Nup358 may be involved in GTP hydrolysis at the NPC. On the other hand, the location of Nup358 at the tips of the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC suggests that it may be involved in the initial docking of substrate prior to import. Many of the recent advances in characterizing nuclear import factors were accomplished by using fluorescent import substrates in a digitonin-permeabilized cell assay (44Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). One of the major tasks that currently face the field is dissecting the events that occur at the NPC during import (3Ohno M. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), a challenge that cannot be met at the resolution level of this assay.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1889-1896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have focused mainly on microinjection experiments in intact cells, in which identifying the functions of individual factors is difficult. In this study, we bring ultrastructural analysis and Ran GTPase activity measurements to the digitonin-permeabilized cell system. This approach is combined with in vitro binding and GTPase assays, as well as standard import assays, to examine where and how the Kapβ1·RanGTP complex is recycled at the NPC. We show that Nup358 is a site at which the first (docking of Kapα·NLS) and the last (recycling of Kapβ1·RanGTP) steps of nuclear import are linked and that the resulting GTP hydrolysis by Ran is required for subsequent import. Using ultrastructural and in vitro solution binding assays, we show that the RBH domains of Nup358 serve as RanGDP- or RanGTP-dependent docking sites for Kapβ1 on the cytoplasmic fibers of the NPC. The Kapβ1·RanGTP·RBH complex, a likely intermediate in the recycling of Kapβ1·RanGTP, is not dissociated by RanBP1, suggesting that GTP hydrolysis by Ran is a prerequisite for the dissociation of Kapβ1 from Nup358 during transport. Kapα and NLS peptide bound to the Kapβ1·RanGTP·RBH complex resulting in GTP hydrolysis by free and NPC-associated RanGAP1. This GTP hydrolysis was necessary for the initiation of further cycles of nuclear import. These findings are integrated into a model for the termination of one cycle of import and the initiation of the next. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented by 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. For electron microscopy and GTPase assays, 50–80% confluent cells were digitonin-permeabilized and stored essentially as described (53Gorlich D. Prehn S. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Cells were nonenzymatically dissociated in dissociation solution (Sigma C-5914) for 15 min at 37 °C and washed three times by low speed centrifugation in cold transport buffer (TB) (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA). They were then suspended in TB with 35 μg/ml digitonin and incubated for 5 min on ice followed by three washes in cold TB. They were resuspended in TB with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma A-7030) and 5% Me2SO at 107 cells/ml and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Human Ran was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) from a pET-9C construct (29Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and purified as described (21Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol.

The murine RanGAP1 open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a construct kindly provided by Mark Rush (54Murphy G.A. Moore M.S. Drivas G. de la Ossa P.P. Villamarin A.

The Kapβ1 open reading frame was amplified from a human cDNA library (CLONTECH), subcloned into pGEX4T3, expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein, and purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose. For electron microscopic and binding studies, Kapβ1 was eluted with thrombin; for GTPase assays, it was eluted with glutathione according to the manufacturer's instructions as a GST fusion protein. Murine Kapα2 (55Kussel P. Frasch M. Mol. Gen.

The Nup358-1 construct was produced by amplifying the region of the Nup358 cDNA that encodes amino acids 996–1963 from a plasmid containing the 7-4 fragment of Nup358 (41Wu J. Matunis M.J. Kraemer D.

It was subcloned into pGEX4T3 and expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. Recombinant RanBP1, expressed from a pET11 construct (kindly provided by Elias Coutavas), was a gift from Yuh-Min Chook and Tschong-Uk Park. The optimum amount of recombinant protein needed to stabilize colloidal gold beads (BBI International) was determined by titration according to the manufacturer's instructions. Colloidal gold beads, 10 nm in diameter, were incubated with the recombinant protein for 5 min at room temperature and brought up to pH 9 with 0.2m potassium carbonate. Bovine serum albumin was added to 10 mg/ml and the coated beads were then concentrated 50-fold by centrifugation according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month. Gold conjugates were checked by electron microscopy to ensure that the preparation is monodisperse with no clumping of gold particles. Approximately 5 × 104digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were incubated with 1 μl of 10-nm gold conjugate for 40 min at 22 °C in 30 μl of TB followed by overnight fixation in 5% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C. Samples were processed for transmission electron microscopy and viewed with a Jeol 100CX microscope (Jeol USA, Peabody, MA). Two photographs per cell were taken from ultrathin sections at × 26,000 magnification from 5–6 cells for each experimental point. For quantitation of Kapβ1 binding to the NPC, the gold beads associated with all the morphologically preserved NPCs visible in the photograph (approximately 40 NPCs per sample) were counted and divided by the number of NPCs. All electron micrographs were scanned and saved using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 software. Quantitative analysis of the images was carried out with NIH Image 1.61 software. Binding reactions contained 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a total volume of 46 μl in transport buffer with Tween 20 (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mmmagnesium chloride, and 0.1% Tween 20) and 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nup358-1, Nup358-4, and Kapβ1 were present at 0.25 μm each; Ran was at 0.8 μm. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. After pelleting the beads, the supernatant was collected, and the beads were washed twice in cold TB-0.1% Tween 20. For the experiment shown in Fig. 4, a further 1 h incubation was carried out in the presence or absence of RanBP1 at 4 °C as indicated. The bound and unbound fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5–20% gradient gels. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining of gels, Amido Black staining of blots, or Western blotting as indicated in the text and figure legends. In Western blots, Kapα, by virtue of its C-terminal His tag, was detected using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-horseradish peroxidase (Ni-NTA horseradish peroxidase) conjugate (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Fig. 7). Detection was by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal reagents (Pierce). Quantitation of Kapα binding was performed by densitometric analysis of blots using Scan Analysis version 2.56 software (Biosoft).Figure 7Kap α and NLS can form a pentameric complex with Nup358, Kap β1, and either RanGDP or RanGTP. A, Kapα and NLS bind to Nup358 in a Kapβ1- and Ran-dependent fashion. Glutathione-Sepharose beads with immobilized Nup358-4 at 0.25 μm were incubated with 0.25 μm Kapβ1, 0.6 μm Kapα, 1.2 μm NLS peptide, and 0.8 μm RanGDP or RanGTP as indicated. Bound fractions were visualized by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and Amido Black staining. Kapα was also visualized by Ni-NTA horseradish peroxidase treatment followed by chemiluminescence detection (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Unbound fractions were visualized by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. B, Kapα and NLS bind cooperatively in the formation of pentameric NLS·Kapα·Kapβ1·Ran·Nup358 complexes. Glutathione-Sepharose beads with immobilized Nup358-4 at 0.25 μm were incubated with 0.25 μm Kapβ1 and 0.6 μm Kapα in the presence or absence of 1.2 μm NLS peptide, 0.8 μm RanGDP or RanGTP as indicated. Bound Kapα was visualized by Ni-NTA horseradish peroxidase treatment followed by chemiluminescence detection (see under “Experimental Procedures”).

Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and used at 0.4 μm in all reactions. When Kapβ1 was used, it was preincubated at 0.25 μm for 30 min at 4 °C with the [γ-32P]RanGTP before the other components were added, in both in vitro and permeabilized cell assays. In vitro assays were done in the presence or absence of the following as indicated in Fig. 8 A: 0.25 μm GST-Nup358-1, 0.6 μm Kapα, 1.2 μm NLS peptide (56Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and 20 nm RanGAP1. For permeabilized cell assays using digitonin-permeabilized cells, 5 × 104 cells were used per assay ± 10 nm RanGAP1 in the presence or absence of 0.6 μm Kapα and 1.2 μm NLS peptide, as indicated in Fig. 8 B. All reactions were carried out in 45 μl of hydrolysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (21Floer M. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5313-5316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 22 °C and stopped by adding 300 μl of hydrolysis buffer; half of the reaction was then passed through a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was washed with 5 ml of cold hydrolysis buffer, and the radioactivity retained on it was counted in a scintillation counter. GST-Kapβ1 fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and an excess of either RanGTP or RanGMPPNP was added. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice, and the Kapβ1·RanGTP and Kapβ1·RanGMPPNP complexes were eluted with glutathione according to the manufacturer's instructions. The buffer was changed to TB by centrifugation through preequilibrated MicroSpin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to use in import reactions. HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 h, permeabilized with 30 μg/ml digitonin in TB for 5 min at room temperature, and washed three times with transport buffer. Import reactions included 0.1 μm Kapβ1·RanGTP or Kapβ1·RanGMPPNP complexes, 0.6 μm Kapα, 5 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-NLS-bovine serum albumin (kindly provided by Mary S.

The mixtures, except for RanGAP1, were preincubated for 15 min on ice. RanGAP1 was added immediately before the mixtures were added to permeabilized cells. Import was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature, and cells were washed twice in TB, fixed in 2% formaldehyde in TB, and visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using a × 63 objective.

Abad C. Liang N.-S. Lowry S.F. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, many sPLA2s found in venom of snakes, insects, lizards, and scorpions (16Rosenberg P. Shier W.T. Mebs D. Handbook of Toxinology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990: 67-277Google Scholar) display diverse modes of toxicity (reviewed in Ref. 17Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function, and Mechanism. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1997: 1-28Google Scholar). At least some of these (patho)physiological activities of sPLA2s are receptor-mediated. The correlation between the binding of mammalian group I sPLA2 (sPLA2-I) to a specific 200-kDa membrane receptor on Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and DNA synthesis by the cells has been shown (8Arita H. Hanasaki K. Nakano T. Oka S. Teraoka H. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19139-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancement of migration of rat embryonic thoracic aorta smooth muscle cells (A7r5) paralleled the binding of sPLA2-I to a specific cell receptor (18Kanemasa T. Hanasaki K. Arita H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1125: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, the contraction of guinea pig lung parenchyma (19Kanemasa T. Arimura A. Kishino J. Ohtani M. Arita H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and prostaglandin synthesis in the mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line were stimulated by the binding of sPLA2-I to the cell receptor in a concentration-dependent manner (20Tohkin M.

A receptor for mammalian sPLA2-I was purified from bovine corpus luteum (21Hanasaki K. Arita H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Its sequence identified it as a homologue of the previously characterized M-type receptor for snake venom sPLA2s in rabbit skeletal muscle (22Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J.

The neurotoxic action of two potent presynaptically acting snake venom sPLA2s, β-bungarotoxin (β-Butx) and taipoxin, was found to depend on their specific interaction with proteins, which are, however, completely different from the M-type receptors, namely certain voltage-dependent K+ channels (30Scott V.E.S.

Apparently, one of the reasons for so many different (patho)physiological activities attributed to sPLA2 lies in the versatility of receptors where they selectively bind and, probably, in their specific tissue distribution (reviewed in Ref. 5Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In the study of the molecular basis of neurotoxicity of ammodytoxin C (AtxC), a presynaptically acting group IIA sPLA2 from the long-nosed viper venom (Vipera ammodytes ammodytes) (33Gubenšek F. Ritonja A. Zupan J. Turk V. Period. Biol. 1980; 82: 443-447Google Scholar, 34Križaj I. Turk D. Ritonja A. Gubenšek F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we identified a novel high affinity binding protein for sPLA2s in porcine cerebral cortex and purified it. The receptor shares some similarity (molecular mass and ligand binding characteristics) with the M-type sPLA2 receptors, but it is not antigenically related to them. The parallel discovery, reported here, of an M-type sPLA2 receptor in the liver of the same animal demonstrates for the first time that more than one sPLA2 receptor of ∼200 kDa exists in the same species and additionally confirms the exclusivity of the receptor for sPLA2 in porcine brain. Ammodytoxins, ammodytin I2 and AtnL, were purified from V. ammodytes ammodytes venom as described previously (33Gubenšek F. Ritonja A. Zupan J. Turk V. Period. Biol. 1980; 82: 443-447Google Scholar, 35Križaj I. Liang N.-S. Pungerčar J. Štrukelj B. Ritonja A. Gubenšek F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Crotoxin (from Crotalus durissus terrificus) and agkistrodotoxin (Agtx, from Agkistrodon blomhoffii brevicaudus) were a gift from Dr. Cassian Bon, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. OS2 (from Oxyranus s. scutellatus), membranes from a primary culture of rabbit skeletal muscle cells and guinea pig polyclonal antibodies against the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor were a gift from Dr. Gerard Lambeau, Institut de Pharmacologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS, Valbonne, France. Taipoxin (Oxyranus s. scutellatus), β-bungarotoxin (Bungarus multicinctus), mannosylated BSA, N-acetylglucosaminated BSA, galactosylated BSA, mannan, and invertase were from Sigma. Porcine pancreatic PLA2(ppPLA2) and bee venom PLA2(bvPLA2) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Na125I (carrier-free) was from NEN Life Science Products. Disuccinimidyl suberate was from Pierce. Affi-Gel 10 and protein molecular mass standards were obtained from Bio-Rad. Triton X-100 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and concanavalin A-Sepharose, lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B, and wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 6MB were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade. Radiolabeled AtxC (125I-AtxC) was prepared as described (36Križaj I. Dolly J.O. Gubenšek F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13938-13945Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).125I-AtxC was identical to native AtxC in enzymatic, neurotoxic, and immunological characteristics. The specific radioactivity of the preparation was routinely about 300 Ci/mmol. A demyelinated P2 fraction of porcine cerebral cortex was prepared using a slight modification of the method of Bennett et al. (37Bennett V. Baines A.J. Davis J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All manipulations were carried out on ice or at 4 °C in the presence of the following inhibitors: 2 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml bacitracin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein content in the membrane preparation was determined using the method of Markwell et al. (38Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5332) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a standard. Membranes were stored at −70 °C. Porcine liver (60 g) was cut into small pieces and homogenized in 240 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min and the pellet (P1 fraction) discarded. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min to give the P2 pellet, and the supernatant was spun once again (10,000 × g for 20 min) to give the P3 pellet. The pellets were resuspended in the homogenizing buffer and stored at −20 °C until used. Membranes from porcine cerebral cortex or liver (2.6 mg of membrane protein/ml) were extracted for 1 h by gentle agitation at 4 °C in 75 mm Hepes, pH 8.2, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm SrCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 4% (w/v) Triton X-100 and afterward centrifuged at 106,200 ×g for 1 h. The detergent extract thus obtained was usually diluted 2-fold with cold deionized water before the next purification step. The membrane extract or the fractions containing solubilized receptor were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 125I-AtxC (10 nm final concentration) in the presence or absence of an unlabeled competitor. Disuccinimidyl suberate, dissolved in 5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (50 mm dithiothreitol) (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C using Kodak X-Omat AR films and two intensifying screens. 9 ml of wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 6MB were equilibrated in 50 mmHepes, pH 8.2, containing 140 mm NaCl and 2 mmCaCl2. The diluted detergent extract was incubated with the gel for 4 h at 4 °C under moderate agitation. Two washing steps followed, the first with 80 ml of the equilibration buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and the second with 40 ml of equilibration buffer with 0.3% (w/v) Triton X-100. The bound material was eluted with 10 ml of the equilibration buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 0.6 m N-acetylglucosamine. 6 ml of Affi-Gel 10 were incubated under agitation for 4 h at 4 °C with 6 ml of 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5 mm CaCl2, containing 1 mg/ml AtxC. The amount of toxin bound to the gel was determined by measuring A280 of the supernatant. Routinely more than 90% of AtxC was bound to the matrix. The resin was washed with 100 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.2, containing 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and stored in the same buffer at 4 °C. The gel was equilibrated with 100 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.2, containing 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The eluate from wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 6MB was incubated with 6 ml of the gel at 4 °C for 4 h under gentle agitation. After washing with 100 ml of equilibration buffer, the resin was transferred to the column and washed with the equilibration buffer containing 0.3% (w/v) Triton X-100. The receptors were eluted with 70 mm MES, pH 5.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for the presence of receptor proteins by affinity labeling with 125I-AtxC as described. The protein composition of each fraction was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (40Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.A. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Samples were run on SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide gels) and transferred for 100 min at 60 V to a nitrocellulose membrane (Serva). The transfer buffer was 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine. After transfer, nonspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 1% (w/v) non-fat dried milk in PBS. The membrane was then incubated with guinea pig polyclonal antibodies raised against the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor diluted 1:5,000 in PBS and subsequently with the peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG diluted 1:10,000 in PBS (Cappel Research Products). After extensive washing in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, the secondary antibodies were detected by the BM chemiluminescent Western blotting system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. In order to solubilize AtxC-binding proteins from the demyelinated P2 fraction of porcine cerebral cortex, various detergents were tested. Judged on the basis of the lowest AtxC-specific binding site content in the pellet after extraction, the detergent with the highest efficiency was Triton X-100 (data not shown). The ligand binding activity of solubilized receptors was assessed by affinity labeling of the membrane extracts with125I-AtxC. Specific adducts shown in Fig.1 A proved that AtxC-binding proteins retain toxin binding activity after solubilization in 4% (w/v) Triton X-100. The addition of proteinase inhibitors to the extraction buffer was not critical because no proteolytic inactivation of the receptors was observed in their absence. In the case of porcine liver the same extraction conditions were successful. As shown in Fig. 1 A, two specific adducts were observed after cross-linking 125I-AtxC with the detergent extract of porcine cerebral cortex P2 fraction. Besides the 39-kDa adduct, already identified by affinity labeling experiments on membranes (41Vučemilo N. Čopič A. Gubenšek F. Križaj I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a second specific adduct, slightly smaller than 200 kDa, was observed. Assuming one to one stoichiometry of binding between the receptors and 14-kDa AtxC, there are thus two specific receptors for AtxC in porcine cerebral cortex with apparent molecular masses of 25 (R25) and 180 kDa (R180), respectively. The affinity of AtxC for its solubilized receptors was estimated in the cross-linking competition experiment shown in Fig. 1. The native AtxC displaced125I-AtxC from 50% of R180 (IC50) at a concentration of 155 nm, which corresponds to a dissociation constant (Kd) of 145 nm(42Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12292) Google Scholar). The Kd for the interaction of AtxC with R25 was lower than 25 nm, consistent with the value of 15 nm obtained using the membrane preparation (41Vučemilo N. Čopič A. Gubenšek F. Križaj I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If Sr2+ and EGTA were replaced with EDTA in the extraction/cross-linking buffer, 125I-AtxC still bound to R180 but not to R25 (data not shown). Several toxic and non-toxic PLA2s as well as some other molecules were examined for their ability to inhibit the125I-AtxC-R180 adduct formation (TableI). Binding of 125I-AtxC to R180 was most potently inhibited by neurotoxic OS2(IC50 = 2 nm) and taipoxin (IC50 = 5 nm) and also by non-toxic ppPLA2(IC50 = 78 nm). AtxA, a 17-fold more toxic homologue of AtxC, inhibited the specific adduct formation 10-fold better than AtxC, which suggests the importance of R180 in the neurotoxic action of ammodytoxins in porcine cerebral cortex. Inhibition was obtained also with the myotoxic PLA2homologue AtnL, which is enzymatically inactive (IC50 = 39 nm). On the other hand, Agtx, crotoxin, and β-Butx, which are potent neurotoxins, and bvPLA2 were not inhibitory at 10 μm concentration. Glycoconjugates of BSA with mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and galactose also prevented the binding of 125I-AtxC to R180 although at much higher concentrations (IC50 values = 570, 335 and 240 nm, respectively), whereas invertase, mannan, and monosaccharides, d-mannose, d-glucose,d-galactose, l-fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine, did not influence the interaction.Table IInhibition of 125I-AtxC binding to R180CompetitorIC50CompetitorIC50nmnmAtxC155Mannan >109AtxA 15Invertase >109AtnL 39d-Mannose >109Agtx >104d-Glucose >109OS22l-Fucose >109Crotoxin >104d-Galactose >109Taipoxin5N-Acetylglucosamine >109β-Butx >104Man-BSA1-aMan-BSA, mannosylated BSA; Gal-BSA, galactosylated BSA; NAG-BSA, N-acetylglucosaminated BSA.570Crotalus atrox PLA2 >104Gal-BSA1-aMan-BSA, mannosylated BSA; Gal-BSA, galactosylated BSA; NAG-BSA, N-acetylglucosaminated BSA.240pp-PLA2 78NAG-BSA1-aMan-BSA, mannosylated BSA; Gal-BSA, galactosylated BSA; NAG-BSA, N-acetylglucosaminated BSA.335bv-PLA2 >104The detergent extracts of porcine cerebral cortex P2 membrane fraction (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 125I-AtxC (10 nm final concentration) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated competitors. The cross-linking procedure that followed is described under “Experimental Procedures”. IC50 values were obtained from dose-response curves relating the extent of specific covalent incorporation of125I-AtxC to the concentration of unlabeled competitor used in the protection as described in Fig. 1.1-a Man-BSA, mannosylated BSA; Gal-BSA, galactosylated BSA; NAG-BSA, N-acetylglucosaminated BSA. Open table in a new tab The detergent extracts of porcine cerebral cortex P2 membrane fraction (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 125I-AtxC (10 nm final concentration) in the presence of increasing concentrations of the indicated competitors. The cross-linking procedure that followed is described under “Experimental Procedures”. IC50 values were obtained from dose-response curves relating the extent of specific covalent incorporation of125I-AtxC to the concentration of unlabeled competitor used in the protection as described in Fig. 1. R180 was found to be very stable in solution. Its 125I-AtxC binding ability was unchanged after prolonged storage at −20 °C or repeated freezing and thawing of the sample. Even after overnight incubation at room temperature the activity of R180 was not affected. R180 lost its affinity for AtxC at pH 5.0, but the affinity was completely restored when the pH was again raised to 7.4. R180 was completely retained by concanavalin A, wheat germ lectin, and lentil lectin-Sepharose and subsequently eluted by the respective specific eluants. This indicates that R180 is glycosylated. 40 ml of the membrane preparation (83 pmol of R180) were extracted with 4% (w/v) Triton X-100. The extract was incubated with wheat germ lectin-Sepharose since we have shown that R180 binds with high affinity and reversibly to this lectin.125I-AtxC affinity labeling was used to follow R180 during the isolation. The analysis of the solution after the incubation showed that all the R180 was retained on the resin. Following washing of the gel, elution of R180 was achieved with 0.6 m N-acetylglucosamine. Reduction of Triton X-100 concentration to 0.1% (w/v) in the eluate did not affect the ability of R180 to bind AtxC. The final purification of R180 was achieved by toxin affinity chromatography. Affi-Gel 10 was chosen as a matrix to which AtxC was attached. The affinity resin with the highest receptor binding activity was synthesized at pH 6.5. Initially, the affinity column was able to bind R25 and R180; however, its capacity for R25 declined very quickly. After using three times, the resin completely lost the R25-retaining ability, whereas its binding of R180 remained unaffected; it became R180-specific. As established by cross-linking experiments, R180 completely lost its toxin binding activity at pH 5.0 and regained it on returning the pH to 7.4. We therefore eluted R180 from the AtxC-Affi-Gel 10 at pH 5.0 and subsequently raised the pH to 7.4, collecting fractions to trace the receptor by 125I-AtxC affinity labeling. In Fig. 2 A, the total protein composition at each purification step is shown using silver-stained SDS-PAGE. A homogenous product with an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa was obtained after the AtxC-affinity chromatography step (Fig. 2 A, lane 7). Under non-reducing conditions only one band with the same molecular mass was visible (data not shown), showing that R180 is not composed of subunits linked by disulfide bonds. The final product exhibited AtxC binding activity, as shown in Fig. 2 B, confirming that the isolated protein is indeed the AtxC receptor. About 2 μg of pure R180 was obtained as determined by semiquantitative densitometric analysis of the silver stained SDS-PAGE band. Purification from the membrane fraction was therefore about 14,000-fold and recovery about 13%. The purification yield was essentially the same whether prepared from fresh or frozen brain cortexes. To characterize R180, Western blot analysis was made using guinea pig polyclonal antibodies raised against the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor. Besides rabbit, these antibodies are able to recognize mouse, rat, and human M-type sPLA2 receptors. 2G. Lambeau, personal communication.Neither the extract of the demyelinated P2 fraction of porcine cerebral cortex (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) nor purified R180 (data not shown) reacted with these antibodies. We examined porcine liver as a non-neuronal tissue source for potential AtxC receptors. 125I-AtxC affinity labeled a specific receptor with a slightly higher molecular mass than that of R180 (Fig.3 B). The liver membrane extract (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) cross-reacted with polyclonal anti-rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor antibodies, showing that the two sPLA2 receptors are related. The rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor and the porcine liver sPLA2receptor were also similar in their low recovery of ligand binding activity following the pH shift from 7.4 to 5.0 and back, and in their instability at room temperature, neither of which was observed in the case of R180. On the contrary, we have found no essential difference in ligand binding specificity between porcine brain (R180) and liver AtxC receptors with the substances tested (Table I). This is not surprising given that we tested only exogenous molecules (except for ppPLA2), which cannot be physiological ligands for these receptors (43Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled AtxC was found to interact specifically with the demyelinated P2 membrane fraction of porcine cerebral cortex. The specific binding of 125I-AtxC was reduced when divalent cations (Ca2+, Sr2+, or Ba2+) were removed from the solution by EDTA, consistent with the fact that R25 failed to form an adduct with 125I-AtxC in the presence of chelator (41Vučemilo N. Čopič A. Gubenšek F. Križaj I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By studying the detergent extract of the membranes, we showed that the remaining EDTA-independent specific binding of AtxC is associated with a 180-kDa membrane protein. The equivalent experiments using intact membranes failed to show the presence of this component, although re-examination of the 125I-AtxC cross-linking patterns, especially those that were overexposed, confirmed the formation of the specific adduct at 200 kDa on the membrane preparations also. The reason for the large difference in intensity of the specific signal near 200 kDa between the membranes and the membrane extract most probably indicates that the topology of R180 in the membrane is unsuitable for efficient cross-linking. R180 and R25 differ considerably in their ligand binding specificities. Whereas R25 binds exclusively neurotoxic ammodytoxins (41Vučemilo N. Čopič A. Gubenšek F. Križaj I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), R180 binds both toxic and non-toxic sPLA2s with high affinity (TableI). R180 recognizes sPLA2s of both mammalian group I (ppPLA2) and non-mammalian group I (OS2 and taipoxin), as well as group II sPLA2s (ammodytoxins and AtnL). The specific binding of the enzymatically inactive sPLA2 homologue AtnL to R180 confirmed that the ability of sPLA2 to bind to R180 is independent of the enzymatic activity. A two-step procedure has been developed to isolate R180. The wheat germ lectin-Sepharose chromatography step was important to decrease the concentration of Triton X-100 from 2% (w/v) in the extract to 0.1% (w/v) in the eluate without diluting the sample. The decreased concentration of the detergent and increased concentration of R180 in the eluate were crucial for the success of the final purification step, AtxC affinity chromatography. Freshly synthesized AtxC-Affi-Gel 10 resin retained both AtxC-binding proteins, R25 and R180, but after the third application, the resin became only R180-specific. From the competition studies it is clear that AtxC has different receptor interaction sites for R25 and R180 (41Vučemilo N. Čopič A. Gubenšek F. Križaj I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the observed binding ability of AtxC-Affi-Gel 10 column could be in a minor conformational change of immobilized AtxC, which would lead to a loss of affinity for one receptor but not for the other. The AtxC affinity step gave rise to highly purified R180 as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. As a high affinity binding receptor for snake venom PLA2s, R180 resembles the M-type sPLA2 receptor, which has been purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (22Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their ligand binding specificities are very similar. Both avidly bind OS2, taipoxin, and ppPLA2 but not bvPLA2, crotoxin, and β-Butx. Invertase, mannan, d-mannose,d-glucose, d-galactose, l-fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine, which are the ligands of macrophage mannose receptor (44Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), do not affect 125I-AtxC binding to R180, just as they also failed to influence the interaction of125I-OS2 with the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor (22Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). R180 also displays lectin-like properties, indicating the presence of carbohydrate recognition domains in its structure. Its much lower affinity for BSA glycoconjugates compared with the rabbit M-type sPLA2 and macrophage mannose receptors (24Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggests, however, that the lectin properties of R180 are not physiologically relevant. The molecular masses of R180 and rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor are practically identical, and both proteins are glycosylated. Nevertheless, the two receptors differ substantially in their abundance in brain. Although we detected 400 fmol of R180 per mg of membrane protein in porcine brain membrane preparation, only 12 fmol of M-type sPLA2 receptor per mg of protein was found in rabbit brain using 125I-OS1, an M-type receptor-specific ligand (45Lambeau G. Cupillard L. Lazdunski M. Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function, and Mechanism. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1997: 389-412Google Scholar). The mouse, rat, and human M-type sPLA2receptor homologues were not detected at all in brain by RNA blotting analysis using cDNA probes derived from respective animals and125I-OS1 binding studies (25Higashino K. Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Ohara O. Arita H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Ancian P. Lambeau G. Mattéi M.-G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function, and Mechanism. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1997: 389-412Google Scholar). The relation between R180 and the M-type sPLA2 receptor from rabbit skeletal muscle was further investigated by Western blotting with guinea pig polyclonal antibodies against the latter. The antibodies, which cross-react also with mouse, rat, and human M-type sPLA2 receptors,2 failed to recognize R180, but they cross-reacted with the AtxC receptor discovered in porcine liver. In pig, therefore, two immunologically different sPLA2receptors of ∼200 kDa are present. One of them, found in liver, is a homologue of the M-type sPLA2 receptors, whereas the other, purified from brain, is quite different. Based on primary structure comparison between sPLA2 binding regions in the M-type sPLA2 receptors from different animals, and on the analysis of the human genome for the M-type sPLA2 receptor genes, it was concluded that M-type sPLA2 receptors from different animals are probably encoded by homologous, single copy genes (25Higashino K. Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Ohara O. Arita H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This finding further emphasizes the distinction between R180 and M-type sPLA2 receptors. Cupillard et al. (43Cupillard L. Mulherkar R. Gomez N. Kadam S. Valentin E. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showed that M-type sPLA2receptors differ substantially in affinity for the respective endogenous group I and II sPLA2s and suggested the existence of other types of sPLA2 receptors distinct from the M-type. According to the molecular mass and some ligand binding characteristics, the porcine brain sPLA2 receptor probably belongs to the multilectin mannose receptor family (29Stahl P.D. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be a member of the same group of receptors as the M-type sPLA2 receptors, which are all immunologically related, and it evidently represents (one of) the “missing” new type sPLA2 receptor(s). The physiological role of the new sPLA2 receptor and its involvement in the neurotoxic action of AtxC remain important questions. In view of the relatively high abundance of R180 in the brain, its function should be very specific, although its natural ligands still have to be identified. Recently, besides endogenous group I and II sPLA2s, group IIC, V, and X sPLA2s have been described which may also be potential candidates, but their receptor binding properties have not yet been determined.

These mutants lost their ability to bind decorin in Western ligand blot assay and bound reduced amounts of decorin in an ELISA. Furthermore, these mutant DbpA proteins did not inhibit the adherence of B. burgdorferi to a decorin substrata, and they did not recognize decorin in an extracellular matrix established by human fibroblast cultures.

Lyme disease is transmitted by infected ticks, which during a blood meal can deposit a small number of organisms in the dermis of the host animal (1Steere A.C. Green J. Schoen R.T. Taylor E. Hutchinson G.J. Rahn D.W. Malawista S.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This initial skin infection is often accompanied by a local rash (erythema migrans), which can be followed by a general flu-like illness (2Steere A.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 9: 586-596Crossref Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 3Szczepanski A. Benach J.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 21-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Untreated Lyme borreliosis can develop into a chronic, multisystemic disorder that may affect the joints (Lyme arthritis), skin, heart, and central nervous system (2Steere A.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 9: 586-596Crossref Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Microbial adhesion to and colonization of host tissue is an early, critical event in an infection process. In the case of Lyme disease, host tissue adherence appears to be of importance during different stages of the disease process. Initially, during an infected tick's blood meal, a small number of spirochetes are deposited in the dermis of the host, where the bacteria appear to colonize collagen fibers (4VanMierlo P. Jacob W. Docks P. Dermatology. 1993; 186: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,5Duray P.H. Schutzer S.E. Lyme Disease: Molecular and Immunologic Approaches. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 11-30Google Scholar). As the infection disseminates to other tissues, bacteria may colonize additional extracellular matrix structures, and host cells may be involved. We previously showed that adherence of B. burgdorferi to collagen fibers involved a specific binding of the spirochete to decorin, a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan that is associated with and “decorates” collagen fibers, whereas a direct binding to collagen could not be demonstrated (6Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 7Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar, 8Guo B.P.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). A dermal route of entry into the host appears to be important for the development of disease. Spirochetes administered intravenously are rapidly and effectively cleared by Kupffer cells in the liver (10Sambri V. Aldini R. Massaria F. Montagnani M. Casanova S. Cevenini R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1858-1861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas those inoculated intradermally consistently establish infection (11Barthold S.W. de Souza M.S.D. Janotka J.L. Smith A.L. Persing D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 959-971PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the initial dermal colonization allows the organism to adapt to in vivo conditions before blood stream dissemination. We and others (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Feng S. Hodzic E. Stevenson B. Barthold S.W.

Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Höök M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). We showed that recombinant forms of DbpA and DbpB are capable of binding to decorin and that DbpA effectively inhibited the adherence of B. burgdorferi to a decorin substrate (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L.

Nevertheless, antibodies to one recombinant form of DbpA conferred broad protection against various strains, suggesting that at least some immunoprotective epitopes are conserved. In this study, we have initiated a detailed analysis of the decorin/DbpA interactions. We report that chemical modification of primary amino groups in DbpA resulted in loss of decorin binding activity. Furthermore, using a panel of site-directed mutants, we identified three specific lysine residues conserved in DbpA sequences among B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates (16Hanson M.S. Cassatt D.R.

Bacterial cultures were incubated in CO2-enriched atmosphere in a GasPak chamber (BBL Microbiologica Media, Baltimore, MD) containing BBL GasPak Plus envelopes and a GasPak anaerobic indicator (Beckton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD) until the cells reached log phase. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 4 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4). The density of bacteria was determined using dark field microscopy and a Petroff-Hausser chamber. Escherichia coli strain JM101 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) was grown at 37 °C in Lennox broth (Difco) (18Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

To label decorin with biotin, 7.5 mg of NHS-LC-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate) (Pierce) was dissolved in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide and combined with 0.5 mg of decorin and 0.5 ml of 0.2 m sodium borate (pH 8.0) in a total reaction volume of 1 ml as described previously (8Guo B.P.

E. coli was grown in Lennox broth until it reached an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. Cells from a 1-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (BB) (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and lysed in a French pressure cell at 11,000 pounds/inch2. The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. A 1-ml iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose column (Sigma) was charged with 75 mm NiCl2·6H2O and equilibrated with BB. The filtered supernatant was applied to the column and washed with 10 volumes of BB and then 10 volumes of BB containing 60 mmimidazole. The bound proteins were eluted with BB containing 200 mm imidazole, dialyzed against PBS containing 10 mm EDTA, then dialyzed against PBS. The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce), and proteins were stored at −20 °C.

Plates were washed four times with PBS-0.05% Tween 20 between all steps and all incubations took place at 37 °C unless otherwise specified. All dilutions were made using Super Block. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Immulon-1 microtiter plate wells were coated with 0.4 μg of DbpA in 50 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed and then blocked as described above. Biotin-conjugated decorin (100 μl of 0.12 μg/ml solution) was preincubated at 37 °C with various amounts (1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.12, and 0.0625 μg/well) of unlabeled DbpA, DbpA site-specific mutants, or K-mod. After washing, 100 μl of the biotin-conjugated decorin/inhibitor mixture was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. After washing, the wells were incubated with streptavidin alkaline phosphatase and developed as described above. All dilutions were made using Super Block. Immulon-1 microtiter plate wells were coated with 1.0 μg of decorin in 50 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing and blocking as described above, 0.5 μg of inhibitor protein (DbpA, DbpA site-directed mutants, K-mod, or OspC) was added per well in 50 μl of Super Block and incubated for 1 h. Subsequently, 4 × 106 Borreliae were added to each well in 50 μl of Super Block, and the bacteria were allowed to attach to the substrate for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (8Guo B.P.

The wells were washed and incubated with 100 μl of a 1:3000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. After washing, the wells were developed as described above. All incubations took place at 37 °C unless otherwise specified. All dilutions were made using Super Block. Human skin fibroblasts were cultured and fixed as described previously (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 16-well chamber slides (Nunc) at a density of 2.5 × 105cells/ml, grown for 2–3 days, and then fixed with −20 °C acetone and washed twice in PBS. All subsequent washes were done by immersing the slides in a staining dish filled with PBS three times, 10 min each wash unless otherwise specified. All incubations were done at room temperature. Unoccupied protein-binding sites on the slides were blocked with 80 μl of Super Block (Pierce) containing 1% goat and 5% horse serum (blocking buffer) (Life Technologies). The blocking buffer was carefully aspirated and 0.05 μg of DbpA, DbpA site-directed mutants, K-mod, or the unrelated His-tag protein osteopontin (22McFarland R.J. Garza S. Butler W.T. Höök M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 760: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were added in 60 μl of blocking buffer for 20 min. After washing, 60 μl of a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-DbpA was added for 30 min. After washing, a final incubation with 60 μl of a 1:50 dilution of rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was added for 30 min in the dark. The slides were examined after washing using fluorescence microscopy. Photographs were taken at × 20 magnification using Fuji Film 1600 ASA slide film. Anti-DbpA and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were adsorbed against CRL-1475 cells prior to use. An equal mixture of 1 × 106 sonicated and whole CRL 1475 fibroblasts in 300 μl of PBS were incubated end over end at 37 °C for 1 h with an equal volume of each antibody. Adsorbed antiserum was collected after centrifugation of each tube at 5000 rpm for 5 min. All antibody and protein dilutions were made in blocking buffer. Controls included (a) incubations with secondary antibody only, (b) anti-DbpA + secondary antibody, and (c) DbpA or osteopontin + secondary antibody. Chemical modification of lysine residues was performed by incubating 700 μl of DbpA (1 mg/ml) with 5.4 mg ofdl-glyceraldehyde and 37.8 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride for 1.5 h at room temperature followed by overnight dialysis at 4 °C in 2 liters of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 2 liters of PBS (pH 7.5) twice each (23Acharya A.S. Sussman L.G. Marjula B.N. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 297: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Chemical modification of arginine residues on DbpA was performed as described (24Patthy L. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 557-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of DbpA (2 ml) was dialyzed against 0.2m sodium borate (pH 9.0) overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and incubated in the dark at 37 °C with 0.05 m cyclohexanedione. DbpA was then passed through a 0.02 m sodium borate-primed PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and four 0.5-ml aliquots were collected (25Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 50 μg per ml. CD spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter calibrated with a 0.06% (w/v) 10-d-camphorsulfonic acid ammonium salt solution. Measurements were taken at room temperature in a 0.2-mm-path length quartz cell. All far-UV (250–190 nm) spectra were acquired with a time constant of 1 s, a scan rate of 20 nm/min, and 4 scans were accumulated and then averaged. Rabbit antiserum R625 (BioDesign International, Kennebunkport, ME) was raised against DbpA as described previously (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Monoclonal IgG2a antibody against OspA (4.5 mg/ml) (BOR-018–48316) was purchased from Capricorn Products, Inc. (Scarborough, ME). Rhodamine-conjugated goat affinity purified antibody (1 mg/ml) to rabbit IgG (whole molecule) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated (enzyme activity, 1191 units/ml) goat affinity purified antibody to murine IgG (whole molecule) were purchased from Cappel (Durham, NC). We previously demonstrated that B. burgdorferi expressed two adhesins in the 20-kDa molecular mass range (DbpA and DbpB) of the microbial surface component-recognizing adhesive matrix molecule family that mediated the attachment of the spirochete to decorin and bind the proteoglycan with an estimated KD of approximately 10−7m (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 20Guo B. Norris S.J. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DbpA bound decorin in both ELISA and Western ligand blot analysis. In addition, DbpA recognized decorin in an organized extracellular matrix produced by cultured skin fibroblasts and mediated attachment of DbpA-coated beads to fibroblast cultures (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 20Guo B. Norris S.J. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize this interaction, we now seek to identify residues within DbpA that are necessary for binding to decorin. In initial experiments, we found that biotin conjugation to primary amino groups in DbpA resulted in loss of decorin binding activity, suggesting a role for lysine residues in this interaction. To substantiate this hypothesis, we decided to chemically modify the side chains of lysine residues and examine the binding properties of the resulting protein. Chemical substitution of the primary amino groups resulted in a DbpA form that migrated as a somewhat larger protein compared with unmodified DbpA when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). Both forms of DbpA migrated as two bands, monomers at 20 and 21 kDa and dimers at 40 and 42 kDa for DbpA and chemically modified DbpA (K-mod), respectively. The basis for the dimer formation is not entirely clear, although it is in part cysteine-mediated (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The decorin binding activity of the DbpA and lysine-modified DbpA was examined in a Western ligand blot assay (Fig. 1 B). Substitution of primary amino groups in DbpA resulted in loss of decorin binding, whereas unmodified DbpA transferred to a supporting membrane bound digoxigenin-labeled decorin. Chemical modification of arginine residues did not affect the ability of DbpA to bind decorin (data not shown). The results described above suggested that one or several lysine residues are critical for the decorin binding activity of DbpA. To evaluate the importance of individual lysine residues, we decided to change selected residues to alanine and analyze the decorin binding activity of the resulting mutants. Of the 27 lysine residues present in the native DbpA protein sequence, 3 are present in the leader sequence. The recombinant form of DbpA used in this study contained part of the leader sequence, including one of the lysine residues (Lys-14). By comparing the DbpA sequences of various B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains (26Roberts W.C. Mullikin B.A. Lathigra R. Hanson M.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the DbpA sequence of B. burgdorferi 297 (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), we identified five lysine residues that were conserved in all 30 sequences examined (Lys-32, Lys-82, Lys-104, Lys-163, and Lys-170) and six that were conserved in most DbpA sequences (Lys-14, Lys-40, Lys-50, Lys-51, Lys-91, and Lys-102). These residues, shown in Fig. 2, were individually targeted for mutational analysis of recombinant DbpA of B. burgdorferi strain 297 using extension overlap polymerase chain reaction (Fig. 2) (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). DbpA and all mutant proteins were expressed as N-terminal polyhistidine (His tag) fusions and purified using nickel-chelating chromatography (9Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of DbpA site-directed mutants (Lys-14, Lys-32, Lys-40, and Lys-163 are not shown) revealed no significant differences when compared with native DbpA (Fig.3 A). CD spectroscopy showed that the overall secondary structure of DbpA and all site-directed mutants were nearly identical (data not shown), indicating that, the mutations did not grossly alter the structure of the protein. Western ligand blot analysis, however, demonstrated that, although all mutants were still recognized by anti-DbpA polyclonal antiserum (data not shown), proteins with mutations of Lys-82, Lys-163 (not shown), and Lys-170 lost their ability to bind decorin (Fig. 3 B). The protein mutated at Lys-51 showed reduced decorin binding activity, and a recombinant, unrelated His-tag protein OspC did not bind decorin (Fig. 3 B). We also examined the ability of biotin-conjugated decorin to bind to different forms of DbpA-coated microtiter wells (Fig.4). The chemically modified DbpA (K-mod) was essentially unable to support the binding of decorin. Proteins mutated at the single lysines Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170 bound significantly less decorin compared with the wild-type DbpA, and the binding of decorin to Lys-51 was marginally reduced. Because we have not determined the efficiency of binding to the wells for the different DbpA forms, a direct comparison between the different proteins decorin binding capacity from these results should be made with caution. However, a similar trend was observed in this ELISA-type assay as in the Western ligand blot assay. To directly compare the decorin binding potential of the different forms of DbpA, we designed an inhibition ELISA-type assay (Fig.5). In this assay, labeled decorin was first incubated with increasing concentrations of soluble inhibitor protein, and the residual DbpA binding activity of decorin was then assessed by ELISA. All proteins tested as potential inhibitors caused a concentration-dependent reduction in decorin binding to DbpA. Unmodified DbpA and the Lys-91 mutant were equally effective in inhibiting the decorin-DbpA interaction. The Lys-14 (not shown), Lys-50, Lys-102, and Lys-104 mutants were also efficient inhibitors whereas Lys-51, Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170 were significantly less effective, suggesting an impaired decorin binding function for these proteins. The chemically modified DbpA protein, K-mod, was the weakest inhibitor and caused less than 50% inhibition at the highest concentration tested. We have previously demonstrated that recombinant DbpA inhibited the adherence of B. burgdorferi to a decorin substrate (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We have now compared the abilities of different DbpA mutants to interfere with bacterial attachment (Fig.6). At the concentration of inhibitor protein examined (0.5 μg/well), mutations of Lys-104 and Lys-91 inhibited B. burgdorferi attachment as well as wild-type DbpA. Mutations of Lys-14 (not shown) Lys-50, Lys-51, and Lys-102 also caused a significant reduction in the number of bacteria adhering to the decorin substrate whereas mutations of Lys-82, Lys-163 (not shown), and Lys-170 did not inhibit bacterial attachment. Likewise, the chemically modified DbpA protein K-mod and the unrelated His-tag protein OspC, did not affect bacterial attachment. Thus the ability of the DbpA mutants to interfere with the adherence of B. burgdorferi to decorin mimics their relative affinity for the proteoglycan. In the studies described above, we have used decorin extracted from bovine fetal skin under denaturing conditions as the ligand for DbpA (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The conformation of decorin is probably different from the mature form of decorin that is found deposited in an extracellular matrix associated with other extracellular matrix components (27Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that DbpA can be used in immunofluorescent staining of an extracellular matrix produced by cultured skin fibroblasts, demonstrating that extracellular matrix-incorporated decorin has binding sites available for DbpA (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Similar fibrillar patterns were seen when DbpA or an antibody to decorin was used in these experiments (9Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We have now examined the ability of the different DbpA proteins to bind to the fibroblast matrix using the immunofluorescent staining technique (Fig. 7). An extensive fibrillar extracellular matrix staining was observed when the cells were incubated with wild-type DbpA, Lys-51, or Lys-102 (Fig. 7, A, C, and F, respectively) or with Lys-14, Lys-32, Lys-40, Lys-91, or Lys-104 (not shown). Intermediate staining was seen when fibroblasts were incubated with Lys-50 (Fig.7 B), and matrix staining was not detected using Lys-82 or K-mod (Fig. 7, D and E, respectively) or Lys-163, Lys-170, or osteopontin (not shown). Incubation of the matrix with primary and secondary antibodies alone or secondary antibody resulted in no detectable binding (not shown). These results suggested that the different DbpA mutants have the same relative affinity for decorin in a fibroblast matrix compared with extracted, isolated decorin. B. burgdorferi colonization of the skin during the initial stages of infection may be mediated in part by surface-exposed DbpA and DbpB that bind the collagen-associated proteoglycan decorin. These adhesins have recently been identified as vaccine candidates in various studies (12Feng S. Hodzic E. Stevenson B. Barthold S.W. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2827-2835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hagman K.E. Lahdenne P. Popova T.G. Porcella S.F. Akins D.R. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Infect.

Immun. 1998; 66: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in fact may be more effective than OspA-based vaccines (15Cassatt D.R. Patel N.K. Ulbrandt N.D. Hanson M.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5379-5387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hanson M.S. Cassatt D.R. Guo B.P. Patel N.K. McCarthy M.P. Dorward D.W. Höök M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2143-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have initiated a detailed analysis of the interaction of DbpA with decorin. We demonstrated here that lysine, which makes up 13% of the residues in recombinant DbpA (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), is involved in decorin binding. Alignment of DbpA sequences from various B. burgdorferi genotypes (26Roberts W.C. Mullikin B.A. Lathigra R. Hanson M.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5275-5285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the sequence of DbpA from strain 297, used previously in our laboratory (8Guo B.P. Brown E.L. Dorward D.W. Rosenberg L.C. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), allowed us to identify six lysine residues conserved in most DbpA sequences and five residues conserved in all of them. These lysine residues were individually mutated to alanine and examined by various assays for decorin binding activity. Analysis of Lys-14-Lys-170 mutants revealed that Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170 were not recognized by decorin in a Western ligand blot and bound reduced amounts of decorin in an ELISA. Lys-51 bound decorin weakly compared with Lys-50 and Lys-91-Lys-104 in Western ligand analysis, but in the ELISA, Lys-51 behaved similarly to DbpA and the other decorin-binding mutant proteins. In the Western ligand blot assay no decorin binding to Lys-82, Lys-163, or Lys-170 was observed, whereas in the ELISA-type assay, these mutants bound reduced but significant amounts of decorin. This difference may be explained by a different conformational status of the DbpA in the two assays. In the Western ligand blots, the DbpA may be at least partly denatured (following SDS-PAGE) when the bacterial protein encounters decorin, whereas a properly folded form of DbpA may be the target for decorin binding in the ELISA-type assay. Consistent with previous results, we found that recombinant DbpA inhibited the adherence of Borrelia to decorin-coated microtiter plates. Most of the lysine mutants had effects similar to that of DbpA. However, Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170 had no effect on Borrelia adherence, and Lys-51 had an intermediate effect. The binding of DbpA to a decorin-containing matrix established by human fibroblasts provided an assay for analyzing the interaction of the bacterial protein with a “native” form of decorin, as the proteoglycan is associated with other extracellular matrix molecules. In this assay, DbpA and most lysine mutants, including Lys-51, bound to the extracellular matrix and revealed a fibrillar-like distribution on immunohistological examination. However, Lys-82, Lys-163, Lys-170, or the unrelated protein osteopontin did not bind to the matrix. Taken together, these results suggested that Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170 are critical lysine residues involved in DbpA-decorin interactions. In addition to these three lysine residues, Lys-32 and Lys-104 are also conserved in all DbpA sequences examined so far. However, mutations of these residues did not alter the decorin binding capability of these recombinant proteins. Perhaps these two lysine residues are of importance in an aspect different from decorin binding. The K51A mutation appeared to result in a protein with somewhat reduced decorin binding activity, although the effect was not as dramatic as that observed for mutations of Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170. Because K51A seems to be a relatively common natural variant (Fig. 2), it would be of interest to see whether the Borrelia strains carrying this variation at position 51 demonstrate a reduced adherence to decorin substrates. The three lysine residues (Lys-82, Lys-163, and Lys-170) in DbpA identified in this study as critical for decorin binding are distributed throughout the protein. It is unclear whether these residues come together to form a binding pocket in the properly folded protein. We have previously shown that effective binding of decorin to DbpA involved an intact proteoglycan and that isolated glycosaminoglycan chains or core protein did not interfere with the decorin/DbpA binding. This observation might indicate the presence of two sites in DbpA that are engaged in decorin binding and that the critical lysine residues identified in this study could be involved in forming each of the hypothetical sites.

https://openalex.org/W2157423024,"A novel nicotinoprotein, catalyzing the dichlorophenolindophenol-dependent oxidation of carveol to carvone, was purified to homogeneity from <i>Rhodococcus erythropolis</i> DCL14. The enzyme is specifically induced after growth on limonene and carveol. Dichlorophenolindophenol-dependent carveol dehydrogenase (CDH) is a homotetramer of 120 kDa with each subunit containing a tightly bound NAD(H) molecule. The enzyme is optimally active at pH 5.5 and 50 °C and displays a broad substrate specificity with a preference for substituted cyclohexanols. When incubated with a diastereomeric mixture of (4 <i>R</i>)- or (4 <i>S</i>)-carveol, CDH stereoselectively catalyzes the conversion of the (6 <i>S</i>)-carveol stereoisomers only. Kinetic studies with pure stereoisomers showed that this is due to large differences in <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values and simultaneous product inhibition by (<i>R</i>)- or (<i>S</i>)-carvone. The <i>R. erythropolis</i> CDH gene (<i>limC</i>) was identified in an operon encoding the enzymes involved in limonene degradation. The CDH nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 831 base pairs encoding a 277-amino acid protein with a deduced mass of 29,531 Da. The CDH primary structure shares 10–30% sequence identity with members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Structure homology modeling with trihydroxynaphthalene reductase from <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i> suggests that CDH from <i>R. erythropolis</i> DCL14 is an α/β one-domain protein with an extra loop insertion involved in NAD binding and a flexible C-terminal part involved in monoterpene binding."
https://openalex.org/W2030771250,"Previous studies have shown that normal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are able to selectively activate CD8+ T cells with suppressor activity, inducing proliferation associated with the activation of both the CD8-associated kinase p56lck and the T cell receptor (TCR)-associated kinase p59fyn. This process appears to relate in part to a 180-kDa IEC surface glycoprotein, gp180, which binds to CD8 and activates CD8-associated p56lck. However, purified gp180 alone is unable to induce T cell proliferation and does not activate p59fyn. Because the class Ib molecule CD1d is expressed by IECs and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD1d inhibit IEC-induced proliferation of CD8+ T cells, co-immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies were performed, which demonstrated an association of gp180 and CD1d on the IEC surface. Interestingly, the activation of p59fyn in IEC-T cell co-cultures was blocked by the anti-CD1d mAb D5 but not by the anti-gp180 mAb B9. Conversely, treatment of IECs with mAb B9 inhibited IEC-induced activation of p56lck but not p59fyn. More directly, a human CD1d cDNA (FO-1 D5) transfectant was able to activate p59fyn but not p56lck. These data suggest that the CD1d-gp180 complex on the surface of IECs can be recognized by the TCR-CD8 co-receptor, resulting in the activation of CD8+ T cells.

Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 18Bland P.W. Warren L.G. Immunol. 1986; 58: 9-14PubMed Google Scholar). The subset of CD8+ T cells that proliferate when co-cultured with IECs are phenotypically similar to suppressor T cells (CD8+CD28−) (19Lui Z. Tugulea S. Cortesini R. Suciu-Foca N. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These T cells inhibit primary, secondary, and unrelated mixed lymphocyte reactions, as well as B cell responses in vitro in an antigen-nonspecific manner. The addition of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies to these co-cultures have supported the contention that the CD8 molecule itself is important in the activation of CD8+T cells by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) with the activation of the CD8-associated protein tyrosine kinase p56lck being a necessary but not sufficient event (20Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of monoclonal antibodies against classical restriction elements, class I and class II MHC, do not inhibit the activation of these CD8+ T cells, thus suggesting some novel form of interaction. It is known that IECs express the nonclassical restriction elements CD1d in humans and CD1 and TL in mouse (21Bleicher P.A. Balk S.P. Hagen S.J. Blumberg R.S. Flotte T.J. Terhorst C.

CD1d transcripts are only observed within intestinal crypt cells, whereas protein expression appears to be localized predominantly in the intestinal villus (25Kasai K. Matsuura A. Kikuchi K. Hashimoto Y. Ichimiya S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 109: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the IEC, CD1d is restricted to the apical and lateral surfaces, placing it in a potential location for interaction with local T cells (24Somnay-Wadgaonkar K. Musrat A. Kim H.S. Canchis W.P. Balk S.P. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previous studies have documented that cytolytic intraepithelial lymphocytes can be restricted by these class Ib molecules (26Balk S.P. Ebert E. Blumethal R.L. McDermott F.V. Wucherpfennig K.W. Landau S.B. Blumber R.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and that the proliferation of T cells in IEC-T cell co-cultures can be inhibited by mAbs to CD1d in a human system (27Panja A. Blumber R.S. Balk S.P. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This molecule may, therefore, serve as a restriction element for IEC-T cell interactions. However, in contrast to the conventional restriction element class I MHC, CD1d fails to bind CD8. 2N. A. Campbell and L. Mayer, unpublished data. Thus, in order for a TCR-CD8 co-receptor complex to form in this system, another surface molecule must exist. Studies in our laboratory have reported on two monoclonal antibodies generated against intestinal epithelial cells that were capable of inhibiting the IEC-induced proliferation of CD8+ T cells and activation of the CD8-associated kinase p56lck (20Li Y. Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both of these mAbs, B9 and L12, recognize a 180-kDa glycoprotein, termed gp180, which is expressed on epithelial cells in various organs and, comparable to CD1d (28Canchis P.W. Bhan A.K. Landau S.B. Yang L. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. Immunol. 1993; 80: 561-565PubMed Google Scholar), the dominant expression pattern is on surface rather than crypt epithelium. The monoclonal antibody B9 recognizes gp180 expressed by gastrointestinal epithelium, cortical thymic epithelium, and placental syncytiotrophoblasts, whereas L12 recognizes gp180 expressed only by the epithelium of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. The 180-kDa intestinal epithelial cell surface glycoprotein is a novel molecule capable of binding to CD82 and activating the CD8-associated protein tyrosine kinase p56lck, but not the TCR-associated kinase p59fyn (29Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12786-12792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to studies using intact intestinal epithelial cells, in which activation of p59fyn is also seen. These data suggest that gp180 may be associated with a molecule that is capable of interacting with the T cell receptor and activating TCR-associated p59fyn. Given the findings reported above, CD1d might be an eligible candidate to aid gp180 in the activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells, including those with suppressor activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that gp180 associates with CD1d and that this gp180-CD1d complex is involved in the activation of CD8+ T cells. FO-1 cells transfected with human CD1d cDNA (FO-1 D5) have been previously described (30Balk S.P. Burke S. Polischuk J.E. Franz M.E. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These transfected cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mmHEPES, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 3 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Untransfected FO-1 cells were cultured in similar media without G418 and served as a negative control. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from leukocyte concentrate packs and separated into T and non-T cells using rosetting and density gradient centrifugation as described previously (27Panja A. Blumber R.S. Balk S.P. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, heparinized venous blood was collected from normal donors and separated by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradient centrifugation. T cells and non-T cells were isolated from PBMCs by a rosetting method using neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells followed by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. Enterocytes were isolated by a method described previously (17Mayer L. Shlien R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1471-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 27Panja A. Blumber R.S. Balk S.P. Mayer L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Surgical specimens were obtained from the operating room. Specimens were washed extensively with PBS containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% fungizone (Flow Laboratory Inc., McLean, VA). The mucosa was stripped from the submucosa, cut into small pieces, and placed in 1 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature to remove the mucus. The pieces were then washed in PBS and incubated in dispase (3 mg/ml in RPMI 1640 medium, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min in a 37 °C shaking incubator. This was repeated four times. The tissue pieces were removed and the cell suspension collected, pooled, and centrifuged on a Percoll density gradient (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Enterocytes located at the 0–30% interface were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in RPMI medium with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for co-culture experiments. Preparations of purified enterocytes were >90% viable, and free of macrophages and B cell contamination as determined by staining with anti-CD14 and anti-CD20 mAbs (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL), and contaminated with only 2–4% intraepithelial lymphocytes (CD3+ cells). B9 is a murine IgG1 anti-human IEC monoclonal antibody that appears to recognize a carbohydrate epitope on the novel intestinal epithelial cell surface molecule gp180. Ascites was generated at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and used at a 1:1000 dilution for Western blotting, whereas 10 μg was used for immunoprecipitation studies. An irrelevant murine IgG1 antibody was used as a negative control whenever necessary. Four monoclonal antibodies were used to detect CD1d. 3C11 and 1H1 are rat IgM anti-mouse CD1 monoclonal antibodies, which have been previously shown to cross-react with human CD1d (21Bleicher P.A.

Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Supernatants were harvested from the 1H1 or 3C11 hybridomas, and antibody concentrations were adjusted to 10 μg/ml. D5 is a murine anti-human CD1d monoclonal antibody generated against glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of CD1d (31Kim H.S. Garcia J. Exley M. Johnson K.W. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9289-9295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of Dr. Steven Balk (Beth Israel Medical Center, Boston, MA). The D5 antibody was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. 51.1.3 is a mouse anti-human CD1d mAb raised against an Fc-fusion protein of CD1d (32Exley M. Garcia J. Balk S.P. Porcelli S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and was the kind gift of Dr. Steve Porcelli (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). OKT3, OKT8, and W6/32 are hybridomas obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) that produce monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD8, and a nonpolymorphic domain of class I MHC, respectively. 2 × 107intestinal epithelial cells were washed, resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI medium with 1 unit of phosphoinositol phospholipase C (Sigma) and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. gp180 has previously been shown to exist in two forms: a GPI-anchored, apically sorted form and a transmembrane basolateral form (29Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12786-12792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g, and the cells and supernatant were analyzed for released gp180 (GPI-anchored form) through cell staining and Western blot. The CD1d-GST fusion protein was constructed using the α1-α3 domains of CD1d in a pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (33Colgan S.P. Morales V.M. Madara J.L. Polischuk J.E. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C276-C283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For large scale preparations of CD1d-GST fusion protein, 10 ml of transformed bacteria grown freshly overnight was inoculated into 500 ml of LB medium with ampicillin selection. This was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. After adding 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the bacterial culture was grown for an additional 4 h. The culture was spun in a Sorvall centrifuge for 10 min at 3000 × g at room temperature and resuspended in 6 ml of STE buffer (10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). It was then spun for 10 min at 1500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 24 ml of 100 μg/ml lysozyme in STE along with protease inhibitors (0.1 mg/ml PMSF and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 15 min prior to adding 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1.5% sarkosyl in STE. Bacterial cell walls were broken using a tissue homogenizer for 15 min, and pellets were obtained by spinning in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 23,500 × g for 30 min. After adding 4% Triton X-100 (v/v), 2.5 ml of glutathione agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated with the lysate for 2 h at 4 °C on an orbital rocker. The beads were spun down, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and washed 6–8 times with 1 ml of cold PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v). The final wash was with PBS alone, and CD1d-GST protein was eluted by rocking at 4 °C for 10 min in 0.75 ml of elution buffer (75 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v)) containing 100 mm reduced glutathione. The supernatant (eluant) was saved, and another 200 μl of elution buffer was added to elute the remaining fusion protein. When the eluate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie, a single band at 65 kDa was seen, the approximate mass of the CD1d-GST fusion protein. T cells and intestinal epithelial cells were resuspended to achieve a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml in 0.1% bovine serum albumin-RPMI 1640 medium (w/v). Cells were prewarmed in a 37 °C water bath. For each reaction, one million T cells were placed in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 5 s. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was loosened. One million intestinal epithelial, FO-1 D5, or untransfected FO-1 cells were mixed with the T cells, spun quickly for 20 s, and placed in a 37 °C water bath. After 1, 2, or 5 min, 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (PBS with 10 mm sodium orthovanadate) (Sigma) was added. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20% PBS, 80% dH2O, 100 mm Na2VO3, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) (Sigma) and vortexed 20 times at the start and end of a 30-min incubation on ice. As a positive control, one million T cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD8 antibody (OKT8) for 30 min at 4 °C and cross-linked with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody for 2 min at 37 °C. Time zero tubes were prepared by adding stop buffer to individual tubes containing T cells and either epithelial, FO-1 D5, or untransfected cells. The lysate from these two tubes were then combined into one tube to account for all constitutive kinases and substrates in both cell types. In some experiments, the lysates from these co-culture conditions were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-human p59fyn or rabbit anti-human p56lck antibody, which was covalently bound to Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). These conjugated antibodies were rotated with co-culture lysates (precleared with rabbit serum-coated Sepharose 4B beads) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with PBS, and 75 μl of reducing buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 5% 2-ME, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS) was added prior to boiling for 5 min. The resulting samples were then run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Schleicher & Schuell Inc., Keene, NH). A mAb 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) Western blot was then performed. In other experiments, lysates of intestinal epithelial cells were immunoprecipitated with murine anti-gp180 mAb B9, IgG1 (isotype control), or the anti-class I mAb W6/32 (negative control) to determine whether an association between CD1d and gp180 existed. Protein A-Sepharose beads were coated with 10 μg/ml rabbit IgG anti-mouse immunoglobulin followed by primary antibody (isotype control, anti-gp180, or anti-class I MHC). Each of these steps was performed for 1 h at room temperature while rotating. The beads were then washed thoroughly with wash buffer (2 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5m EDTA, 4 m NaCl), and the epithelial cell lysate was rotated with the coated beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with RIP buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mNaCl, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin, and 0.02% sodium azide) and resolved on SDS-PAGE. After transferring to nitrocellulose, an anti-CD1d (D5) mAb followed by an anti-gp180 (B9) mAb Western blot was performed. When kinase assays were performed, beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm MnCl2, 50 mmTris, pH 7.4) and mixed with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of 4× reducing buffer (as described previously) and boiling for 5 min. A 10% SDS-PAGE gel was prepared, and one million cell equivalents of protein was loaded per lane. The protein was transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose paper and blocked with 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with 1 μg/ml of primary antibody (4G10, B9, D5, or isotype control) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with PBS several times and incubated in 1 μg/ml of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Cappel, Durham, NC) antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed thoroughly with wash buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20) prior to development using enzyme-linked chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products) reagent. gp180 was purified using a B9 affinity column and diluted in coating buffer (dH20, 0.015 m Na2CO3, 0.03 mNaHCO3, 3 mm NaN3). An optimal dilution of gp180 (4 × 105 cell equivalents) was used to coat 96-well Nunc ELISA plates at 4 °C, overnight. The plates were washed five times with 100 μl/well of ELISA buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, 1 μg/ml CD1d-GST fusion protein or GST alone was added to the plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were then washed five times. Binding was detected by incubating the plates with 5 μg/ml mouse anti-GST antibody for 1 h followed by 1 h of incubation with 10 μg/ml HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody. After 100 μl of HRP substrate (dH2O, 0.2 m NaPO4, 0.2 m Na2PO4, 0.001% H2O2, 2 mm phenol, 1.2 mm 4-aminoantipyrine) was added, the plate was read by a Genetic Systems microplate ELISA reader at 490 nm. Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated as described, and 1 × 105 cells per condition were stained in a V-bottom 96-well plate. The cells were washed three times with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The intestinal epithelial cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml isotype control mAb (murine IgG1 or murine IgG2b), 10 μg/ml mouse IgG1 anti-gp180 (B9), or 10 μg/ml mouse IgG2b anti-CD1d (D5) monoclonal antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed several times and incubated with 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and resuspended in 400 μl of PBS. The percentage of positive cells and mean fluorescence were analyzed by an Epics Profile III flow cytometer. Our previous studies have shown that co-culturing IECs with PBTs results in the activation of the TCR-associated p59fyn and CD8-associated p56lck tyrosine kinases. Purified gp180 was found to be responsible for the activation of the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck but not p59fyn (29Yio X.Y. Mayer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12786-12792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, hypothesized that another molecule might associate with gp180 and interact with the TCR. Because anti-CD1d antibodies have been shown to inhibit IEC-induced proliferation of CD8+ T cells, CD1d was an eligible candidate to aid gp180 in the activation of CD8+ T cells. Thus, the hypothesis that gp180 associates with CD1d was studied. Initial studies were performed to confirm that normal IECs express both gp180 and CD1d on their surface. 1 × 105 cells per condition were stained with B9, D5, and appropriate isotype controls to confirm cell surface expression of gp180 and CD1d, respectively. The cells were analyzed by an Epics Profile III flow cytometer. Fig.1 A illustrates that freshly isolated intestinal epithelial cells do express both of these molecules. A co-immunoprecipitation study was then performed using these same freshly isolated intestinal epithelial cells (data not shown) or HT29 cells. An intestinal epithelial cell lysate was prepared by lysing 1 × 107 intestinal epithelial cells in lysis buffer containing 1% digitonin. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with a murine IgG2b mAb isotype control or mAb D5. An anti-gp180 (B9) followed by an anti-CD1d (D5) Western blot was then performed. Fig. 1 B documents the association of gp180 (180 kDa) and CD1d (37 kDa). The D5 mAb immunoprecipitated a 180-kDa band consistent with gp180 (Fig. 1 B, left panel, right lane), as well as a doublet at 37-kDa (right panel, right lane), consistent with the form of CD1d isolated from intestinal epithelial cells (24Somnay-Wadgaonkar K. Musrat A. Kim H.S. Canchis W.P. Balk S.P. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Balk S.P. Burke S. Polischuk J.E. Franz M.E. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S. Science. 1994; 265: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed when 3C11 and 1H1 monoclonal antibodies were used (data not shown). Although this figure provides data with intestinal epithelial cells lysed in a digitonin based lysis buffer, there appeared to be no difference in intestinal epithelial cells lysed with either Nonidet P-40 or Brij 97 (data not shown). Thus, the interaction between gp180 and CD1d appeared to be quite strong. In addition, it appears that neither gp180 nor CD1d co-precipitated with the conventional restriction element class I MHC (data not shown). In order to confirm these findings more directly, an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay was performed. An optimal concentration (4 × 105 cell equivalents) of gp180 was used to coat ELISA plates, and 1 μg/ml CD1d-GST or control proteins were added to the wells. A mouse anti-GST antibody (5 μg/ml) was then added followed by a HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody to detect binding. As seen in Fig. 2, the CD1d-GST fusion protein bound gp180 to a significantly greater extent in comparison to the control GST protein. Thus, by two experimental approaches, CD1d appeared to be capable of associating with gp180. Initial experiments conducted in our laboratory suggested that CD1d was not involved in the activation of CD8-associated p56lck in IEC-T cell co-cultures. This was determined by mAb inhibition studies in which neither the 3C11 mAb nor 1H1 mAb inhibited IEC activation of p56lck. However, in order to confirm that CD1d was not involved in the activation of p56lck more directly, FO-1 cells stably transfected with human CD1d cDNA (FO-1 D5) were co-cultured with peripheral blood T cells for varying incubation periods (0, 2, and 5 min). The reactions were stopped with cold lysis buffer. The T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mouse IgG anti-human p56lck antibody, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and an anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot was performed. In this experiment (Fig.3 A), no phosphorylation of the CD8-associated protein tyrosine kinase p56lck was seen. As a control, untransfected FO-1 cells were cultured with peripheral blood T cells and subjected to the same conditions as the FO-1 D5 cells. In order to document that the CD1d expressed by the transfectant was functional, we utilized the same cell lysates to determine whether CD1d could activate the TCR-associated kinase p59fyn. FO-1 D5 cells were co-cultured with peripheral blood T cells for varying incubation periods (0, 2, and 5 min) in the presence or absence of the mouse IgG anti-human CD1d mAb, D5. As a control, untransfected FO-1 cells were cultured with peripheral blood T cells and subjected to the same conditions as the FO-1 D5 cells. All reactions were stopped with cold lysis buffer. The T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human p59fyn antibody, and an anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot was performed. As seen in Fig. 3 B, phosphorylation of p59fyn was readily seen with FO-1 D5-T cell co-cultures, which was blocked by the monoclonal antibody D5. FO-1 cells do not express either CD1d or gp180, thus explaining the inability of this cell line to activate p56lck or p59fyn. In addition, the ability of FO-1 D5 cells to activate p59fyn indicates that CD1d is fu"
https://openalex.org/W2041589035,"SH2-B has been shown to be required for nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neuronal differentiation and survival, associate with NGF receptor TrkA, and be tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to NGF. In this work, we examined whether NGF stimulates phosphorylation of SH2-B on serines/threonines. NGF promotes a dramatic upward shift in mobility of SH2-B, resulting in multiple forms that cannot be attributed to tyrosyl phosphorylation. Treatment of SH2-B with protein phosphatase 2A, a serine/threonine phosphatase, reduces the many forms to two. PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, dramatically inhibits NGF-promoted phosphorylation of SH2-B on serines/threonines, whereas depletion of 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-sensitive protein kinase Cs does not. ERKs 1 and 2 phosphorylate SH2-Bβ primarily on Ser-96 in vitro. However, NGF still stimulates serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ(S96A). SH2-Bβ(S96A), like wild-type SH2-Bβ, enhances NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. In contrast, SH2-Bβ(R555E) containing a defective SH2 domain blocks NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and displays greatly reduced phosphorylation on serines/threonines in response to NGF. SH2-Bβ(R555E), like wild-type SH2-Bβ, associates with the plasma membrane, suggesting that the dominant negative effect of SH2-Bβ(R555E) cannot be explained by an abnormal subcellular distribution. In summary, NGF stimulates phosphorylation of SH2-B on serines/threonines by kinases downstream of MEK, which may be important for NGF-mediated neuronal differentiation and survival. SH2-B has been shown to be required for nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neuronal differentiation and survival, associate with NGF receptor TrkA, and be tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to NGF.

ERKs 1 and 2 phosphorylate SH2-Bβ primarily on Ser-96 in vitro. However, NGF still stimulates serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ(S96A). SH2-Bβ(S96A), like wild-type SH2-Bβ, enhances NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. In contrast, SH2-Bβ(R555E) containing a defective SH2 domain blocks NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and displays greatly reduced phosphorylation on serines/threonines in response to NGF. SH2-Bβ(R555E), like wild-type SH2-Bβ, associates with the plasma membrane, suggesting that the dominant negative effect of SH2-Bβ(R555E) cannot be explained by an abnormal subcellular distribution. In summary, NGF stimulates phosphorylation of SH2-B on serines/threonines by kinases downstream of MEK, which may be important for NGF-mediated neuronal differentiation and survival. nerve growth factor rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line Src homology pleckstrin homology protein kinase C 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protein phosphatase 2A green fluorescent protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase epidermal growth factor glutathione S-transferase anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 Neurotrophins, including NGF,1 brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4/5, and neurotrophin-6, play a crucial role in differentiation, survival, and plasticity of developing neurons.

These observations suggest that serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins by the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays an essential role in NGF signaling. SH2-B, a recently described adapter protein containing SH2 and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (27Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell.

Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

Zhang Y. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). NGF promotes tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-B in primary sympathetic neurons (15Qian X. Riccio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and PC12 cells overexpressing TrkA or SH2-B (16Rui L. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). NGF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-B was also observed in untransfected PC12 cells but only in the presence of a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (16Rui L. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that any phosphorylated tyrosines in SH2-B are rapidly dephosphorylated. In addition to its 9 tyrosines, SH2-Bβ has a large number of serines (82 serines) and threonines (29 threonines) including many that lie within consensus sequences for phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C, ERKs 1 and 2, cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, and casein kinase II. We previously reported that platelet-derived growth factor stimulates phosphorylation of SH2-B on serines/threonines as well as on tyrosines (28Rui L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21239-21245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the kinase(s) that phosphorylate SH2-B on serines/threonines are unknown. In this study, we provide strong evidence that NGF stimulates phosphorylation of SH2-B on multiple serines/threonines by MEK or kinases downstream of MEK. ERKs 1 and 2 phosphorylate SH2-Bβ primarily on Ser-96 in vitro, but SH2-Bβ(S96A) is still phosphorylated on multiple serines/threonines in cells in response to NGF and enhances NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. These findings indicate that kinase(s) downstream of MEK, other than ERKs 1 and 2, phosphorylate SH2-B and that phosphorylation of Ser-96 by ERKs 1 and 2 is not required for its action in NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth. A dominant negative SH2-Bβ(R555E), which is unable to bind to TrkA, exhibits a profound defect in its serine/threonine phosphorylation, suggesting that association with TrkA and/or subsequent tyrosyl phosphorylation by TrkA may be a prerequisite for serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-B in response to NGF.

PC12 cells and stable cell lines derived from PC12 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 5% fetal bovine serum. The confluent cells were deprived of serum overnight using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and were treated for various times with NGF at 37 °C at the indicated concentrations. The cells were then rinsed three times with ice-cold PBSV (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4), solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was utilized for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. PC12 cells were transfected with plasmids (pEGFP-C1) encoding GFP, GFP-SH2-Bβ, GFP-SH2-Bβ (S96A), or GFP-SH2-Bβ (R555E), using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. After 72 h growth in regular medium, the transfectants were cultured for 50 additional days in medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. The G418-resistant transfectants were pooled, and the top 2% of cells in terms of expression of GFP fluorescence was selected by flow cytometry. Cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibody on ice for 2 h. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose (50 μl) during 1-h incubation at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA) and boiled for 5 min in a mixture (80:20) of lysis buffer and SDS-PAGE sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). The solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (5–12% gradient or 7.5% gels). Proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibody using ECL. Some membranes were then incubated at 55 °C for 30–60 min in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7). The membranes were then immunoblotted with the desired antibody. In some cases, the blots were reprobed with a second antibody without stripping. PC12 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 10 min, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αSH2-B. The immunoprecipitates were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with 40 units of alkaline phosphatase in 100 μl of dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) in the presence or absence of 5 mm Na3VO4. The reaction was terminated, and proteins were eluted by boiling in a mixture (80:20) of lysis buffer and SDS-PAGE sample buffer. As controls, the immunoprecipitates were treated identically except no alkaline phosphatase was added. The resultant dephosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with αSH2-B. PC12 cells were untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml NGF or EGF for 10 min and lysed as described above. ERKs 1 and 2 were immunoprecipitated with αERK2 (recognizing both ERKs 1 and 2) from the cell lysates. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, αERK2 immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 10 μg of GST fusion protein containing SH2-Bβ or SH2-Bβ (S96A) in kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm Na3VO4). GST fusion proteins containing SH2-Bβ or SH2-Bβ (S96A) were prepared as described previously (27Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the in vitro kinase assay, the GST fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads. SH2-Bβ or SH2-Bβ (S96A) was released from the beads by incubation at 30 °C for 40 min with 10 units of thrombin in digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). Isolated wild-type or mutant SH2-Bβ was resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was subjected to autoradiography and then immunoblotted with αSH2-B. The confluent PC12 cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBSV, scraped from plates in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and subjected to sonication on ice for 50 s. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant contained the cytosol. The pellet (designated the membrane fraction) was resuspended in lysis buffer. Confocal imaging was performed with a Noran OZ laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a × 60 Nikon objective. GFP was excited at 488 nm by a krypton-argon laser, and fluorescence above 500 nm was captured. Cells were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips attached to the bottom of a 60-mm culture dish and imaged at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (128 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaHPO4, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The contribution of cellular autofluorescence was judged to be less than 1%. The presented images are representative of at least three separate experiments. We have shown previously that NGF stimulates a large shift in mobility of SH2-B as well as tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-B when PC12 cells overexpress TrkA or SH2-B or are pretreated with Na3VO4, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (16Rui L. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test whether serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-B contributes to the NGF-induced shift in mobility of SH2-B, PC12 cells were treated with NGF in the absence of Na3VO4. SH2-B was immunoprecipitated with αSH2-B and immunoblotted with αPY. No detectable tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-B was observed using this experimental paradigm in either control or NGF-treated cells (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2), as reported previously (15Qian X. Riccio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Rui L. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, NGF still stimulated a dramatic shift in mobility of SH2-B, generating multiple forms of SH2-B with different migrations (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4). These data suggest that the NGF-induced shift in mobility of SH2-B is due to phosphorylation of SH2-B on multiple serine(s)/threonine(s). To verify that the NGF-reduced change in migration of SH2-B is caused by phosphorylation, αSH2-B precipitates were treated with alkaline phosphatase, a nonspecific protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphotyrosines, phosphoserines, and phosphothreonines. Alkaline phosphatase treatment reduced the multiple forms of SH2-B observed in NGF-treated cells to primarily a faster migrating form (Fig. 1 B, lane 2 versus 4) that co-migrated with the band seen in cells not incubated with NGF (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). Sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase, abolished the effect of alkaline phosphatase on SH2-B migration (data not shown), indicating that the change of migration of SH2-B by alkaline phosphatase is caused by dephosphorylation. To confirm that the NGF-dependent phosphorylation of SH2-B is primarily on multiple serines/threonines, αSH2-B precipitates were treated with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that dephosphorylates only phosphoserines and phosphothreonines (28Rui L. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21239-21245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol.

Rundell K. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1996-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PP2A treatment of SH2-B from NGF-treated cells reduced the multiple forms of SH2-B to two distinct forms (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus 6), with the majority co-migrating with SH2-B from control cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). The small portion of the slower migrating SH2-B (Fig. 1 B, lane 6) may represent tyrosyl-phosphorylated SH2-B whose phosphotyrosine(s) cannot be detected with αPY or SH2-B phosphorylated on specific serine(s)/threonine(s) that are resistant to PP2A. Okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of PP2A, blocked the effect of PP2A on the NGF-induced mobility shift of SH2-B (data not shown). These results indicate that the NGF-induced shift in mobility of SH2-B is primarily caused by phosphorylation of SH2-B on serines and/or threonines. The presence of multiple forms of SH2-B in response to NGF suggests that SH2-B is phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to NGF. The upward shift in mobility of SH2-B was detected within 1 min of NGF treatment, was maximal within 15 min, and decreased after 30 min of NGF treatment (Fig. 1 C, upper panel). A residual upward shift in mobility of SH2-B was maintained through 2 h (Fig. 1 C, upper panel). A mobility shift of SH2-Bβ was detectable at concentrations of NGF as low as 1 ng/ml and reached a maximum at 25 ng/ml (Fig. 1 C, lower panel). These data suggest that NGF-stimulated serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-B is rapid and transient. NGF activates MEK, a kinase that plays an essential role in NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (22Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J.

Interestingly, overexpression of SH2-Bβ, which has been shown to enhance NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (16Rui L. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was unable to overcome the inhibition of NGF-induced neuronal differentiation by the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 2 d), raising the possibility that phosphorylation of SH2-B by kinases within the MEK/ERK cascade may be involved in regulation of neurite outgrowth in response to NGF. To determine whether MEK plays a role in NGF-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-B, PC12 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 100 μm PD98059 prior to stimulation with 50 ng/ml NGF for 10 min. SH2-B was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with αSH2-B. PD98059 substantially, but not completely, inhibited the NGF-induced shift in mobility of SH2-B (Fig.3 A, top panel, lane 2 versus 3), suggesting that MEK is required for a substantial portion of the NGF-induced phosphorylation of SH2-B. Similarly, inhibition of the NGF-induced shift in mobility of SH2-B by PD98059 was also observed when cell lysates were immunoblotted with αSH2-B (Fig. 3 A, middle panel, lane 2 versus 3). As expected, NGF stimulated activation of ERKs 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, lane 2) as revealed by immunoblotting cell lysates with an antibody that recognizes the dual phosphorylated, active form of ERKs 1 and 2. PD98059 treatment inhibited substantially, but not completely, NGF-induced activation of ERKs 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, lane 2 versus 3). Therefore, the residual serine/threonine phosphorylation of SH2-B after PD98059 treatment may be dependent on MEK. Because multiple isoforms of PKC are proposed to play a role in NGF signaling (34Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Soh Y. Ewald S.J. White K.R. Lloyd E.D. Olivier A. Parker P.J.

Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we also examined whether PMA-sensitive PKCs are involved in NGF-induced phosphorylation of SH2-B. PMA, a robust activator of multiple isoforms of conventional PKCs (38Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), stimulated a mobility shift of SH2-B in PC12 cells (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lane 1 versus 2). PMA also stimulated activation of ERKs 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 B, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2), consistent with the previous observations that PKC activates the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (39Hoshino M. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4878-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 40Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J.

Therefore, it is unclear whether PKC activated by PMA phosphorylates SH2-B directly or indirectly via MEK or kinases downstream of MEK. Chronic PMA pretreatment abolished the ability of PMA to activate ERKs 1 and 2 (Fig. 3 B, lower pan"
https://openalex.org/W2125878220,"The EPR and thermodynamic properties of semiquinone (SQ) species stabilized by mammalian succinate:quinone reductase (SQR) in situ in the mitochondrial membrane and in the isolated enzyme have been well documented. The equivalent semiquinones in bacterial membranes have not yet been characterized, either in SQR or quinol:fumarate reductase (QFR) in situ. In this work, we describe an EPR-detectable QFR semiquinone using Escherichia coli mutant QFR (FrdC E29L) and the wild-type enzyme. The SQ exhibits a g = 2.005 signal with a peak-to-peak line width of ∼1.1 milliteslas at 150 K, has a midpoint potential (Em(pH 7.2)) of −56.6 mV, and has a stability constant of ∼1.2 × 10−2 at pH 7.2. It shows extremely fast spin relaxation behavior with a P1/2 value of ≫500 milliwatts at 150 K, which closely resembles the previously described SQ species (SQs) in mitochondrial SQR. This SQ species seems to be present also in wild-type QFR, but its stability constant is much lower, and its signal intensity is near the EPR detection limit around neutral pH. In contrast to mammalian SQR, the membrane anchor of E. coli QFR lacks heme; thus, this prosthetic group can be excluded as a spin relaxation enhancer. The trinuclear iron-sulfur cluster FR3 in the [3Fe-4S]1+ state is suggested as the dominant spin relaxation enhancer of the SQFR spins in this enzyme. E. coli QFR activity and the fast relaxing SQ species observed in the mutant enzyme are sensitive to the inhibitor 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). In wild-type E. coli QFR, HQNO causes EPR spectral line shape perturbations of the iron-sulfur cluster FR3. Similar spectral line shape changes of FR3 are caused by the FrdC E29L mutation, without addition of HQNO. This indicates that the SQ and the inhibitor-binding sites are located in close proximity to the trinuclear iron-sulfur cluster FR3. The data further suggest that this site corresponds to the proximal quinone-binding site in E. coli QFR.

Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). They consist of two well conserved subunits protruding from the membrane. A larger flavoprotein subunit (denoted Fp) harbors the dicarboxylate-binding site and a covalently bound FAD cofactor; a smaller iron-sulfur protein subunit (denoted Ip) contains three distinct iron-sulfur clusters. The [2Fe-2S]2+,1+, [4Fe-4S]2+,1+, and [3Fe-4S]1+,0 clusters are called S1 or FR1, S2 or FR2, and S3 or FR3 in SQR and QFR, respectively. The membrane anchor domain of the enzyme is more variable and may consist of one or two hydrophobic polypeptides (SdhC/FrdC and SdhD/FrdD) and contain zero, one, or two b hemes depending on the enzyme species. When two hemes are present, they are denoted heme bH and heme bL. The primary sequence similarity is also much lower in this part of the enzyme. Nevertheless, accumulated evidence indicates that the membrane anchors have a conserved general structure (3Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 4Hägerhäll C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). One exception is a group of SQRs lacking the membrane domain and instead containing two different, more or less hydrophilic subunits (5Janssen S.G., S. Anemuller S. Moll R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5560-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The membrane-bound enzymes catalyze the oxidation of succinate or the reduction of fumarate in the bacterial cytoplasm or mitochondrial matrix and the reduction or oxidation of quinone/quinol in the membrane. It should be emphasized that when provided with suitable substrates in vitro, SQRs and QFRs generally can carry out both reactions; however, in vivo, they serve separate physiological functions. Thus, organisms capable of both aerobic and anaerobic life contain genes encoding both enzymes that are expressed during different growth conditions. There are three functionally distinct classes of SQR/QFR defined by the type of quinones that they use as electron acceptors/donors. Class 1 SQRs donate electrons to a quinone with a higher redox midpoint potential (Em) such as ubiquinone, whereas Class 2 QFRs and Class 3 SQRs use a quinone with a lower Em such as menaquinone (3Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). How the directionality of the enzyme reaction is achieved in vivo is not well understood, particularly for the Class 3 enzymes, but it is clear that the Em values of the iron-sulfur clusters are differently tuned in the enzymes of a different functional class.The presence of two quinone-binding sites on the membrane anchor, located toward opposite sides of the membrane, has been demonstrated in SQR/QFR enzymes by various methods. Both membrane anchor polypeptides of Bos taurus SQR were photolabeled with [3H]arylazidoquinone derivatives (6Yu C.-A. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6127-6131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In subsequent labeling studies using the same enzyme, two peptide regions, one in SdhC and the other in SdhD, were assigned as quinone-binding sites (7Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,8Shenoy S.K., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, the N-terminal part of SdhC from Escherichia coli SQR was photoaffinity-labeled with a [3H]azidoquinone analogue (9Yang X., Yu, L. He D. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31916-31923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies of the E. coli QFR membrane anchor polypeptides also outlined two quinone-binding regions (10Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that overlap both with peptide stretches indicated in the bovine enzyme and with the stretch implied in bacterial SQR (see Fig. 1). This corroborates the structural similarity between the heme-less and the heme-containing membrane anchors. Apparently, extensive sequence variability is tolerated at the quinone-binding sites, but their location in the protein is nevertheless conserved. There is a quinone-binding region formed by amino acid residues from SdhCD/FrdCD located near the bacterial cytoplasmic or mitochondrial matrix side of the membrane. This region is referred to as Q-proximal (previously denoted QB), whereas an additional quinone-binding area located farther from the Fp and Ip subunits and near the other side of the membrane is termed Q-distal (or QA).There are a number of inhibitors that interfere with the interaction of SQR/QFR with quinones. The most well known are 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), 3-methylcarboxin, and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). Sensitivity to these inhibitors varies among species and SQR/QFR enzyme types. The two former compounds exhibit some structural similarity and are specific inhibitors (11Mowery P.C. Ackrell B.A. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Mowery P.C. Steenkamp D.J. Ackrell A.C. Singer T.P. White G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas HQNO also inhibits various other enzymes interacting with quinones (13Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 249-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Studies with resistant mutants of Ustilago maydis (14Broomfield P.L.E. Hargreaves J.A. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and Paracoccus denitrificans (15Matsson M. Ackrell B.A.C. Cochran B. Hederstedt L. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) indicate that the carboxin-binding site overlaps with Q-proximal and that amino acids from both Ip (in fact, a residue within the cluster S3 ligation motif) and SdhD contribute to carboxin binding. Close proximity of S3 and the inhibitor-binding site is also apparent from the Em shift of cluster S3 in pigeon heart submitochondrial particles (16Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and bovine heart submitochondrial particles (17Salerno J.C. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) caused by TTFA.E. coli QFR and Bacillus subtilis SQR, both of which use menaquinone as an electron donor/acceptor, are not sensitive to carboxins or to TTFA, but are sensitive to HQNO (with apparent Ki values of 0.2 and 0.4 μm, respectively (18Hägerhäll C. On the Structure and Function of Succinate: Quinone Oxidoreductase Using Bacillus subtilis as a Model Organism.Ph.D. thesis. University of Lund, Lund, Sweden1994Google Scholar); the former at pH 7.8 and the latter at pH 7.5). 2Maklashina, E., and Cecchini, G. (1999)Arch. Biochem. Biophys., in press.2Maklashina, E., and Cecchini, G. (1999)Arch. Biochem. Biophys., in press. Both studies show that the apparent Ki increases with increasing pH. In B. subtilis SQR as well as in isolated SdhC polypeptide, HQNO binding causes a shift in the EPR spectrum line shape and induces a shift in the Em of heme bL by about −60 mV, without affecting the heme bH properties (19Smirnova I. Hägerhäll C. Konstantinov A. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 3V. Borisov, I. Smirnova, C. Hägerhäll, A. Konstantinov, and L. Hederstedt, manuscript in preparation.3V. Borisov, I. Smirnova, C. Hägerhäll, A. Konstantinov, and L. Hederstedt, manuscript in preparation. This demonstrates that the HQNO-binding site in B. subtilis SQR is located in the vicinity of heme bL, i.e. that it corresponds to Q-distal. It has also been shown that HQNO elicits a significant change in the EPR line shape of E. coli FR3, indicating the close proximity of the quinone-binding site and iron-sulfur cluster (20Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Such EPR line shape changes were not detected in the B. subtilis enzyme (21Hägerhäll C. Fridén H. Aasa R. Hederstedt L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11080-11089Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Hägerhäll C. Sled V.D. Hederstedt L. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in the presence of HQNO.In mammalian mitochondria, multiple EPR signals at g = 2.04, 1.99, and 1.96 arising from spin-spin interactions were observed at temperatures <15 K (23Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Schepler K.L. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2886-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These spin-coupled split signals were absent in ubiquinone-depleted membranes and reappeared in ubiquinone-replenished membranes, indicating that one of the interacting partners was a semiquinone (SQ). Spectral simulations suggested a semiquinone (either semiquinone or flavosemiquinone) spin-spin interaction overlapped with the cluster S3 signal (23Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Schepler K.L. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2886-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). If the spin-coupled split signals were assumed to arise only from dipole-dipole interaction, the distance between the interacting spins was estimated to <7.7 Å (23Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Schepler K.L. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2886-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Ingledew and Ohnishi (16Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Salerno and Ohnishi (17Salerno J.C. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) showed that these split signals arise from a semiquinone anion (Q⨪iQ⨪i) pair, based on detailed EPR and thermodynamic analysis of the rapidly relaxing Q⨪sg = 2.00 signal and the spin-coupled split signals. Both Q⨪s and the Q⨪Q⨪ pair are sensitive to the SQR-specific inhibitors carboxin and TTFA. The spin-coupled Q⨪ pair have similar Em values:Em1 (Q⨪/Q) and Em2 (QH2/Q⨪) = 140 and 80 mV, respectively, which correspond to a stability constant (KS) of 10. This is many orders of magnitude greater than the KS of the quinone pool, indicating a preferential binding of Q⨪ relative to Q and QH2(Table I). Similar spin-spin interaction signals have been observed in mitochondria from various plants (24Rich P.R. Moore A.L. Ingledew W.J. Bonner Jr., W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 462: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the fungus Neurospora crassa (25Rich P.R. Bonner Jr., W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 504: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Neither semiquinone nor the spin-coupled split EPR signals have previously been directly demonstrated in bacterial SQR and QFR enzymes, although recent results based on spectral simulations suggest the presence of a similar semiquinone pair in P. denitrificans SQR (26Waldeck A.R. Stowell M.H. Lee H.K. Hung S.-C. Matsson M. Hederstedt L. Ackrell B.C. Chan S.I. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab In this work, we describe an EPR-detectable thermodynamically stabilized semiquinone in E. coli QFR using an FrdC E29L mutant (10Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The semiquinone is sensitive to HQNO and demonstrates extremely fast spin relaxation behavior, similar to the previously described Q⨪s g = 2.00 signal of mitochondrial SQR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in contrast to B. subtilis SQR, in E. coli QFR, HQNO interacts with the proximal quinone-binding site. The SQ species is also found in wild-type QFR, but has a much lower KS and is detectable only in the higher pH range.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe E. coli strains, plasmids, and phage used in this study have been previously described (10Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain higher expression levels of the mutant forms of QFR discussed in this work, it was necessary to reconstruct the frdC mutations that had been previously made using a low copy number, i.e. two-plasmid expression system (10Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the in vitro mutagenesis system from Bio-Rad based on the method developed by Kunkel (27Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar) and Kunkel et al. (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar) using single-stranded M13 DNA containing the frdCD genes as template. Oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized on a Biosearch Model 8700 nucleic acid synthesizer to change the nucleotides in frdC encoding Glu-29, His-82, and Trp-86 to codons for the selected amino acid substitutions. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using the dideoxy termination procedure (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52355) Google Scholar) and a Ladderman DNA sequencing kit (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI). Following mutagenesis, the 1070-base pair Dra III-Xho I fragment containing the desired mutation was cloned into plasmid pH3 (30Blaut M. Whittaker K. Valdovinos A. Ackrell B.A. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13599-13604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to restore the complete frdABCD operon with the desired mutation. Plasmids containing the mutations were then transformed into strain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD sdhC::kan) (10Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to give high level expression of membrane-bound QFR. E. coli strain DW35 cells containing pH3 plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant forms of QFR were grown anaerobically on glucose/fumarate medium as described previously (31Cecchini G. Thompson C.R. Ackrell B.A. Westenberg D.J. Dean N. Gunsalus R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in the early stationary phase of growth, and the membrane fraction was prepared from a French pressure cell lysate as described previously (32Werth M.T. Cecchini G. Manodori A. Ackrell B.A.C. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Johnson M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8965-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Redox titrations were performed at room temperature (25 °C) in an airtight vessel flushed with oxygen-free argon and equipped with a magnetic stirring device, an Ag/AgCl-platinum combination electrode, and a pH electrode essentially as described (33Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The redox potential of the reference electrode was calibrated versus a saturated solution of quinhydrone (285 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode at pH 7). The following redox mediators, dissolved in H2O (indigo dyes) or Me2SO, were used at 25–50 μm final concentrations: 5,5′-indigodisulfonate (−125 mV), 5,5′,7-indigotrisulfonate (−80 mV), 5,5′,7,7′-indigotetrasulfonate (−46 mV), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (−152 mV), 1,4-naphthoquinone-2-sulfonate (+113 mV), 1,4-naphthoquinone (+50 mV), and duroquinone (+7 mV). In total, <0.15% Me2SO was added. Reductive titrations were carried out by stepwise addition of an anaerobic sodium dithionite solution, and samples were transferred anaerobically to EPR tubes, frozen in a cold mixture of isopentane/methylcyclohexane (5:1) at about −80 °C, and stored in liquid nitrogen until EPR analyses. The relative concentration of the intermediate SQ form (y) as a function of the ambient redox potential (Eh) is described by Equation 1,y=11+10(Eh−Em1/0)/59+10(Em2/1−Eh)/59Equation 1 where Em1/0 and Em2/1 are Em values of two consecutive 1-electron transfer steps. Alternatively, membranes were poised at different ambient Eh values using the substrate couple succinate/fumarate (1:1) at a 20 mm total concentration under argon by changing the ambient pH in the absence of redox mediator dyes. The same titration vessel and setup as for the potentiometric titration were used. The pH, initially 6.0, was gradually altered by small additions of 5 m NaOH and, when approaching a pH of ∼9.5, was followed by similar additions of 5m HCl. EPR samples were taken 5 min after each addition to ensure equilibrium and were frozen and stored as before. In both cases, the E. coli membranes were suspended in 50 mmBisTris and 3 mm EDTA (pH as indicated) at 25 mg/ml membrane protein. At this protein concentration, the membranes routinely contained 32 ± 5 μm QFR, based on spin quantitation of the iron-sulfur cluster FR1. HQNO, when present, was added at ∼5:1 stoichiometry (150 μm). Protein was determined as described (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spin quantitation under non-power-saturated conditions was performed as described (35Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar) using 0.5 mm CuEDTA as a standard. EPR spectra were recorded using an X-band Bruker ESP-300E EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 helium flow cryostat. Other EPR conditions were as indicated in the figure legends. The power saturation data were analyzed by computer fitting to Equation 2,A=∑i=1nAi=∑i=1nCiP(1+P/P1/2(i))0.5biEquation 2 where Ai is the amplitude of the i th-type free radical, Ci is a coefficient for the actual content of the i th-type free radical in the sample, P50(i) is the half-saturation microwave power, bii is the “inhomogeneity parameter,” and n is numbers of components (36Vinogradov A.D.

Simulation of the power saturation and redox titration curves was performed using the software Origin (MicroCal Software, Inc.) using the Marquardt-Lovenberg algorithm and simplex method for nonlinear least-square fitting.RESULTSThe previous EPR studies using mammalian SQR showed that semiquinone signals were more readily detected in submitochondrial particles compared with more resolved preparations or the isolated enzyme (38Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3278-3284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Xu Y. Salerno J.C. Wei Y.H. King T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In mitochondrial and bacterial inner membranes, other free radical species are also present. SQR-specific inhibitors such as carboxin and TTFA can be used in the mammalian experimental system, but for E. coli QFR, we have no specific inhibitors available. Thus, we compared redox titrations of membranes from E. coli strain DW35, deleted of both the QFR- and SQR-encoding operons (10Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with membranes from DW35 expressing wild-type or mutant QFR. The overexpression of QFR also facilitated detection of QFR-bound semiquinone versus other unrelated free radicals in the system. In this study, attention was focused on the proximal quinone-binding site in QFR; and thus, we selected three of the most promising of the previously generated membrane anchor mutants predicted to reside in this area, i.e. FrdC E29L, H82R, and W86R (10Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).EPR analyses of cytoplasmic membranes of E. coli, poised by conventional potentiometric redox titrations, showed that a weak SQ free radical g = 2.00 signal was present in both DW35 (QFR- and SQR-deleted) membranes and DW35 membranes containing wild-type QFR. The SQ species showed Em values of approximately −30 and −50 mV, respectively, with about the same spin concentration/mg of membrane protein (data not shown). Both semiquinone signals were very slow relaxing; and in addition, neither signal was affected by HQNO.In contrast, membranes from FrdC E29L mutant QFR exhibited another SQ free radical species with much faster spin relaxation behavior (P1/2 ≫ 500 mW) 4Commercial X-band EPR spectrometers can measure to a maximum of only a 200-mW level. Although we obtained very high P1/2 values such as >500 mW by computer fitting, it means that the sample has extremely fast spin relaxation from a practical point of view. at 123 K similar to the SQs species of bovine heart SQR, in addition to the slow relaxing SQ species. Fig. 2 shows a potentiometric titration curve of the semiquinone g = 2.005 signal in the cytoplasmic membrane of the FrdC E29L mutant. SQ spectra were recorded at 5-mW microwave power to minimize the overlapping slow relaxing SQ signals. Curve-fitting computer analysis provided Em1 (SQ/Q) = −112 mV and Em2 (QH2/SQ) = +1.2 mV, which correspond to Em(pH 7.2) = −56.6 mV and a SQ stability constant (KS) of 1.2 × 10−2. Both first and second electron transfer steps were assumed as n = 1 steps. The Em value corresponds to the peak redox potential of the bell-shaped titration curve, which equals the average of Em1and Em2. This SQ signal was quenched by HQNO. The SQ g = 2.005 spectra of the sample poised near the titration peak is shown below in Fig. 4.Figure 2Potentiometric titration curves of the semiquinone g = 2.00 signal amplitude as a function of Eh, analyzed in the presence of the redox mediator dyes at pH 7.2, in E. coli E29L mutant QFR (data points from two independent titrations are shown (▴ and ▾)) and in the presence of 150 μm HQNO (♦). The bell-shaped continuous line represents a theoretical simulated titration curve with Em1 and Em2 values of −112 and +1.2 mV, respectively, corresponding to an Em of −56.6 mV. The E29L mutant membrane preparation (30 μm QFR) was titrated at 25 mg/ml protein. The titration was conducted under anaerobic conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” EPR measurements of semiquinone signals were conducted using a Varian E109 spectrometer and a Johnson Foundation cold nitrogen gas flow system under the following conditions: sample temperature, 123 K; microwave power, 5 mW; modulation amplitude, 1.0 mT; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; time constant, 0.128 s; scanning field width, 40 mT; scanning time, 4 min; and microwave frequency, 9.190 GHz.arb. units, arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4EPR spectra of semiquinones in E. coli mutant QFR (FrdC E29L).

Harrison M.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The renal collecting duct is populated by cells (α-intercalated cells and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD)1 cells) that are specialized for H+ transport (2Selvaggio A.M. Schwartz J.H. Bengele H.H. Gordon F.D. Alexander E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F391-F400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The vacuolar H+-ATPase in these cells resides in high density in vesicles and is polarized to the apical membrane (3Alper S.L. Natale J. Gluck S. Lodish H.F. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Constitutive and regulated exocytotic insertion and endocytotic retrieval of H+-ATPase containing vesicles to and from the apical plasma membrane regulate, in part, not only the density of H+-ATPase in the apical membrane but also the rate of proton transport by these cells (4Gluck S.

A reduction in the intracellular pH followed by an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+are the required stimuli that induce regulated exocytic insertion of proton pumps into the apical membrane (8Slotki I. Schwartz J.H. Alexander E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C432-C438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the exocytotic event that regulates translocation of the H+-ATPase to the apical membrane in renal acid secretory cells utilizes a mechanism for exocytosis that is similar to that described in neuronal cells. The process in neuronal cells involves the participation of a subset of highly conserved, universally present membrane proteins (v- and t-SNAREs) and soluble factors (NSF and SNAP) (9Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposal is the observation that SNARE proteins are present in renal collecting duct cells (10Nielsen S. Marples D. Birn H. Mohtashami M. Dalby N.O. Trimble M. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1834-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Mandon B. Chou C.L. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1998; 275: F131-F142PubMed Google Scholar) and our recent studies document that in cultured rat IMCD cells, H+ transport, mediated by an H+-ATPase, is inhibited by clostridial toxins (14Alexander E.A. Shih T. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1054-F1057PubMed Google Scholar). However, to date, no studies have described the exocytotic mechanisms regulating H+-ATPase insertion into the apical plasma membrane or provided direct evidence for the participation of the SNARE proteins in this process. Furthermore, the formation of a putative docking complex similar to the 20 S complex that has been described in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells (9Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) has not been demonstrated in renal epithelial cells. To characterize the mechanisms involved in IMCD trafficking of H+-ATPase and to characterize the role of SNAREs in this process, we determined the effect of clostridial toxins on cell acidification-induced translocation of both H+-ATPase and SNAREs to the apical membrane, identified the v-SNARE proteins that participate in the translocation of H+-ATPase from vesicle to apical membrane following an acid load, and isolated a complex of proteins similar to the docking complex (20 S complex) that is required for docking and fusion of the vesicles. The present study, utilizing previously characterized cultured IMCD cells (15Brion L.P. Schwartz J.H. Lachman H.M. Zavilowitz B.J. Schwartz G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F486-F501PubMed Google Scholar), provides direct evidence for the participation of SNARE proteins in H+-ATPase vesicle trafficking and elucidates an oligomeric protein complex that is comprised of the v- and t-SNAREs, NSF, SNAP, and H+-ATPase and that resembles the previously described 20 S docking complex in neuronal cells. IMCD cells were obtained from rat papillae as described previously (15Brion L.P. Schwartz J.H. Lachman H.M. Zavilowitz B.J. Schwartz G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F486-F501PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from passes 6–12 were grown to confluence in 150-cm2 plastic culture dishes in DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin and streptomycin in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Just prior to study, the confluent monolayers were incubated for 30 min in fresh DMEM containing either 25 nm clostridial toxin (BotD/TeTx (light chain)) or no toxin. Following this incubation the toxin-containing media were removed, and the monolayers were briefly washed with fresh DMEM. Toxin-free and toxin-treated monolayers had their cytosolic pH (pHi) adjusted to 7.2 or 6.5. To obtain these pHi values IMCD monolayers were initially washed with PBS to remove the DMEM from the external solution. To obtain a pHi of 7.2, the normal resting pHi of IMCD cells, monolayers were incubated for 20 min prior to harvest in NHB (110 mmNaCl, 50 mm HEPES acid, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmKH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, pH 7.2). To reduce pHito 6.6 other monolayers were incubated for 20 min in CHB. CHB is identical to NHB except that 110 mm NaCl was replaced with choline chloride and for the addition of 10 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.2). In NHB intracellular pHi has been shown to be maintained at approximately 7.2, and in CHB pHi rapidly declines to 6.5 because of reversal of the Na+/H+ exchanger and diffusion of acetic acid into the cell (16Slotki I.N. Schwartz J.H. Alexander E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F210-F217PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, cells were scraped from the plate with a plastic spatula into a homogenizing buffer consisting of CHB or NHB containing protease inhibitors 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm leupeptin. Cells were passed 20 times through a 23-gauge needle and then homogenized 10 times using a Teflon-coated Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g in a Sorvall refrigerated RC5B centrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C to pellet intact cells and large fragments. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended in homogenizing buffer, and aliquots were saved for protein determination, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot analysis. Two 100-μg aliquots of each homogenate from cells not treated with clostridial toxin, one incubated with diluent alone and the other with 25 nm TeTx (light chain), were resuspended in CHB at 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation period EDTA and EGTA (4 mm) were added to each aliquot to inactivate the toxin, and the suspension was further processed for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (as described below). In separate studies, apical membrane was isolated from IMCD cells by a vesiculation method recently developed by our laboratory for polarized epithelial cells (17Scott R.E. Perkins R.G. Zschunke M.A. Hoerl B.J. Maercklein P.B. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 35: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Scott R.E. Maercklein P.B. J.

Physiol. 1998; 273: F1054-F1057Google Scholar). 20 min after the pHi was adjusted to 7.2 or 6.5, monolayers were incubated for an additional 90 min at 37 °C in a vesiculation medium that contained, in addition to CHB or NHB, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm paraformaldehyde, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Paraformaldehyde and dithiothreitol induce the formation of vesicles from the apical membrane that are released into the incubation medium. At the end of the incubation period vesiculation medium was filtered through 37-μm nylon mesh to remove whole cells, and then the filtrate was centrifuged at 25,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge for 1 h to pellet the vesicles. The pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer, and aliquots were saved for protein and immunoblot analysis. This method has been shown previously to yield relatively purified apical membrane (17Scott R.E. Perkins R.G. Zschunke M.A. Hoerl B.J. Maercklein P.B. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 35: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Scott R.E. Maercklein P.B. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 35: 245-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Alexander E.A. Brown D. Shih T.

This homogenate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody to either the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase (a gift from Dennis Brown), VAMP-2 (Stressgen and T. F. J. Martin), 2The StressGen VAMP Antibody (rabbit polyclonal) was used in experiments depicted in Figs. 1 C and 3, A and B, and the rabbit polyclonal antibody obtained from T. F. J. Martin was used in experiments depicted in Figs. 2, A and B, and 3 C. This latter antibody consistently identified a broader band than did the antibody obtained from StressGen. However, the proteins identified with either antibody had the same apparent molecular mass. or syntaxin/HPC-1 (Sigma) conjugated to Protein A-/G-agarose beads with dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times with CHB with protease inhibitors to eliminate nonspecifically bound proteins and were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting of proteins transferred to nitrocellulose was conducted with antibodies to syntaxin (Sigma), SNAP-23 (P. Roche), synaptotagmin (T. F. J. Martin), NSF, SNAP (T. Sollner and J. E. Rothman), the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase, and GP-135 (G. Ojakian). Whole cell homogenates or immunoprecipitated or apical membrane samples prepared as described above were added to sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min before loading on a 12 or 15% SDS polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions (14Alexander E.A. Shih T. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1054-F1057PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Following transfer, the filters were washed in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked for 1 h in TBST containing 5% w/v nonfat powdered milk (TBSTM) before incubation with a primary antibody (1:1000 in TBSTA (TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin)) at 4 °C overnight. The filters were washed 5 times with TBST and incubated in secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody used in 1:3000 dilution in TBSTM) for 2 h at room temperature with agitation. After five washes, bound antibody was detected using the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). The images of the immunoblots presented in this manuscript are representative of at least four separate studies. After acute cell acidification, a maneuver that enhances the rate of H+ transport by IMCD cells (2Selvaggio A.M. Schwartz J.H. Bengele H.H. Gordon F.D. Alexander E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F391-F400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the mass of the immunodetectable 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase increased in apical membrane by a factor of 2.5, compared with that present in apical membrane of control cells (Fig.1, A and B). In contrast, the mass of GP-135, a resident protein of the apical membrane, is unaffected by cell-acidification cells (Fig. 1, A and B). After intact cells are exposed to either 25 nm TeTx (Fig. 1, A and B) or 25 nm BotD (Fig. 1 C) for 30 min, the mass of the 31-kDa subunit and GP-135 detectable in the apical membrane is not changed. However the increment in H+-ATPase observed with cell acidification is abolished. In addition, when intact IMCD cells are exposed to BotD, the immunodetectable level of VAMP-2 in whole cell homogenate and apical membrane is reduced (Fig. 1 C). Thus, cell acidification induces clostridial toxin-sensitive amplification of apical membrane H+-ATPase. We first determined if IMCD cells express the proteins typically observed in 20 S docking complexes. By immunoblot analysis of whole cell homogenate as depicted in Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and 4, both brain and IMCD cells express NSF, synaptotagmin, syntaxin, SNAP, and VAMP-2. In addition, IMCD cells, but not brain cells, express SNAP-23, a 30-kDa protein that is an isoform of brain SNAP-25. Next we determined if these proteins formed an immunoprecipitable complex in cells subjected to an acute acid load. Antibody to vesicular proteins such as the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase or VAMP-2 co-immunoprecipitated NSF, SNAP, syntaxin, SNAP-23, synaptotagmin, VAMP-2, and the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase, respectively, from the IMCD cell homogenate (Fig. 2 A). In addition, antibody to the apical plasma membrane protein, syntaxin, also co-immunoprecipitated synaptotagmin, the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase, and VAMP-2 (Fig.2 B). The observation that the immunodetectable amount of synaptotagmin co-immunoprecipitated by antibody against either VAMP or the 31-kDa subunit appears to be significantly greater than that identified in whole cell homogenate (Fig. 2 A) was unexpected. One possible explanation is that after complexes are formed, the antigenicity of this protein is enhanced. To evaluate the stability and specificity of the complexes isolated, we determined the in vitro effect of tetanus toxin on the immunoprecipitability of complexes present in a homogenate derived from acid-loaded cells. Aliquots containing equal amounts of protein (100 μg) of this homogenate were incubated in the presence of either diluent or 25 nm tetanus toxin for 25 min. At the end of the incubation period, the toxin was inactivated by chelation of Zn2+ with EDTA and EGTA. Antibodies to the VAMP-2, 31-kDa H+-ATPase subunit, or syntaxin were employed to co-immunoprecipitate the oligomeric complex from these toxin treated and control IMCD cell homogenates. There is a reduction in the proteins that are co-immunprecipitated by a VAMP-2 antibody from homogenates exposed to TeTx as compared with those co-immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the same homogenate not treated with TeTx (Fig.3 A). Although the toxin-induced change is likely to be because of the effect of tetanus toxin on the integrity of the complex, it is also possible that the complex remains intact, but TeTx alters the immunogenicity of VAMP by its proteolytic action on this target protein. However, when antibodies to either the 31-kDa subunit of the H+-ATPase or syntaxin are used, the amount of the primary protein immunoprecipitated (the 31-kDa subunit of the H+-ATPase or syntaxin) is unchanged by exposure to toxin, whereas the proteins that are associated with these molecules by complex formation are reduced (Fig. 3, B and C). This observation confirms that specific complexes are present and suggests that the 20 S-like docking complex requires intact VAMP-2 for stability. The rate of proton secretion by the collecting duct is regulated by changes in cytosolic pH (4Gluck S. Cannon S. Al-Awqati Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4327-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Because proton pump activity is relatively insensitive to pH changes (19Gluck S. Caldwell J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F71-F79PubMed Google Scholar), pHimust affect this transport through alternative mechanisms. It is widely believed that pHi controls this secretory process by regulating exocytic amplification and endocytotic retrieval of proton pumps from the apical membrane of acid secretory collecting duct cells. We have utilized a tissue culture model system, the IMCD cell, to characterize the process of regulated exocytosis of H+-ATPase (20Schwartz J.H. Masino S.A. Nichols R.D. Alexander E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F94-F101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent studies we have demonstrated in these cells that pHi-regulated exocytosis results in the translocation of H+-ATPase to the apical membrane (21Alexander E.A. Brown D. Shih T. McKee M. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 273: F1054-F1057Google Scholar) and that clostridial toxins inhibit pHi recovery after an acute acid load (14Alexander E.A. Shih T. Schwartz J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1054-F1057PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, evidence is presented that directly supports the hypothesis that SNAREs are involved in the targeting fusion of H+-ATPase vesicles with the apical plasma membrane. Cell acidification-induced regulated exocytosis with translocation of H+-ATPase to the apical membrane is inhibited by either TeTx or BotD (Fig. 1, A–C). These toxins proteolytically cleave VAMP-2 at different sites (22Schiavo G. Rosetto O. Tonello F. Montecucco C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 257-274PubMed Google Scholar), and both reduce the amount of VAMP-2 detected in apical membrane and in IMCD cell homogenate. Although these two toxins may have additional ill-defined effects on IMCD cells, the observation that both toxins have equivalent effects in H+-ATPase translocation and VAMP-2 expression is strong evidence indicating that VAMP-2 has a role in this process. In contrast to the effect of toxin on pHi-induced amplification of apical membrane H+-ATPase, the mass of H+-ATPase present in the unacidified cell is not reduced by exposure to toxin. This observation is consistent with the proposal that the constitutive delivery of H+-ATPase may be VAMP-2-independent. It has been suggested that VAMP plays a major role in the mechanism of vesicle trafficking (24Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). This is based upon previous knowledge of the substrate specificity of TeTx and BotD (23Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W.

Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar), the interaction of VAMP with other SNARE proteins during the events of vesicle fusion, and the ability of specific VAMP peptides to inhibit neurotransmitter release in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells (25Hunt J.M.

Recent studies demonstrated the regulatory role of VAMP isoforms in glucose transporter-4 trafficking in adipocytes, exocytosis of histamine in enterochromaffin-like cells, and in the sperm acrosome reaction (26Martin L.B.

In renal cells, VAMP has been shown to co-localize with aquaporin 2 containing vesicles and participate in the fusion of antidiuretic hormone-regulated aquaporin 2 containing endosomes in vitro (12Jo I. Harris H.W. Amendt-Raduge H.W. Majewski R.R. Hammond T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 1, A–C) are consistent with prior observations regarding the role of VAMP in exocytosis and now document the participation of VAMP in another exocytic process, the translocation of H+-ATPase in renal epithelial cells. In neuronal cells, regulated exocytosis is thought to be mediated by the close interaction between the v- and t-SNAREs with the formation of a docking complex (20 S complex) comprised of the v- and t-SNAREs, NSF, and SNAP followed by ATP-mediated priming and Ca2+-dependent fusion (29Martin T.F.J. Kowalchyk J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14447-14453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Banerjee A. Barry V.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20223-20226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We have attempted to identify a similar 20 S-like complex in the IMCD cells. Immunoblots, utilizing rat brain as a control, indicate the presence of these proteins in IMCD cells (Fig. 2, A–B). We have employed antibodies directed against the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase, VAMP-2, or syntaxin to immunoprecipitate, from detergent-free IMCD cell homogenate, the putative 20 S-like complex. The antibody to the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase and VAMP-2, a v-SNARE, co-immunoprecipitated NSF, SNAP, synaptotagmin, syntaxin, SNAP-23, VAMP-2, and the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase, whereas the syntaxin antibody, a t-SNARE, co-immunoprecipitated the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase, VAMP-2, and synaptotagmin (Fig. 2). Thus, all the proteins that have been identified in neuronal exocytosis as a part of the core complex (v- and t-SNAREs) and soluble proteins (NSF and SNAP) that make up the 20 S complex also exist in a multimeric complex in renal IMCD cells. However, in IMCD cells, this complex also appears to include a subunit of the H+-ATPase. The presence of H+-ATPase provides evidence that the complexes we isolated are related to regulation of H+-ATPase exocytosis. IMCD cells also have SNARE-decorated vesicles that cycle aquaporin 2 (10Nielsen S. Marples D. Birn H. Mohtashami M. Dalby N.O. Trimble M. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1834-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Mandon B. Chou C.L. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. J. Clin.

However, these latter vesicles do not contain H+-ATPase (10Nielsen S. Marples D. Birn H. Mohtashami M. Dalby N.O. Trimble M. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1834-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Mandon B. Chou C.L. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. J. Clin.

Thus, the finding of H+-ATPase in these isolated complexes is consistent with a functional role in the regulation of proton transport for these complexes. Conversely, the persistent isolation of an H+-ATPase subunit with the standard components of the 20 S complex suggests that the H+-ATPase per se may play some specific role in targeting and fusion of the vesicles they decorate. In our studies, the oligomeric complex of SNAREs, NSF, SNAP, and the 31-kDa subunit isolated by immunoprecipitation from homogenate of IMCD cells was sensitive to the action of TeTx, an observation that has not been found universally (31Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This is demonstrated by the reduced recovery of an immunoprecipitable oligomeric 20 S-like complex from a homogenate exposed in vitro to toxin (Fig. 3, A–C). These results not only demonstrate the ability of TeTx to destabilize the 20 S-like complex in the IMCD but also provide evidence that the molecules isolated in the supposed complex are not merely an aggregation but a specific complex. Finally, this effect of TeTx on 20 S-like complex documents a specific role of VAMP in docking events and clarifies the effect of toxins on the translocation of H+-ATPase to the apical membrane. In summary, these data provide new evidence that both v- and t-SNAREs participate in the docking and fusion of H+-ATPase vesicles with the apical membrane. They demonstrate a close interaction between the participating SNAREs and the 31-kDa subunit of H+-ATPase. In addition, these data furnish evidence that a subunit of H+-ATPase is not only the cargo of the vesicle but a part of the 20 S-like complex and may function as an unique SNARE in this system for targeting this vesicle subtype."
https://openalex.org/W2087219569,"Basolateral to apical vesicular transcytosis in the hepatocyte is an essential pathway for the delivery of compounds from the sinusoidal blood to the bile and to traffic newly synthesized resident apical membrane proteins to their site of function at the canalicular membrane front. To characterize this pathway better, microtubules in a hepatocyte homogenate were polymerized by addition of taxol, and associated membrane-bound vesicles were isolated. This fraction was enriched in polymeric immunoglobulin A receptor and contained apical membrane proteins. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that polymeric immunoglobulin A receptor was localized predominantly on vesicles ranging from 100 to 160 nm and that the multidrug resistance protein 2 and the bile salt export pump co-localized on these vesicles. The minus-ended microtubule motor, dynein, was highly enriched in the fraction, and its intermediate chain could be released effectively by incubation with 1 mM ATP or GTP. However, the association of the transcytotic vesicles with the microtubules was not sensitive to hydrolyzable or non-hydrolyzable nucleotides. This study characterizes a fraction of microtubule-associated vesicles from rat hepatocytes and demonstrates that several resident apical membrane transport proteins and the polymeric immunoglobulin A receptor traffic on the same vesicle."

Neurotrophin-stimulated presynaptic calcium uptake appears to play a key role in this process. To understand the mechanism of neurotrophin-stimulated calcium uptake, the regulation of calcium uptake and intracellular mobilization by nerve growth factor (NGF) was investigated using NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with either the high affinity NGF receptor p140trk(3T3-Trk) or the low affinity NGF receptor p75NGFR(3T3-p75). In 3T3-Trk cells, NGF increased both calcium uptake and intracellular calcium mobilization. In 3T3-p75 cells, NGF increased calcium uptake but not intracellular calcium mobilization. K-252a alone increased intracellular calcium in 3T3-Trk cells but not in 3T3-p75 cells. Nifedipine, an inhibitor of calcium uptake throughl-type calcium channels, inhibited the action of NGF on both 3T3-Trk cells and 3T3-p75 cells, indicating that both p140trk and p75NGFR receptors are linked to nifedipine-sensitive l-type calcium channels. These studies show that either NGF receptor will support increases in intracellular calcium but that p140trk does so by increasing both uptake and mobilization, whereas p75NGFR does so by increasing uptake only.

The neurotrophin family consists of five structurally and functionally related polypeptides and includes nerve growth factor (NGF),1 brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5), and neurotrophin 6 (NT-6).NGF, the first discovered and best characterized member of this family, is required for the survival and development of sympathetic and sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system (1Levi-Montalcini R.

It also acts on specific populations of neurons in the central nervous system (3Hefti F. Hartikka J. Eckenstein F. Gnahn H. Heumann R. Schwab M.

Many of the biological activities of the neurotrophins are mediated by their binding to and activation of high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases (8Chao M.V. Neuron. 1992; 9: 583-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). These receptors are encoded by the trk gene family. NGF preferentially binds to p140trk, BDNF and NT-4/5 to p145trkB, and NT-3 to p145trkC(9Ip N.Y. Stitt T.N. Tapley P. Klein R. Glass D.J. Fandl J. Greene L.A. Barbacid M. Yancopoulos G.D.

Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Activation of p140trk receptor catalytic activity results in the recruitment of downstream signaling protein substrates, such as phospholipase Cγ (12Loeb D.M. Stephens R.M. Copeland T. Kaplan D.R.

Mol. Cell.

Hartikka J. Eckenstein F. Gnahn H. Heumann R. Schwab M. Neuroscience. 1985; 14: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence for a role of p75NGFR in neurotrophin actions, possibly to increase local concentrations of neurotrophin, to alter the specificity of binding to the trk receptors, and/or to enhance the activity of trk s (16Verdi J.M. Birren S.J. Ibanez C.F. Persson H. Kaplan D.R. Benedetti M. Chao M.V. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 17Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Most recently, p75NGFR has been implicated in the activation of the sphingomyelin cycle (18Dobrowsky R.T.

A. 1994; 91: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).A great deal of evidence suggests that calcium levels are involved in the long term mechanism(s) by which NGF acts on its target cells. Clearly, neuronal survival requires adequate intracellular calcium levels (23Collins F. Schmidt M.F. Guthrie P.B. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2582-2587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, given appropriate calcium levels, the survival of certain classes of neurons becomes neurotrophin-independent (24Koike T. Martin D.P. Johnson Jr., E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 86: 6421-6425Crossref Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Equally clearly, the protection of neurons against environmental insults, such as hypoglycemia or ischemia, depends upon preventing the marked increases in intracellular calcium that attend these insults. In many systems it has been shown that neurotrophins can prevent these increases (25Cheng B. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar).More recently it has been shown that the acute actions of the neurotrophins also involve adjustment of calcium levels. It has been found that the addition of BDNF to cultures of Xenopus neuromuscular junctions increases both the spontaneous and the evoked potentials at those synapses (26Lohof A.M. Ip N. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1993; 363: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Such increases are caused by increased release of neurotransmitter and are the basis of changes in synaptic strength leading to long term potentiation, which, many think, underlies the ability of the brain to store information. And these neurotrophin-dependent changes in neurotransmitter release are dependent, in turn, on increases in presynaptic calcium uptake (27Stoop R. Poo M.-M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3256-3264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the uptake of calcium is a crucial element in both the long and the short term actions of the neurotrophins.A possible model for these neurotrophin-dependent increases in calcium uptake may be the PC12 cell (28Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar, 29Dichter M.A. Tischler A.S. Greene L.A. Nature. 1977; 268: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that NGF causes increases in calcium uptake into PC12 cells (30Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and that this increased uptake seemed to be mediated by unique calcium channels (31Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It also appeared that an NGF-induced phosphorylation, perhaps of the calcium channel itself, is required for this increased uptake (31Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The strength of the NGF-induced increase in calcium uptake is dependent on the intracellular calcium concentration (32Kozak A. Nikodijevic B. Yavin E. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); calcium uptake is greater in cells depleted of calcium and weaker in cells in which calcium levels are raised. Protein kinase C appears to participate in the process of NGF-induced calcium uptake (33Dickens G. Lavarreda M. Zheng W.H. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). K-252a, a kinase inhibitor that blocks the actions of NGF on PC12 cells (34Koizumi S. Contreras M. Matsuda Y. Hama T. Lazarovici P. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 715-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mimics the action of NGF on calcium uptake (30Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Nikodijevic B. Aschkenasy M. Dickens G. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 495-498Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and may employ the same signaling elements as does NGF, including protein kinase C and, perhaps, the high affinity NGF receptor itself.In a previous study it was shown that NGF induced an increased uptake of calcium into 3T3 cells stably transfected with either p140trk or p75NGFR (36Jiang H. St. Ulme D. Dickens G. Chabuk A. Lazarovici P. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6835-6837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study we used confocal microscopy to investigate further the alterations in calcium levels produced by NGF in these two separate cell populations.RESULTSThe expression of human p140trk and of p75NGFRin 3T3-Trk and 3T3-p75 transfectants, respectively, was analyzed by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Both p140trk and p75NGFR were highly expressed in the appropriately transfected 3T3 cells but not in the parent cells (Fig.1 A). Indeed, p140trkis seen as a doublet, as it is in other p140trk-containing cell lines, the lower band representing an underglycosylated precursor (41Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra T. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 42Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6835-6837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the WT 11 and WT 108 clones of 3T3-Trk cells have 3–4-fold more p140trk receptors than do PC12 cells; the 3T3-p75 clones have about 50% as many p75NGFR receptors as do PC12.To examine NGF-induced p140trk phosphorylation and downstream signaling pathways, WT11 and WT108 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 5 min. NGF induced a strong phosphorylation of p140trk(Fig. 1 B) and an activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (data not shown) in both clones. NGF failed, however, to induce either p140trk phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B) or mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (data not shown) in either KD215 or KD217, clones transfected with a kinase-deficient mutant of p140trk. K-252a, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts on the Trk family of neurotrophin receptors in PC12 cells (34Koizumi S. Contreras M. Matsuda Y. Hama T. Lazarovici P. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 715-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), blocked NGF-induced p140trk phosphorylation in both WT11 and WT108 cells (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that transfection of human p140trk into NIH 3T3 cells results in activation of functional NGF receptors coupled to appropriate downstream signaling pathways.Previous studies have shown that NGF induced45Ca2+ influx into PC12 cells (30Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and into both 3T3-Trk and 3T3-p75 cells as well (36Jiang H. St. Ulme D. Dickens G. Chabuk A. Lazarovici P. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6835-6837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To explore this observation further and to determine the subcellular distribution of the increased intracellular calcium, the calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-3 (44Minta A. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used in these studies. In calcium-containing medium, NGF induced an increase in intracellular calcium in both WT11 (Fig.2A) and WT108 cells (data not shown). The time of peak increase is about 4 min after NGF treatment (Fig.2 C). The intracellular calcium level began to decrease after about 6 min but remained above basal for at least 10 min after NGF treatment. Nuclear calcium levels were somewhat higher than those in the cytosol.Figure 2NGF-induced changes in intracellular calcium levels in 3T3-Trk cells. WT11 cells were loaded with Fluo-3-AM (4 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C.

In order to examine the effects of NGF on both calcium influx and calcium mobilization, regular calcium-containing medium was replaced with either calcium-free medium or regular medium containing 2 mm EGTA. In WT11 cells in calcium-free medium, NGF also induced an initial increase in intracellular calcium levels (Fig.2 B). The peak was reached in about 3–4 min, and the levels returned to basal in 8 min (Fig. 2 D). Ligand-induced increases in intracellular calcium levels in calcium-free medium have been attributed to mobilization of intracellular stores. The persistent increased levels above basal seen in calcium-containing, but not in calcium-free, medium are thought to be due to uptake from extracellular sources. This observation suggests that activation of p140trkby NGF can induce both calcium influx and release of calcium from internal stores.In order to define the role of the p140trk receptor in this process, two kinase-deficient clones, KD215 and KD217, were used. NGF did not induce any increase in intracellular calcium concentrations in KD217 cells (Fig. 3 A). Preincubation with 500 nm K-252a for 30 min blocked the NGF-induced increase of intracellular calcium in both WT108 cells (Fig.3, B and C) and WT11 (data not shown), showing that p140trk phosphorylation is required to support increased intracellular calcium levels.Figure 3Lack of NGF-induced changes in intracellular calcium levels in the kinase-deficient 3T3-Trk clone, KD217, and in the 3T3-Trk clone, WT108, treated with K-252a.

The peak of the increase was at about 6 min after NGF treatment (Fig. 4 C). There appeared to be an increase in nuclear calcium levels in these cells as well, but the increase was no greater than that seen in the cytoplasm.Figure 4NGF-induced changes in intracellular calcium levels in 3T3-p75 cells.

This suggests that activation of p75NGFR supports only calcium uptake but not calcium mobilization from intracellular stores. Preincubation with K-252a did not block the NGF-induced increase in intracellular calcium in 3T3-p75 cells (data not shown).Signaling by the p75NGFR appears to involve the sphingomyelin cycle and the second messenger ceramide (18Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The addition of C2-ceramide to 3T3 cells resulted in an increase in intracellular calcium (Fig.5 A). Consistent with this, ceramide treatment produced no increase in intracellular calcium in calcium-free medium (Fig. 5 B). So the addition of ceramide appears to mimic the action of NGF on p75NGFR; it produces an increase in calcium uptake but no increase in calcium mobilization.Figure 5C2-ceramide-induced changes in intracellular calcium levels in parent 3T3 cells. 3T3 cells were loaded as described in Fig. 2, incubated in either calcium-containing or calcium-free medium, and treated with 10 μm C2-ceramide.

Res. 1995; 40: 495-498Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) have shown that K-252a alone mimics the actions of NGF on 45Ca2+ uptake, as it does on neurotransmitter release (46Nikodijevic B. Creveling C.R. Koizumi S. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in PC12 cells, and that uptake appears to be mediated by the p140trk receptor (35Nikodijevic B. Aschkenasy M. Dickens G. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 495-498Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Treatment of 3T3-Trk cells with K-252a produced a marked increase in calcium levels in the cells (Fig. 6 A) and that increase appeared, as does the increase produced by NGF in these cells, to be comprised of an increase in calcium uptake and an increase in calcium mobilization as well, since the increase in calcium-free medium was less than that in complete medium and returned to base line readily (Fig. 6 B). Treatment of 3T3-p75 cells with K-252a in calcium-containing medium produced no increase in calcium levels (Fig.6 C). Thus, the actions of K-252a on these cells appears to be mediated by the p140trk receptor, as it does in PC12 cells (35Nikodijevic B. Aschkenasy M. Dickens G. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 495-498Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar).Figure 6K-252a-induced changes in intracellular calcium levels in 3T3-Trk and 3T3-p75 cells.

Jia, Li, M., Liu, X.-W., Jiang, H., Nelson, P. G., and Guroff, G., submitted for publication.l-type calcium channels were sought in these 3T3 transfectants. PCR analysis showed the presence of transcripts for calcium channel subunits α1A, α1B, and α1C in both 3T3 cells and PC12 (Fig.7). This last, α1C, is the α subunit found in l-type calcium channels. As further proof, it was shown that BayK 8644, an l-type calcium channel agonist, stimulates calcium uptake into these cells and that this uptake is inhibited by nifedipine, an l-type channel antagonist (Fig.8, A and B). When nifedipine was added to cells stimulated with NGF, inhibition was seen with both 3T3-Trk (Fig. 9, A and B) and 3T3-p75 cells (Fig.10, A and B),l-type indicating that binding to either p140trkreceptors or p75NGFR receptors will activate nifedipine-sensitive l-type calcium channels.Figure 7Expression of calcium channel α1 subunits in 3T3 cells and in PC12 cells.

It was first reported in 1978 (47Schubert D. LeCorbiere M. Whitlock C. Stallcup W. Nature. 1978; 273: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) that NGF treatment produces a small increase of calcium release from PC12 cells. However, this observation was not supported by subsequent studies (48Landreth G.E. Cohen P. Shooter E.M. Nature. 1980; 283: 202-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More recently, the direct effects of NGF on the intracellular calcium levels of NGF-responsive cells have been reinvestigated and have led to the finding that NGF produces a small and rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentrations in PC12 cells (49Alonso A.P. Malgaroli A. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 50Lazarovici P. Levi B.Z. Lelkes P. Koizumi S. Fujita K. Matsuda Y. Ozato K. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and that certain of the effects of NGF depend upon the presence of extracellular calcium (51Contreras M. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 52Hashimoto S. Iwasake C. Kuzuya H. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).One of the effects of NGF on PC12 cells is to induce catecholamine release, and this release is dependent upon the presence of extracellular calcium (46Nikodijevic B. Creveling C.R. Koizumi S. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 26: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). By using an assay that measures the uptake of radioactive calcium into PC12 cells, it was further shown that NGF induced a small but rapid increase in the uptake of calcium (30Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The increase of calcium uptake is maximal after 5 min of NGF treatment and gradually disappears after 15 min. This observation was further supported by studies using the fluorescent dye, Fluo-3 (32Kozak A. Nikodijevic B. Yavin E. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Those experiments showed that NGF treatment of PC12 cells produces a rapid and transient uptake of divalent cations and an increase in their intracellular level as well. Most significant, this increase was stronger when the calcium levels of the cells were low and weaker when it was high. This suggests that the effects of NGF are to modulate calcium levels in either direction, depending on the needs of the cells at the time.In order to identify potential calcium channels involved in NGF-induced calcium uptake into PC12 cells, a number of calcium channel blockers were used (31Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nifedipine, a blocker of l-type calcium channels, partially inhibited NGF-induced calcium uptake, suggesting that l-type calcium channe"

Among them, insolubilization of structural proteins has been believed to strengthen the cell wall barrier against pathogen attack (1Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Extensins and proline-rich proteins (PRPs)1 that act as defense-related structural proteins have been identified in both dicotyledons and monocotyledons (2Varner J.E. Lin L.-S. Cell. 1989; 56: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Extensins and PRPs have been thought to be nonenzymatic and purely structural proteins, and molecular characterization of these proteins has established that they all possess several structural characteristics in common: 1) they are basic; 2) they are abundant in hydroxyproline, proline, lysine, and tyrosine residues; 3) and they have highly repetitive peptide sequence with characteristic motifs (e.g. Ser-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp-Hyp for extensins, and Pro-Pro-Val-Tyr-Lys for PRPs) (2Varner J.E.

Their insolubilization mechanisms have been also well examined, confirming that insolubilization of both structural proteins, which involves H2O2-mediated oxidative cross-linking to cell walls, is catalyzed by coexisting peroxidases (5Cooper J.B. Varner J.E. Plant Physiol. 1984; 76: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Everdeen D.S. Kiefer S. Willard J.J. Muldoon E.P. Dey P.M. Li X.-B. Lamport D.T.A.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Peroxidases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze oxidation of cellular components in the presence of H2O2. Most higher plants contain a number of peroxidase isozymes, which can be classified into two (anionic and cationic) or three (anionic, neutral, and cationic) subgroups according to their isoelectrophoretic mobilities, and these isozymes exist in cytosol, chroloplast, vacuole, and cell wall (8Lagrimini L.M. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Rothstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7542-7546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Asada K. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 85: 235-241Crossref Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Their physiological roles have been extensively investigated, and it has been demonstrated that they catalyze a variety of important reactions, such as indole-3-acetic acid catabolism (10Hinnman R.L. Lang J. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 144-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), lignin biosynthesis (11Grisebach H. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 475-478Google Scholar, 12Espelie K.E. Franceschi V.R. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 487-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suberization of cell wall (13Christensen J.H. Baun G. Welinder K.G. Montague M.V. Boerjan W. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and detoxification of H2O2 (9Asada K. Physiol.

These peroxidases are soluble in buffers containing detergents or high concentration of salt, whereas peroxidases that cannot be extracted using these buffers are also found in various plants (15Ridge I. Osborne D.J. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 229: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Goldberg T. Imberty A. Liberman M. Prat R. Greppin H. Penel C. Gaspar T.

Although the latter peroxidases have been shown to be covalently bound to cell walls, almost nothing is known about their physiological importance, their structural characteristics, or the mechanism of covalent bond formation. Previously, we identified a novel H2O2-detoxifying system induced by elicitor treatment in Scutellaria cells and demonstrated that two ionically bound wall peroxidases (peroxidases 1 and 2) effectively metabolize large amounts of H2O2 produced during oxidative burst (19Morimoto S.

Further studies have revealed that peroxidase 1 possesses quite novel functions; like extensins and PRPs, peroxidase 1 is covalently bound to cell wall in response to elicitor treatment and mechanical damage, and surprisingly, this reaction is catalyzed by the action of peroxidase 1 itself in the presence of H2O2. We report here the novel properties and possible physiological roles of peroxidase 1. In addition, we have found that the isozymes peroxidase 2 and the newly identified peroxidase 3 show enzymatic properties similar to peroxidase 1, but they do not become insoluble after stress treatment. Because the divergent and shared properties of these peroxidases are assumed to arise from their structures, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding peroxidases 1–3 and predicted their amino acid sequences. We also describe the primary structures of these Scutellaria peroxidases. The four-week-old calluses of Scutellaria baicalensis (5 g), which was cultured on Murashige-Skoog medium (21Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Morimoto S. Harioka T. Shoyama Y. Planta. 1995; 195: 535-540Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), were subdivided into 100-ml flasks, and 20 ml of liquid Murashige-Skoog medium was added to each flask. After 200 μl of 10% (v/w) yeast extract dissolved in the liquid Murashige-Skoog medium was added (final concentration of yeast extract, 0.1%), the calluses were incubated at 25 °C for 3 h. Treatment of the callus with H2O2 was conducted as described above, except that 100 μl of 1 m H2O2 (final H2O2 concentration, 5 mm) was used instead of the yeast extract solution. Mechanical damage to callus was done as follows. After an aliquot (0.5 g) of the callus was homogenized with 20 ml of the liquid Murashige-Skoog medium, the intact callus (4.5 g) was added to the homogenate and incubated as above. Polyclonal antiserum against peroxidase 1 was generated in white female rabbits using 75 μg of purified peroxidase 1 per injection. The antiserum obtained after the second boost was applied to an affinity column that contains purified peroxidase 1 linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-peroxidase 1 was eluted with 2 m MgCl2. For Western blotting analysis, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide gels) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 1.5 mA/cm2 for 1 h with a semidry blotting apparatus. The membranes were blocked overnight with blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% gelatin) and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with affinity-purified anti-peroxidase 1 diluted in blocking buffer. Antibody binding was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Wako, Tokyo) and 1-chrolo-4-naphtol (Sigma). Immunostaining of crude cell wall was conducted as follows. Crude cell wall, which was prepared as described below, was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in blocking buffer containing affinity-purified anti-peroxidase 1 (final dilution, 1:100) and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The cell wall was rinsed in washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Tween 20) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Wako; final dilution, 1:1000) diluted in the blocking buffer. After the cell wall was rinsed with the washing buffer, antibody binding was detected using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate according to the method of Mobassaleh et al. (22Mobassaleh M. Mishra K. Keusch G.T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To avoid insolubilization of peroxidase 1 during preparation of cell wall, ionically bound wall proteins were removed by washing the 4-week-old callus (100 g) with 1 m NaCl (2,000 ml). The NaCl-washed calluses were homogenized with 50 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The homogenate was filtered, and the residue was rinsed with 450 ml of the same solvent. The residue was further washed with 99% EtOH (250 ml) and then with hexane (250 ml) and was used as crude cell wall. Fractionation of the crude cell wall was carried out by a modification of the method of Srisuma et al. (23Srisuma N. Ruengsakulrach S. Uebersax M.A. Bennink M.R. Hammerschmidt R. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 1991; 39: 855-858Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The crude cell wall (5 g) was heated in water (500 ml) at 85 °C for 1 h and then filtered. Pectin was extracted by incubating the hot water-insoluble residue at 85 °C for 1 h in 0.5% (w/v) ammonium oxalate (500 ml) at 85 °C, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The ammonium oxalate-insoluble materials were further incubated at room temperature for 18 h in 1 m NaOH (500 ml). The NaOH-soluble fraction was dialyzed against water, followed by lyophilization to isolate hemicellulose, whereas the NaOH-insoluble fraction was washed with water (500 ml) and dried under vacuum to give lignocellulose. The fraction containing cationic peroxidases was prepared from 4-week-old callus (300 g) by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by chromatography on CM-cellulose (19Morimoto S. Tateishi N. Matsuda T. Tanaka H. Taura F. Furuya N. Matsuyama N. Shoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12606-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this fraction was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (Nacalei Tesque, Kyoto, Japan, 1.0 × 20.0 cm) preequilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The column was washed with 160 ml of the same buffer to isolate pure peroxidase 1. Further elution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with an increasing ionic strength gradient (10–70 mm) of phosphate buffer resulted in separation of two peroxidase activity peaks, eluted at approximately 20 and 30 mm. The fractions (fractions 13–15 and 18–20, each 20 ml) contained peroxidases 2 and 3, respectively. Peroxidase 2 was purified to homogeneity, whereas peroxidase 3 was contaminated with a few minor proteins. After the peroxidase-3-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated as above and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), the dialysate was applied to a CM cellulose column (1.0 × 20.0 cm) preequilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 60 ml of the same buffer, and peroxidase 3 was then eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with a 600-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.3 m). The most active fractions (9–11, each 20 ml), which contain peroxidase 3 in a pure form, were used for the determination of enzymatic properties and amino acid sequence. An HPLC system (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) composed of a CCPM pump and a UV-8000 absorbance detector equipped with a cation exchange column Poros SP/M (PerSeptive Biosystems, 0.46 × 10.0 cm) was used. Peroxidases were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.2 m). The effluent was monitored by absorption at 220 nm. Peroxidases (60–80 μg) were dissolved in 40 μl of digestion buffer (125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (w/v) glycerol) containing 5% (w/v) mercaptoethanol. Each sample was heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and then 40 μl of the digestion buffer was added. After 20 μl of endoproteinase Glu-C solution (2 unit, Promega) was added to the peroxidase solution, the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. For degradation of peroxidases with CNBr, purified peroxidases (each 20 μg) were dissolved in 100 μl of 70% (v/v) formic acid containing 1% (w/v) CNBr and incubated at 30 °C for 20 h under darkness. The samples treated with endoproteinase Glu-C or CNBr were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide gels) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as above. The fragments were NH2-terminally sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Four-week-old callus (100 mg) was homogenized with 225 μl of extraction buffer (total RNA extraction kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing 4.5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. After 2 m acetate buffer (pH 5.2, 22.5 μl), phenol solution (225 μl), and chloroform-isoamylalcohol (24:1, 45 μl) were added to the homogenate, the samples were well mixed and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5 min. Isopropanol (250 μl) was added to the aqueous phase, stored at −20 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged as above. The pellet containing RNA was resuspended again in 70% EtOH (1 ml), centrifuged as above, and dissolved in 20 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. In this study, four cDNA pools were used as templates for PCR. The cDNA pools 1 and 2 were prepared by reverse transcription of the above RNA solution using oligo dT primer (5′-CGA(T)14–3′) and oligo dT primer possessing adapter (5′-GACTCGTCTAGAGGATCC-CG(T)17–3′), respectively. Both reactions were carried out with M-MLV reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The cDNA pools 3 and 4 were synthesized by attaching poly(C) and poly(A) tails to cDNA pool 1 using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase according to the manufacturer's protocols (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The following oligonucleotide primers were used in this study: degenerate primers 1 (5′-GGGGTACCTTYCAYGAYTGYTTYGT-3′), 2 (5′-CGGGATCCTTRTTRAAIIINGTRCARTG-3′), 3 (5′-CGGGATCCAARTTICCRCAYTGISWYTG-3′), and 4 (5′-CGGGATCCGCYTGICCDATIGTRTG); gene-specific primers 1 (5′-GGTTTCATTAGCTTCCGAGGCA 3′), 2 (5′-GGGGTA-CCCGAGCATTTGCCAACAAGGG-3′), 3 (5′-GACAACTTCAAAACCTCTGAGGC-3′), 4 (5′-GGGGTACCCGGAGGTGAATCTTTCTCTGC-3′), 5 (5′-GGGGTACCCCTACCTTCTACTCTCACCCA-3′), 6 (5′-ACTTGGAAGCCTCTGACAGA-3′), 7 (5′-GGGGTACCATTGGGGCCCGCAGTCTTTT-3′), 8 (5′-GGGGTACCCCTGGACTCAATCTCAATGC-3′), 9 (5′-ATCGAACCCTCGCAGCGAAT-3′), and 10 (5′-GGGGTACCTTTTCTC-CGGTGAACCCAGT-3′; and adapter primers 1 (5′-GACTCGTCTAGAGGATCCCG-3′), 2 (5′-GACTCGTCTAGAGGATCCCG11-3′), and 3 (5′-GACTCGTCTAGAGGATCCCGT17-3′). All PCR amplifications were carried out in 50-μl reaction mixture consisting of primers (degenerate primer, 2 μm; gene-specific or adapter-specific primer, 0.2 μm), dNTPs (0.2 mm each), and Taq DNA polymerase (1 unit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For cloning of cDNA encoding peroxidase 1, degenerate oligonucleotide primers 1 and 2 were designed to adhere to the internal amino acid sequences. In the first step, a cDNA fragment (450 bp) was amplified using both degenerate primers in the presence of cDNA pool 1 as template (40 cycles of each 1 min at 94, 40 and 72 °C). Furthermore, to amplify 3′-terminal and 5′-terminal regions, RACE was employed. The first PCR was conducted with gene-specific primer 1, adapter primer 1, and template cDNA pool 2 (30 cycles of each 1 min at 94, 55, and 72 °C). A 3′-RACE product (750 bp) was obtained by a second round of PCR with gene-specific primer 2 and adapter primer 1 in the presence of the PCR products from the first reaction as template (30 cycles of each 1 min at 94, 58, and 72 °C). 5′-RACE was created in the same manner. The first PCR was performed with gene-specific primer 3 and adapter primers 1 and 2 using template cDNA pool 3 (five cycles of 1 min at 94, 50, and 72 °C, and then 30 cycles of 1 min at 94, 55, and 72 °C). A second round of PCR (30 cycles of 1 min at 94, 55, and 72 °C) with gene-specific primer 4, adapter primer 1, and the PCR products from the first reaction resulted in a 5′-RACE product (350 bp). PCR products were cloned into phage vectors (M13mp18 and M13mp19), transformed into Escherichia coli competent cells (JM110), and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 373S DNA sequencer. The obtained sequences were combined using a SeqEd™ program (Applied Biosystems). Similar procedures were used for the amplification of cDNAs encoding peroxidase 2. As a first step, degenerate PCR was conducted using degenerate primers 1 and 3 in the presence of template cDNA pool 1 (30 cycles of each 1 min at 94, 42, and 72 °C) and resulted in a 400-bp product. A 3′-RACE product (700 bp) was obtained with gene-specific primer 5, adapter primer 1 and template cDNA pool 2 (30 cycles of each 1 min at 94, 55 and 72 °C). 5′-RACE product was created by first performing PCR with gene-specific primer 1 and adapter primers 1 and 3 using template cDNA pool 4 (5 cycles of 1 min at 94, 50, and 72 °C and then 30 cycles of 1 min at 94, 55, and 72 °C). Then a second round of PCR (30 cycles of 1 min at 94, 55, and 72 °C) with gene-specific primer 7, adapter primer 1, and first PCR products yielded a 5′-RACE product (350 bp). Sequencing of the amplified fragments was carried out as above. Concerning the amplification and sequencing of cDNA encoding peroxidase 3, the same PCR conditions were employed, except that degenerate primer 4 and gene-specific primers 8, 9, and 10 were used instead of degenerate primer 3 and gene-specific primers 5, 6, and 7, respectively. Previously, Bradley et al. (1Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) reported that treatment of French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) or soybean (Glycine max L.) cells with elicitor causes rapid insolubilization of extensins and PRPs in cell walls. Therefore, we investigated whether similar treatment affects extractability of structural proteins in S. baicalensis. After Scutellaria calluses were treated with yeast extract as an elicitor, cell wall proteins were extracted with NaCl and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When NaCl-extractable proteins in the elicitor-treated callus were compared with those in the control callus, apparent decreases in a 36-kDa protein were observed in the former callus (Fig.1 A). To obtain structural information on this 36-kDa protein, cell wall proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the 36-kDa protein was NH2-terminally sequenced. However, sequencing was unsuccessful because the NH2terminus appeared to be chemically blocked. The 36-kDa protein was eluted from the gel and digested using endoproteinase Glu-C. NH2 terminus sequencing of the hydrolysates (1.2- and 1.6-kDa fragments) surprisingly revealed that both fragments contain motifs very similar to the peroxidase active site (Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ile-Arg-Leu-His-Phe-Asp) and the ligand of heme (Met-Val-Thr-Leu-Ser-Gly-Ala-His-Thr-Leu), respectively (8Lagrimini L.M. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Rothstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7542-7546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the motifs characteristic of extensins and PRPs were not found. Previously, we identified two cationic peroxidase isozymes (peroxidases 1 and 2) catalyzing H2O2-metabolism in S. baicalensis (19Morimoto S. Tateishi N. Matsuda T. Tanaka H. Taura F. Furuya N. Matsuyama N. Shoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12606-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the molecular mass of the 36-kDa protein was closer to peroxidase 1 than peroxidase 2. Finally, the 36-kDa protein was identified as peroxidase 1 by Western blotting using affinity-purified anti-peroxidase 1 antibody (Fig. 1 B). In situ immunostaining of Scutellaria callus was carried out with anti-peroxidase 1 antibody by a method described previously (1Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), but it did not differentiate between control and elicitor-treated calluses (data not shown). We hypothesized that ionically bound wall peroxidase 1 is not completely removed using this staining method, and therefore, soluble peroxidase-free cell wall fractions, which were prepared by extensive washing the callus with NaCl, were used for immunostaining. Consequently, the immunoreactivity in the isolated cell walls was significantly enhanced by elicitor treatment (Fig. 2), indicating that the decrease in NaCl-extractable peroxidase 1 is due to insolubilization in the cell walls. Although we attempted to extract insolubilized peroxidase 1 from the elicited callus using various methods including SDS extraction (1Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), acidified cholite treatment (24O'Neill M.A. Selvendran R.R. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and limited proteolysis (25McDougall G.J. Phytochemistry. 1993; 33: 765-767Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), peroxidase 1 could not be solubilized. This observation, taken together with the results of immunostaining, suggests that peroxidase 1 is rigidly cross-linked to cell wall through covalent bonds. Fig. 1 A shows that mechanical damage also induces similar decrease in NaCl-extractable peroxidase 1. Because elicitor treatment or mechanical damage causes rapid production of H2O2 in plant cells, we assumed that H2O2 is indispensable for the insolubilization of peroxidase 1. This assumption was strengthen by the fact that treatment of Scutellaria callus with H2O2 promotes decreases in NaCl-extractable peroxidase 1 (Fig. 1 A). We therefore attempted in vitro insolubilization using H2O2, purified peroxidase 1 and isolated cell walls and detected the amount of NaCl-extractable peroxidase 1 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3 A, insolubilization of peroxidase 1 was found only in the presence of crude cell wall and H2O2. These results indicated that, like extensins and PRPs, insolubilization of peroxidase 1 involves H2O2-dependent cross-linking to cell walls. Peroxidase 1 was thought to catalyze the reaction itself because the insolubilization never occurred using inactivated peroxidase 1 (Fig. 3 B). Brownleader et al. (7Brownleader M.D. Ahmed N. Trevan M. Chaplin M.F. Dey P.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) demonstrated polymerization of extensins by in vitro peroxidase reaction in the absence of cell walls, whereas peroxidase 1 was not polymerized under similar conditions. The crude cell walls were further fractionated into pectin, hemicellulose, and lignocellulose (23Srisuma N. Ruengsakulrach S. Uebersax M.A. Bennink M.R. Hammerschmidt R. J. Agric. Food. Chem. 1991; 39: 855-858Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and binding of peroxidase 1 to each fraction was tested. Fig. 3 C shows that peroxidase 1 bind only to lignocellulose. This lignocellulose fraction from the elicited callus was treated with cellulase and anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, which catalyze cleavage of glycosidic bonds, but treatment using both reagents did not solubilize peroxidase 1, confirming that peroxidase 1 is not bound to the cellulose moiety (data not shown). The kinetics of peroxidase insolubilization were determined by monitoring the band intensity of peroxidase 1 by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). NaCl-soluble peroxidase 1 quickly decreased until 30 min after addition of elicitor and thereafter slowly insolubilized. More than 80% of ionically bound wall peroxidase 1 was cross-linked to the cell walls at 60 min after elicitation. Its significant decrease was not detectable after 180 min. The insolubilization of extensins and PRPs, which is initiated within 2–5 min and completed within 20–30 min, is one of the earliest defense responses (1Bradley D.J. Kjellbom P. Lamb C.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), whereas the insolubilization of peroxidase 1 was somewhat slower. We hypothesized that this lower rate is due to scarcity of H2O2, because Scutellaria cells rapidly metabolize large amounts of H2O2 produced during oxidative burst (19Morimoto S. Tateishi N. Matsuda T. Tanaka H. Taura F. Furuya N. Matsuyama N. Shoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12606-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hence, we conducted experiments using an excess of H2O2, but only a slight increase in the insolubilization rate occurred (Fig. 4). Our previous studies demonstrated the presence of other isozymes in S. baicalensis during purification of peroxidases 1 and 2 (19Morimoto S. Tateishi N. Matsuda T. Tanaka H. Taura F. Furuya N. Matsuyama N. Shoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12606-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but their properties were not examined. To precisely compare the properties of these isozymes with those of peroxidase 1, we attempted purification of them. A cell wall protein fraction, which was prepared from 4-week-old callus as described previously (19Morimoto S. Tateishi N. Matsuda T. Tanaka H. Taura F. Furuya N. Matsuyama N. Shoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12606-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was applied to a CM-cellulose (CM-52) column and then to a hydroxylapatite column to isolate a new isozyme (peroxidase 3), together with peroxidases 1 and 2. The peroxidase-3-containing fractions were further chromatographed over a CM-52 column, purifying peroxidase 3 to homogeneity (Fig.5). SDS-PAGE of peroxidase 3 revealed that it has the same molecular mass (34 kDa) as peroxidase 2 (Fig. 5), whereas its pI value (8.5) was cationic, like peroxidases 1 and 2. Peroxidase 3 catalyzed degradation of the flavones baicalein and luteolin, but the other flavones (baicalin, apigenin, oroxylin A, and wogonin) were not substrates of this isozyme. This catalytic ability was identical to that of peroxidases 1 and 2 (19Morimoto S. Tateishi N. Matsuda T. Tanaka H. Taura F. Furuya N. Matsuyama N. Shoyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12606-12611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the presence of baicalein, its H2O2-metabolizing activity (1.29 μkatal/mg of protein) also resembled those of peroxidases 1 (1.38 μkatal/mg of protein) and 2 (1.02 μkatal/mg of protein). Thus, enzymatic properties of these three peroxidases were similar, although the responses of peroxidases 2 and 3 to oxidative stress were apparently different from that of peroxidase 1. The intensity of a 34-kDa band corresponding to peroxidases 2 and 3 was not significantly decreased by elicitor treatment or mechanical damage, contrary to that of peroxidase 1 (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, we evaluated changes in ionically bound wall peroxidases 2 and 3 levels by HPLC. Fig.6 demonstrates that the levels of NaCl-soluble peroxidases 2 and 3 are not affected by elicitor treatment. We next analyzed the amino acid contents of all isozymes. Although extensins and PRPs are characterized by high (hydroxyl)proline and lysine contents (2Varner J.E. Lin L.-S. Cell. 1989; 56: 231-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar)"

Apparently, CccB corresponds to cytochrome c551 of the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus PS3. The heme domain of B. subtilis cytochrome c551 is very similar to that of cytochrome c550 , a protein encoded by the cccA gene and anchored to the membrane by a single transmembrane polypeptide segment. Thus, B. subtilis contains two small, very similar, c-type cytochromes with different types of membrane anchors. The cccB gene is cotranscribed with the yvjA gene, and transcription is repressed by glucose. Mutants deleted for cccB or yvjA-cccB show no apparent growth, sporulation, or germination defect.

YvjA is not required for the synthesis of cytochrome c551, and its function remains unknown. nutrient sporulation medium with phosphate polymerase chain reaction 5-aminolevulinic acid base pair(s) The cytoplasmic membrane of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis contains cytochromes of a-, b-, c-, and d-type (1von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The c-type cytochromes differ from other cytochromes by having heme covalently bound to the polypeptide via cysteine residues in a consensus motif, Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-His, in which the His residue functions as the fifth axial ligand to the heme iron. Three different membrane-bound c-type cytochromes have been described in B. subtilis. They are all dispensable for growth, repressed by glucose, and expressed in the early stationary phase (1von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 100: 91-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cytochromes c are subunit II of the cytochrome caa3 complex (encoded by the ctaC gene) (2Saraste M. Metso T. Nakari T. Jalli T. Lauraeus M. van der Oost J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 517-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), cytochrome c of the cytochrome bc complex (encoded by the qcrC gene) (3Yu J. Hederstedt L. Piggot P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6751-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the monomeric cytochrome c550 (encoded by the cccA gene) (4von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome caa3 is a cytochrome c oxidase. The cytochrome bc complex oxidizes menaquinol and transfers electrons to cytochrome c. Cytochrome c550 is a 13-kDa protein with a membrane anchor domain consisting of a single α-helical transmembrane segment of about 30 residues and a heme domain of about 74 residues (4von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter domain, like that of all bacterial c-type cytochromes, is located on the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane (5von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At pH 7.0, cytochrome c550 has a midpoint redox potential of +178 mV (6von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The function of this cytochrome is not known, and deletion or overexpression of the cccA gene does not affect the respiration activity of the cell (4von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13939-13948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the respiratory system and energy metabolism of B. subtilis requires detailed knowledge of the cytochromes and their specific biological roles. Sequence analysis of the entire B. subtilis genome revealed the cccB gene encoding a possible novel cytochrome c in B. subtilis. The deduced CccB sequence shows about 35% identity to CccA and has the cytochrome c consensus motif in the C-terminal part of the polypeptide. This was the only new c-type cytochrome found in the B. subtilis genome sequencing project. The cccB gene is located at 310° on the chromosome far away from the cccA gene at 222° (7Kunst F.

In this paper we demonstrate that cccB is the structural gene for a membrane-anchored cytochrome c551. As compared with the other c-type cytochromes in wild type cells, CccB is present in very low amounts, i.e. less than 103 molecules/cell.

Plasmids were isolated using CsCl density gradient centrifugation (15Ish-Horowicz D. Burke J.F.

For this purpose, the following oligonucleotides were prepared: CR108, 5′-GTC CGA TTT TAA TGT GCG TGG TTG-3′, whose sequence is identical to the distal part of the yvjA- coding DNA strand; and CR109, 5′-GCT TCC GTC TTG CTG CCA GTG TCT-3′, complementary to the mRNA encoding a proximal part of cccB. 32 μg of total RNA were extracted from 22 ml of a late exponential phase LB culture of B. subtilis 168 by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The extract was incubated for 60 min with 5 units of DNase I at 37 °C. After heat inactivation of the DNase (65 °C for 20 min), 5 ng of the RNA preparation were incubated for 20 min at 60 °C in reverse transcription buffer containing primer CR109 (2 μm), 0.9 mm MnCl2, 3.2 mm dNTP mixture, and 4 units of Tth DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Under these conditions and in the presence of Mn2+, the Tth DNA polymerase can perform reverse transcription and thus catalyze the synthesis of the cDNA strand complementary to the cccB mRNA. Subsequently, the mixture was supplemented with primer CR108 (2 μm), 0.75 mm EGTA, and PCR buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR was performed in the same tube, because the Tth enzyme can act as a thermostable DNA polymerase in the presence of the Mg2+ present in the PCR buffer. To confirm that the resulting product originated from template mRNA and not from eventual chromosomal DNA contamination, a negative control was performed by running in parallel the same RNA preparation previously incubated for 120 min at 37 °C with 5 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A. Plasmid pCRΔcccB was constructed in several steps. Basically it is a derivative of pUC18 into which the two DNA fragments from the B. subtilis chromosome (Fig. 1), obtained by using PCR, and the tetracycline resistance gene from the plasmid pBEST307 (19Itaya M. Tanaka T. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 631-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were introduced. pCRΔ972 was obtained from pCRΔcccB by substituting the distal part of yvjA with a PCR-obtained fragment homologous to the chromosomal region located upstream of yvjA (Fig. 1). Plasmid pCR977 carries a transcriptional fusion of the yvjA-cccB promoter region with the lacZ gene from E. coli (Fig. 1). It was obtained by cloning the PCR-derived DNA fragment used for the pCRΔ972 construction into pDH32. The latter plasmid allows the ectopical integration of the gene fusion into the B. subtilis amyE locus (20Perego M. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology and Molecular Genetics. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 615-624Google Scholar). Plasmid pLUJ104, used for overproduction of CccB, was constructed as follows. Plasmid p4303 was cleaved by Eco RI and Hin dIII, and the obtained 990-bp fragment containing the cccB gene was ligated into pBluescript SK(-). From this plasmid, multiplied in E. coli SURE, a 1010-bp Bam HI-Hin dIII fragment containing the cccB gene was ligated into pMY2 downstream of the B. subtilis sdh promoter. Plasmid pLUJ105 was constructed as follows. Plasmid pLUT191, which is a pUC19 derivative and contains 600 bp of the B. subtilis cccA gene region corresponding to the promoter and the part of the gene encoding amino acid residues 1–33, was cleaved by Kpn I and Bam HI and treated with alkaline phosphatase. The part of the cccB region that encodes residues 28–112 of CccB and contains the proposed transcription termination loop (Fig. 1.) was amplified by PCR using two primers, 03III, 5′-CG GGT ACCAAG ACA GAC ACT GGC AGC AAG (the Kpn I site is underlined), and 03IV, 5′-CG GGA TCC ATA TTG TCA AGG CAT AAA AAC ATC (the Bam HI site is underlined). Plasmid p4303 was used as the template. The PCR was performed using Pwo DNA polymerase and buffer from Roche Molecular Biochemicals containing 4 mm MgSO4. The PCR product was cleaved with Kpn I and Bam HI, and the 315-bp fragment was ligated into pLUT191. The resulting pLUJ105 has the cccA-cccB hybrid gene under the native B. subtilis cccA promoter. The cccB gene was deleted by gene replacement consisting of the integration of linearized pCRΔcccB into the B. subtilis 168 chromosome via a double crossover event resulting in strain L16205. The deletion of the yvjA-cccB segment was performed in a similar way by using linearized pCRΔ972. Strain LUH20 was obtained by the transformation of strain 168 to phleomycin resistance with chromosomal DNA containing a ΔctaCD::ble gene replacement (21van der Oost J. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2063-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and then to chloramphenicol resistance with DNA containing a ΔcccA::cat gene replacement (5von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). LUH36 was obtained by the transformation of LUH20 to tetracycline resistance with L16205 (ΔcccB::tet) chromosomal DNA. Membranes isolated from LUH36/pLUJ104 and LUH36/pLUJ105 were diluted to 1.5 mg protein/ml in solubilization buffer (30 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8, 0.5 m Na2SO4, and 1 mmNa-EDTA, pH 8) containing 2% (w/v) cholate, Triton X-100, or no detergent. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 0.5 mm, and the samples were sonicated and then centrifuged for 40 min at 140,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants and the pellets, homogenized in 2 ml of buffer without detergent, were analyzed by light absorption spectroscopy. Membranes isolated from B. subtilis LUH20/pLUJ104 were diluted to 5 mg protein/ml in solubilization buffer containing 2% (w/v) cholate. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added and the samples were incubated and centrifuged as for the differential solubilization described above. The supernatant was supplemented with polyethylene glycol (Mr 20,000) to a final concentration of 8% (w/v) and centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature. To the supernatant, polyethylene glycol was added to a final concentration of 30% (w/v), and MgSO4 was added to 5 mm. After mixing, the sample was centrifuged at 43,700 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The pellet was suspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, containing 1% (w/v) Thesit and then dialyzed at 4 °C against the same buffer using Spectrapor® tubing with a 3.5-kDa cut-off. The sample was applied on a QMA MemSep® 1010 Ion Exchange Membrane Chromatography Cartridge (Millipore) connected to an FPLC® system (flow rate 5 ml/min). After two washing steps with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.1% Thesit, containing 5 and 20 mm NaCl, respectively, the CccB cytochrome was eluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1% Thesit and 100 mm NaCl. The 5-ml eluate was dialyzed as above against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.1% Thesit. The purification procedure up to this point was based on a method described by Sone et al. (22Sone N. Kutoh E. Yanagita Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to purify cytochrome c551 from Bacillus PS3. The cytochrome c was further purified using isoelectric focusing with the Rotorfor® System (Bio-Rad) in the presence of 0.1% Thesit. Twenty fractions were collected, and the absorption at 414 nm was determined. The fractions with high absorption at 414 nm (pH 3.7–4.0) were diluted in 5 volumes of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8, containing 0.1% Thesit, pooled, and concentrated using Microcon 10-kDa cut-off concentrators. Light absorption spectroscopy at room temperature, in vivo labeling of heme using 2 μm and 0.1 μCi/ml of 5-[4-14C]aminolevulinic acid ([14C]ALA) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described in Ref. 23Schiött T. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1962-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar except that the Schägger/von Jagow gel system (24Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10475) Google Scholar) was used. B. subtilis membranes were isolated according to Ref.25Hederstedt L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar. Low temperature (77 K) light absorption spectroscopy was done as described in Ref. 21van der Oost J. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2063-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. β-galactosidase assays were performed according to Ref. 26Ferrari E. Howard S.M.H. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 173-179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Heme C was determined from the pyridine hemochromogen difference (reduced minus oxidized) spectrum in alkaline solution using the absorption coefficient 23.97 mm−1cm−1 (550 nm minus 535 nm) (27Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Inspection of the B. subtilis genome sequence reveals that the cccB gene is flanked by the genes yvjA and ftsE (Fig.1). Like cccB, these flanking genes are transcribed in the direction of DNA replication. The fstE gene encodes a 25.5-kDa protein with sequence similarities to FstE from E. coli, which is an ATP-binding protein involved in cell division. The putative 29.8-kDa polypeptide encoded by the yvjA gene shows about 30% sequence identity to several proteins of unknown function in B. subtilis, e.g. YgfU, YxkD, and YpjC. Judging from the sequence, there is no obvious promoter located immediately upstream of the cccB gene and no transcription terminator between yvjA and cccB. Downstream of cccB there is an inverted repeat followed by a run of Ts that probably functions as a rho-independent transcription terminator. The DNA sequence upstream of yvjA shows the features of a transcription terminator followed by a promoter region. Together, these observations suggest that yvjA and cccB are co-transcribed as an approximately 1.55-kilobase mRNA. Northern blot analysis of total B. subtilis RNA, using cccB as the probe, has also shown a 1.6-kilobase transcript. 2T. Schiött, personal communication. The presence of such a di-cistronic mRNA was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR on total RNA extracted from strain 168 (Fig.2). The obtained cDNA product showed that yvjA and cccB mRNA is contiguous (Fig.1). To study the expression pattern of yvjA-cccB during growth, a transcriptional yvjA-lacZ fusion was constructed (Fig. 1) and inserted into the chromosome at the amyE locus in strain 168 resulting in strain L16238. β-galactosidase activity was analyzed in cells growing at 37 °C in NSMP with or without 0.5% glucose. Activities were low and decreased in the presence of 0.5% glucose (Fig. 3). In L16238 cells grown in unsupplemented NSMP, the β-galactosidase activity reached a maximum at the end of the exponential growth phase. The results indicate that the cccB gene is expressed under exponential growth but at a low level. To analyze the role of YvjA and CccB, deletion mutants L16224 (ΔyvjA-cccB) and L16205 (ΔcccB) were constructed. No apparent growth defect was detected, i.e. the mutants grew as wild type on solid and liquid media including minimal medium. It can be noted that mutants deficient in cytochrome c synthesis also do not show any growth defect (23Schiött T. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1962-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cccB deletion mutant showed normal sporulation, spore outgrowth, and sensitivity to lysozyme (data not shown). The amino acid sequence of the C-terminal part of CccB is very similar to that of CccA, the B. subtilis cytochrome c550 polypeptide (Fig.4.). This part constitutes the heme domain of cytochrome c550 (6von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The N-terminal parts of the two proteins are clearly different. In CccA, the first 32 residues are known to function as a noncleaved signal sequence for membrane insertion and peptide membrane anchor for the cytochrome domain (5von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of CccB also has the features of a signal peptide but contains the bacterial lipoprotein consensus sequence, Leu-Ala-Ala-Cys. This suggests that it is modified at the Cys residue by the addition of a diacylglycerol moiety and subsequently is cleaved by type II signal peptidase resulting in the modified Cys at the N-terminal end of the protein (28Hayashi S. Wu H.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 451-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). CccB is therefore most likely a lipoprotein anchored to the membrane by fatty acid residues. The thermophilic bacterium Bacillus PS3 contains a 10-kDa cytochrome c, which has been shown to be a lipoprotein containing two palmitic acid (C16:0) residues/molecule of cytochrome (29Noguchi S. Yamazaki T. Yaginuma A. Sakamoto J. Sone N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This cytochrome shows an absorbance maximum at 551 nm and has therefore been named cytochrome c551. The structural gene for this cytochrome in Bacillus PS3 is called cccA (30Fujiwara Y. Oka M. Hamamoto T. Sone N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sequence similarities strongly suggest that B. subtilis CccB corresponds to CccA of Bacillus PS3 (Fig. 4). This conclusion is supported by the fact that B. subtilis YvjA and the protein encoded by the open reading frame located immediately upstream of cccA in the chromosome of Bacillus PS3 (30Fujiwara Y. Oka M. Hamamoto T. Sone N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) show 70% sequence identity. It has been demonstrated that Bacillus PS3 cytochrome c551 can be synthesized from the cloned gene in both Bacillus stearothermophilus K1041 (29Noguchi S. Yamazaki T. Yaginuma A. Sakamoto J. Sone N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and B. subtilis (31Kai K. Noguchi S. Sone N. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1997; 84: 190-194Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound cytochromes with covalently bound heme can be identified by a combination of in vivo radioactive labeling of heme using ALA, a precursor to heme, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of isolated membranes followed by autoradiography, cf. Ref. 23Schiött T. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1962-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. In wild type B. subtilis strains, four cytochromes are visualized by this method (Fig.5, lane 1). These are the 39-kDa subunit II of cytochrome caa3 (CtaC), the 28-kDa cytochrome c of the bc complex (QcrC), the 25-kDa cytochrome b subunit of the cytochrome bc complex (QcrB) (32Yu J. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8860-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the 13-kDa cytochrome c550 (CccA). The predicted mass of the mature CccB lipoprotein with covalently bound heme is about 10 kDa. CccA protein in membranes of the parental strain 168 labeled with [14C]ALA gives rise to a diffuse but rather strong, radioactive cytochrome c band in the 15-kDa region of the gel. This band can hide other small cytochrome polypeptides. Therefore, to assess the presence of CccB, we constructed and analyzed strain LUH20, in which both cccA and ctaC are deleted. As expected, the QcrC and QcrB polypeptides were present in this strain, whereas a very faint, diffuse, radioactive polypeptide was found in the 14-kDa region of the gel. This polypeptide is most likely CccB because it was not present in labeled membranes from strain LUH36, which in addition to cccA and ctaCD has been deleted for the cccB gene (Fig. 5). To facilitate the detection of14C-heme labeled CccB as well as the isolation of the protein for biochemical characterization we have constructed pLUJ104. This plasmid is a derivative of pHP13, an E. coli/B. subtilis shuttle vector with a copy number of about 5 in B. subtilis (9Haima P. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), containing the cccB gene cloned downstream of the sdh promoter. [14C]ALA-labeled membranes obtained from B. subtilis strain LUH36 containing pLUJ104 presented a strong, diffuse band migrating faster than CccA but at the same position as the weak band observed with LUH20 (Fig. 5, lane 5). The results show that CccB contains covalently bound heme, i.e. is a cytochrome c. The diffuse polypeptide bands observed with CccA and CccB are because of inherent properties of these cytochromes (not to the electrophoresis system as previously shown for CccA (6von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Genes that are organized in one operon often encode functionally related proteins. To determine if the YvjA protein plays a role in the maturation of the CccB cytochrome a yvjA-cccB, cccA deletion strain L16225 was constructed. Membranes of L16225 containing pLUJ104 or the plasmid vector, pHP13, were analyzed for cytochrome c (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). The results showed that YvjA is not required for the synthesis of the membrane-bound CccB cytochrome or any other cytochrome with covalently bound heme. To investigate the domain structure of CccB, a cccA-cccB in frame gene fusion was constructed and cloned into pHP13 resulting in pLUJ105. The hybrid gene is transcribed from the native cccA promoter and is expected to encode a protein with the CccA membrane anchor domain (residues 1–33) fused to the predicted heme domain of CccB (residues 28–112). Membranes from strain LUH36 containing pLUJ105 and grown in the presence of [14C]ALA contained a radioactive polypeptide corresponding to the CccA-CccB hybrid protein, which in the polyacrylamide gel migrated slightly slower than CccA (Fig. 5, lane 4). The results define the heme domain of CccB and demonstrate that the membrane anchor domain of CccA and CccB is functionally interchangeable. Membranes from strain LUH36/pLUJ104 grown in NSMP were analyzed by light absorption spectroscopy. LUH36 lacks cytochrome c550 and cytochrome caa3, which are the dominant high potential B. subtilis cytochromes absorbing in the 550-nm region of the spectrum (11Schiött T. Throne-Holst M. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is deleted for the cccB gene. Ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized difference spectra at 77 K of membranes from LUH36/pLUJ104 showed an α-band absorption peak at 547 nm and a β-band peak at 519 nm (Fig.6, asc. spectrum). These peaks are because of CccB, because they were not seen with membranes from LUH36/pHP13 (Fig. 6). Only cytochromes of high (>100 mV) midpoint redox potential are reduced by the ascorbate. Difference spectra of dithionite-reduced membranes, where all cytochromes are reduced, indicated that the CccB cytochrome is present in relatively large amounts in LUH36/pLUJ104 (Fig. 6, dit. spectra). At room temperature, reduced CccB cytochrome showed absorption maxima at 551 ± 0.7 nm and 522 ± 0.7 nm (not shown). Because of its spectral properties and other similarities to the small cytochrome of Bacillus PS3, we name B. subtilis CccB cytochrome c551. Membranes from strain LUH36 containing pLUJ105, which encodes the CccA-CccB hybrid protein, showed an absorbance maximum at 551 nm at room temperature after reduction with ascorbate. This confirmed that residues 28–112 of CccB (amino acid numbering according to the unprocessed CccB) constitute the entire heme domain of cytochrome c551. Cytochrome c551 was overproduced to about 0.36 nmol/mg membrane protein in strain LUH20/pLUJ104. The cytochrome was extracted from these membranes using cholate and purified according to steps 1 and 2 of a method described by Noguchi et al. (29Noguchi S. Yamazaki T. Yaginuma A. Sakamoto J. Sone N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), except that we used 1% (w/v) Thesit instead of Triton X-100. A final isoelectric focusing step in the presence of 0.1% Thesit was performed to obtain pure B. subtilis cytochrome c as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining for protein and covalently bound heme. The cytochrome polypeptide gave rise to a diffuse band in the gels (not shown) like that observed with14C-heme labeled cytochrome (Fig. 5). The properties of isolated B. subtilis cytochrome c551 are very similar to those of cytochrome c551 from Bacillus PS3 (TableII). The latter cytochrome has been demonstrated to be a lipoprotein (29Noguchi S. Yamazaki T. Yaginuma A. Sakamoto J. Sone N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). That B. subtilis cytochrome c551 is a lipoprotein also, as suggested from the amino acid sequence, was confirmed by the finding that it could be efficiently extracted from LUH36/pLUJ104 membranes using cholate. In contrast, the CccA-CccB fusion protein, which contains a peptide membrane anchor, was poorly extractable from membranes of LUH36/pLUJ105 by cholate but, as expected, was solubilized by Triton X-100.Table IIBiochemical properties of cytochrome c551 of B. subtilis compared to that of Bacillus PS3PropertiesB. subtilisBacillus PS3Number of amino acid residues2-aIn the processed polypeptide.9293Isoelectric point (pI)3.84.0Extinction coefficient32 mm−1 cm−120.9 mm−1 cm−1(Reduced minus oxidized)(A551 −A535)(A551 −A535)Midpoint redox potential>100 mV225 mVAbsorption maxima at room temperature Oxidized409 nm409 nm Reduced416, 522, 551 nm2-bThe numbers given are within an experimental error of ±0.7 nm.416, 522, 551 nm2-a In the processed polypeptide.2-b The numbers given are within an experimental error of ±0.7 nm. Open table in a new tab A small cytochrome c has recently been isolated and characterized from the Gram-positive photosynthetic bacterium Heliobacterium gestii. This 18-kDa cytochrome c553 is a lipoprotein similar to CccB, the function of which, like that of CccB, remains unknown. It contains palmitate and stearate in the lipid moiety at the N terminus (33Albert I. Rutherford A.W. Grav H. Kellermann J. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9001-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c551 of Bacillus PS3 has been shown to contain two palmitate residues. We have not been able to detect radioactivity in CccB polypeptide after growth of LUH20/pLUJ104 in the presence of [3H]palmitate followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of isolated membranes and autoradiography. This negative result can be explained by the low amount of CccB in the membrane and/or by the fact that the cytochrome contains fatty acid residues with an acyl chain shorter than that of palmitate. The heme domains of CccA and CccB seem from the amino acid sequence to belong to a family of small c-type cytochromes found in Bacillus species (34 and this work).B. subtilis cytochrome c550 and c551 differ essentially only in the way they are anchored to the membrane (Fig. 7). The very similar amino acid sequence and redox properties of the heme domain of these two cytochromes indicate that they might serve the same, yet unknown, function in electron transfer in the membrane. If so, B. subtilis would be endowed with two different membrane-anchoring systems for a conserved cytochrome c domain, each of which may offer a distinct advantage under specific growth conditions. Mutants, e.g. LUH36, lacking both these cytochromes grow as well as the parental strain, suggesting that the growth conditions used in the laboratory do not require any of the two cytochromes. It is possible that, under certain natural environmental conditions, B. subtilis may preferentially resort to lipid mediated anchoring to the cytoplasmic membrane, i.e. use CccB rather than CccA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of two homologous membrane proteins with different types of membrane anchors that coexist in one organism. The close similarity between cytochrome c551 of B. subtilis and Bacillus PS3 suggests that they fulfill the same function in their respective bacterium. In Bacillus PS3, c551 is a major cytochrome, whereas a cytochrome c corresponding to B. subtilis cytochrome c550 has not been found. The function of cytochrome c551 in Bacillus PS3 has been investigated by Sone et al. (35Sone N. Kutoh E. Sato K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This cytochrome is mainly synthesized under air-limited conditions and is efficiently oxidized by a novel cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome ba3/bo3 (36Sakamoto J. Handa Y. Sone N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 764-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structural genes, cbaAB, of this oxidase have recently been sequenced (37Nikaido K. Noguchi S. Sakamoto J. Sone N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). If cytochrome c551 specifically interacts with cytochrome ba3/bo3 to donate electrons, B. subtilis would contain such an oxidase also. However, genes corresponding to cbaA or cbaB were not found in the genome of B. subtilis 168. This leaves open the question whether cytochrome c551 is required for the reduction of cytochrome ba3/bo3 only or whether it may have other functions."

Progesterone (PG) increased IGFBP-5 expression in normal human osteoblasts and increased IGFBP-5 transcription in U2 human osteosarcoma cells. We developed a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct containing the human IGFBP-5 proximal promoter sequence, which includes TATA and CAAT boxes, and five putative PG response element half-sites. 10−8m PG increased promoter activity of this construct in U2 cells co-transfected with a PG receptor isoform A (PRA) expression vector. Analysis of 5′ deletion constructs indicates that PG transactivation of IGFBP-5 promoter activity does not require the PG response element half-sites but does require the region −162 to −124 containing two tandem CACCC box sequences. Mutation of the proximal CACCC box at −139 eliminated PG transactivation. Gel shift assays using a −162 to −124 DNA fragment, U2 cell nuclear extracts, and purified PRA protein indicate that nuclear factors bind to a CACCC sequence at −139 and that PRA alters the pattern of transcription factor interaction with the CACCC sequence. Using a luciferase reporter construct containing base pairs −252 to +24 of the IGFBP-5 promoter, we found that both PRA and PRB isoforms mediated PG stimulation of promoter activity. These results suggest that PG may stimulate IGFBP-5 gene transcription via a novel mechanism involving PR and CACCC-binding factors.

These results suggest that PG may stimulate IGFBP-5 gene transcription via a novel mechanism involving PR and CACCC-binding factors. insulin-like growth factor-binding protein insulin-like growth factor progesterone progesterone receptor chloramphenicol acetyltransferase base pairs β-galactosidase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium calf serum charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum PG response element mouse mammary tumor virus 2-{[tris-(hydroxymethyl)]-methylamino}-ethanesulfonic acid electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s) retinoblastoma control element myocyte nuclear factor glucocorticoid response element Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 (IGFBP-5)1 belongs to a family of six structurally related proteins that are unrelated to the IGF receptors and that bind IGF-I and IGF-II with high affinity (1Rechler M.M.

IGFBPs modulate the mitogenic and metabolic activities of the IGFs in vitro, suggesting an important role in IGF physiology in vivo. Of the various IGFBPs, IGFBP-5 is unique in that it stimulates IGF-induced osteoblastic cell proliferation when added simultaneously with IGF I or II to serum-free osteoblast-like cell cultures (4Andress D.

In addition, IGFBP-5 binds with high affinity to hydroxyapatite and to various extracellular matrix proteins, properties that are consistent with a role for this binding protein in fixing IGFs to extracellular matrices including mineralized bone (7Mohan S.

Pertinent to this study, we found that progesterone (PG) stimulated human osteoblast cell proliferation (25Tremollieres F.A. Strong D.D. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Acta Endocrinol. 1992; 126: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26Scheven B.A. Damen C.A. Hamilton N.J. Verhaar H.J. Duursma S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Calcium Regulating Hormones. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1992: 239-243Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which PG increased IGFBP-5 mRNA levels is not known. As a first step toward understanding how bone cell production of IGFBP-5 is regulated by PG, we isolated the 5′-flanking region of the human IGFBP-5 gene, linked the IGFBP-5 proximal promoter to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter, and measured basal and progesterone-inducible promoter activity in transient transfection assays with U2 human osteosarcoma cells. We also examined the roles of progesterone receptor isoforms PRA and PRB in mediating PG induction of IGFBP-5 transcription. PRs are expressed in various cells as two different isoforms that are transcribed from separate promoters in the PR gene (28Schrader W.T. Birnbaumer M.E. Hughes M.R. Weigel N.L. Grody W.W.

U2 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% CS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere composed of 95% air and 5% CO2. In most experiments, cells were changed to phenol red-free DMEM and CD-FBS (described below). PG was dissolved in ethanol at 10−2m and was further diluted with serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin before adding to the cells. Control cultures were treated with ethanol diluted to the same extent as for PG treatment. Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures by a single-step acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA was subjected to Northern analysis as described previously (23Chevalley T. Strong D.D. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Linkhart T.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using Magnagraph hybridization membranes (MSI, Westboro, MA). The human IGFBP-5 cDNA was a 0.35-kilobase fragment containing the coding region of exon 1 and was labeled with 32P and hybridized as described (23Chevalley T. Strong D.D. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Linkhart T.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Relative abundance of each mRNA species was quantitated by laser densitometry (Biomed Instruments, Fullerton, CA) and corrected as described (39Strong D.D. Beachler A.L. Wergedal J.E. Linkhart T.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for the amounts of RNA transferred to the hybridization membrane by dividing the densities of 28 S rRNA bands that were stained with methylene blue before hybridization. Relative mRNA levels are presented as the ratio of treated to control. The effect of PG on the rate of IGFBP-5 gene transcription was determined with a modified nuclear run-on analysis as described (40Celeno P. Bechtold C. Casero R.A. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 942-944PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, U2 cells were treated with 10 nm PG or with vehicle for 1 and 4 h. The cells were rinsed and scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, nuclei were isolated, and then nuclei were incubated in transcription buffer consisting of 0.6 m KCl, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm of ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 100 μCi of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). RNA was isolated and equal amounts (2 × 106 dpm) were hybridized to 10 μg of alkali-denatured plasmid DNAs (IGFBP-5 cDNA, β-actin cDNA, and pBluescript DNA) that had been immobilized to Hybond-N filters. The filters were hybridized in a solution containing 10 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 0.6m NaCl at 68 °C for 48 h. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice with 6× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min and once with 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 30 min and autoradiographed with two DuPont Cronex III intensifying screens for 3 days. The relative intensity of each band on the autoradiographs was quantitated by laser densitometry (Biomed Instruments, Fullerton, CA). A mixture of two oligodeoxynucleotides, 5′-CCCAGGTAAGAGGAGAGGAA-3′ and 5′-CTGGCTAGAGGAGGAGACA-3′, corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the human IGFBP-5 gene, was labeled with [γ-32P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide Kinase and was used to screen 6 × 106 clones of a human cosmid (pWE15) library derived from placental DNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Positive clones were rescreened with a human IGFBP-5 full-length coding region cDNA probe. DNA from a selected clone was digested with restriction enzymes Eco RI, Pst I, Sac I, Bam HI, and Hin dIII, and analyzed by Southern blot using a 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide, 5′-ACTCTCGCTCTCCTGCCCCA-3′, corresponding to the 5′-untranslated exon 1 region of human IGFBP-5. A 4.6-kilobase Eco RI fragment was gel purified and subcloned into pGEM3Zf(−) (Promega, Madison, WI). Both DNA strands of the fragment were sequenced with the dideoxy chain termination method (41Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). It contained 1390 bp of 5′-flanking region, all of exon 1, and 2.9 kilobases of intron 1. Primer extension analysis was carried out as described (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.79-7.87Google Scholar). Seven IGFBP-5 promoter-reporter constructs containing 753, 461, 345, 325, 252, 162, and 124 bp of IGFBP-5 5′-flanking region were prepared by inserting selected restriction enzyme fragments or polymerase chain reaction products into a CAT reporter gene vector pJFCAT1 (43Fridocich-Kiel J.L. Gudas J.M. Bryan I.B. Pardee A.B. BioTechniques. 1989; 5: 572-579Google Scholar). For pCAT162 CACCC box mutants, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides with the sequence corresponding to BP5-PDREm1 flanked by Sph I sites were synthesized, annealed and inserted in the sense orientation into the Sph I site of pCAT124 upstream of the IGFBP-5 5′-flanking region. The IGFBP-5 promoter fragment from −252 to +24 bp was subcloned to pGEM7 and then to pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) to create the luciferase reporter construct pLUC-252. The sequence and orientation of all promoter constructs used were confirmed using the dideoxy method. To determine basal promoter activities of the IGFBP-5 promoter CAT constructs, 3 × 105 U2 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% CS. After 18 h of incubation, cells were rinsed once with DMEM and 1.6 ml of DMEM containing 12 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 6 μg of Qiagen purified DNA (5 μg of CAT construct + 1 μg of pCMVβ-gal) was added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, in 95% air, 5% CO2. Medium was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% CS and cells were incubated for 48 h before β-gal and CAT assay. To evaluate the effect of PG on promoter activity, U2 cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 5% CD-FBS for 72 h before transfection. U2 cells were plated at 2 × 105/dish and, in most experiments, were transfected with 2 μg of phPR-A plasmid (44Vegeto E. Shahbaz M.M. Wen D.X. Goldman M.E. O'Malley B.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), 3 μg of IGFBP-5 promoter construct, and 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal. After transfection, cells were incubated in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 2% CD-FBS for 24 h. Medium was then replaced with phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 2% CD-FBS, plus 10 nm PG or solvent, for another 24 h. Cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer. CAT and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described (45Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 46Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and CAT activity was expressed per unit of β-galactosidase activity. To evaluate transactivation of IGFBP-5 promoter activity in a luciferase reporter construct, cells were plated in 6-well plates at 120,000/well. All incubation, transfection, and treatment procedures were as described for the CAT reporter construct studies except that amounts of pLUC-252 and pCMV-β-gal were 0.375 and 0.125 μg/well, respectively, phPR-A (and phPR-B) were tested at 0.0625–0.50 μg/well, and total DNA added was kept constant at 1.0 μg/well by adding pGEM7 plasmid DNA. Luciferase activities were determined using the Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit (Pharmingen, San Diegao, CA). Because this assay was less complex to perform than the CAT assay, experiments were done with 6 replicate wells/group. Statistical analysis of differences between groups by analysis of variance was done using the Systat computer program (Systat Inc., Evanstan, IL). U2 cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells per 100 mm dish in 5% CD-FBS for 18 h. The medium was replaced with 2% CD-FBS and incubated for 48 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (47Dignam D. Lebowitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). For the EMSA, the binding reaction contained 4% glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 1.5 μl (3 μg of protein) of nuclear extract, and 1 μl (50,000 cpm) of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides in a total volume of 20 μl. For cold competition experiments, nuclear extract was preincubated with unlabeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides. The oligodeoxynucleotides used for competition with the labeled IGFBP-5 CACCC box sequence are described under “Materials.” The mouse mammary tumor virus PRE oligodeoxynucleotide was a double-stranded 28-mer based on the sequence 189–162 bp 5′ of the transcription start site and was described previously (37DeMarzo A.M. Beck C.A. Onate S.A. Edwards D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Purified PRA was obtained from a baculovirus expression system and purified as described (31Onate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Reeves M. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate PR interactions with U2 cell nuclear factors, different concentrations of PR proteins were preincubated with 5 μg of U2 cell nuclear extract protein before the addition of labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and analyzed by electrophoresis using a 5% polyacrylamide-0.125% bis-acrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE. For supershift experiments, 1 μg of anti-PR antibody PR52 (41Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) was added to the reaction and incubated on ice for an additional 15 min before loading onto the gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and autoradiographed using Kodak X-OMAT or Biomax MS film and Cronex III screens. The GenBankTM data base accession number of the human IGFBP-5 5′-flanking region determined in this study is U20271. Previously we found that PG increased IGFBP-5 mRNA levels in normal human osteoblasts and in MG63 and U2-OS osteosarcoma cells (27Lempert U.G. Strong D.D. Mohan S. Demarest K. Baylink D.J. Cohn D.V. Gennari C. Tashjian A.J. Calcium Regulating Hormones. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1992: 239-243Google Scholar). In the present study we replicated this earlier finding with normal human vertebral osteoblasts and determined whether the progestin antagonist RU486 would affect PG induction of IGFBP-5 expression. Treatment with 10−8m PG for 4 h increased IGFBP-5 mRNA levels to 190% of control (Fig. 1). 10−6mRU486 by itself did not affect IGFBP-5 mRNA levels and prevented the increase in IGFBP-5 mRNA levels induced by PG. These results support the conclusion that PG increases IGFBP-5 expression by a PR-dependent mechanism. U2 cells were selected to investigate the mechanism of PG action in the present study because both IGFBP-5 expression and transfection efficiency were higher in this cell type than in other human osteoblast-like cell lines. PG treatment for 1 h increased IGFBP-5 gene transcription determined by nuclear run-on analysis to 334% of control (p < 0.002), whereas the rate of β-actin gene transcription was not significantly altered (Fig. 2). After 4 h of PG treatment, the IGFBP-5 transcription rates in both the treated and control groups were elevated such that the difference between PG-treated and control groups was less compared with that found after 1 h of PG treatment (data not shown). To determine whether PG effected IGFBP-5 mRNA stability, U2 cells were treated with PG for 4 h, and thereafter RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription was inhibited with 4 × 10−5m5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole-1-β-d-ribofuranoside. IGFBP-5 mRNA levels in control and PG-treated cultures were determined at 5–24 h by Northern analysis. In these experiments, IGFBP-5 mRNA half-life was estimated to be approximately 24 h and was not affected by PG (data not shown). The long IGFBP-5 mRNA half-life and absence of a PG effect on half-life are consistent with the results of nuclear run-on analysis, suggesting that PG rapidly increased IGFBP-5 mRNA levels in human osteoblasts primarily by a transcriptional mechanism. We isolated a pWE15 human genomic cosmid clone containing the IGFBP-5 gene and then isolated a 4.6-kilobase Eco RI fragment containing the 5′-flanking region. The nucleotide sequence from position −461 through the first exon was identical to that reported previously (12Allander S.V. Larsson C.L. Ehrenborg E. Suwanichakul A. Weber G. Morris S.L. Bajalica S. Kiefer M.C. Luthman H. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10891-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal 5′-flanking region contains a TATA box, a CAAT box, and several putative response elements. Primer extension analysis in U2 cells confirmed a single transcription start site 33 nucleotides from the TATA box (data not shown) that was reported previously in a study of human breast cancer cells (12Allander S.V. Larsson C.L. Ehrenborg E. Suwanichakul A. Weber G. Morris S.L. Bajalica S. Kiefer M.C. Luthman H. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10891-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the putative IGFBP-5 promoter functioned in human osteoblasts, CAT reporter constructs were made containing a Pst I fragment from −753 to +23 (pCAT753) and a 484-bp Hin dIII/Pst I fragment from −461 to +23 (pCAT461). U2 cells were transiently transfected with sense reporter constructs, antisense constructs, or the pJFCAT1 promoterless control vector and then incubated for 48 h in medium with 10% CS. CAT activity in cells that were transfected with pCAT753 or pCAT461 sense constructs was 620 and 730%, respectively, of CAT activity in cells transfected with pJFCAT1. In contrast, CAT activity did not increase in U2 cells transfected with antisense promoter constructs. In experiments for assessing effects of PG treatment, concentrations of steroids and other factors in serum were minimized by maintaining U2 cells for 72 h in phenol red-free DMEM plus 5% CD-FBS and then plating the cells in 5% CD-FBS at"
https://openalex.org/W2061936627,"Acetylcholine receptor inducing activity (ARIA) is made by motoneurons and is released at the neuromuscular synapse to stimulate the synthesis of acetylcholine receptors by skeletal muscle. ARIA is derived from a transmembrane precursor (pro-ARIA) via proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomain. We studied requirements in the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site with various substitution and deletion mutations. Wild type (WT) and mutant proteins were transiently expressed in COS cells, and release of ARIA into the conditioned medium was measured by tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor, p185, in L6 cells. Removal of all potential cleavage sites between the extracellular epidermal growth factor domain and the transmembrane domain by substitution and small deletions (<11 amino acid residues out of 21) did not significantly reduce ARIA release, whereas larger deletions abolished it. We propose that cleavage occurs independently of amino acid sequence at a short distance from the epidermal growth factor domain, unless sterically hindered by the nearby secondary structure. A mutant with shorter cytoplasmic domain (“c” isoform) released significantly less ARIA than the WT (“a” isoform), suggesting that the c isoform may be suitable for signaling through direct cell-cell contact. Alternatively, proteolytic conversion of the a isoform to the c isoform may rapidly down-regulate release of ARIA.

Gwynne D. Nature. 1993; 362: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). ARIA and many other NRGs are derived from transmembrane precursor proteins (pro-ARIA or pro-NRG, respectively) via proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomain. Considering that an EGF-like domain, located in the membrane proximal half of the extracellular segment, is crucial for all biological actions of NRGs (reviewed in Ref. 7Carraway III, K.L. Burden S.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), proteolytic cleavage of pro-ARIA must occur between the extracellular EGF-like domain and the transmembrane domain in order to release functional ARIA. The C-terminal end of the EGF-like domain can be functionally defined as Met185 (see Fig. 1 a), because a synthetic NRG ending with this residue was fully functional, and this methionine was critical for receptor activation (8Barbacci E.G. Guarino B.C. Stroh J.G. Singleton D.H. Rosnack K.J. Moyer J.D. Andrews G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9585-9589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In transfected CHO cells, significant portion of pro-ARIA is expressed at the cell surface before it is cleaved to release ARIA (9Burgess T.L. Ross S.L. Qian Y. Brankow D. Hu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19188-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Loeb J.A. Susanto E.T. Fischbach G.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cleavage of pro-ARIA appears to involve a protein kinase C-dependent step because it can be stimulated by treatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C activator (9Burgess T.L.

Neurosci. 1998; 11: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the processing enzyme remains elusive. It is clear that NRG plays an important role at the developing and mature nerve-muscle synapses. The number of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors is reduced in heterozygous NRG knockout (NRG+/−) mice (11Sandrock Jr., A.W. Dryer S.E. Rosen K.M. Gozani S.N. Kramer R. Theill L.E. Fischbach G.D. Science. 1997; 276: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Homozygous knockout mice (NRG−/−) die by embryonic day 10 before neuromuscular junction develops (12Meyer D. Birchmeier C.

It is not clear if this action of NRG depends on an action of cleaved and “soluble” NRG or if the transmembrane form is biologically active. In certain cases, transmembrane form of growth factors are not simply precursors for the soluble counterparts, but they can signal through direct cell-cell contact (juxtacrine signaling) (14Kriegler M. Perez C. DeFay K. Albert I. Lu S.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 15Wong S.T. Winchell L.F. McCune B.K. Earp H.S. Teixido J. Massague J. Herman B.

In the case of TNFα, juxtacrine signaling mediated by pro-TNFα may mediate local inflammatory responses, whereas systemic signaling through soluble TNFα may be responsible for septic shock or cachexia (14Kriegler M. Perez C. DeFay K. Albert I. Lu S.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Therefore, proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane form of these molecules may be viewed as an important regulatory mechanism in deciding between signaling at a distance (paracrine) versus signaling through contact (juxtacrine) rather than simply regulating the amount of soluble factors. In this paper, we examine the constraints on the amino acid sequence of pro-ARIA at the cleavage site. We also examine potential differences between different isoforms of pro-ARIA in release of soluble ARIA. Plasmid DNA derived from pcDNAI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing full-length cDNA for pro-ARIA has been described earlier (2Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the pro-ARIA was performed by Kunkel's method (19Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) using the Mutagen kit (Bio-Rad). Mutagenic oligonucleotides often contained an additional silent mutation to create a restriction site, which was used for screening of the mutants. All mutations and lack of additional unwanted mutation were confirmed by sequencing the entire coding region of pro-ARIA. Plasmid DNA was purified with a Qiagen kit (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) before sequencing and transfection into COS cells. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (DMEM+). Cells were split 1 day before transfection into 24-well plates at a density of 20–30% confluence. On the day of transfection, 400 ng of plasmid DNA was used to transfect cells in 1 well using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, the cells were incubated with DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture for 6 h in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) before fetal calf serum was added to 10%. The following day, cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM and incubated for 10 h with Opti-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum to allow recovery of the cells. To collect conditioned medium for measurement of steady-state release of ARIA, medium was replaced with Opti-MEM containing 2 mm CaCl2 and further incubated for 48 h. Conditioned medium was filtered through 0.22-μm filter to remove floating cells and stored frozen until p185 phosphorylation assay. After collecting conditioned medium, total cell lysates were obtained by adding 100 μl of 2× strength SDS-PAGE sample buffer to each well. Total cellular expression of precursor proteins was examined by Western blotting of the cell lysates. Proteins were separated in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures. Membrane was blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk solution prepared in PBS, incubated with primary antibody for 1 h in blocking solution, washed three times in PBS for 5 min each, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody in blocking solution, and then washed three times in PBS for 5 min each. Proteins were visualized with Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ARIA was assayed by tyrosine phosphorylation of p185 in L6 muscle cells basically as described (20Corfas G. Falls D.L. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. L6 cells were grown in DMEM+. For p185 phosphorylation assay, cells were seeded into 48-well plates (Costar, Acton, MA) and grown in DMEM+ until they became confluent and fused. Cells became confluent in 4–5 days and began to fuse. In about 10 days after plating, cells fused both laterally and longitudinally forming a large sheet of multinucleated cells, at which time response to ARIA reached maximum sensitivity. Cells maintained maximum responsiveness for about 4–5 days. All the p185 phosphorylation assays were done during this period. After aspirating the growth medium, assay medium was added in 200 μl volume per well and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, assay medium was aspirated, and 50 μl of preheated 2× strength SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to each well. Cell lysates were collected into microcentrifuge tubes, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and stored at −20 °C until analysis by Western blotting. Samples were run in a 5% gel until the 130-kDa prestained molecular mass marker (Bio-Rad) reached the bottom of the gel for best separation of the p185 band from non-responding lower molecular weight bands. The rest of the Western blotting was done similarly as described above except that 4G10 antibody (0.3 μg/ml final) was used as a primary antibody in 3% nonfat dry milk, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) was used as a secondary antibody. 4G10 antibody was a gift from Dr. T. Roberts (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston). To compare amounts of ARIA in the conditioned media from cells transfected with mutant constructs with that from wild type (WT)-transfected cells, serial dilutions were made for each conditioned media. p185 phosphorylation assay was performed simultaneously for each of the serially diluted media. L6 cell lysates were run in the same gel for all the samples to be compared. X-ray film containing the Western blotting results was scanned with a flat bed scanner in transmissive mode at 600 dpi, 256 gray scale. The resulting digitized image was imported into ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Band intensity of the p185 from different samples was measured by drawing a rectangular box of identical size around each p185 band and measuring integrated intensity using built-in volume-reporter function. A calibration curve was generated using p185 band intensity by each of the serial dilutions of the WT conditioned medium. The amount of ARIA in undiluted medium was calculated for each mutant using the calibration curve by linear regression. To compare total cellular expression of the precursor protein for each mutant with that of the WT, serial dilutions were made for each cell lysate in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Western blotting and quantitation was performed in a similar manner as above. Data for qualitative and quantitative comparisons were obtained from separate transfection experiments. Transfection of COS cells was performed similarly as described above with minor modifications. Cells were transfected in a 100-mm dish and incubated with DMEM+ for 24 h after recovery from transfection. On the day of PMA stimulation, cells were washed once and incubated for 1 h with prewarmed DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After collecting the medium for basal release of ARIA, cells were washed once and incubated under the same condition with an additional 100 nm PMA for stimulated release. Collected conditioned media were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter to remove floating cells, then concentrated 20-fold using Centricon-10 (Millipore) before serial dilutions were made, and p185 phosphorylation activity was assayed. PMA was initially made in Me2SO at 1 mmconcentration. Control experiments with purified NRG showed that 100 nm PMA did not interfere with the p185 phosphorylation assay, although a 10-fold higher concentration significantly reduced the phosphorylation response. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and reseeded into 8-well glass chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) precoated with laminin. Immunolabeling was performed on the following day. For labeling of cell surface pro-ARIA, cells were washed and prechilled with cold DMEM before they were incubated with 183 antiserum for 1.5 h on ice. Antiserum 183 was raised against the whole pro-ARIA. Cells were washed with cold DMEM twice, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and washed thoroughly with PBS. Fixed cells were then incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature and washed thoroughly with PBS. Antibody 1310, directed against the cytoplasmic domain of pro-ARIA, gave no detectable staining under the same condition. For labeling of total cellular pro-ARIA, cells were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. Antibody 1310 was used as a primary antibody for labeling of total cellular pro-ARIA. Even when permeabilization with Triton X-100 was omitted, fixation with paraformaldehyde alone apparently allowed access of primary antibody to the intracellular space because clear staining of transfected cells was visible. Slides were mounted with 5%n-propyl gallate in 50% glycerol and then viewed and photographed under rhodamine filter. CHO cells stably expressing WT pro-ARIA have been described earlier and were maintained accordingly (10Loeb J.A. Susanto E.T. Fischbach G.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 12-well plates to near confluence were washed once and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with DMEM containing different treatment reagents. Conditioned medium was centrifuged to remove floating cells, and then treatment reagents were added to adjust for differences. Thus, all conditioned media contained equal concentrations of EDTA, o-phenanthroline (OP), PMA, ZnCl2, and CaCl2 when p185 phosphorylation assay was performed to measure released ARIA. OP was initially made as 5 m concentration in EtOH. Cleavage of pro-ARIA must occur between the C-terminal end of the EGF domain (Met185) and the transmembrane domain to release functional ARIA. The transmembrane domain was predicted to begin with Val207 based on the hydropathy analysis and the presence of adjacent charged residues (see Ref. 2Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We call this region including Ala186 and Arg206 the “stalk.” Deletion of a large portion of the stalk (>15 amino acid residues out of 21) prevented release of functional ARIA into the medium without affecting expression of the precursor proteins (Figs. 1 and2). WT and mutant proteins were transiently expressed in COS cells, and the ARIA released into conditioned medium was assayed by its ability to phosphorylate tyrosine residues on a p185 in L6 muscle cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). p185 is a broad band containing NRG receptors in extracts of L6 cells that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 185 kDa. The intensity of p185 band on Western blot was concentration-dependent over a wide range of NRG concentration. We routinely detected NRG at levels as low as 10 pm using this assay, whereas the response did not saturate until 1 nm concentration (see Fig. 7). ARIA in the conditioned medium could not be directly detected by Western blotting method using currently available antibodies, probably due to lower sensitivity or lack of cross-reactivity between species. Conditioned medium from the WT-transfected cells contained high levels of ARIA as measured by p185 phosphorylation activity, whereas those from mock-transfected cells had no activity (Fig. 1 b). A doublet of slightly lower molecular mass (about 150 kDa) that did not respond to ARIA served as an internal control for loading of equal amount of proteins. ARIA from the WT conditioned medium was readily detectable even when the conditioned medium was diluted 10-fold (data not shown). On the contrary, conditioned media from cells transfected with large deletion mutants (delA, delB, and delC in Fig. 1 a) contained no detectable phosphorylation activity (Fig. 1 b), indicating that these mutants were defective in release of functional ARIA. We considered four explanations for lack of functional ARIA from cells transfected with these mutants. First, the mutant proteins might not be expressed in the transfected COS cells. When WT-transfected cell lysates were examined by Western blotting method, two sets of broad bands (each migrating similarly with 83- and 51-kDa molecular mass markers) were observed using an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain of pro-ARIA (antibody (Ab) 1310 in Fig.1 c). Only the upper set of bands was recognized by an antibody directed against the extracellular Ig domain (antibody (Ab) HM94 in Fig. 1 c). This upper set of bands is most likely the full-length transmembrane precursor (bracket in Fig.1 c) because it contains both extracellular and cytoplasmic epitopes. Heterogeneity in the size of the bands is probably due to variable glycosylation of the protein. The remnant, defined as the transmembrane plus cytoplasmic domain after cleavage of the ectodomain, is expected to run as a single band with a molecular mass of 44–46 kDa, depending on the exact cleavage site within the stalk. Among the lower set of bands detected by the 1310 antibody but not by the HM94 antibody, a prominent band with an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa was assigned as the remnant (open arrowhead in Fig.1 c). Other bands may correspond to partial degradation products. A significant level of expression was detected for the precursors of all three mutants (bracket in Fig.1 c, right panel) when expression was measured in the same cells from which conditioned media were collected. One of the mutants (delB) actually showed a higher level of expression than the WT. Therefore, lack of ARIA in the conditioned media from the mutant-transfected cells was not due to lack of expression of the precursor proteins. Second, the mutant proteins might be expressed but not delivered to the cell surface, perhaps due to disruption of a necessary signaling motif. In stably transfected CHO cells, a significant portion of pro-NRG reaches the cell surface before it is cleaved (9Burgess T.L. Ross S.L. Qian Y. Brankow D. Hu S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19188-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10Loeb J.A. Susanto E.T. Fischbach G.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 77-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We examined the cell surface expression of these proteins following transient transfection into COS cells. Unfixed, transfected COS cells were incubated with antiserum 183, raised against the whole pro-ARIA, without permeabilization to prevent access of the primary antibody to the intracellular space. Incubation was done on ice to prevent internalization of the antibody. All of the mutants (delA, delB, and delC) as well as the WT pro-ARIA were readily detected at the cell surface (Fig. 2) upon examination of the labeled cells with fluorescence microscopy. The pattern of labeling was consistent with localization at the cell surface and was easily distinguishable from cells that were fixed and permeabilized before incubation with the primary antibody (Fig. 2, top panels). Labeling of permeabilized cells showed staining of a meshwork structure consistent with labeling of the trans-Golgi network (Fig. 2, WT-total). Occasionally, a bright perinuclear staining was visible. On the contrary, cell surface labeling gave numerous small punctate staining patches with the brightest staining at the cell periphery. The pattern of cell surface labeling showed no meshwork but was consistent with the three-dimensional contour of the cell surface. Cotransfection experiments with green fluorescent protein confirmed that those cells that were labeled with pro-ARIA antibody were the cells that received plasmid DNA during transfection (data not shown). There was no noticeable difference in the intensity and frequency of labeled cells among the mutants and the WT. Therefore, lack of ARIA in the conditioned media from the mutant-transfected cells was not due to lack of cell surface expression. Third, cleavage might have occurred within the EGF domain of the mutants and destroyed the activity of ARIA. Fourth, cleavage of the ectodomain may have been impaired for the mutant proteins either because the cleavage site was eliminated or because of other structural constraints. The results of the Western blotting analysis were more consistent with lack of ectodomain cleavage for these mutants than with destruction of activity by cleavage within the EGF domain. The remnant band, clearly seen from the WT-transfected cell lysate (open arrowhead in Fig. 1 c), was almost completely missing in the delC-transfected cell lysate. Other large deletion mutants also showed marked reduction in the intensity of this band. We attempted to localize the precise cleavage site within the stalk. First, we examined if the pair of basic residues at the juxtamembrane position (Lys205–Arg206) was a major cleavage site. Many prohormones and proproteins contain pairs of basic amino acid residues that are cleaved by subtilisin-like proteases (21Thomas G. Thorne B.A. Thomas L. Allen R.G. Hruby D.E. Fuller R. Thorner J.

To eliminate the potential cleavage site while preserving the putative boundary between the transmembrane and the extracellular domain, we simultaneously substituted Lys205 to Glu and Arg206 to Asp (KR/ED mutant; Fig.3 a). The amount of ARIA released into the medium from KR/ED-transfected cells showed no decrease when compared with WT (Fig. 3 b, upper panel). Total cellular expression level of the precursor proteins was similar between WT and the KR/ED mutant (Fig. 3 b, lower panel). Therefore, elimination of dibasic residues did not significantly reduce release of ARIA. Quantitative comparison of the released ARIA and total cellular expression of the precursor between the WT and the KR/ED mutant confirmed this conclusion (Fig. 3 d). To quantitate released ARIA, serial dilutions were made for conditioned media, and the p185 phosphorylation activity was assayed for each of them. The amount of ARIA in the conditioned medium for the mutant was quantified using a calibration curve generated by serial dilutions of the WT conditioned medium and, therefore, was expressed as relative to the WT (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cellular expression levels of the precursors were also quantified in a similar manner using serial dilutions of the cell lysates. In this transfection experiment, the amount of released ARIA for the KR/ED mutant was reduced to half of WT, but this was explained adequately by the reduced expression of the precursor (Fig. 3 d). The ratio of the released ARIA to precursor expression represents efficiency of ARIA release normalized for protein expression. The efficiency of ARIA release thus defined was not decreased for the KR/ED mutant compared with the WT (solid bar in Fig. 3 d). We conclude that the juxtamembrane dibasic residues are not a major cleavage site for pro-ARIA. Next, we made a series of small (4–6 amino acid residues) deletions to cover the rest of the entire stalk (Fig. 3 a, delD, delE, delF, and delG). Unlike the large deletion mutations (delA, delB, and delC), none of these small deletions affected the release of ARIA from the transfected cells (Fig.3 c). Total cellular expression levels of the precursor proteins were similar between the WT and the mutants. Quantitative comparison of the ARIA release and precursor expression between the mutants and the WT (Fig. 3 d) confirmed the conclusion that none of these deletions deleteriously affected efficiency of ARIA release. In this experiment, delE mutant showed a 50% increase in the expression of the precursor protein compared with the WT, with a similar increase in ARIA release. Concomitant increase in ARIA release with increased precursor expression also demonstrated that the capacity of the transfected cells to process pro-ARIA was not saturated, validating the method of comparison. Failure to prevent release of ARIA by any of the small deletions and substitutions strongly suggested t"

One isolated protein bound both a Sea-immunoglobulin fusion protein and an antisera raised against murine macrophage stimulating protein. Amino-terminal sequencing of the dual-reactive protein yielded sequences which were identical to the predicted α and β subunits of chicken macrophage stimulating protein. The partially purified chicken macrophage stimulating protein caused autophosphorylation of the Sea receptor. Previous work showed that recombinant expression of fully activatible human or mouse macrophage stimulating protein required a specific Cys to Ala substitution (Wahl, R. C., Costigan, V. J., Batac, J. P., Chen, K., Cam, L., Courchesne, P. L., Patterson, S. D. Zhang, K., and Pacifici, R. E. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 1–4). Therefore, we expressed both the wild type and the specific Cys to Ala form of chicken macrophage stimulating protein as recombinant proteins. After proteolytic activation, only conditioned media from COS cells transfected with the C665A chicken macrophage stimulating protein, but not from wild type chicken macrophage-stimulating protein, or control vector, was detected by the Sea-immunoglobulin fusion protein in Western blotting experiments. Conditioned media containing the C665A chicken macrophage-stimulating protein readily caused Sea phosphorylation, while conditioned media containing the wild type chicken macrophage-stimulating protein was only effective at inducing receptor phosphorylation at high concentrations. In addition to receptor phosphorylation, the C665A chicken macrophage-stimulating protein induced phosphorylation of Shc, Erk1, and Erk 2. We conclude that macrophage-stimulating protein is a ligand of the Sea receptor protein-tyrosine kinase.

Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). The binding of ligand to the extracellular domain of these receptors results in rapid intracellular autophosphorylation followed by the phosphorylation of multiple downstream effector proteins (2van der Geer P.

Other members of this subfamily include the RON1/Stk (5Ronsin C. Muscatelli F. Mattei M.G. Breathnach R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1195-1202PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gaudino G. Follenzi A. Naldini L.

A. 1993; 90: 6140-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A common feature of this subfamily is that the mature version of the receptor consist of a heterodimer between a small α chain (∼35 kDa) and a larger β chain (∼160 kDa) which arise from proteolytic cleavage of a precursor protein. The gene encoding Met has been identified in both mammalian and chicken species (3Park M. Dean M. Kaul K. Braun M.J. Gonda M.J. Vande-Woude G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6379-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 4Chan A.M. King H.W. Deakin E.A. Tempest P.R. Hilkens J. Kroezen V. Edwards D.R. Wills A.J. Brookes P. Cooper C.S.

However, RON/Stk has only been identified in mammalian species, while Sea has only been found in chicken species, despite repeated efforts to find orthologs in other species (10Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 699-705PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. A. Welcher, unpublished observations.2A. A. Welcher, unpublished observations. The Sea receptor was originally identified as the cellular homologue of the avian retroviral oncoprotein v-sea. This avian erythroblastosis virus (S13) induced sarcomas, erythroblastosis, and anemia in infected birds (11Stubbs E.L. Furth J. J. Exp. Med. 1935; 61: 593-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Beug H. Hayman M.J. Graf T. Benedict S.H. Wallbank A.M. Vogt P.K. Virology. 1985; 145: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transformation of erythroid cells with the sea oncogene rendered them erythropoietin independent (13Knight J. Zenke M.

Graf T. Cell. 1986; 45: 349-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Sea receptor is a heterodimeric protein composed of a 35-kDa α and a 160-kDa β chain and is expressed at low levels in a variety of tissues including kidney, intestine, liver, stomach, white blood cells, and allantochorion (8Huff J.L. Jelinek M.A. Borgman C.A. Lansing T.J. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6140-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Huff J.L. Jelinek M.A. Jamieson T.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar). Protein comparisons indicate that the extracellular domain of the Sea receptor is more similar to RON (48% identity) or stk (44% identity) than to Met (39% identity). Analysis of the extracellular domain of chicken Met indicates 72% identity to human MET, but only 37% identity to RON. Because a mammalian analog of Sea has not yet been identified, and since a chicken Met gene but not a chicken Ron gene has been identified, it is possible that RON and Sea are orthologous receptors. However, definitive data has not yet been obtained to support or refute this hypothesis. Analysis of downstream signaling events indicated that activation of the Sea intracellular domain (fused to the extracellular domain of Trk and activated by nerve growth factor) triggered similar biological responses to those of RON or Met when these receptors were stimulated by their respective ligands (16Medico E. Mongiovi A.M. Huff J. Jelinek M.A. Follenzi A. Guadino G. Parsons J.T. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A family of related proteins serve as ligands for these receptors. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/scatter factor) is the ligand for Met (17Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L.

Michalopoulos G.K. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1991; 4: 501-504Google Scholar), and macrophage-stimulating protein/hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (MSP) is the ligand for RON/Stk (19Gaudino G.

Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The ligand for the Sea receptor has not yet been identified. The known ligands are part of an extended family of related proteins which includes plasminogen. Like plasminogen, these growth factors require proteolytic cleavage between homologous Arg-Val residues, which generates heterodimeric disulfide-bonded subunits, for biological activity (21Wang M.H. Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3436-3440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both HGF and MSP are ∼80-kDa heterodimeric proteins which are found in plasma (22Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3314-3320PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguichi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A number of studies indicated that HGF has mitogenic, morphogenic, and motogenic effects on a variety of cell types (reviewed in Ref. 24Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 1177-1180Crossref Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Likewise, MSP has been shown to have a variety of biological activities, particularly on cells of the hematopoetic lineage. It induced macrophage shape change and chemotactic migration (25Leonard E.J. Skeel A. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 102: 434Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), apoptosis of an erythroid cell line (26Iwama A. Yamaguchi N. Suda T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5866-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and megakaryocytopoiesis (27Banu N. Price D.J. London R. Deng B. Mark M. Godowski P.J. Avraham H. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2933-2940PubMed Google Scholar). MSP has also been shown to be active on epithelia, bone, and neuroendocrine tissues (28Gaudino G. Avantaggiato V. Follenzi A. Acampora D. Simeone A. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2627-2637PubMed Google Scholar). In order to better understand the biological role of the Sea receptor, we searched for a protein which would act as its ligand. As part of the search, we tested whether chicken MSP (chMSP) could serve as a Sea ligand. Although the gene encoding the chMSP has been cloned (9Thery C. Sharpe M.J. Batley S.J. Stern C.D. Gherardi E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 990Google Scholar), there are no reports of its recombinant expression. We obtained MSP from both a natural source, chicken serum, and a recombinant source in order to study its ability to activate the Sea receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The recombinant expression of activatible human or murine MSP is reported to be problematic due to the presence of a specific Cys residue which interferes with disulfide linkage of the nascent subunits of MSP (1Wahl R.C. Costigan V.J. Batac J.P. Chen K. Cam L. Courchesne P.L. Patterson S.D. Zhang K. Pacifici R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15053-15056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Since the predicted sequence of chMSP, based on the cloned gene, indicated the presence of a similar Cys residue, a Cys to Ala variant of chMSP was also studied. Reported here is our assessment of chMSP as a potential ligand for Sea. The Sea-Fc construct (14Kahn P. Frykberg L. Brady C. Stanley I. Beug H. Vennstroem B. Graf T. Cell. 1986; 45: 349-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells and conditioned media produced as described for other recombinant proteins (29DeClerck Y.A. Yean T.D. Lu H.S. Ting J. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3893-3899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Sea-Fc was purified with a protein G-Sepharose HiTrap column (Mab Trap G II, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. One liter of undialyzed chicken sera (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), containing ∼20 g of protein, was chromatographed on a 80-ml heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 (PBS). The column was washed with PBS to remove unbound proteins, and bound proteins were eluted with 2 mNaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The 2 msalt eluate, containing ∼600 mg of protein in 150 ml, was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C versus PBS, and then serine proteases were inactivated with 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Sea-Fc was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose at 1 mg of Sea-Fc/ml gel, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The heparin-Sepharose eluate was chromatographed on a 1-ml column of Sea-Fc-Sepharose equilibrated with PBS. After sample application, the column was washed with PBS until the A280returned to baseline, then washed with 5 ml of PBS + 0.35 msalt, followed by 10 ml of a high pH elution buffer consisting of 50 mm CAPS, pH 10.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mmCHAPS, 0.005% Tween 20. Both elution buffers eluted well defined peaks of absorbtion at 280 nm containing 1–2 A280units. Fraction 15 (Fig. 1) contained about 1 mg of protein. Unless otherwise stated, chemical reagents came from Sigma, while the molecular biology reagents came from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. SDS-PAGE gels were from Novex (San Diego, CA). Nonreduced samples were mixed with sample buffer containing 2% SDS but not β-mercaptoethanol, and were not heated. For Western blot analyses, separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose or Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with either 5% nonfat dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin and 1% ovalbumin (for anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) blots only) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. For MSP detection, the membranes were incubated with 4–20 μg/ml anti-murine MSP antibodies (raised against murine pro-MSP (1Wahl R.C. Costigan V.J. Batac J.P. Chen K. Cam L. Courchesne P.L.

For Sea-Fc detection, the membranes were incubated with 0.3–0.5 μg/ml Sea-Fc for 1 h at room temperature, followed by goat anti-human IgG (Fc)-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 20 min at room temperature. For Sea detection, the membranes were incubated with 4 μg/ml of the 4E10 antibody (15Huff J.L. Jelinek M.A. Jamieson T.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) for 20 min at room temperature. For anti-Tyr(P) detection, the membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) for 20 min at room temperature. For the Shc and ERK detection experiments, the membranes were incubated either with 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-human Shc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or with 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-ERK 1/2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) for 20 min at room temperature. Bound immune complexes were detected with ECL reagents (Amersham). Amino-terminal sequencing was performed on an Immobilon-PSQ (Millipore, Bedford, MA) blot using a Procise 494 sequencer (PE-ABD, Foster City, CA). 32DSea5-2 cells (15Huff J.L. Jelinek M.A. Jamieson T.A. Parsons J.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and 5% WEHI-3-conditioned medium from WEHI-3 cells. For phosphorylation studies, 32DSea5-2 cells were grown to the exponential proliferative phase, and then switched to the above media containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (starvation media) and grown overnight. A suspension of 1 × 107 cells were spun at 210 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of conditioned (overnight) starvation media and the cells and protein samples were prewarmed separately at 37 °C for 2 min. After the preincubation, cells and protein samples were mixed together and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. To stop the phosphorylation reaction, 10 ml of cold 1× PBS was added to each sample and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 400 μmorthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with either the monoclonal anti-Sea antibody 8C3 (14Kahn P. Frykberg L. Brady C. Stanley I. Beug H. Vennstroem B. Graf T. Cell. 1986; 45: 349-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or anti-Tyr(P) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) at 4 °C overnight. Antibody-antigen complexes were then incubated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 30 min. Immune complexes were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in sample buffer. A full-length cDNA of chMSP was constructed from three fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using as template an adult chicken liver 5′-stretch cDNA library in λgt10 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The primers listed in TableI were designed according to the sequence of GenBank accession number X84043 (9Thery C. Sharpe M.J. Batley S.J. Stern C.D. Gherardi E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 17: 990Google Scholar). Five μl (∼5 × 105 plaque forming units) of phage library was used for each PCR. Amplification was carried out for 35 cycles of 94 °C (15 s), 60 °C (15 s), and 72 °C (90 s) using AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase with the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The 354-bp product generated by oligonucleotides 1 and 2 was digested with the restriction enzymes Xho I and Nar I to 270 bp; the 1245-bp product generated by oligonucleotides 3 and 4 was digested with restriction enzymes Nar I and Bgl II to 936 bp; and the 986-bp product generated by oligonucleotides 5 and 6 was digested with restriction enzymes Bgl II and Eco RI to 975 bp. These three fragments were ligated into the mammalian expression vector pBJ5 (30Welcher A.A. Bitler C.M. Radeke M.J. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The confirmed sequence of this full-length cDNA construct was identical to the published sequence (9Thery C. Sharpe M.J. Batley S.J. Stern C.D. Gherardi E. Dev.

Wild type chicken MSP plasmid and oligonucleotides 8 and 9 containing the Cys to Ala change at nucleotides 2005 and 2006 were used to generate mutated chicken MSP cDNA. The 67-bp product was generated by carrying out 5 cycles at 94 °C (15 s), 60 °C (15 s), and 72 °C (30 s), followed by another 20 cycles at 94 °C (15 s), 64 °C (15 s), and 72 °C (30 s) with oligonucleotides 7 and 8. The 146-bp product was generated by carrying out 5 cycles at 94 °C (15 s), 58 °C (15 s), and 72 °C (30 s), followed by another 20 cycles of 94 °C (15 s), 68 °C (15 s), and 72 °C (30 s) with oligonucleotides 6 and 9. Both amplified fragments were isolated from a polyacrylamide gel and eluted with MAXAM buffer (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0). Equal molar ratios of the two isolated fragments were re-amplified with oligonucleotides 7 and 10 for 25 cycles at 94 °C (15 s), 64 °C (15 s), and 72 °C (30 s) to generate the 192-bp mutated product. The isolated 192-bp fragment was digested with restriction enzymes Apa I and Eco RI to a 149-bp fragment. Wild type chicken MSP plasmid was digested with restriction enzymes Eco RI and Bgl II to generate a 4.6-kilobase fragment, and Bgl II and Apa I to generate the 775-bp fragment. The mutated fragment was then ligated with the 4.6-kilobase and 775-bp fragments to generate the mutated chMSP cDNA in the pBJ5 expression vector. COS-7 cells were transfected as described previously (30Welcher A.A. Bitler C.M. Radeke M.J. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Conditioned media of transfected cells were concentrated by Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). In order to activate recombinant pro-MSP, concentrated conditioned media was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with human kallikrein (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml followed by addition of Pefabloc-SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to stop the proteolytic activation. For some experiments, conditioned media was concentrated 100× by chromatography on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 2 m NaCl. The buffer was exchanged to PBS using Centricon-10 (Amicon Corp.) and activated by kallikrein as above. 30× concentrated, activated conditioned media from COS cells transfected with C665A chMSP was either mock-treated (PBS incubation) or preincubated with 10 or 100 μg of either the Sea-Fc protein or the leptin receptor-Fc protein (an unrelated Fc fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of the leptin receptor). The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, then used to treat the 32DSea5-2 cells as above. The final concentration of the C665A chMSP used to treat the cells represented 12× concentrated conditioned media. During the course of our work with recombinant murine wild type and C677A variant MSP (1Wahl R.C. Costigan V.J. Batac J.P. Chen K. Cam L. Courchesne P.L. Patterson S.D. Zhang K. Pacifici R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15053-15056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we observed that the Sea-Fc fusion protein could be used as the primary probe in a Western blot analysis. 3Based on sequences already in SWISS-PROT, the Cys residue number in human, murine, and chicken is 672, 677, and 665, respectively. As such, it detected active murine MSP with high sensitivity (see below), while neither pro-MSP nor reduced MSP nor any species other than the intact heterodimer were detected (data not shown). These observations suggested that the Sea-Fc might be a useful reagent for affinity purification of the Sea ligand. Since the known ligands for this family of receptors are detected in normal sera (22Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3314-3320PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguichi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we investigated whether there were Sea-binding proteins present in chicken sera. Both HGF and MSP bind strongly to heparin-Sepharose at neutral pH and physiological salt concentration (0.15 m), and can be eluted with increasing salt concentrations of about 0.8 msalt for MSP (31Shimamoto A. Kimura T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and 1.2 m salt for HGF (32Gohda E. Tsubouchi H. Nakayama H. Hirono S. Sakiyama O. Takahashi K. Miyazaki H. Hashimoto S. Daikuhara Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Since it was anticipated that the Sea ligand might have a similar tight heparin-binding property, a heparin-Sepharose binding step with a single high salt elution step was employed as an initial purification step. One liter of chicken serum was chromatographed on a heparin-Sepharose column and bound proteins were eluted with high salt. The interaction of plasminogen-related growth factors with their receptors requires proteolytic activation of the ligands (21Wang M.H. Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3436-3440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to literature reports, the heparin-Sepharose chromatography step used here was expected to purify both plasma kallikrein (33Heimark R.L. Davie E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), an activator of human MSP (21Wang M.H. Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3436-3440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and hepatocyte growth factor activator (34Shimomura T. Kondo J. Ochiai M. Naka D. Miyazawa K. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22927-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, incubation of the high salt eluate from the heparin-Sepharose column with the kallikrein substrate benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-nitroanilide (35Silverberg M. Kaplan A.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) resulted in considerable hydrolysis of the nitroanilide (data not shown), while the unfractionated chicken serum was inactive. This observation suggested that endogenous proteinase inhibitors had been removed and serum proteases had become activated during purification and were present in the eluate. Accordingly, the heparin-Sepharose eluate was incubated overnight at 4 °C in order that the endogenous, active serum proteases would activate potential plasminogen-related growth factors that were present. After incubation, the endogenous proteases were inactivated with Pefabloc, and the high salt heparin-Sepharose eluate was dialyzed versus PBS and then chromatographed on a Sea-Fc column. Bound proteins were eluted with a pH 10.5 buffer. Both the heparin-Sepharose and the Sea-Fc column eluted material showed well defined peaks of absorbtivity at 280 nm. Analysis of the four peak fractions (numbers 13–16), as indicated by A280 to contain proteins eluted from the Sea-Fc-Sepharose column, is shown in Fig.1. Staining with Coomassie Blue revealed that this two-step purified material contained multiple protein bands, but the overall protein complexity was reduced considerably relative to the starting sera (fraction 15 contains 1 mg of protein compared with 800 mg in the heparin pool, and 20 g in the starting serum). It was expected that isolation of some of the proteins resulted from nonspecific interactions with either the Sepharose resin or the Fc portion of the Sea-Fc, a result observed with other affinity purifications (data not shown). To characterize the proteins eluting from the Sea-Fc column further, Western blot analyses were performed. When the Sea-Fc fusion protein was used as the primary probe, a protein band with an apparent mobility of 84 kDa was readily detected in all the lanes, but especially in fraction 15 (Fig. 1 B). Although, several protein species were eluted from the Sea-Fc column (Fig. 1 A), the subsequent Western blot result implies a particularly strong interaction between the Sea-Fc and the 84-kDa species. For comparison, the same gel contained a standard of"

Furthermore, linker insertion analysis has demonstrated that the two dimerization regions are located in a highly flexible part of the enzyme. Topoisomerase IIα mutant enzymes unable to dimerize via the C-terminal primary dimerization regions due to lack of one of the defined dimerization regions can still be forced to dimerize if DNA and an ATP analog are added to the reaction mixture.

Thus, during the catalytic cycle of the enzyme, it introduces a transient double-strand break into the DNA backbone, where the subunits become covalently linked to the 5′-ends of the respective DNA strands through O4-phosphotyrosine bonds. A second DNA duplex is then transported through the cleaved DNA before it is finally religated (1Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Liu L.F.

Westergaard O. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6237-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The functional implications of a dimeric nature of eukaryotic topoisomerase II have been supported by several observations. Hydrodynamic studies indicate that the enzyme exists in solution as a dimer (18Shelton E.R. Osheroff N. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9530-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Biersack H. Jensen S. Gromova I. Nielsen I.S. Westergaard O. Andersen A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1984; 259: 10422-10429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this has further been strengthened by studies of topoisomerase II heterodimers, which have been found to be highly stable in vitro without the ability to dissociate and produce enzymes with a homodimeric conformation (19Biersack H. Jensen S. Gromova I. Nielsen I.S. Westergaard O. Andersen A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8288-8293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, structural data obtained either from crystallization of a 92-kDa fragment of yeast topoisomerase II or from electron microscopy studies of human topoisomerase IIα have demonstrated a dimeric nature of these enzymes (24Berger J.M. Wang J.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancock R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5936-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite the strong evidence in favor of a dimeric structure of eukaryotic topoisomerase II, biochemical data on a mapping of the exact regions involved in subunit interaction are still lacking. Early analysis of the amino acid sequence of human topoisomerase IIα revealed the presence of a leucine zipper (26Zwelling L.A. Perry W.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a motif that has been shown to selectively direct homo-and heterodimerization of proteins by forming a coiled coil structure, and it was suggested that topoisomerase II dimerization could be mediated through this motif. The importance of the leucine zipper in topoisomerase II dimerization has, however, been questioned by the absence of a similar motif in human topoisomerase IIβ (27Austin C.A. Sng J.H. Patel S. Fisher L.M. Biochim.Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), as well as by results obtained by Kroll et al. (28Kroll D.J. Sullivan D.M. Gutierrez Hartmann A. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 305-318PubMed Google Scholar), showing that disruption of the leucine zipper did not have any effect on topoisomerase II dimerization. The same group detected by use of topoisomerase IIα fragments in far Western blotting a region covering amino acids 951–1042 to constitute a minimal subunit association region, whereas maximal homodimerization required sequences C-terminal to position 1042 (29Kroll D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 345: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Similar, another study, using a small human topoisomerase IIα peptide with the ability to adopt a coiled coil structure, has demonstrated that this peptide, covering amino acids 1013–1056, forms a stable homodimer in solution (30Frere V. Sourgen F. Monnot M. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The most compelling data on eukaryotic topoisomerase II dimerization so far have derived from resolution of the crystal structure of a 92-kDa fragment of yeast topoisomerase II (31Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). This structure shows a primary interaction domain in the C-terminal part of the fragment involving two minor regions covering amino acids 1031–1046 and 1114–1130 in the yeast topoisomerase II enzyme. In the present study, we have mapped the regions involved in primary dimerization of human topoisomerase IIα using two biochemical approaches based on metal ion affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation. The defined sequences are located in the C-terminal region of the enzyme and correspond to the interaction domains discovered in yeast topoisomerase II from crystallization of the central fragment of the yeast enzyme. A further investigation of human topoisomerase IIα mutant enzymes lacking the primary C-terminal dimerization region has shown that such enzymes are still capable of dimerization via secondary dimerization regions if DNA and an ATP analog are present. The yeast strains BJ5462 (MATα ura3 trp1 leu2 pep4:: HIS3 prb1 can1) and BJ201 (MATα ura3 trp1 leu2 pep4:: HIS3 prb1 can1 top2::TRP1) were used for expression of topoisomerase II constructs. Plasmids pBY105 and pBY106, which contain the yeast triose phosphate isomerase promoter inserted into the LEU2/ARS-CEN plasmid pRS315 and the URA3/ARS-CEN plasmid pRS316 (32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, were used as backbone for introduction of hΔC1121, hΔC1233, h1121-12, and wild-type TOP2 cDNAs into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Plasmid pYX212 (purchased from R&D Systems) containing the yeast triose phosphate isomerase promoter and the 2-μm origin was used as backbone for introduction of the cDNA constructs hΔ1053–1069 and hΔ1124–1143 into S. cerevisiae. Construction of the plasmids pHT300, hΔC1121, hΔC1233, and h1121-12 is described in Ref. 33Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Construction of hΔ1053–1069 was carried out using the 5′ polymerase chain reaction primer 5′-TGGCTCCTAGGAATGCTTGGTGCTGAATCTGCTAAACTGAATAATCAGGCTCGCTTTAAAGAATTAATTAAAGTTC-3′ outlooping the region between amino acids 1053 and 1069 and having the topoisomerase II AvrII site at the 5′-end and the 3′ primer 5′-GGACTCTTTCTTTTTAATGTG-3′ having the Pst I site at the 3′-end. The resulting AvrII-Pst I fragment was subsequently used to substitute the normal AvrII-Pst I fragment present in topoisomerase II. Construction of hΔ1124–1143 was carried out substituting an Xho I-Pst I fragment of h1121–2 (33Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K.

All constructs have been sequenced to verify the introduced mutations. Yeast cells were transformed by using a modified version of the LiAc method of Ito et al. (34Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the ability of the mutated topoisomerase II constructs to complement the lack of endogenous topoisomerase II in BJ201 the LEU2-based constructs were transformed into BJ201, and cells were transferred to medium plates containing 5′ fluoro-orotic acid (1 mg/ml) to select against the URA3 plasmid carrying the Schizosaccharomyces pombe TOP2 gene (33Jensen S. Andersen A.H. Kjeldsen E. Biersack H. Olsen E.H. Andersen T.B. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3866-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Single- and double-transformed yeast cells were grown in 50 ml of selection medium to late log phase and then transferred to 1 liter of YPD medium and grown for approximately 12 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Yeast cells were extracted with 2 volumes of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 m NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1 volume of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) by vortexing at 4 °C for 30 min. Glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged for 20 min at 12000 rpm. After filtration (0.65 μm pore size filters), the crude extract was loaded on a 2-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (matrix purchased from Qiagen) equilibrated with equilibration buffer (20 mm imidazole, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm KPi, pH 8, 10% glycerol). The column was subsequently washed with equilibration buffer, and protein was eluted with elution buffer (1 m imidazole, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm KPi, pH 8, 10% glycerol) in a gradient of imidazole ranging from 20 mm to 1 m. All chromatographic steps were performed using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system under the control of an LCC-500 plus. When metal ion affinity chromatography was used for enzyme purification, yeast cell extraction and the following Ni2+ column chromatography were performed as described above, except that all buffers contained 500 mm NaCl rather than 1 m. Partly purified enzymes were stored in elution buffer supplemented with 50% glycerol. The C-terminally tagged human topoisomerase IIα mutants were detected by the mouse monoclonal antibody MYC1–9E10.2 (diluted 1:500), purchased from Genosys. Untagged human topoisomerase II versions were recognized by the anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody CRB (Genosys) raised against the C-terminal peptide (RAKKPIKYLEESDEDLF) of the wild-type human topoisomerase IIα enzyme (diluted 1:5000). For immunostaining, samples collected from the Ni2+ column were subjected to SDS-PAGE1 on 8.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schüll, 0.45 μm), and immunostaining was carried out according to the ECL protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were used as secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunochemicals). For studies of secondary dimerization, immunostaining of immunoprecipitated material was performed using the penta-His antibody (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitation of human topoisomerase IIα was carried out using Dynabeads-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μl of beads were incubated with the anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody CRB (2 μg) overnight followed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline buffer (1 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The beads were then incubated with 500 μl of yeast extract containing the different mutated topoisomerase II enzymes for 2–4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Following extensive wash, 60 μl of Laemmli loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 2–5 min before being loaded onto 8% SDS protein gels. Immunostaining was carried out with the MYC1–9E10.2 antibody. Immunoprecipitation using partly purified topoisomerase IIα mutant enzymes for studies of secondary dimerization was performed using protein A-Sepharose. 250 mg of protein A-Sepharose was extensively washed in distilled water followed by three washes in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.35% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). The Sepharose was finally dissolved in 5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. For each immunoprecipitation reaction, 100 μl of Sepharose was coated with 2 μg of anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody (CRB) by incubation overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Coated Sepharose was next washed in immunoprecipitation buffer and used for immunoprecipitation by adding the hΔ1053–1069 enzyme. Following incubation for 1–2 h at 4 °C with gently shaking, the hΔC1121 mutant enzyme was added either alone or together with DNA (28-mer duplex containing a strong topoisomerase II recognition sequence (8Andersen A.H. Sorensen B.S. Christiansen K. Svejstrup J.Q. Lund K. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9203-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and/or an ATP analog (AMP-PNP, Roche Molecular Biochemicals; final concentration, 500 μm), and incubation was continued for 1–2 h before precipitation by centrifugation at 5000 rpm. The NaCl concentration was throughout the immunoprecipitation reaction kept at 100 mm. To avoid unspecific interaction, the precipitated material was washed four times in immunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with 1m NaCl and 0.1% SDS and one time in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. The pellet was further prepared for SDS-PAGE as described above. The activity of topoisomerase IIα mutant enzymes was tested by in vitro decatenation of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) using yeast extract overexpressing the topoisomerase II enzyme of interest. Extract was incubated with 300 ng of kDNA in 1 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 50 mm bis-Tris-propane (pH 8), 120 mmpotassium glutamate in a total volume of 20 μl. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently subjected to electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. The contribution of the endogenous yeast topoisomerase II enzyme to decatenation is negligible, as no decatenation activity was seen in yeast extracts when overexpression of the human topoisomerase IIα enzymes was omitted. In eukaryotic topoisomerase II, subunit dimerization is a key process that is essential for the function of this highly complex enzyme. To map the regions that participate in dimerization in human topoisomerase IIα, we have taken a biochemical approach employing a previously developed protein-protein interaction assay, which takes advantage of the affinity of metal ions for histidine-containing proteins (19Biersack H. Jensen S. Gromova I. Nielsen I.S. Westergaard O. Andersen A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8288-8293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The assay involves coexpression in yeast of two versions of topoisomerase IIα, one of which is His-tagged, followed by analysis of the extract by metal ion affinity chromatography. The strategy behind the assay is that an untagged topoisomerase II enzyme will be retained on a Ni2+ column only if it has interacted with a His-tagged version. A positive interaction can afterward be visualized if the Ni2+ column fractions are examined by immunostaining. To first verify the specificity of the assay, a human topoisomerase IIα mutant enzyme truncated at residue 1233 (hΔC1233) and fused at its C-terminal end to a bicomposite tag consisting of a hexahistidine tail, and a c-Myc epitope was expressed in the yeast strain BJ201. Crude extract was subjected to metal ion affinity chromatography under highly stringent conditions, and samples of the eluted material were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunostaining with anti-c-Myc antibody demonstrated the presence of the histidine-tagged hΔC1233 topoisomerase IIα mutant in the elution profile (Fig.1, top panel). In contrast, when an untagged version of wild-type human topoisomerase IIα was analyzed in the dimerization assay, it exhibited no detectable affinity for binding to the nickel column, as evident from the immunostain shown in Fig. 1 (bottom panel), in which the enzyme is visualized by the anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody. The assay is thus highly specific for topoisomerase II enzymes containing a hexahistidine tag, and the method therefore provides a powerful tool to investigate possible interactions between tagged and untagged topoisomerase II subunits. Several biochemical studies have implied an important role for the C-terminal region of eukaryotic topoisomerase II in mediating subunit interaction (30Frere V. Sourgen F. Monnot M. Troalen F.

Genetics. 1991; 128: 703-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although direct biochemical evidence is still lacking. As an initial step to map the dimerization region of human topoisomerase IIα, extracts from yeast cells coexpressing untagged wild-type human topoisomerase IIα and a His- and c-Myc-tagged C-terminal truncation mutant of the enzyme deleted at either amino acid 1233 or 1121 were analyzed in the described dimerization assay (Fig. 2 and TableI). When the wild-type enzyme was expressed together with hΔC1233, the anti-c-Myc antibody identified hΔC1233 as a constituent of the column eluate, as expected. The wild-type form of human topoisomerase IIα was retained on the column as well and eluted in the same fractions as the truncated form, as demonstrated by staining with the anti-topoisomerase IIα antibody (Fig. 2, top panel). It has previously been shown that under the conditions employed, unspecific interaction, as well as multimerization, does not occur at least to a detectable level between topoisomerase II dimers (19Biersack H. Jensen S. Gromova I. Nielsen I.S. Westergaard O. Andersen A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8288-8293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The coexistence of the truncated and wild-type forms in the elution profile therefore can only be a result of an interaction between the two different subunits, demonstrating that hΔC1233 still carries the region essential for dimerization. When extract from yeast cells coexpressing wild-type human topoisomerase IIα and the C-terminal truncation mutant deleted at residue 1121 (hΔC1121) was analyzed in the dimerization assay, only the tagged hΔC1121 mutant was eluted (Fig. 2, bottom panel). The hΔC1121 enzyme is therefore unable to participate in a heterodimeric configuration, suggesting that the region spanning residues 1121–1233 in human topoisomerase IIα has an important role in directing subunit interaction. However, the obtained result does not rule out the possibility that hΔC1121 is able to form homodimers. Furthermore, the possibility cannot be excluded that the observed lack of heterodimerization is caused by an altered or destroyed folding of the hΔC1121 enzyme.Table IAnalysis of C-terminal mutants of human topoisomerase IIαView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Schematic representation of the human topoisomerase IIα constructs employed.

The interpretation of the results obtained with the C-terminal truncated topoisomerase II enzymes is that a region residing between amino acids 1121 and 1233 is required for subunit interaction in human topoisomerase IIα. A further dissection of the dimerization region(s) was performed based on information derived from the crystallization of a 92-kDa central fragment of yeast topoisomerase II (31Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). As evident from the crystal structure a major dimerization interface is present in the C-terminal region of the yeast enzyme involving residues 1031–1046 and 1114–1130. Because dimerization is a highly conserved feature of eukaryotic topoisomerase II, it is likely that subunit contacts will be mediated by corresponding regions in topoisomerase II enzymes of different eukaryotic origin. Therefore, a human topoisomerase IIα mutant was first constructed carrying a deletion of amino acids 1124–1143 (hΔ1124–1143) equivalent to the most C-terminal dimerization region observed in the crystal structure of yeast topoisomerase II (residues 1114–1130). This mutant was coexpressed in yeast together with the histidine-tagged, truncated form of human topoisomerase IIα, hΔC1233, which still contains the potential to dimerize. In the experiment, hΔC1233 was preferred to the wild-type enzyme, as this mutant can easily be distinguished from the deletion mutant upon SDS-PAGE due to its smaller size. Analysis of the crude yeast extract in the dimerization assay revealed that no heterodimer formation takes place between hΔC1233 and the deletion mutant hΔ1124–1143 (Fig. 3, top panel), because only the hΔC1233 enzy"

The α subunit (63 kDa) contains an N-terminal polymerase and a C-terminal RNase H domain. The N terminus of β (95 kDa) corresponds to α with the integrase domain attached to the C terminus (32 kDa). We have constructed baculoviruses expressing the genes for α or β or the entire pol (99 kDa). Infection of insect cells with recombinant virus yielded highly active and soluble RSV RT enzymes that could be purified to >90% homogeneity. HPLC gel filtration showed that α is a dimeric enzyme that can be partially monomerized upon the addition of 45% Me2SO. DNA synthesis on DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA primer-templates in the presence of competitor substrates revealed that αβ and β as well as α are processive polymerases. However, the affinity of β and αβ for primer-template substrates appears to be higher than that of α. All RSV enzymes investigated have the potential to displace RNA-RNA duplexes more efficiently than human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT. Unlike human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT, RSV RTs can catalyze an initial RNase H endonucleolytic cleavage of the RNA template but not a 3′ → 5′ directed processing activity."

The basal layer consists of proliferating undifferentiated keratinocytes that migrate outward into the nondividing suprabasal compartment and terminally differentiate. To ensure homeostasis in normal epidermis, a strict balance is maintained between the proliferation of keratinocytes in the basal layer and the rate of progression through the differentiated suprabasal layers. The end result of this tightly regulated differentiation process is the external cornified layer of the epidermis which provides a protective barrier (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The proliferating basal keratinocytes express K5 and K14, and as keratinocytes move suprabasally and begin to differentiate, K5 and K14 expression is lost and K1 and K10 expression begins. The expression of keratinocyte transglutaminase as well as structural proteins such as involucrin, loricrin, profilaggrin, and SPRR also becomes evident at later stages of keratinocyte differentiation (1Fuchs E.

Detailed analysis of the regulatory regions of these genes have demonstrated the importance of a number of transcription factors (TFs), such as AP1 and AP2 (13Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B.

However, these TFs are also expressed in other organ systems and are not likely to ultimately determine which genes are uniquely expressed in keratinocytes. This has prompted a search for TFs that are only expressed in keratinocytes and are responsible for regulating expression of keratinocyte-specific genes during differentiation.One TF that may play a role in regulating keratinocyte-specific gene expression is the POU TF Skn-1a/Epoc-1/Oct-11 (17Andersen B.

POU TFs are of particular interest because they are usually expressed in a tissue-specific manner and play an important role in the establishment of cell identity and cellular differentiation during development (20Ryan A.K.

Since Skn-1a is primarily expressed in the epidermis, it may have an important regulatory role in both epidermal development and keratinocyte differentiation (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Yukawa K. Yasui T. Yamamoto A. Shiku H. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). During mouse embryogenesis, a stratified epidermis appears by day 15 to 16. Skn-1a is expressed in the ectoderm underlying the periderm just prior to the sloughing off of the periderm and emergence of the stratified epidermis (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In adult murine skin, Skn-1a expression is present primarily in differentiating suprabasal keratinocytes (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G.

Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, in vitro studies have demonstrated that Skn-1a binds to and transactivates the promoter regions of keratinocyte genes involved in epidermal differentiation, such as human K10 (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and SPRR-2A (29Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Skn-1a also transactivates the long control region (LCR) of the human papillomaviruses (HPV) types 16, 18 (30Yukawa K. Butz K. Yasui T. Kikutani H. Hoppe-Seyler F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 10-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 1a (31Andersen B. Hariri A. Pittelkow M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15905-15913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the expression pattern of the early HPV gene products E6 and E7 parallels that of Skn-1a, with very low detection in basal keratinocytes and increased expression suprabasally (30Yukawa K. Butz K. Yasui T. Kikutani H. Hoppe-Seyler F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 10-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Because of Skn-1a's potential importance as a regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, our goal was to characterize Skn-1a's primary transactivation domain(s) in order to generate a dominant negative protein that could be used to interfere with Skn-1a function in different biological systems. Unlike the POU domain, which is highly conserved and responsible for binding target DNA sequences, the location of the transactivation domain in POU TFs is not predictable (23Herr W.

Sci. 1996; 351: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The POU TFs Oct-1, Oct-2, and Oct-3/4, for instance, have multiple transactivation domains, which reside on either end of the proteins (24Verrijzer C.P. Vliet P.C.V.d. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 33Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Imagawa M. Miyamoto A.

In this paper we report the cloning of the human homologue of murine Skn-1a (hSkn-1a) and the identification of two novel functional domains, a C-terminal transactivation domain and a N-terminal inhibitory domain, that reside outside of the complex POU domain. C-terminal deleted hSkn-1a is able to effectively compete with full-length hSkn-1a and is therefore a good candidate dominant negative protein. Characterization of the functional domains of Skn-1a may provide insights regarding the biological function of this epidermal-specific POU TF.DISCUSSIONPOU factors are implicated in cell lineage progression during early embryogenesis and tissue-specific cell maturation in later developmental stages (20Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Skn-1a POU TF is primarily expressed in the epidermis (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Yukawa K. Yasui T. Yamamoto A. Shiku H. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is a strong candidate gene for regulating keratinocyte-specific gene expression and keratinocyte differentiation. However, a biological function and mode of action for Skn-1a in epidermal differentiation has not yet been established. In vitro assays have demonstrated that Skn-1a can activate (K10) or inhibit (involucrin) the expression of the keratinocyte-specific genes (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 45Welter J.F. Gali H. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14727-14733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Yet, Skn-1a/i null mice develop normally and do not exhibit any overt phenotypic alterations (28Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), perhaps reflecting functional redundancy between Skn-1a/i and other ubiquitous POU TFs in skin. Consequently, the precise role of this keratinocyte-specific POU TF in epidermal differentiation still needs to be determined.Elucidation of Skn-1a's mechanism of action requires identification of functional domains by testing the effects of truncated Skn-1a constructs on different target promoters. To facilitate future in vitro studies with human keratinocyte organ cultures, we cloned the human Skn-1a homologue (hSkn-1a). hSkn-1a proved to be virtually identical to its murine counterpart. Interestingly, a human homologue of the previously described murine Skn-1i splice variant could not be detected. Deletion analysis of hSkn-1a revealed that it contained a primary transactivation domain downstream of the POU domain, within the C-terminal 92 amino acids. While FL-Skn-1a transactivated all promoters tested, regardless of which cell line was assayed, ΔCOOH-Skn-1a did not transactivate any of the promoters. Conversely, the N-terminal 120 amino acids of hSkn-1a contains either an inhibitory domain or a secondary transactivation domain, depending on the target DNA sequences in the different promoters. For the bK6 promoter, ΔNH3-Skn-1a demonstrated greater transactivation than FL-Skn-1a. However, deletion of the N-terminal 120 amino acids did not increase transactivation of the other promoters. ΔNH3-Skn-1a was incapable of transactivating the HPV-18 LCR, suggesting that either the N-terminal region contains a necessary transactivation domain for this promoter or that interaction of ΔNH3-Skn-1a with the nonconsensus DNA target site of HPV-18 LCR induces a conformational change in the POU domain preventing it from interacting with accessory factors necessary for proper promoter activation (46Walker S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An earlier study, using a Skn-1a-LexA fusion protein approach, reported that the primary transactivation domain for the murine Skn-1a resides within the N-terminal 182 amino acids (31Andersen B.

Our data suggest that the critical domain for hSkn-1a transactivation lies in the C terminus, while a secondary transactivation domain in the N terminus is required for some promoters. This apparent discrepancy may reflect conformational changes resulting from fusion of Skn-1a fragments with the LexA DNA-binding domain or use of the LexA promoter as a target for the fusion protein.POU TFs often have multiple transactivation domains (33Brehm A.

Oct-3/4, for instance, has two transactivation domains residing outside of the POU domain: a primary N-terminal transactivation domain and a secondary, cell-specific, C-terminal transactivation domain that is dependent on the POU domain itself (33Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Imagawa M. Miyamoto A. Shirakawa M. Hamada H. Muramatsu M.

This dependence is lost if Oct-3/4's C-terminal transactivation domain is fused to the heterologous POU domain of Pit-1, indicating that the activity of the Oct-3/4 C-terminal depends on a particular POU domain and the specific co-factors interacting with that POU domain (33Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Vigano M.A. Staudt L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2112-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inhibitory domains have also been observed in other POU factors. Oct-2 harbors, in addition to two transactivation domains, an N-terminal, cell line-specific inhibitory domain (32Latchman D.S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 51Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Our results suggest that hSkn-1a has two distinct transactivation domains: 1) an invariant primary C-terminal domain and 2) a promoter-specific N-terminal domain. Additionally, we also demonstrate that the N-terminal 120 amino acids of hSkn-1a contain a promoter-specific inhibitory domain. The C-terminal truncated protein lacking the primary transactivation domain is capable of effectively competing with FL-Skn-1a in a dominant negative manner. Therefore, ΔCOOH-Skn-1a is a good candidate construct to effectively block and disrupt the function of endogenous Skn-1a in keratinocytes. The identification of important functional domains of hSkn-1a may help define its biological function in keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis. Constructs with or without these defined domains can be inappropriately overexpressed or used to block endogenous Skn-1a in keratinocyte organ cultures and transgenic animal models to assess phenotypic and biochemical effects. The epidermis is a regenerative tissue composed of several layers of keratinocytes with each layer representing an increased state of differentiation. The basal layer consists of proliferating undifferentiated keratinocytes that migrate outward into the nondividing suprabasal compartment and terminally differentiate. To ensure homeostasis in normal epidermis, a strict balance is maintained between the proliferation of keratinocytes in the basal layer and the rate of progression through the differentiated suprabasal layers. The end result of this tightly regulated differentiation process is the external cornified layer of the epidermis which provides a protective barrier (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Morphologically distinct epidermal layers can be identified by the expression of genes which are only expressed at specific stages of keratinocyte differentiation (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 197-208Crossref Google Scholar, 3Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Examples of these molecular markers include the keratin (K)1 intermediate filaments (4Steinert P. Freedberg I. Goldsmith L.A. Physiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Skin. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 113-147Google Scholar), structural proteins such as profilaggrin (5Dale B.A. Presland R.B. Fleckman P. Kam E. Resing K. Darmon M. Blumemberg M.

The proliferating basal keratinocytes express K5 and K14, and as keratinocytes move suprabasally and begin to differentiate, K5 and K14 expression is lost and K1 and K10 expression begins. The expression of keratinocyte transglutaminase as well as structural proteins such as involucrin, loricrin, profilaggrin, and SPRR also becomes evident at later stages of keratinocyte differentiation (1Fuchs E. Byrne C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 17: 197-208Crossref Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the regulatory regions of these genes have demonstrated the importance of a number of transcription factors (TFs), such as AP1 and AP2 (13Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Banks E.B.

However, these TFs are also expressed in other organ systems and are not likely to ultimately determine which genes are uniquely expressed in keratinocytes. This has prompted a search for TFs that are only expressed in keratinocytes and are responsible for regulating expression of keratinocyte-specific genes during differentiation. One TF that may play a role in regulating keratinocyte-specific gene expression is the POU TF Skn-1a/Epoc-1/Oct-11 (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Goldsborough A.S. Healy L.E. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Willison K.R. Ashworth A.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). POU TFs are of particular interest because they are usually expressed in a tissue-specific manner and play an important role in the establishment of cell identity and cellular differentiation during development (20Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 21Herr W. Sturm R.A. Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Ingraham H.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Finney M.

Cell. 1988; 55: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Since Skn-1a is primarily expressed in the epidermis, it may have an important regulatory role in both epidermal development and keratinocyte differentiation (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Yukawa K. Yasui T. Yamamoto A. Shiku H. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). During mouse embryogenesis, a stratified epidermis appears by day 15 to 16. Skn-1a is expressed in the ectoderm underlying the periderm just prior to the sloughing off of the periderm and emergence of the stratified epidermis (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In adult murine skin, Skn-1a expression is present primarily in differentiating suprabasal keratinocytes (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, in vitro studies have demonstrated that Skn-1a binds to and transactivates the promoter regions of keratinocyte genes involved in epidermal differentiation, such as human K10 (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and SPRR-2A (29Fischer D.F. Gibbs S. van de Putte P. Backendorf C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5365-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Skn-1a also transactivates the long control region (LCR) of the human papillomaviruses (HPV) types 16, 18 (30Yukawa K. Butz K. Yasui T. Kikutani H. Hoppe-Seyler F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 10-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 1a (31Andersen B. Hariri A. Pittelkow M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15905-15913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the expression pattern of the early HPV gene products E6 and E7 parallels that of Skn-1a, with very low detection in basal keratinocytes and increased expression suprabasally (30Yukawa K. Butz K. Yasui T. Kikutani H. Hoppe-Seyler F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 10-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of Skn-1a's potential importance as a regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, our goal was to characterize Skn-1a's primary transactivation domain(s) in order to generate a dominant negative protein that could be used to interfere with Skn-1a function in different biological systems. Unlike the POU domain, which is highly conserved and responsible for binding target DNA sequences, the location of the transactivation domain in POU TFs is not predictable (23Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 32Latchman D.S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The POU TFs Oct-1, Oct-2, and Oct-3/4, for instance, have multiple transactivation domains, which reside on either end of the proteins (24Verrijzer C.P. Vliet P.C.V.d. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 33Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Imagawa M. Miyamoto A.

In this paper we report the cloning of the human homologue of murine Skn-1a (hSkn-1a) and the identification of two novel functional domains, a C-terminal transactivation domain and a N-terminal inhibitory domain, that reside outside of the complex POU domain. C-terminal deleted hSkn-1a is able to effectively compete with full-length hSkn-1a and is therefore a good candidate dominant negative protein. Characterization of the functional domains of Skn-1a may provide insights regarding the biological function of this epidermal-specific POU TF. DISCUSSIONPOU factors are implicated in cell lineage progression during early embryogenesis and tissue-specific cell maturation in later developmental stages (20Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Skn-1a POU TF is primarily expressed in the epidermis (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Yukawa K. Yasui T. Yamamoto A. Shiku H. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is a strong candidate gene for regulating keratinocyte-specific gene expression and keratinocyte differentiation. However, a biological function and mode of action for Skn-1a in epidermal differentiation has not yet been established. In vitro assays have demonstrated that Skn-1a can activate (K10) or inhibit (involucrin) the expression of the keratinocyte-specific genes (17Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.R., II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1993; 260: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 45Welter J.F. Gali H. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14727-14733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Yet, Skn-1a/i null mice develop normally and do not exhibit any overt phenotypic alterations (28Andersen B. Weinberg W.C. Rennekampff O. McEvilly R.J. Bermingham Jr., J. Hooshmand F. Vasilyev V. Hansbrough J.F. Pittelkow M.R. Yuspa S.H. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), perhaps reflecting functional redundancy between Skn-1a/i and other ubiquitous POU TFs in skin. Consequently, the precise role of this keratinocyte-specific POU TF in epidermal differentiation still needs to be determined.Elucidation of Skn-1a's mechanism of action requires identification of functional domains by testing the effects of truncated Skn-1a constructs on different target promoters. To facilitate future in vitro studies with human keratinocyte organ cultures, we cloned the human Skn-1a homologue (hSkn-1a). hSkn-1a proved to be virtually identical to its murine counterpart. Interestingly, a human homologue of the previously described murine Skn-1i splice variant could not be detected. Deletion analysis of hSkn-1a revealed that it contained a primary transactivation domain downstream of the POU domain, within the C-terminal 92 amino acids. While FL-Skn-1a transactivated all promoters tested, regardless of which cell line was assayed, ΔCOOH-Skn-1a did not transactivate any of the promoters. Conversely, the N-terminal 120 amino acids of hSkn-1a contains either an inhibitory domain or a secondary transactivation domain, depending on the target DNA sequences in the different promoters. For the bK6 promoter, ΔNH3-Skn-1a demonstrated greater transactivation than FL-Skn-1a. However, deletion of the N-terminal 120 amino acids did not increase transactivation of the other promoters. ΔNH3-Skn-1a was incapable of transactivating the HPV-18 LCR, suggesting that either the N-terminal region contains a necessary transactivation domain for this promoter or that interaction of ΔNH3-Skn-1a with the nonconsensus DNA target site of HPV-18 LCR induces a conformational change in the POU domain preventing it from interacting with accessory factors necessary for proper promoter activation (46Walker S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), perhaps reflecting functional redundancy between Skn-1a/i and other ubiquitous POU TFs in skin. Consequently, the precise role of this keratinocyte-specific POU TF in epidermal differentiation still needs to be determined. Elucidation of Skn-1a's mechanism of action requires identification of functional domains by testing the effects of truncated Skn-1a constructs on different target promoters. To facilitate future in vitro studies with human keratinocyte organ cultures, we cloned the human Skn-1a homologue (hSkn-1a). hSkn-1a proved to be virtually identical to its murine counterpart. Interestingly, a human homologue of the previously described murine Skn-1i splice variant could not be detected. Deletion analysis of hSkn-1a revealed that it contained a primary transactivation domain downstream of the POU domain, within the C-terminal 92 amino acids. While FL-Skn-1a transactivated all promoters tested, regardless of which cell line was assayed, ΔCOOH-Skn-1a did not transactivate any of the promoters. Conversely, the N-terminal 120 amino acids of hSkn-1a contains either an inhibitory domain or a secondary transactivation domain, depending on the target DNA sequences in the different promoters. For the bK6 promoter, ΔNH3-Skn-1a demonstrated greater transactivation than FL-Skn-1a. However, deletion of the N-terminal 120 amino acids did not increase transactivation of the other promoters. ΔNH3-Skn-1a was incapable of transactivating the HPV-18 LCR, suggesting that either the N-terminal region contains a necessary transactivation domain for this promoter or that interaction of ΔNH3-Skn-1a with the nonconsensus DNA target site of HPV-18 LCR induces a conformational change in the POU domain preventing it from interacting with accessory factors necessary for proper promoter activation (46Walker S. Hayes S. O'Hare P. Cell. 1994; 79: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 47Cleary M.A. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2090-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An earlier study, using a Skn-1a-LexA fusion protein approach, reported that the primary transactivation domain for the murine Skn-1a resides within the N-terminal 182 amino acids (31Andersen B. Hariri A. Pittelkow M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15905-15913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the critical domain for hSkn-1a transactivation lies in the C terminus, while a secondary transactivation domain in the N terminus is required for some promoters. This apparent discrepancy may reflect conformational changes resulting from fusion of Skn-1a fragments with the LexA DNA-binding domain or use of the LexA promoter as a target for the fusion protein. POU TFs often have multiple transactivation domains (33Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Vigano M.A. Staudt L.M.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1625-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Oct-3/4, for instance, has two transactivation domains residing outside of the POU domain: a primary N-terminal transactivation domain and a secondary, cell-specific, C-terminal transactivation domain that is dependent on the POU domain itself (33Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Imagawa M. Miyamoto A. Shirakawa M. Hamada H. Muramatsu M.

This dependence is lost if Oct-3/4's C-terminal transactivation domain is fused to the heterologous POU domain of Pit-1, indicating that the activity of the Oct-3/4 C-terminal depends on a particular POU domain and the specific co-factors interacting with that POU domain (33Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Vigano M.A. Staudt L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2112-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inhibitory domains have also been observed in other POU factors. Oct-2 harbors, in addition to two transactivation domains, an N-terminal, cell line-specific inhibitory domain (32Latchman D.S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 51Lillycrop K.A. Latchman D.S. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that hSkn-1a has two distinct transactivation domains: 1) an invariant primary C-terminal domain and 2) a promoter-specific N-terminal domain. Additionally, we also demonstrate that the N-terminal 120 amino acids of hSkn-1a contain a promoter-specific inhibitory domain. The C-terminal truncated protein lacking the primary transactivation domain is capable of effectively competing with FL-Skn-1a in a dominant negative manner. Therefore, ΔCOOH-Skn-1a is a good candidate construct to effectively block and disrupt the function of endogenous Skn-1a in keratinocytes. The identification of important functional domains of hSkn-1a may help define its biological function in keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis. Constructs with or without these defined domains can be inappropriately overexpressed or used to block endogenous Skn-1a in keratinocyte organ cultures and transgenic animal models to assess phenotypic and biochemical effects.

Mark Udey, Kim Yancey, and Tom Sargent for stimulating discussions and critical advice; Carole Yee for expert technical assistance; and Dr. Stephen Katz for his encouragement and support.

Hiraga K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 45: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,2Douce R. Bourguignon J. Macherel D. Neuburger M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GDC is found in large amount in the mitochondria of C3 plant leaves, where it plays a key role in the photorespiratory pathway (3Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The enzymatic complex consists of four different component proteins: P, T, L, and H proteins. H protein is a 14.1-kDa monomer that plays a pivotal role in the reaction mechanism, since it interacts sequentially with each of the other three proteins of the complex through its cofactor lipoic acid bound to a lysine residue. The P protein (100 kDa) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of glycine and the transfer of the resulting methylamine group to the oxidized lipoamide arm carried by H protein. The lipoamide-bound methylamine is then shuttled to the T protein (41 kDa), where the methylene carbon atom is bound to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamate (H4PteGlun, where n is the number of glutamate residues), yielding N 5 N 10-methylene-H4PteGlun, and the amino group is released as NH3. Finally, the L protein (50 kDa), a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, reoxidizes the reduced lipoamide of H protein by the sequential reduction of FAD and NAD+, thereby completing the catalytic cycle of the H protein. The three-dimensional structure of pea H protein revealed that the lysine bearing the lipoic acid was located at the tip of a hairpin configuration (4Sieker L. Cohen-Addad C. Neuburger M. Douce R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 223-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 5Pares S. Cohen-Addad C. Sieker L. Neuburger M. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4850-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Upon reaction with P protein, the lipoamide-methylamine arm swivels toward a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of the protein (6Cohen-Addad C. Pares S. Sieker L. Neuburger M. Douce R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this configuration, the fragile methylamine group should be stabilized and protected from nucleophilic attack by OH− ions until the reaction with H4PteGlun and T protein takes place. Lipoic acid is also the prosthetic group of the E2 protein component (dihydrolipoamide S-acyltransferase) of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases, a family of multienzyme complexes involved in the decarboxylation of pyruvate, 2-oxoglutarate, and branched chain 2-oxoacids. The E2 protein component forms the structural core of the complexes, on the surface of which oxoacid decarboxylase (E1 protein) and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3 protein) are bound in a noncovalent manner. In E2 proteins, the lipoyl domains show both striking sequence and structure similarity with H protein (7Brockelhurst S.M. Perham R.N. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 626-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Berg A. Verwoort J. de Kok A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Cohen-Addad C. Faure M. Neuburger M. Ober R. Sieker L. Bourguignon J. Macherel D. Douce R. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Considerable work has been done on the lipoylation, structure, and activity of recombinant lipoyl domains engineered from the oxoacid dehydrogenases (10Wallis N.G. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Wallis N.G. Allen M.D. Broadhurst R.W. Lessard I.A.D. Perham R.N. J. Mol.

In contrast, few studies have been undertaken at the structural level to highlight amino acids involved in catalytic site of the enzymes. H protein is a small lipoic acid protein that offers an interesting alternative to analyze the functioning of the lipoyl-lysine group in this type of multienzyme complex. A major feature of H protein catalysis lies in the stabilization of the methylamine-loaded form through the burying of the lipoyl arm within a hydrophobic cleft (Fig. 1). Close inspection of the structure of H protein indicates that the NH3+ moiety of the methylamine group is tightly linked, by an ionic bond, to the lateral chain carbonyl group of Glu14, and by hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl group of Ser12 and Asp67. The two residues Ser12 and Glu14 are also linked by hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of serine and the carbonyl group of glutamate (Ref. 9Cohen-Addad C. Faure M. Neuburger M. Ober R. Sieker L. Bourguignon J. Macherel D. Douce R. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 b). The only significant interaction of the carbon in the methylamine group occurs through hydrophobic contact with Ile27. Since a system allowing the production of recombinant H protein (apoform or lipoylated form) was available (13Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we sought to further investigate the interactions between amino acids Ser12, Glu14, and Ile27 of the hydrophobic cavity and methylamine bound to the lipoamide using site-directed mutagenesis. We constructed four mutants of H protein: HE14D (Glu14 was replaced by Asp), HE14A (Glu14 was replaced by Ala), HI27A (Ile27was replaced by Ala), and HS12K (Ser12 was replaced by Lys) (Fig. 1 c). We were also interested in the structural features of the hairpin loop carrying the lipoate cofactor that could intervene in catalysis but also in the lipoylation of the apoprotein. There is indeed a noticeable similarity between lipoate-dependent proteins and biotin-dependent proteins. The biotinyl-moiety is attached to a specific lysine residue in the highly conserved motif MKM, which is structurally similar to the lipoyl domains or H protein (7Brockelhurst S.M. Perham R.N. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 626-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Athappilly F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the lipoate protein ligase (LPL) is responsible for the ATP-dependent attachment of free lipoic acid to a specific lysine residue in the lipoyl domain of E2 protein (16Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the three-dimensional structure of the recombinant H apoprotein at a 0.25-nm resolution and demonstrated that the apoprotein, which exhibits the same conformation as the lipoylated protein, was an excellent substrate for LPL (13Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to make a fifth double mutant, HV62M/A64M (Val62 and Ala64 both replaced by Met residues), where the lipoylation motif VKA is replaced by the biotinylation motif (Fig. 1). Such a mutant was expected to shed light both on the reaction mechanism of H protein and on the post-translational modification of the apoprotein by LPL. We report here the detailed structural analysis of these five H protein mutants and the effect of these mutations regarding the lipoylation process and the reaction mechanism of the GDC. The plasmid pET-H encoding the mature pea H protein (13Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was used as a template to generate mutations in the DNA sequence with the unique site elimination (USE) mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that utilizes a two-primer system to generate site-specific mutations. The second primer (target mutagenic primer) is directed to the sequence of the mature pea H protein cDNA and carries the desired mutation. The sequences of the mutagenic oligodeoxynucleotides E14A, E14D, I27A, S12K, V62M/A64M are listed in TableI. The mutations are designated with the position of the mutated residue in the mature H protein sequence preceded by the original amino acid. The mutagenized plasmids, designated pET-HE14A, pET-HE14D, pET-HI27A, pET-HS12K, and pET-HV62M/A64M, carried DNA inserts encoding mature H protein with the mutations. All constructions were sequenced on both strands (Génome Express, Grenoble) to verify that the desired mutation was introduced within the H protein sequence.Table ISynthetic oligodeoxynucleotide sequences used as mutagenic primersPrimerSequenceE14A5′CGCACCTTCACAT GCA TGGGTCAAGCATGE14D5′CGCACCTTCACAT GAC TGGGTCAAGCATGI27A5′GCCACTATTGGT GCC ACTGACCATGCCCS12K5′CAAGTACGCACCT AAA CATGAATGGGTCV62M/A64M5′GGAGCTGTTGAAAGT ATG AAG ATG ACAAGTGATGTAAACMutant codons appear in boldface type.

The transformation of the different pET plasmids in BL21 (DE3)E. coli, the culture conditions for overexpression of the recombinant apoproteins, the cell lysis, and the protein ammonium sulfate fractionation were performed as described earlier (13Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The H apoprotein solutions (15 ml, 200 mg) were treated with RNase and DNase (20 μg/ml each) for 20 min at 30 °C and were loaded on a Q-Hyperdex column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA) and connected to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Proteins were eluted with a continuously increasing KCl gradient (0–1 m) (flow rate, 1 ml/min; fraction size of 2 ml). The fractions containing H apoproteins (analyzed by SDS-PAGE) were pooled, dialyzed extensively against buffer A, and concentrated on 3K-macrosep (Filtron) by centrifugation (7,000 × g) to a concentration of about 10 mg/ml. E. coli strain TM 202 harboring the recombinant plasmid pET-TM 70 containing the lplA gene encoding LPL was kindly supplied by Prof. J. E. Cronan (Illinois University).E. coli LPL was overexpressed as described by Green et al. (16Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Bacteria resuspended in buffer B (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) were disrupted by three cycles of freezing and thawing, and the resulting suspension was centrifuged (35,000 × g, 10 min). Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 35% saturation, and the solution was stirred on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation (24,000 × g, 10 min), the pellet was suspended in buffer B (5–10 ml) and dialyzed overnight against buffer B. After centrifugation and filtration of the supernatant through a 0.22–μm filter, the protein solution was then applied to a MonoQ-HR10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with buffer B. Proteins were eluted with a continuously increasing NaCl gradient (0–500 mm) (flow rate, 1 ml/min; fraction size of 1 ml). The fractions containing LPL as deduced from SDS-PAGE analysis were pooled, dialyzed extensively against buffer B, and concentrated (10 mg/ml). For the purpose of lipoylating proteins on a preparative scale, the experiment was performed at 37 °C for 1 h in a reaction medium containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm Mops, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm ATP, 200 μmdl-lipoic acid, 0.25 μm E. coli LPL, and 43 μm H apoprotein, usually in a final volume of 850 μl. The different forms of H protein were resolved by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The proportion of lipoylated protein always exceeded 98%. The quantitative determination of lipoylated H protein by dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (H2LipDH) was measured by a new enzymatic assay using TCEP (Roche Diagnostics) as a reductant for bound lipoic acid. This new enzymatic assay is described in the legend to Fig. 2. TCEP in large excess allows the reduction of lipoic acid attached to H protein. The reduced form of lipoylated H protein thus formed is oxidized by H2LipDH in the presence of NAD+. For the quantitative determination of lipoylated H protein, the reaction medium contained the following in a final volume of 500 μl: 50 mm Mops, pH 7.5, 0.9 μm porcine heart H2LipDH (Sigma), 8 mm TCEP, and various amounts of lipoylated H protein. The reaction was started with 2 mmNAD+. The rate of NADH formation was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using a Kontron (Uvikon 810) spectrophotometer. In order to quantify the H protein content of the sample, a calibration curve was first recorded by plotting the rate of the catalytic reaction as a function of the H protein concentration (one curve was established for each mutant, data not shown). The reaction of lipoylation was also followed spectrophotometrically by detecting the lipoylated H protein with the H2LipDH/TCEP assay. The reaction medium contained the following in a total volume of 500 μl: 10 mm Tris, 10 mm Mops, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm ATP, 200 μmdl-lipoic acid, 0.9 μmporcine heart H2LipDH, 8.5 μm H apoprotein, 2 mm NAD+, and 8 mm TCEP. The reaction was initiated with 0.09 μm LPL, and NADH formation was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The oxidation of free dihydrolipoic acid present in the medium (lipoic acid reduced by TCEP) does not interfere with the assay because the affinity of H2LipDH for free dihydrolipoic acid is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of dihydrolipoate bound to H protein. Glycine decarboxylase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by measuring glycine-dependent NADH formation essentially as described by Bourguignon et al. (3Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). P and T proteins were purified from pea leaves according to Bourguignon et al. (3Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained the following in a total volume of 500 μl: 10 mm Mops, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 160 μm H4PteGlu, 2 mmNAD+, 0.2 μm pea P protein dimer, 1 μm pea T protein, 0.9 μmH2LipDH, and various amounts of wild-type H protein or mutants (up to 50 μm). The reactions were maintained under a stream of argon to ensure anaerobic conditions in order to prevent the oxidation of H4PteGlu into H2PteGlu. The reactions were started by the addition of 20 mm glycine. The initial GDC rates were expressed as nmol of NADH formed/min. The methylamination of H protein by P protein was monitored by following the disappearance of free lipoylated H protein in the incubation medium (see Fig. 2). The reaction medium contained 10 mm Mops, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 1.25 mmNAD+, 0.3 μm porcine heart H2LipDH (additions of NAD+ and H2LipDH are required to provide H protein in a fully oxidized state), 0.2 μm pea P protein dimer, and 20 μm lipoylated H proteins in a final volume of 500 μl. The reaction performed at 30 °C was initiated by 20 mmglycine. Aliquots of 50 μl were taken from the reaction medium at different times (0, 5 s, 10 s, 15 s, etc., to 20 min) and added to 50 μl of a solution containing 10 mmcarboxymethoxylamine (an inhibitor of P protein (17Sarojini G. Oliver D.J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 77: 786-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) to stop the reaction. This 100 μl was then analyzed using the H2LipDH/TCEP assay described above to quantify the residual free lipoylated H protein and thus to deduce the amount of methylamine-loaded H protein. The methylamine-loaded H protein was converted, when needed, into dihydrolipoyl H protein by the addition of 1 μm T protein and 200 μmH4PteGlu (see Fig. 2). In another set of experiments, we investigated the stability of the methylamine-loaded lipoamide arm of H protein (wild type and mutants) as a function of time. First, the methylamination of H protein was carried out as described above for 30 min in a total volume of 500 μl. The reaction was then stopped by adding 500 μl of a solution containing 10 mm carboxymethoxylamine. The protein solution was then incubated at 30 °C, and aliquots of 100 μl were analyzed at different times with the H2LipDH/TCEP assay in order to monitor the appearance of the unloaded form of H protein. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed as described by Bourguignon et al. (18Bourguignon J. Vauclare P. Merand V. Forest E. Neuburger M. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). H proteins were analyzed by small angle x-ray scattering. Data were processed by linear regression. According to Guinier (21Guinier A. Fournet G. Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angles Scattering. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar), two experimental parameters can be determined: the forward scattered intensity, which is proportional to an apparent molecular mass, and an apparent radius of gyration of electron density for the particles. The H proteins were diluted in 20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA at a concentration of 10 mg/ml for HE14A protein and 5 mg/ml for the other proteins. NMR experiments were performed with samples containing 0.5–0.8 mm H proteins in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 90% H2O, and 10% D2O. Spectra were acquired at 27 °C using a Bruker AM-X spectrometer operating at 400 MHz. One-dimensional experiments were recorded at 27 °C. NMR spectra were the result of adding 512 scans. Chemical shifts were referenced relative to water resonance fixed at 4.75 ppm at 27 °C. Data were processed with the Felix program (MSI, Inc.). Spectral acquisition was performed on a Dichrograph Jobin Yvon CD6 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C between 190 and 260 nm. Purified H proteins were placed in a linear polarized beam in a cell with a path length of 0.1 mm at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA). Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide) as described by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

H apoproteins were also subjected to PAGE analysis in nondenaturing conditions (12% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide). The concentrations of proteins were estimated by the method of Lowry (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The pET-H plasmid carrying the cDNA encoding the mature form of pea mitochondrial H protein was mutagenized to produce the site-directed mutations within domains interacting with the lipoamide-methylamine arm or around the lipoyl-lysine residue. The wild-type pea H protein was expressed to more than 50% of total soluble proteins of E. coli, as reported before (13Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and all mutant proteins, designated HE14A, HE14D, HI27A, HS12K, and HV62M/A64M, were expressed in bacterial cells at similar levels (results not shown). The proteins were purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 a). Growth of bacteria without the addition of lipoic acid resulted in the exclusive production of apoproteins as demonstrated in a previous article (13Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses of the purified apoproteins gave the following masses: H, 13947 ± 1 Da; HE14A, 13888 ± 1 Da; HE14D, 13933 ± 1 Da; HI27A, 13905 ± 1 Da; HS12K, 13989 ± 1 Da; and HV62M/A64M, 14,040 ± 1 Da, values that are in agreement with those calculated from the primary structure deduced from the cDNA. Nondenaturing PAGE was carried out to determine whether there were any gross changes in the overall structures of the various mutants compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3 b). HE14A and HV62M/A64M apoprotein mutants moved as a fast migrating single band like wild-type H apoprotein. In marked contrast, HE14D, HI27A, and HS12K mutants moved much more slowly as several distinct bands (Fig. 3 b). As it could be the consequence of structural modification of the proteins, we have performed a deeper structural analysis of the wild-type and five mutated H apoproteins by various biophysical methods. Solutions of the different H apoproteins were analyzed by small angle x-ray scattering, and data were processed to give the Guinier plots shown in Fig.4. For HE14A and HV62M/A64M apoproteins, the observed radii of gyration of 13.2 and 13 Å, respectively, were in agreement with the 12.6-Å radius of gyration for wild-type H apoprotein and were coherent with a monomeric globular protein (9Cohen-Addad C. Faure M. Neuburger M. Ober R. Sieker L. Bourguignon J. Macherel D. Douce R. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the case of HE14D, HI27A, and HS12K apoproteins, data could not be processed with linear regression, yielding biphasic Guinier plots (Fig. 4). The observed values of radii of gyration calculated from the initial slope were 29.3, 33.7, and 30 Å, respectively, more than twice the wild-type pea H protein radius of gyration. These values and the shape of Guinier plots suggest that HE14D, HI27A, and HS12K apoproteins belong to a heterogeneous population of molecules, maybe aggregates, that may well result from an unfolded state (21Guinier A. Fournet G. Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angles Scattering. John Wiley & Sons, New York1955Google Scholar). Further evidence of unfolding was sought from circular dichroism spectroscopy. The spectrum of H apoprotein displayed the characteristics of a folded protein, representing α-helix and β-strand of the protein (Fig. 5). Spectra of HE14A and HV62M/A64M apoproteins were identical to that of H protein, suggesting that their proportions of secondary structures were very similar. In the case of HE14D, HI27A, and HS12K apoproteins, spectra markedly differed from the H protein spectrum and were characteristic of unfolded proteins (Fig. 5). To further test this hypothesis, we have analyzed apoproteins using NMR spectroscopy. The spectra of wild-type H apoprotein, HE14A, and HV62M/A64M apoproteins exhibited chemical shift values of amide protons in the range 6.4–9.7 ppm, which was clear evidence of well structured polypeptides. In addition, wild-type, HE14A, and HV62M/A64M apoproteins showed similar resonances between 6 and 7.5 ppm (Fig.6) as well as for the aliphatic protons (results not shown), indicating a structure similarity between these three proteins. In contrast, as could be expected from the results described above, the spectra of HE14D, HI27A, and HS12K were very different, with chemical shift values of the amide protons between 6.7 and 8.4 ppm (Fig. 6). Such spectra are characteristic of peptides in random coil conformation. As a whole, all of these results show that HE14A and HV62M/A64M apoproteins are correctly folded, having a three-dimensional structure close to that of the native H apoprotein, whereas the structures of HE14D, HI27A, and HS12K apoproteins were dramatically affected by the mutations. Therefore, only HE14A and HV62M/A64M mutants were analyzed biochemically in the following studies.Figure 5Circular dichroism analysis of the H apoprotein (H) and the five H apoprotein mutants: HE14A (HEA), HV62M/A64M (HVM/AM), HE14D (HED), HI27A (HIA), and HS12K (HSK). Apoproteins (0.5 mg/ml in 20 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) were analyzed in a Jobin Yvon Dichrograph with a cell of 0.1-mm path length and a volume of 300 μl.

This post-translation modification of pea H protein that occurred normally in the mitochondria was done in vitro using recombinant E. coli LPL, which was shown earlier to carry out the ATP-dependent attachment of the lipoate to the amine group of the lateral chain of K63 of the pea H protein (13Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We developed a new enzymatic assay to follow spectrophotometrically the lipoylation of apoproteins by LPL in a coupled assay that detected the presence of lipoylated H protein (see “Materials and Methods”). This assay combines the TCEP chemical reduction of lipoamide into dihydrolipoamide bound to H protein with its reoxidation catalyzed by dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (H2LipDH) in the presence of NAD+(see Fig. 2). In this experiment, the amount of lipoylated H protein (or mutants) was estimated with the H2LipDH/TCEP assay according to specific calibration curves made with known amounts of fully lipoylated protein (H, HE14A, and HV62M/A64M). Fig.7 showed that the H apoprotein lipoylation proceeded at a similar rate as that of HV62M/A64M and HE14A apoproteins. The lipoylation states of the different proteins (at 30 min) were also confirmed by mass spectrometry analyses (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization). We could estimate the proportions of lipoylated protein to between 95 and 100% (results not shown). These results demonstrated that neither mutations of Val62 and Al"

To study the transcriptional regulation of Fas ligand in the eye, we employed an immortalized mouse corneal endothelial cell line (C3H3) that constitutively expresses Fas ligand.

In contrast, this element was not required for Fas ligand transcriptional activity in Sertoli cells and airway epithelial cells.

Fas ligand polymerase chain reaction double-stranded nuclear factor for activated T cells nuclear factor κB serum response factor glucocorticoid receptor base pair(s) concatenated oligonucleotide Fas (APO-1, CD95) is a type I cell surface protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor family that transduces a cell death signal upon binding to Fas ligand (FasL)1 (1Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar). Fas is expressed in a variety of cell types such as activated T cells and B cells, macrophages, hepatocytes, keratinocytes, type II alveolar epithelial cells, and certain carcinoma cells (2Watanabe-Fukunaga R.

Bhat D. Din W Goodwin R.G. Seldin M.F. Immunity. 1994; 1: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Consistent with its potent proapoptotic activity during immune reactions, FasL is tightly regulated in T cells, with induction occurring subsequent to T cell receptor engagement (5Ju S.T. Panka D.J.

The relevant transcription factors controlling this induction include NFAT and early growth response-related proteins (9Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, FasL is constitutively expressed in certain nonlymphoid cell types such as the Paneth cell of the small intestine, endothelial and epithelial surface of the cornea, Sertoli cells of the testis, and Clara cells of the airway (7Suda T.

Notably, the regulatory elements controlling constitutive and organ-specific FasL expression have not been identified. The presence of inducible and constitutive modes of FasL expression suggests distinctive genetic regulatory mechanisms in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell populations. In the immune system, FasL plays a key role in controlling the expansion of activated T cells by eliminating autoreactive T cells. Furthermore, FasL-initiated signaling is directly involved in Th1 cell-mediated cytotoxicity (14Crispe I.N. Immunity. 1994; 1: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Defects in Fas expression in lpr mice as well as a loss of function point mutation of FasL in gld mice are associated with development of lymphadenopathy, lupus-like autoimmune disease and the unregulated migration of lymphocytic cells into various organs (1Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar). Although other factors are involved, FasL expression in nonlymphoid tissues such as the eye and testes contributes to the maintenance of tissue integrity by eliminating infiltrating Fas+leukocytes. As a result, the eye and testes are relatively resistant to the immune injuries associated with tissue graft rejection and infection; this unique status is termed immune privilege (11Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 16Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C.

Consequently, ocular viral infection in gld mice results in significantly more extensive and destructive inflammatory cell infiltration than in wild-type mice (11Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). During transplantation, corneal graft cells expressing FasL induce apoptosis of infiltrating host immune cells, thereby improving corneal allograft survival (11Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar,16Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C.

These findings suggest that alterations in the expression of FasL may be an important element controlling the outcome of corneal allografting. In this study, we sought to characterize the molecular basis for constitutive FasL gene expression in cornea cells. To meet this goal, we characterized mouse FasL promoter activity and found that action of ∼30-kDa nuclear protein at a TCCT box (−292 to −302) is involved in the constitutive expression of FasL in corneal endothelial cells. Total RNA from corneal endothelial cells (C3H3 cells) was extracted by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the reverse transcription system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FasL and β-actin cDNAs were amplified with Taq DNA polymerase using mouse FasL primers (5′-CTTAGCTTCTCTGGAGCAGTCAGCGTCAGAG, 3′-CCTTCTTCTTTAGAGGGGTCAGTGGCGGCA) and specific β-actin primers (Promega) before separation and visualization in a 2% agarose gel. The identity of the Fas ligand PCR product was confirmed by restriction mapping. C3H3 cells were grown to confluence, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored at −20 °C until use. Cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels before transfer of proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was first blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 0.1% TPBS buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. After this, the membrane was incubated with a polyclonal antibody directed against mouse Fas ligand (kindly provided by Dr. J. Tschopp, University of Lausanne) in 0.1% TPBS for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with 0.1% TPBS, the blots were incubated with a secondary HRP-conjugated anti-IgG (Promega) for 1 h and exposed to x-ray film after treatment with enhanced luminol reagent (NEN Life Science Products). The mouse FasL promoter was isolated and sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AF045739). Mouse FasL promoter-luciferase plasmids were subsequently constructed by inserting various lengths of the 5′-flanking sequence of the fasL gene into the Kpn I-Hin dIII sites of pGL3B vector (Promega). This vector contains a multicloning cassette upstream from the firefly luciferase gene. Importantly, a single FasL transcriptional start site was previously identified in mouse tissues, 2J. Zhang, K. Miranda, B. Ma, and A. Fine, unpublished data. which for the purposes of this paper is designated the +1 nucleotide. To generate promoter fragments, the plasmid pGL3B-618 was used as a template during PCR. After amplification, smaller promoter fragments containing from −332 to + 71, −246 to +71, and −104 to +71 of fasL gene were isolated and subcloned into the pGL3B vector to obtain pGL3B-332, pGL3B-246, and pGL3B-104, respectively. For site-directed mutagenesis, construct pGL3B-313m was generated by replacing the wild-type antisense oligonucleotide with a mutated oligonucleotide containing bp substitutions localized to the −302TCCT−298(TCCT to GATC). C3H3 cells, an SV-40 immortalized cell line were kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Ksander (Scheppen's Eye Institute). Mouse Sertoli cells (TM4) and mouse airway epithelial cells (LA4) were purchased from ATCC. Both of these cell types constitutively express FasL (data not shown). For transfection, luciferase assays were performed following the manufacturer's instruction using the LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, the cells were seeded into 6-well plates (Costar) at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Cells were then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 2 μg of luciferase plasmid, 1 μg of β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, and 10 μg of LipofectAMINETM. After 5 h, the medium was replaced, and total cellular proteins were harvested after 24 h. Luciferase activity of the supernatant was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described elsewhere (29Edlund T. Walker M.D. Baw P.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) to normalize transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared following the method described by Schreiber et al. (18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) and Bohinski et al. (19Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. After adding 10% Nonidet P-40, samples were resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min, the supernatant (nuclear extracts) was saved and stored at −80 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by the method described by Bohinski et al. (19Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). For the generation of probes, an 87-bp double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragment F87 (−332 to −246; generated by PCR) or a 28-bp double-stranded DNA fragment F2 (−313 to −286) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). For competition assays, dsDNA fragments were added (100- to 300-fold molar excess) at the beginning of the binding reaction. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), buffer and protease inhibitors (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride),32P-labeled probe (100,000 cpm), and 10 μg of nuclear extracts. The binding reaction mixture of probe and nuclear extracts was exposed to UV light (254 nm) for 30 min at a distance of 5 cm from the light source. The DNA-protein complex was visualized in the gel shift assay, isolated, and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To examine the expression of FasL in mouse corneal endothelial cells, total RNA from C3H3 cells was isolated, reverse-transcribed, and amplified by PCR. The cDNA from Sertoli cells (TM4 cells) and H2O were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. By employing FasL-specific primers, appropriately sized cDNA products for FasL (321 bp) were generated (2nd and 3rd lanes in Fig.1 A); the identity of the FasL PCR product was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion (data not shown). To further study the production of FasL in corneal cell culture, C3H3 cell protein lysates were examined by Western analysis. As predicted, immunoblotting with an anti-mouse FasL antibody revealed the expression of a band with a Mr of 40 kDa (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results indicate that the C3H3 cell line can serve as a suitable in vitro system to investigate the basis for constitutive FasL expression in the cornea. To examine transcriptional control of FasL expression in corneal C3H3 cells, a series of mouse FasL promoter fragments with 5′ deletions were generated by PCR and ligated to the pGL3B vector. Constructs were tested for promoter activity by incubating vector DNA containing liposomes with C3H3 cell cultures. Promoter activity was expressed relative to a promoter-less construct and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The data displayed in Fig.2 shows the average of three experiments (n = 3 for each experiment) for each of the constructs. It is interesting that the construct containing 332 bp of immediate upstream sequence (−332/+71) had the highest luciferase activity in C3H3 cells (Fig. 2). Further deletion to −246 (−246/+71) caused a dramatic decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 2). These results indicate the presence of a positive regulatory element(s) located from −332 to −246. To locate the potential transcription factor binding sites within the active 87-bp fragment (−332 to −246), gel mobility shift assays were performed. As shown in Fig.3 A, nuclear proteins derived from C3H3 cells bound to ds oligonucleotide FLP87 (−332 to −246) and formed two retarded DNA-protein complex bands (arrows). The specificity of these bands was confirmed through competition assays; 100- to 300-fold molar excess of nonradioactive FLP87 attenuated the formation of the two retarded bands (lanes 3, 4, and 5). To further localize the relevant binding region, we determined the effect of 4 overlapping oligonucleotides in competition assays (Fig.3 A). Importantly, the F2 oligonucleotide (−313 to −286) but not F1 (−332 to −305) or F3 (−290 to −263) or F4 (−271 to −248) had the capacity to block DNA-protein complex formation (lane 7). In these studies, F2 blocked formation of the faster migrating complex (II). This suggested that a key nuclear protein binding site(s) was located from −313 to −286 bp. The importance and functional significance of the slower migrating complex is uncertain at this time. To identify the potential regulatory elements in the F2 region, we examined the effect of substituted mutations in oligonucleotide F2 (−313 to −286) during competition binding assays. For this analysis, we employed mini-gels. We found that F2-M2, which contains a mutated−302TCCT−298 sequence (TCCT to GATC) failed to inhibit the formation of the protein-DNA complex (Fig.3 B). In contrast, F2-M1 and F2-M3, which contain mutations at other sites in the F2 oligonucleotide sequence, retained the ability to inhibit complex formation. These results strongly suggest that the key site of protein binding in the F2 fragment encompasses the sequence−302TCCT−298. To further examine the −302TCCT−298 site, we employed a concatenated oligonucleotide (CE) that contains five multimers of TCCT and flanking sequence (TGTCCTCA TGTCCTCA TGTCCTCA TGTCCTCA TGTCCTCA) in mini-gel shift assays. Interestingly, we found that CE specifically bound to C3H3 nuclear extracts (Fig.4 A), forming a complex with the same relative mobility as seen in studies with the F2 oligonucleotide. Moreover, excess cold CE inhibited formation of the F2-nuclear protein complex (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that the core sequence TCCT, located at −302 to −298 in the FasL promoter, binds to a nuclear protein derived from C3H3 cells and may play a role in constitutive FasL expression in corneal cells. Analysis of the 5′ deletion constructs (Fig. 2) indicated the presence of an enhancer between −332 to −246 bp, whereas the gel mobility shift assays, as described above, localized nuclear protein binding to the core sequence−302TCCT−298. To determine the role of the−302TCCT−298 site during constitutive FasL promoter function in C3H3 cells, we characterized the activity of a construct with site-directed mutations in the−302TCCT−298 motif. As shown in Fig.5 A, the relative activity of the mutant construct (TCCT to GATC) was decreased by approximately 50% when compared with the wild-type construct. These results show that the core sequence −302TCCT−298 functions as a major positive cis-element for the expression of the fasL gene in corneal endothelial cells. To determine whether the −302TCCT−298cis-element was active in other nonlymphoid cell types that constitutively express FasL, transfections of the wild-type and mutated FasL promoter constructs were performed in mouse Sertoli cells (TM4) and mouse airway epithelial cells (LA4). As shown in Fig.5 B, the −302TCCT−298 mutant construct exhibited comparable activity to that of the wild-type construct in both TM4 and LA4 cells. These findings are consistent with recent work showing that the active site mediating constitutive FasL expression in airway epithelial cells is a palindromic sequence situated at approximately −245 from the transcriptional start site. 3J. Zhang, B. Ma, A. Marshak-Rothstein, and A. Fine, submitted for publication. To further examine the relative role of the TCCT element in constitutive FasL expression, we utilized the F2 oligonucleotide in gel shift analyses with Sertoli cell nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig.6 A, the mobility pattern of DNA-protein complexes generated with Sertoli cell extracts was significantly different that observed with C3H3 extracts. Similar findings were observed in several repeat experiments. Of note, a prominent faster migrating complex was observed with Sertoli cell extracts (lower arrow marked II). Moreover, we found that mutant oligonucleotides F2-M1 (CTAA to AGCG), F2-M2 (TCCT to GATC), and F2-M3 (AGGG to GATA) competitively inhibited the formation of this faster migrating DNA-protein complex in gel shift analyses performed with Sertoli cell lysates (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these results indicate that the enhancer activity of the−302TCCT−298 element may be specific to regulation of fasL gene in corneal endothelial cells. The−302TCCT−298 element and 10 flanking nucleotides were analyzed for possible transcription factor interactions (20Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). This computer analysis suggested the possibility that the serum response factor (SRF) or the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) may be the key nuclear proteins binding to the core−302TCCT−298 element. To determine the potential role of these factors in FasL promoter activity, we examined the effect of consensus SRF and GR oligonucleotides on formation of DNA-protein complexes during gel shift studies. As shown in Fig.7 A, a consensus binding oligonucleotide for SRF (SRE) as well as its mutant did not interrupt complex formation with the F2 oligonucleotide (lanes 4 and 5). Similarly, a consensus GR oligonucleotide and its mutant had no major effect on complex formation (Fig.7 B, lanes 4 and 5). These results show that the SRF and GR are unlikely to be the proteins binding to the−302TCCT−298 element. To estimate the Mr of the protein binding to the−302TCCT−298 element, corneal nuclear proteins were UV-cross-linked to the F2 oligonucleotide. For this, radiolabeled DNA-protein complexes were exposed to UV light (254 nm) for 30 min before gel elution and separation by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 8, a single band of approximately 45 kDa comprising the DNA-protein complex was identified. By subtracting the Mr of ds F2, the Mr of the−302TCCT−298 binding protein was estimated to be ∼ 30. Similar results were obtained in a repeat experiment. Importantly, both SRF and GR are significantly larger than 30 kDa (21Saoud C.J. Wood C.E Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,22Liu S.H. Peng B.H. Ma J.T. Liu Y.C. Ng S.Y. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the characterization of the mouse FasL promoter in a mouse corneal cell line (C3H3) that constitutively expresses FasL. A deletion analysis indicated the presence of an active site situated between −332 to +71. Contained within this region was the active core sequence −302TCCT−298. Mutations at this site significantly attenuated promoter activity. In contrast, mutations at this site did not affect promoter activity in Sertoli and airway epithelial cell lines. These results implicate the−302TCCT−298 element in mediating the constitutive expression of the mouse fasL gene in corneal endothelial cells. In addition, our gel shift and UV cross-linking studies demonstrated that the DNA-binding protein interacting at the−302TCCT−298 element has a Mr of approximately 30. To date, the transcriptional control of the FasL promoter has been predominantly investigated in T cells. Studies in activated human T cells showed that the NFAT family of transcription factors plays a critical role in the regulation of Fas ligand (9Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Notably, two NFAT sites are located within the proximal promoter region of both the human and mouse promoter; these sites specifically bind to NFAT proteins derived from Jurkat T cell lysates (9Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of these sites indicates that both NFAT sites are important for optimal expression of FasL in activated Jurkat T cells (9Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31427-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NF-κB action may also important for FasL expression in T cells. In this regard, incubation of activated hybridoma T cells with a specific inhibitor of NF-κB translocation blocks fasL gene activation and Fas ligand-dependent cytotoxicity (23Matsui K. Omura S. Cui H. Schauer S. Sonenshein G.E. Ju S.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Matsui K. Fine A. Zhu B. Marshak-Rothstein A. Ju S.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3469-3473PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of a proximal NF-κB site significantly reduces FasL promoter activity (24Matsui K. Fine A. Zhu B. Marshak-Rothstein A. Ju S.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3469-3473PubMed Google Scholar). A proximal FasL regulatory element has been implicated in mediating FasL promoter activity in murine T cell hybridomas and human T cell blasts (25Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In these investigations, members of the early growth response family of transcription factors were found to activate this site. In other studies, the transcription factor AP-1 has been shown to participate in stress-induced FasL expression in neuronal cells (26Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Notably, our deletion analysis and gel shift studies demonstrate that these previously characterized promoter sites and associated transcription factors do not play a significant role in the constitutive expression of FasL in corneal endothelial cells. We believe our results along with these observations demonstrate distinctive modes of genetic regulation for inducible and constitutive forms of FasL expression. Furthermore, our findings suggest that a unique mechanism regulates FasL transcription in the cornea. Several studies have shown that FasL is a critical factor controlling inflammatory cell infiltration of eye tissue. Indeed, the constitutive expression of FasL is involved in maintaining the so-called immune privilege status of the eye, in addition to the testis (11Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 12French L.E. Tschopp J. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1996; 97: 156-160PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Stuart et al. (27Stuart P.M. Griffith T.S. Usui N. Pepose J., Yu, X. Ferguson T.A. J. Clin Invest. 1997; 99: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) demonstrated that wild type but not gld corneal grafts survive after allogeneic transplantation. Similar results have been found in models of Sertoli cell allografting (16Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Protection from immune-mediated tissue rejection is believed to result from the ability of constitutively expressed graft FasL to induce the apoptosis of infiltrating Fas+ host effector T cells (11Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 16Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 17Streilein J.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1158-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 27Stuart P.M. Griffith T.S. Usui N. Pepose J., Yu, X. Ferguson T.A. J. Clin Invest. 1997; 99: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). During pancreatic tissue grafting, however, transplantation of islet cells engineered to express FasL induces an exuberant neutrophilic infiltration with accelerated rejection (28Kang S.M. Schneider D.B. Lin Z. Hanahan D. Dichek D.A. Stock P.G. Baekkeskov S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that additional tissue-specific factors may be involved in regulating the immune protective effects of FasL. Importantly, the anterior chamber of the eye contains substances known to modulate immune cell activity; these include transforming growth factor-β and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (17Streilein J.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1158-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a−302TCCT−298 element is essential for the optimal constitutive expression of the mouse FasL promoter in a corneal cell line. This site was not required for constitutive promoter activity in Sertoli cells or mouse airway epithelial cells. Further analysis indicated that a ∼30-kDa protein binds to this region and, thus, likely contributes to the constitutive expression of FasL in corneal cells. Identification of this protein will help clarify molecular mechanisms mediating transcriptional control of FasL in the cornea."

Using a fluorescence in situ hybridization assay and interspecific backcross panel mapping, we have localized the Cig30 locus to the distal region of mouse chromosome 19, between the Tlx1 and Ins1 loci. Sequencing of the corresponding λ clone to completion revealed that the insert contained yet another gene in the opposite orientation. It turned out to be the newly identified homeobox gene Pitx3. Interestingly, the genes are very tightly linked, so that the 3′ ends of their transcripts are complementary. Thus, our results provide evidence for bidirectional transcription of a several hundred base pair-long DNA region as a result of the extremely tight linkage between Cig30 and Pitx3.

Despite the amount of biochemical data pertaining to the function of this novel gene family, conclusive evidence elucidating its physiological role is still lacking. The present knowledge comes almost exclusively from studies of three paralogous yeast genes of this family. Two of these yeast genes, known as FEN1/GNS1/VBM2/ELO2 and SUR4/APA1/SRE1/ELO3, have been implicated in a complex pleiotropic phenotype suggesting a defect in a plasma membrane function and/or interaction between the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton (2Revardel E. Bonneau M. Durrens P. Aigle M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In accord with this view, it has recently been proposed that both FEN1/GNS1/VBM2/ELO2 and SUR4/APA1/SRE1/ELO3 are involved in fatty acid chain elongation resulting in very long chain fatty acids of up to 26 carbon atoms (3Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), whereas the third yeast paralogue, the J0343/YJL196C/ELO1 gene, was found to catalyze the elongation of shorter fatty acid species, primarily between C-14 and C-16 (4Toke D.A. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In a search for genes selectively induced during the recruitment process in brown adipose tissue, Cig30 was identified as the first mammalian member of this gene family (1Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Under thermo-neutral conditions, Cig30 is weakly expressed in brown fat, liver, and skin. Following a 3-day cold exposure, Cig30 expression in brown fat is strongly and selectively induced more than 200 times. Highly elevated Cig30 mRNA levels are also found in two other conditions of brown fat recruitment, i.e. during perinatal development and after cafeteria diet. Although the effect of cold on Cig30 expression can be largely mimicked by norepinephrine infusion in vivo, our studies on primary cultures of brown adipocytes have revealed that a dexamethasone stimulus is also required for full Cig30 expression, implying that a synergistic action of catecholamines and glucocorticoids is necessary for maximal Cig30 stimulation. To study the regulation of Cig30 in greater detail, and in pursuit of Cig30 gene disruption by homologous recombination, we isolated a 14-kb1 genomic clone from the mouse 129 strain liver genomic DNA library and clarified the genomic structure of the Cig30 gene. Unexpectedly, we found that Cig30 is tightly linked to Pitx3, a homeobox gene and established that the transcription units of both gene overlap. Genomic clones of Cig30 were isolated by plaque hybridization of a commercial mouse 129 strain liver genomic DNA library in the Lambda FIX II vector (Stratagene catalog no. 946308) with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to 1.2 kb from the 5′ end of the Cig30 cDNA (GenBank accession no. U97107). Hybridization was carried out overnight at 45 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardts' solution, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml degraded herring sperm DNA. The membranes were first washed twice for 15 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and a high stringency wash was then performed at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15–30 min. Screening of approximately 1.5 × 106plaques yielded two positive recombinants, which were isolated by two additional rounds of plaque purification. Phage DNA was prepared on a large scale by the polyethylene glycol precipitation method as described previously (5Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction fragments generated by various combinations of restriction enzymes were analyzed by Southern blotting, and the presence of the 3′ end of the Cig30 gene was checked by hybridization with a 3′ untranslated region probe (0.8 kb from the 3′ end of the Cig30 cDNA). Using recombinant phage DNA as a template, the genomic insert was sequenced by the primer walking strategy. Sequencing was performed with an ABI 373A automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) on reactions prepared by the dye-termination method, using the ABI Prisms dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). The sequence information was compiled and analyzed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group software (6Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). The complete nucleotide sequence of the 13,869-bp genomic fragment has been deposited in GenBank (accession no.AF054504). Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (7Courseaux A. Grosgeorge J. Garnier G. Larsson C. Ayraud N. Gaudray P. Raynaud S.D. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 1313-1317PubMed Google Scholar). The probe, consisting of the entire 14-kb fragment of mouse Cig30 genomic DNA in the phage vector, was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by nick translation using the Bio-Nick Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). 100 ng of labeled DNA was coprecipitated in the presence of 20 μg of Cot1 DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.), denatured at 70 °C for 10 min, and pre-annealed at 37 °C for 30 min. An overnight hybridization was then carried out on metaphase chromosomes from the mouse SV 22CD cell line (8Baron B. Metezeau P. Kelly F. Bernheim A. Berger R. Guenet J.L. Goldberg M.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 152: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The signal was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence images were captured using a high performance cooled charge-coupled device C4880 camera (Hamamatsu) interfaced to a PC 486DX33 with a Matrox 640 card. All digital image acquisition, processing, and analysis functions were accomplished using an Alcatel software package (Fluogen). Chromosomal linkage of Cig30 was determined using the interspecific backcross DNA panel mapping resource of The Jackson Laboratory that were generated by mating (C57BL/6J × SPRET/Ei)F1 females and SPRET/Ei males (9Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R. Frankel W.N. Letts V.A. Eppig J.T. Ko M.S. Thurston S.J. Birkenmeier E.H. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). A total of 94 mice were used to map Cig30 by Southern blot analysis of a polymorphic Bam HI restriction fragment, the size of which was 8.2 and 7.5 kb in C57BL/6J and Mus spretus mice, respectively. The probe was a Cig30 ORF cDNA fragment (see below) labeled with [32P]dCTP as described (10Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing conditions have been described elsewhere (11Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). Chromosome linkage and recombination distances were calculated by MapManager. Total RNA was isolated using the ULTRASPECTM RNA isolation system (BIOTECX) from the skin and liver of a 6-week-old NMRI male mouse kept at room temperature and from the brown adipose tissue of another sibling male mouse that was cold-exposed at 4 °C for 3 days. Northern blotting and hybridization was performed as described previously (1Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The DNA probes used were the following: the Cig30 ORF probe (a 871-bp fragment corresponding to nt 162–1056 in the Cig30 cDNA), the Cig30 3′ probe (a 294-bp Pst I-Stu I fragment corresponding to nt 10646–10939 in the genomic clone), and the Pitx3 probe (a 897-bp Pst I-Pst I fragment corresponding to nt 11443–12340 in the genomic clone). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Amplification of the 3′ cDNA ends was performed with mouse liver Marathon-Ready cDNA and the Advantage KlenTaq polymerase mix (both fromCLONTECH) following the supplier's recommendations. Five μl of cDNA template were amplified using the Cig30-specific primer (5′-TCTTTGAAAACGGGATAGGGGGAGTC-3′, nt 10973–10998 in the genomic clone) and the AP1 primer in touchdown PCR, which was carried out for a total of 40 cycles (5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 2 min). For nested PCR, 10 pmol of the forward primer (5′-GGTGAGCCAAGGGTGAAT-3′, nt 11011–11028) was used together with 10 pmol of the reverse primer (5′-TGAAAGGGGTGCCAGAGC-3′, nt 11177–11160) on 2 μl of the 3′ RACE product without further purification. PCR was performed with KlenTaq polymerase for 30 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min), and the PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE and photographed. Genomic DNA was prepared from mouse tails or human lymphocytes by the simplified mammalian DNA isolation procedure published by Laird et al. (12Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Tail biopsies were collected from 3-week-old mice of the C57BL/6J strain and used directly for DNA isolation. For human DNA preparation, cell nuclei were first purified from the blood of a normal Caucasian female donor by the following procedure. 40 ml of blood was mixed with 60 ml of buffer A (0.32 m sucrose, 5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) and centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer B (0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The washing step was repeated once with 20 ml of buffer B. The final pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of buffer B and frozen at −70 °C. Digested DNA was separated on an 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to standard procedures (5Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing conditions were identical to those used for library screening, except that the second wash was carried out under low-stringency conditions (15 min at 40 °C in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS). The radiolabel was detected by exposing to DuPont Cronex x-ray films with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. A mouse genomic library was screened using Cig30 cDNA (1Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as a probe. The screening yielded two independent λ clones, which were characterized by restriction analysis and Southern blotting. Following digestion of the phage DNA with Sal I and Xba I, the size of the two inserts was estimated to be 14 and 13 kb, respectively. Subsequent hybridization with probes specific for the 5′ and 3′ ends of the Cig30 cDNA indicated that both genomic clones contained the entire Cig30 gene (not shown). In the 14-kb genomic clone, the Cig30 gene appeared to be conveniently located in the middle of the insert, and we determined its nucleotide sequence by primer walking strategy directly from the phage DNA. Sequencing revealed that the Cig30 gene consists of four exons, which span 4 kb of genomic DNA (Table I and Fig.3 A). The exons range in size from 132 to 1319 bp and the size of introns range from 222 to 1132 bp. The splice junctions of the three intervening introns conform to the 5′-G(T/A)G-3′ rule (13Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar), matching almost perfectly the broader consensus for the donor site (GTRAGT) and for the acceptor site (YYNYAG) (14Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). The first two introns are phase II, interrupting codons between the second and third nucleotide of the coding triplet, whereas intron 3 is phase I. The translation initiation codon (ATG) is located in the first exon, and the protein coding sequence stretches over all four exons, the major part being in exon 4.Table IExon/intron boundary sequences of the mouse Cig30 geneExonExon sizeLocation in cDNASplice donorIntron sizeSplice acceptorbpbp12751–275GAGTACTG/gt gagacctg1132atctgttttctgccctcc ag/GGTAAGCTE Y W (35)V S S2132276–407ATATTCAG/gt aagttagt743tgtgcatggtctcactcc ag/TATCCTGGI F S (79)I L G3152408–559TGAACTGG/gt gagtgcag222tatgatccctcacctctc ag/GAGACACG E L G (130)D T41319560–1878Exon sequences are in capital letters.

The amino acid positions encoded by spliced codons are indicated in parentheses. The Cig30 gene encodes a 30-kDa membrane glycoprotein with at least five putative transmembrane domains (1Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The exon/intron structure of Cig30 does not, however, correlate with the transmembrane organization of the CIG30 protein. The chromosomal location of Cig30 in the mouse was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of mouse SV 22CD metaphase chromosomes using the 14-kb λ genomic clone as a probe. In the karyotype of the SV 22CD cell line, all chromosomes are fused in pairs, except for chromosome 19 and the slightly larger X chromosome (8Baron B. Metezeau P. Kelly F. Bernheim A. Berger R. Guenet J.L. Goldberg M.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 152: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This chromosomal abnormality was accidentally of great benefit in the chromosomal determination, because the twin spot signals were observed specifically on a single unfused chromosome pair, which was readily identified as chromosome 19 (Fig.1). To further refine the localization of the Cig30 gene, we employed interspecific backcross analysis using progeny derived from matings of ((C57BL/6JEi × SPRET/Ei)F1 × SPRET/Ei), known as Jackson BSS (9Rowe L.B.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism between C57BL/6J and M. spretus in the Cig30 locus was revealed by Southern blot hybridization, using the coding region of the Cig30 cDNA as a probe. The 7.5-kb Bam HI M. spretus restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to follow the segregation of the Cig30 locus in backcross mice. The mapping results indicated linkage with markers in the distal region of mouse chromosome 19. Cig30 segregated with markers D19Mit3 and D19Mit4, placing Cig30 between the Tlx1 (T-cell leukemia, homeobox 1) and Ins1 (insulin I) genes (Fig.2). We analyzed the entire 13,869-bp contiguous sequence carrying the Cig30 gene with the Testcode program (6Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) and found several regions downstream of the last Cig30 exon with a high likelihood of protein coding capacity (not shown). A BLAST search revealed that these regions correspond in fact to the Pitx3 gene (Fig.3). Pitx3 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor gene belonging to the Rieg/Pitx homeobox gene family (15Semina E.V. Reiter R.S. Murray J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which has been implicated in anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis and congenital cataracts in humans (16Semina E.V.

The Pitx3 gene consists of four exons; their exon-intron junctions have been characterized (15Semina E.V. Reiter R.S. Murray J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but the genomic sequence has not been published. Our λ genomic clone covers, however, the last three exons and two introns of the Pitx3 gene. Sequence identity between the published Pitx3 cDNA sequence (GenBank accession no. AF005772) and the sequence we have determined from our genomic clone is 99.68% over a total region of 1251 nucleotides. Of the four mismatches, two are in the protein coding region, and both of them are silent. Extending the earlier published information on the Pitx3 gene structure, our data allowed the determination of the exact size of the second and third introns to 182 and 377 bp, respectively. Cig30 and Pitx3 are oriented in a tail-to-tail manner in a strikingly tight linkage. In fact, their published cDNA sequences (1Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Semina E.V. Reiter R.S. Murray J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) appear to be complementary over the last 10 nucleotides. As we had earlier noted lack of a polyadenylation signal consensus at the 3′ end of the Cig30 cDNA and the presence of several Cig30 mRNA species on Northern blots (1Tvrdik P. Asadi A. Kozak L.P. Nedergaard J. Cannon B. Jacobsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31738-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we decided to establish the major cleavage site of Cig30 transcription. When total RNA from mouse skin, liver, and brown fat was hybridized to the Cig30 ORF probe, we consistently detected three Cig30 mRNA species, designated I, II, and III (Fig.4 A). Most radioactivity was bound in band II (70%), less in band III (20%), and band I accounted only for about 10% of the total signal. To identify the individual bands, we hybridized an identical parallel blot with a Cig30 3′ probe, which was situated downstream of the only polyadenylation signal consensus sequence in the Cig30 gene at 10546 (Fig.3 C). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the Cig30 3′ probe hybridized principally at band I′, which seemed identical to band I obtained with the Cig30 ORF probe. A minor amount of the signal was also found in band II′, which was different from all bands in Fig. 4 A and could be either a degradation product or an alternatively spliced or initiated transcript. Thus, our results indicate that most of the Cig30 transcripts are cleaved at the polyadenylation signal consensus at 10546 (plausibly band II) or earlier (band III). A small but significant number of the primary transcripts, however, are elongated considerably beyond the polyadenylation signal consensus site. To confirm the presence of long Cig30 mRNA species, we searched the data base of expressed sequence tags (EST) for sequences corresponding to 3′ ends of randomly cloned Cig30 transcripts. We found five cDNA fragments that are schematically aligned in Fig. 3 B. Three of the five cloned 3′ ends (GenBank accession no. AA798121, AA798103, and AA562425) conform with cleavage immediately downstream of the polyadenylation signal (Fig.5 A). Notably, in addition to the sequence published by us (GenBank accession no. U97107), the two other EST cDNA clones (GenBank accession no. AA241332 and AA062140) indicate cleavage events at various points several hundred base pairs downstream. These transcripts constitute an overlap with the fourth Pitx3 exon in an antiparallel manner (Fig. 5 B), ranging from 10 up to about 300 bp (Fig. 5 C). We found no EST clone indicative of a longer Pitx3 transcript than the published Pitx3 cDNA sequence (GenBank accession no.AF005772). This sequence contains a perfect polyadenylation signal consensus (Fig. 5 B) and apparently corresponds to a full-length transcript. In contrast, none of the long Cig30 transcripts (Fig. 5, B and C) possess a polyadenylation signal upstream of the cleavage site, suggesting that their polyadenylation is controlled by some other signal or occurs more or less randomly. Consistent with that view, we obtained no predominant PCR product in a 3′ RACE experiment performed on mouse liver cDNA using the specific primer downstream of the Cig30 cleavage site at 10951. However, following a second round of PCR with two nested PCR primers (corresponding to nt 11011–11028 and 11177–11160), we amplified the anticipated 167-bp product, confirming that in liver such Cig30 transcripts exist that overlap Pitx3 by at least 236 bp (Fig. 6). In a parallel reaction, the same pair of primers failed to amplify the product directly from mouse liver cDNA, implying that the product obtained by nested PCR was specific for Cig30 and not for Pitx3 transcription. Moreover, the Pitx3 probe (Fig. 3 C) gave no signal after Northern hybridization to the blots in Fig. 4 (not shown), indicating that (i) Pitx3 is not expressed in brown fat, liver, or skin in adult mice and that (ii) very few, if any, Cig30 transcripts exist that would overlap with Pitx3 by more than 500 bp.Figure 6PCR analysis of 3′ Cig30 cDNA ends in mouse liver.

Thus, we asked whether there is a nucleotide sequence in the human genome that would specifically hybridize with mouse Cig30 cDNA. As shown in Fig.7, following digestion with Bam HI, Eco RI, Hin dIII, and Xba I, the mouse Cig30 ORF probe not only strongly hybridized to mouse genomic fragments (which were of the predicted size) but also specifically hybridized to human genomic DNA, indicating the presence of a homologous CIG30 sequence. In both cases, a simple pattern of hybridization was seen, suggesting that Cig30 is a single-copy gene in both the mouse and human genomes. Cig30 is the first mammalian member of a gene family that has been suggested to be involved in the elongation of very long chain fatty acids. We report here its genomic structure and chromosomal location. Our mapping results indicate that Cig30 is located in the distal region of mouse chromosome 19, which links with D19Mit4. Semina et al. (15Semina E.V. Reiter R.S. Murray J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) obtained an identical result using the same BSS panel to follow Pitx3 polymorphism. Furthermore, in addition to the BSS panel, they also used the (C57BL/6J M. spretus)F1 × C57BL/6J panel from The Jackson Laboratory and identified two crossover events (in 94 animals) between Pitx3 and D19Mit4. By combining the data from both crosses, Semina et al. suggest that Pitx3 is located 1.06 ± 0.75 centimorgans proximal of D19Mit4. In the mouse genome data base map, Pitx3 has been accordingly assigned to 46.5 centimorgans from the proximal end of chromosome 19. The genetic distance between Cig30 and Pitx3 is minimal, and Cig30 should therefore be assigned to the same chromosomal location. It cannot be concluded from our data whether Cig30 is proximal or distal to Pitx3. The distal part of mouse chromosome 19 shares a region of homology with human chromosome 10q. Human paralogues of several mouse genes linked with Cig30, such as HOX11, CYP17, or COL17A1, map to chromosome 10q24, suggesting that human CIG30 could reside in the same region. In good agreement, Semina et al. (16Semina E.V. Ferrell R.E. Mintz H.H. Bitoun P. Alward W.L. Reiter R.S. Funkhauser C. Daack H.S. Murray J.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) mapped human PITX3 to 10q25. Several human disorders of unknown genetic etiology have been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 10. Among these are urofacial syndrome (17Wang C.Y. Hawkins L.B. Ochoa B. Walker R.D. She J.X. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), endometrial carcinoma (18Nagase S. Sato S. Tezuka F. Wada Y. Yajima A. Horii A. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), juvenile intestinal polyposis (19Jacoby R.F. Schlack S. Sekhon G. Laxova R. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 70: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia (20Nikali K. Isosomppi J. Lonnqvist T. Mao J.I. Suomalainen A. Peltonen L. Genomics. 1997; 39: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), corneal dystrophy of Bowman layer (21Yee R.W. Sullivan L.S. Lai H.T. Stock E.L. Lu Y. Khan M.N. Blanton S.H. Daiger S.P. Genomics. 1997; 46: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and partial epilepsy (22Ottman R. Risch N. Hauser W.A. Pedley T.A. Lee J.H. Barker C.C. Lustenberger A. Nagle K.J. Lee K.S. Scheuer M.L. et al.Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, none of these syndromes is easily reconcilable with the pattern of Cig30 expression observed in the mouse model (brown fat, liver, skin) nor with the tentative biochemical role of the CIG30 protein (biosynthesis of complex lipids). Obviously, further progress in this area must await the cloning of the human CIG30 gene. This should be facilitated by our finding that the mouse Cig30 cDNA hybridizes to a unique nucleotide sequence in the human genome. It is generally accepted that adjacent mammalian genes are normally separated by tens to hundreds of kilobases. Although gene clusters are occasionally found in vertebrates, they typically consist of homologous genes that probably arose by gene duplication (such as globin genes or homeobox genes), or they involve genes that are functionally related (e.g. histone genes). Here we show that two apparently unrelated mouse genes occupy as little as 8–9 kb totally (depending on the size of the first Pitx3 intron). Moreover, this study indicates that the 3′ end of Cig30 overlaps with the 3′ end of Pitx3. Similar arrays are uncommon in eukaryotes (23Lerner A. D'Adamio L. Diener A.C. Clayton L.K. Reinherz E.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar, 24Batshake B. Sundelin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Campbell H.D. Fountain S. Young I.G. Claudianos C. Hoheisel J.D. Chen K.S. Lupski J.R. Genomics. 1997; 42: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Clearly, overlapping genes in opposite orientations generate transcripts that could form RNA duplexes, if present in the same cell. Although both Cig30 and Pitx3 genes exhibit rather restricted tissue expression patterns, Pitx3 appears to be expressed primarily during embryonal development. In day 10 postcoitum mouse embryos, Pitx3 mRNA is found in the lens placode and the forming lens pit and then, later, throughout all stages of lens development. Beginning with day 12 postcoitum, Pitx3 mRNA has been also detected in the the midbrain region, tongue, incisor primordia, condensing mesenchyme around the sternum and vertebrae and in the head muscles (16Semina E.V. Ferrell R.E. Mintz H.H. Bitoun P. Alward W.L. Reiter R.S. Funkhauser C. Daack H.S. Murray J.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cig30 expression is confined to the brown fat, liver, and skin in adult mice, but EST clones AA241332 and AA062140 isolated from total fetuses of 12.5 and 19.5 days postcoitum, respectively, indicate that Cig30 is turned on already during embryonal development. Interestingly, these EST clones correspond to the long Cig30 mRNA species that overlaps with Pitx3. Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that both genes are temporarily and spatially co-expressed, which would imply that some Cig30 transcripts could interact with Pitx3 mRNA. Such an interaction, however, is unlikely to have any regulatory role, considering the small amount of transcripts involved. Nevertheless, the tight linkage between Cig30 and Pitx3 provides a new example of closely associated genes in vertebrates, and it will be of interest in evolutionary terms to investigate whether this presumably fortuitous gene association is conserved in other mammalian species.

We have cloned a 1.6-kilobase 5′-flanking region of the human EDA gene and used it to analyze features of transcriptional regulation. Primer extension analysis located a single transcription initiation site 264 base pairs (bp) upstream of the translation start site. When the intact cloned fragment or truncated derivatives were placed upstream of a reporter luciferase gene and transfected into a series of cultured cells, expression comparable with that conferred by an SV40 promoter-enhancer was observed. The region lacks a TATA box sequence, and basal transcription from the unique start site is dependent on two binding sites for the Sp1 transcription factor. One site lies 38 bp 5′ to the transcription start site, in a 71-bp sequence that is sufficient to support up to 35% of maximal transcription. The functional importance of the Sp1 sites was demonstrated when cotransfection of an Sp1 expression vector transactivated the EDA promoter in the SL2 Drosophila cell line that otherwise lacks endogenous Sp1. Also, both Sp1 binding sites were active in footprinting and gel shift assays in the presence of either crude HeLa cell nuclear extract or purified Sp1 and lost activity when the binding sites were mutated. A second region involved in positive control was localized to a 40-bp sequence between −673 and −633 bp. This region activated an SV40 minimal promoter 4- to 5-fold in an orientation-independent manner and is thus inferred to contain an enhancer region.

Because affected individuals have sparse hair, rudimentary teeth, and no sweat glands, and Tabby mice show similar defects, the gene is believed to function at an early stage in ectodermal development, possibly at a branch point. Some hints as to the function of the EDA protein have been gained by findings that it associates with the cell membrane and may participate in the regulation of cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions (3Bayes M.

Studies of EDA gene expression and protein function have been complicated by the fact that the EDA transcript undergoes alternative splicing and is capable of forming eight distinct isoforms, many of which can be detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a variety of tissues (3Bayes M.

In addition, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis of various human embryonic, fetal, and adult tissues have demonstrated that the EDA gene and protein are expressed at low levels in several tissues unaffected in EDA as well as in the ectodermal tissues that develop abnormally (2Kere J.

The minimal promoter region, including two Sp1 sites important for promoter function, has been defined. In addition, an enhancer region centered at 653 bp upstream of the transcription start site has been identified. The enhancer segment includes putative binding sites for two transcription factors known to regulate tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of certain cardiac genes. HeLa, 293, and HaCaT cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were done with 10 μg of reporter plasmids. The 293 and HeLa cell lines were transfected in subconfluent cultures by the calcium phosphate method. The HaCaT cell line was transfected using liposomes (DOTAP, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 7 μl of DOTAP per microgram of DNA. To normalize transfection efficiencies, a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (pSV-β-Gal plasmid, Promega) was cotransfected with the test plasmid in each experiment. Promoter activity was normalized to protein concentration and β-galactosidase activity.Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells were grown in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation.

The fragment was then blunt-end ligated into the Sma I site of the promoterless pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). Other constructs included: plasmid p-785, constructed by digestion of p2A5 with Acc I (position −768) and Sma I (position +258). The Acc I site was filled in as above, and the resulting fragment was cloned into the Sma I site of pGL2-Basic. p-338 was constructed by digestion of p-785 with Pst I (positions −321 and +168); the fragment was rendered blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and cloned into the Sma I site of pGL2-Basic. p-88 was created using PCR. The promoter fragment (nt −71 to nt +63) was amplified using the upstream primer 5′-TCCCCCGGGTGGAGGCCCGGCT-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-GAAGATCTCCCGCCGAGGGAAT, with Sma I and Bgl II sites (underlined), respectively, incorporated into the primers. The PCR product was then cloned between the Sma I and Bgl II sites of pGL2-Basic. p-53 was constructed by digestion of p-785 with Nar I (position −35) and Sma I (position +258), filled in with Klenow fragment, and cloned into the Sma I site of plasmid pGL2-Basic. p125(5′−3′), p103(5′−3′), p83(5′−3′), and p63(5′−3′) were constructed by PCR, using the primers listed below.

The same primer was used in sequencing reactions that were done with the 33P Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled cycle sequencing terminator kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All samples were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel in 1× TBE (0.1m Tris-HCl, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0), dried, and exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen. Gel shift assays were performed with radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides from the EDA gene, nt −52 to nt −22 (Box B1) and nt −197 to nt −167 (Box B2). The oligonucleotides were labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 293, HeLa, and HaCaT cells, and DNA binding assays were performed as described (13Majello B. Arcone R. Toniatti C. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In competition experiments, unlabeled competitor was included in the preincubation reaction with the nuclear extract. Oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequence and mutated sequence for Sp1 binding (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ and 5′-ATTCGATCGG TT CGGGGGAC-3′, respectively) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz). For antibody “supershift” experiments, 0.5 and 1μg of polyclonal antisera specific for Sp1 and AP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were added to the binding assay reactions and incubated on ice for 30 min before the radiolabeled oligonucleotides were added. Plasmid F1 (containing FragmentI) was constructed using PCR amplification of the EDA sequence from nt −102 to nt +63 with primers containing a Sma I site in the 5′-primer (5′-TCCCCCGGGGGCGAACCC-3′) and a Bgl II site in the 3′-primer (5′-GAAGATCTCCCGCCGAGGGAAT-3′). The amplified fragment was again inserted into the Sma I/Bgl II sites of pGL2-Basic. Plasmid F1 was cleaved with Bgl II restriction endonuclease, labeled by filling in ends with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and digested with Sma I. Plasmid p-785 (FragmentII), described above, was digested with Nar I, labeled by end-filling with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow DNA polymerase, and then digested with Pst I. Each labeled fragment was gel purified. Binding reactions were carried out using 30–50 μg of nuclear extract or 1–2 footprinting units of purified Sp1 fragment (Promega) and 30,000 cpm of probe. After DNase digestion, DNA fragments were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 8m urea. The sequences of the binding sites were confirmed by Maxam-Gilbert G + A sequencing reactions performed on each fragment. The primary findings are that, although the level of EDA mRNA in tissues is low (2Kere J. Srivastava A.K. Montonen O. Zonana J. Thomas N. Ferguson B. Munoz F. Morgan D. Clarke A. Baybayan P.

Because endogenous levels of the EDA transcript are extremely low (2Kere J. Srivastava A.K. Montonen O. Zonana J. Thomas N. Ferguson B. Munoz F. Morgan D. Clarke A. Baybayan P. Chen E., Y. Ezer S.

Cytochem. 1998; 46: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the studies here have been carried out with cells transiently transfected with EDA constructs to increase signal strength. Although EDA is very widely expressed, epithelial-derived cell lines have been used as they are likely to be more relevant for a gene involved in skin appendage formation. The transcription start site was determined by primer extension analysis carried out on RNA preparations from HeLa epithelial cells transfected with plasmid p-1625. This plasmid contains a 1.6-kilobase genomic fragment that includes 5′-upstream sequences and part of the known cDNA sequence and has been shown to direct high levels of transcription (see below). As shown in Fig.1, lane 2, a single transcription start site was observed at nucleotide 3453 (G) of the EDA genomic sequence. DNA sequencing has revealed that the EDA gene lacks basal elements like the TATA box or an initiator sequence. The absence of such sites and the presence of Sp1 sites, including one in the basal promoter (see below), might have been expected to result in initiation of transcription at several locations. However, a single initiation site was consistently detected in these assays and in RNase protection assays (data not shown). This analysis extends the 5′-end of the EDA transcript 47-bp further than the published cDNA sequence. To test for promoter activity, a genomic fragment of 1.6 kilobases, including 5′-upstream sequences and part of the known cDNA sequence, was placed 5′ to a luciferase reporter gene, and its capacity to direct luciferase synthesis in transfection experiments was compared with a series of deletion mutant constructs. Each truncated segment was cloned into the promoterless reporter plasmid pGL2-Basic and transfected into human epithelia-derived cell lines. Each of these cell lines (HeLa, 293, and HaCat) have been shown to exhibit low levels of endogenous EDA gene expression, as detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR, similar to levels found in other cell types and tissues (2Kere J. Srivastava A.K. Montonen O. Zonana J. Thomas N. Ferguson B. Munoz F. Morgan D. Clarke A. Baybayan P. Chen E., Y. Ezer S. Saarialho-Kere U. de la Chapelle A. Schlessinger D. Nat.

Cells were transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and after 48 h, cell extracts were prepared and luciferase activity was measured (Fig.2). This index of promoter strength was normalized to the activity of a cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter gene under SV40 promoter control. Promoter constructs retaining 1.6 kilobases to 35 bp of DNA upstream of the transcription initiation site varied in potency by more than 90%. Promoter activity as strong as an SV40 control promoter-enhancer (Fig.2) was maintained in constructs deleted up to −767 bp. Removal of the region between −767 and −321 bp, however, decreased promoter activity in HeLa cells and HaCaT cells by 50%, and in 293 cells by 40%. A further drop of the remaining activity was obtained after removing sequence extending from −321 to −71 bp (by 50% in HeLa and in HaCaT, and by 40% in 293 cells). As is often seen in transient expression assays of promoter activity, each of the promoter constructs exhibits a rather higher level of activity in one cell type rather than another (here, 293 cells compared with HeLa or HaCat cells). However, in all cell types, the subfragment of 71 bp immediately proximal to the transcription start site provides enough DNA sequence for basal transcription of the human EDA gene. It contains a single Sp1 site. In contrast, constructs further shortened to include only 35 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, which eliminates the last Sp1 site, show no activity over the background from the promoterless luciferase vector pGL2 in HeLa and HaCaT cells. (The −35-bp construct transfected into 293 cells retained activity about 10% higher than the promoterless pGL2, probably because of a higher transfection efficiency.) Because the Sp1 binding sites (“GC boxes”) bind transcription factor Sp1 and other members of the Sp1 multigene family (14Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), these results provide an indication that Sp1 or similar proteins may be important in the regulation of EDA expression. Based on the transfection experiments of deletion mutant constructs (Fig. 2), the region between +63 and −321 bp was chosen for further analysis. DNase I footprinting analysis was used to map binding sites of nuclear factors, using nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells. Similar results were obtained from the HaCaT and 293 cell lines (data not shown). Each of two fragments of the promoter was 5′-end-labeled to generate a single-strand-labeled fragment for the assays. Fragment I (−102 to +63 bp) showed one protected region (−45 to −31 bp; Fig. 3, lane 2), containing a canonical GC box (Box B1), i.e. a putative binding site for Sp1. It seemed likely that Sp1 might indeed bind to this region because it functions as an essential factor for several viral and cellular promoters (15Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 16Courey A.J. Tjian R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To establish whether this GC box is protected by Sp1, DNase I footprinting analysis was carried out with purified Sp1 protein. As shown in Fig. 3, lane 3, recombinant Sp1 protected the same GC-rich sequence noted in the experiment with HeLa cell nuclear extract, suggesting that Box B1 of the EDA promoter region can specifically interact with the transcription factor Sp1. In repeated comparable experiments using the second probe (-37 to −321 bp), a second potential binding site for Sp1 was detected between nt −177 and nt −189 (Box B2). However, a higher background was observed, possibly because of nonspecific binding, which resulted in a significantly weaker signal (data not shown). Stronger evidence that Box B2 also specifically interacts with Sp1 was derived from further experiments using gel shift assays and transactivation studies with an Sp1 expression vector (see below). To characterize further the functionality of the Sp1 sites, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We used 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides from positions −52 to −22 bp (Box B1) and −197 to −167 bp (Box B2). Incubation of the Box B1 probe with the HeLa nuclear extract resulted in the formation of three complexes (complex I, complex II, and a less consistently observed very weak complex III (Fig.4 A, lane 1)). Similar binding patterns were observed for the Sp1 binding sites in comparable assays with crude nuclear extract (14Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Complexes I and II were competed away by unlabeled oligonucleotide, verifying the specificity of the binding to DNA. The third complex was constitutively expressed and was not competed away by unlabeled probe; it is inferred to be a nonspecific binding site. To establish that binding was specific for Sp1, increasing amounts of an antibody to Sp1 were added to the binding reaction, resulting in a “supershift” (a shift to lower mobility) of Complex I (Fig.4 B, lanes 2 and 3). The inability of Sp1 to supershift the complex fully may be because of the comigration of a complex with another member of the Sp1-family, e.g. Sp3 (14Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 20Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes and Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). A control antibody to the transcription factor AP-2, which is expressed in HeLa cells and can also bind some GC-rich sequences (20Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes and Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), had no effect on the mobility of the bound complex (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 5). To substantiate further that Sp1 bound to Box B1, competition experiments were performed in which unlabeled Box B1 oligonucleotides and double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus Sp1 binding site or containing mutated Sp1 consensus sequence were added to the reactions and gel mobility shifts were again assessed. Complexes I and II were both competed for in a dose-dependent manner by Box B1 and Sp1 consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2–5) but not by increasing amounts of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a mutated Sp1 binding site (Fig.4 C, lanes 6–9). Similar results were obtained using as a probe the putative Box B2 Sp1 site (Fig.5). As shown in Fig. 5 A, lane 1, two other minor nonspecific complexes were also observed. Taken together, the results further demonstrate directly that Sp1 binds to both the Box B1 and Box B2 GC sequences. As another confirmation of Sp1 function, we tested the extent of its transactivation of the EDA promoter in the SL2 cell line. D. melanogaster Schneider cell line SL2 is known to be devoid of endogenous Sp1-like activity and thus serves as a useful cell line to test Sp1 effects in vivo (16Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 17Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). When reporter plasmids p-1625 and p-88, which contain two and one Sp1 binding sites, respectively, were cotransfected with increasing amounts of the eukaryotic expression vector pPAC-Sp1 (16Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), we observed a strong enhancement of transcription compared with the reporter vector pGL2-Basic (Fig. 6). Note that higher levels of added pPAC-Sp1 resulted in some decrease of transcription activity, perhaps because Sp1 cofactors were squelched; but the results confirm the ability of co-expressed Sp1 to induce expression from the EDA promoter, further supporting the functionality of the Sp1 sites. To assess the importance of each Sp1 site for EDA gene expression, we assayed the effects of point mutations in each of them. Reporter constructs were created that differed by 2 bp from the wild type promoter (−548 to +63 bp; see “Experimental Procedures”) and were assayed for luciferase activity in HeLa cells. The promoter activity from the mutant constructs pmBox1 and pmBox2 was decreased to 40 and 10% of the wild type promoter, respectively (Fig. 7). These results suggest that Box B2 may be functionally more important than Box B1; however, both sites were required for maximal promoter activity. Another positive regulatory sequence extending from −673 to −550 bp was detected using constructs with this fragment cloned in both orientations into the pGL2-Promoter vector. This vector contains an SV40 minimal promoter that drives the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. When constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, the EDA promoter fragment induced the production of luciferase by 4- to 5-fold compared with the level observed for the vector alone. Consistent with the notion that this DNA segment contains an enhancer binding site, the activity of the cloned region was very similar in both cloned orientations (Fig.8 A). To define the core region that still gave enhancer activity, smaller fragments of the region were tested by repeated transfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 8 A, enhancer activity was slightly reduced when the region between −673 and −653 bp was removed and completely abolished when the fragment was truncated further to −633 bp upstream of the transcription start site. From these results, we concluded that"

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). MHC class II molecules present antigenic peptides to CD4-positive T cells, and these peptides are usually derived from antigens that are internalized and processed in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (2Unanue E.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 395-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 3Wolf P.R. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 267-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Directly after translation and insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the αβ molecules associate with a third molecule, the invariant chain (Ii). Ii is known to trimerize, and three αβ dimers associate with these trimers to form a nonameric complex (4Roche P.A. Marks M.S. Cresswell P.

The major form of Ii consists of a 33-kDa form (6Jones P.P. Murphy D.B. Hewgill D. McDevitt H.O. Mol. Immunol. 1979; 16: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); an additional form of Ii, IiP41, arises through alternative splicing and contains an additional exon encoding 64 amino acid residues at the C-terminal end of the molecule (7Strubin M. Berte C. Mach B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3483-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Koch N. Lauer W. Habicht J. Dobberstein B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1677-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, in human cells, an alternative initiation site upstream gives rise to a 35- and a 43-kDa form, which are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum due to the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (9Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). These multiple forms of Ii are usually co-expressed within the same cell and associate with MHC class II molecules (1Pieters J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The invariant chain is known to regulate the range of peptides that can be presented by MHC class II molecules in various ways. First, it assists in the folding and export of MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (10Anderson M.S. Miller J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2282-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Second, Ii provides a targeting signal for endosomal/lysosomal compartments (9Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T.

This targeting signal directs MHC class II/Ii complexes to so-called MHC class II compartments, specialized organelles of the endosomal/lysosomal pathway that are present in antigen-presenting cells (13Pieters J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 751-758PubMed Google Scholar). In these organelles, the associated Ii is degraded from its lumenal, C-terminal side, thus liberating the peptide binding site in the class II complex (17Pieters J. Horstmann H. Bakke O. Griffiths G. Lipp J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Dobberstein B. Ploegh H.L. Pieters J. Nature. 1994; 369: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Degradation of Ii is most probably carried out by endosomal cathepsins (14Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungercic G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and results in the generation of several Ii fragments. These fragments retain the cytoplasmic, N-terminal portion, but lack different segments of the lumenal, C-terminal domain (16Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After Ii degradation, antigenic peptides can be loaded onto the class II dimer, a process that may be assisted by the recently described HLA-DM molecules (18Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 19Denzin L.K. Cresswell P.

From the MHC class II compartments, peptide loaded class II dimers are transported to the plasma membrane for triggering T cell receptors of CD4+ T cells (20Ferrari G. Knight A.M. Watts C. Pieters J.

As MHC class II molecules present peptides derived from antigens that are usually internalized into the endocytic pathway of antigen-presenting cells, they should be prevented from binding peptides at early stages after biosynthesis. Indeed, a third function of Ii is to prevent peptide association with class II molecules. This function is carried out by the C-terminal, lumenal portion of Ii, precisely that part that is degraded upon arrival in endocytic structures prior to peptide loading (1Pieters J. Curr. Opin.

Dickson P.W. Lotteau V. Sette A. Fink P. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The region that is responsible for preventing peptide association with MHC class II molecules has been mapped to the membrane-proximal domain of the invariant chain (26Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Koch N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9703-9706Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27Bijlmakers M.J. Benaroch P. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp.

These fragments are termed CLIPs (for class II-associated invariant chain peptides). Although a core fragment including methionines 99 and 104 has been shown to bind class II dimers in a manner similar to antigenic peptides (29Ghosh P. Amaya M. Mellins E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1995; 378: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the precise Ii fragments binding to class II molecules vary considerably and depend partially on the class II haplotype (30Chicz R.M. Urban R.G. Lane W.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Vignali D.A.A. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 31Malcherek G. Gnau V. Jung G. Rammensee H.-G. Melms A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to the Ii fragments generated at endosomal sites, in both human and murine cell types, other Ii proteolytic fragments have been observed (25Teyton L. O'Sullivan D. Dickson P.W. Lotteau V. Sette A. Fink P. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 32Mehringer J.H. Harris M.R. Kindle C.S. McCourt D.W. Cullen S.E. J.

Presently, it is unknown where in the cell these fragments are generated and what the physiological relevance is of the generation and presence of these fragments. In this paper, we describe the expression, intracellular transport, location, as well as the biological activity of an invariant chain fragment, IiP25, that was associated with MHC class II molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum of human melanoma cells. IiP25 included part of the CLIP region but lacked the Ii N-terminal domain responsible for targeting to endocytic organelles. In accordance with such a sequence, IiP25 was not targeted to endocytic compartments but was secreted into the culture medium. Furthermore, IiP25 was biologically active, in that its presence inhibited T cell activation by MHC class II molecules. We propose that the secretion of a lumenal Ii fragment extracellularly may contribute to the regulation of class II-restricted T cell responses by competing with antigenic peptides for MHC class II molecules. The human melanoma cell line Mel JuSo (34Johnson J.P. Demmer-Dieckmann M. Meo T. Hadam M.R. Riethmuller G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Chinese hamster ovary cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal antibody L243, a kind gift from Dr. T. Johnson; anti-MHC class II rabbit antiserum, a kind gift of Dr. H. L. Ploegh; anti-Ii rabbit antiserum MDDQ, raised against the N-terminal fragment of Ii and monoclonal antibodies Bu43 and Bu45, recognizing the Ii C-terminal domain, a kind gift from Dr. I. McLennon. The clonal tissue culture insect cell line Sf9 (derived from Spodoptera frugiparda cells), Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), and the derived BaculoGold™ viral DNA were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The high expressing cell line High Five (derived from Trichoplusia ni egg cell homogenates) were obtained from Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherlands). The H-2d- and H-2s-expressing B cell hybridoma LS102.9 and the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent cell line CTLL-2 were obtained from ATCC. The 89–101 myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell hybridoma 12.3 was a kind gift from Dr. D. Wraith (Cambridge, United Kingdom). B and T cell hybridomas were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. cDNA encoding IiP25 was constructed by cloning the signal sequence of hemagglutinin from fowl plaque virus (strain A/fowl plaque virus/Rostock/34(H7N1 (35Kretzschmar E. Veit M. Brunschön S. Kuroda K. Klenk H.-D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar)) in front of methionine 99 of Ii. Briefly, cDNA encoding amino acid 1–18 of fowl plaque virus-hemagglutinin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using 5′-gcgaattcgatacaaaatgaac-3′ and 5′-aacgcatgccatttgtgggaatgac-3′ as primers and recombinant AcMHPV virus encoding fowl plaque virus-hemagglutinin (kindly provided by Dr. H.-D. Klenk) as a template. These primers introduced an Eco RI site 5′ and a SpHI site 3′ of the coding region. cDNA encoding the N-terminal region of IiP25 was amplified using 5′-cgcgcatgcaggcgctg-3′ and 5′-ggtgttcttaaggtgtc-3′ as primers and Ii in pGem-3 (Promega) as a template, introducing an SpHI and an Afl II site 5′ and 3′ of the IiP25 N-terminal region, respectively. These two amplified fragments were then ligated into IipGEM-3 that had been digested with Eco RI and Afl II, to result in the plasmid IiP25pGEM. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNAs were analyzed by dideoxy sequencing according to Sanger et al. (36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52418) Google Scholar). To construct a eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding IiP25, IipGEM-3 was digested with Eco RI and Bam HI and ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCB6 (kindly donated by Dr. Peter van der Sluijs) that had been digested with the same enzymes. For the generation of recombinant AcNPV, an Eco RI-Bam HI fragment from IiP25pGEM was cloned into the vector pVL1392 digested with the same enzymes. Recombinant virus was generated by cotransfecting the IiP25pVL1392 DNA with BaculoGoldTM DNA (Pharmingen) in SF9 cells as described by the manufacturer. High titer virus was obtained by amplification in SF9 cells. IiP25 protein was obtained by inoculating High Five cells with recombinant virus. IiP25 produced from High Five cells after inoculation with recombinant AcNPV was purified on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or using an Affi-Gel 15 column (Bio-Rad) coupled with the anti-Ii antibody Bu45. Cells were pulse-labeled with 0.15 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min, with or without a chase in normal medium containing 5 mm methionine and 5 mm cysteine. Cells were lysed, and molecules were immunoprecipitated as described before (17Pieters J. Horstmann H. Bakke O. Griffiths G. Lipp J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For sequential immunoprecipitation, immunoadsorbed complexes were denatured by boiling the protein A-Sepharose beads in 0.5% SDS and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 7 min. The sample was diluted 10-fold in lysis buffer and reimmunoprecipitated as described. Immunoprecipitation from the medium was performed after addition of protease inhibitors and concentration of the medium through a Centricon-10 device (Amicon). The media were adjusted to 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and immunoprecipitation was carried out as described. For analysis of sialic acid content, antigens immobilized on protein A-Sepharose were incubated with or without 10 milliunits of neuraminidase in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 9 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl containing protease inhibitors for 12 h at 37 °C. Antigens were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads, denatured, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206281) Google Scholar) and fluorography. Monolayers of Mel JuSo cells were grown to subconfluency in tissue culture dishes. After metabolic labeling, the cells were scraped in homogenization buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.4), and a membrane fraction was prepared (20Ferrari G. Knight A.M. Watts C. Pieters J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Dobberstein B. Ploegh H.L. Pieters J. Nature. 1994; 369: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Organelle electrophoresis was carried out essentially as described (22Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Dobberstein B. Ploegh H.L. Pieters J. Nature. 1994; 369: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 38Engering A. Lefkovits I. Pieters J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2523-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 6% Ficoll-70 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), layered in between a linear Ficoll gradient (0–10%), and electrophoresed for 90 min at 10.4 mA. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and assayed for the different organelle markers (see below). Immunoprecipitation of antigens from the different fractions was carried out after adjusting the fractions to 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors as described (20Ferrari G. Knight A.M. Watts C. Pieters J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Ferrari G. Naito M. Langen H. Pieters J. Cell. 1999; 97: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). For protein sequencing, immobilized proteins after SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and the IiP25-containing membrane was subjected to automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer, model 473A. The amount of 35S eluted in each fraction was determined for each sequenator cycle by liquid scintillation methods. Supernatants from infected High Five cells were adjusted to a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.7. Aliquots of 100 ml were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the bifunctional chemical cross-linker BS3 (Pierce) at the concentrations indicated. Excess cross-linker was quenched with 100 mmglycine, pH 8.5, for 30 min. Total proteins were precipitated with acetone, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The presence of IiP25 was determined using anti-Ii antibodies. Presentation of the 89–101 MBP peptide was assayed as follows. The H-2d- and H-2s-expressing B cell hybridoma LS102.9 (a fusion of B10.S (7R) spleen cells and the Balb/c lymphoma A20.2J (ATCC)) was used as a source of APC at 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. The MBP peptide 89–101 (0.2 mg/ml) was added simultaneously with the 89–101 MBP-specific T cell hybridoma 12.3 (kindly provided by Dr. D. Wraith, Cambridge, United Kingdom) in the presence or absence of IiP25. Fixation of APC was at room temperature using 1% paraformaldehyde. After 16 h at 37 °C, production of IL-2 in the supernatant was determined using the IL-2-dependent cell line CTLL-2 (ATCC) and the MTS/PMS reagent (Promega). Presentation of peptides derived from intact MBP was analyzed by adding whole MBP (Sigma) at 3 μg/ml to 5 × 105 SJL/J irradiated spleen APCs and 5 × 104 cells/well of the T cell hybridoma 6F11 2E. E. Eynon, unpublished data. in the presence of IiP25 or bovine serum albumin. T cell activation was determined as described above. Results are expressed as the A490. Cells were grown on glass coverslips and incubated on ice with the proteins and antibodies indicated. Subsequently, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, mounted in FluoroGuard Antifade mounting reagent (Bio-Rad), and analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope system (MRC-1024, equipped with 522/32 nm and 605/32 nm band pass filter for FITC and Texas Red, respectively; Bio-Rad) attached to an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) as described (12Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ferrari G. Naito M. Langen H. Pieters J. Cell. 1999; 97: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Images were collected using the 488 nm (FITC) and 568 nm (Texas Red) lines of an Argon/Krypton laser, with pinhole settings at 2.0 and 2.5 for FITC and Texas Red, respectively. The human melanoma cell line Mel JuSo expresses MHC class II molecules, as well as all known Ii isoforms, and is a suitable model cell line for studying the biology of MHC class II-restricted antigen processing and presentation (20Ferrari G. Knight A.M. Watts C. Pieters J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Dobberstein B. Ploegh H.L. Pieters J. Nature. 1994; 369: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). When Mel JuSo cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, several polypeptides co-immunoprecipitated with MHC class II molecules (Fig. 1, anti-MHC class II). In addition to the MHC class II α and β chains, the 33-kDa form of Ii was present, as was a protein with a molecular mass of 25 kDa. To analyze the origin of this 25-kDa protein, the anti-class II immunocomplexes were denatured, diluted in lysis buffer, and reprecipitated using antibodies against either the Ii N-terminal or the Ii C-terminal region. The 25-kDa protein could only be recovered using the anti-IiC terminal antibodies (Fig. 1, anti-IiC), and not the anti-Ii N-terminal antibodies (Fig. 1, anti-IiN). The immunoreactivity of P25 with the anti-Ii antibodies and the difference in molecular mass between Ii and P25 indicates that P25 represents a form of Ii (IiP25) that lacks the N-terminal cytoplasmic region. In Mel JuSo cells, as in other class II/Ii-positive antigen-presenting cells, various Ii fragments are generated at late stages of biosynthesis, following transport of class II/Ii complexes to post-Golgi endocytic organelles (16Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3975-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 17Pieters J. Horstmann H. Bakke O. Griffiths G. Lipp J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast to IiP25, these fragments represent N-terminal segments that lack different portions of the lumenal, C-terminal region (17Pieters J. Horstmann H. Bakke O. Griffiths G. Lipp J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To analyze the organelles in which IiP25 resided, subcellular fractionation by organelle electrophoresis was performed. During such electrophoresis, endosomal and lysosomal organelles shift toward the anode, whereas most other subcellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum, remain unshifted (Fig.2 a and Refs. 22Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Dobberstein B. Ploegh H.L. Pieters J. Nature. 1994; 369: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar and 38Engering A. Lefkovits I. Pieters J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2523-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To reveal the presence of IiP25, cells were metabolically labeled and homogenized, and the membrane fraction was subjected to organelle electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After fractionation, Ii-related molecules were immunoprecipitated from the different fractions and separated by SDS-PAGE. As can be seen in Fig.2, endosomal and lysosomal organelles were well separated from the endoplasmic reticulum, as analyzed by the presence of β-hexosaminidase reactivity and the presence of radiolabeled molecules after a 4-min pulse, respectively (Fig. 2 a). IiP25 cofractionated with endoplasmic reticulum-containing fractions and was absent from fractions containing endosomal/lysosomal markers (Fig.2 b). The fact that IiP25 was found to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum raised the possibility that it originated from signal peptidase cleavage. Indeed, the invariant chain has been shown to contain a potentially cleavable signal sequence in its membrane-spanning domain (40Lipp J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1103-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cleavage by signal peptidase results in an Ii form that lacks the first 42 amino acid residues (from the 33-kDa form) and starts at position 43 with leucine (40Lipp J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1103-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To determine whether the IiP25 described here results from signal peptidase cleavage during translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, the N terminus of IiP25 was determined. Ii immune complexes from [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. IiP25 immobilized on the membrane was subjected to automated Edman degradation, and amino acid-containing fractions were analyzed for their 35S content, indicative of the presence of methionine and/or cysteine. Radioactivity was eluted after 1, 6, 14, and 23 cycles (Fig. 3). Elution of methionine at these positions is predicted by an IiP25 protein starting at position 99 (see Fig. 3) and in agreement with the observed apparent molecular weight after SDS-PAGE. Thus, IiP25 represents a form of Ii lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and therefore did not result from signal peptidase cleavage. In addition, IiP25 includes the CLIP region that is responsible for binding to MHC class II molecules (26Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Koch N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9703-9706Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One important function of Ii is to target the MHC class II complex to endocytic organelles (1Pieters J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 3Wolf P.R. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 267-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The targeting sequences responsible for endosomal location reside in the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (9Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 11Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar,12Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of this N-terminal domain in IiP25 might thus result in transport of IiP25 through the secretory pathway, rather then being targeted to and retained in endocytic compartments. In addition, the absence of the membrane anchoring domain would result in IiP25 being secreted. To follow the transport and possible secretion of newly synthesized IiP25 molecules, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased in the absence of radiolabel for the times indicated in Fig.4. At the different chase times, the medium was collected, and anti-Ii immunoreactive proteins were precipitated from the media. After 2 and 4 h of chase, a protein of ∼27 kDa was present in the culture medium (Fig. 4). This increase in molecular mass might have resulted from glycosylation during transit through the Golgi compartments; indeed, incubation of the immunoprecipitates with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid residues reduced the apparent molecular mass to 25 kDa (Fig. 4, NANAse). We conclude that IiP25 is transported via the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex to the plasma membrane and secreted into the culture medium. The lumenal domain of Ii is responsible for blocking peptide assembly to MHC class II molecules, and methionine 99 and 104 (which are part of the CLIP sequence) serve as anchor residues that allow this fragment to bind efficiently to MHC class II molecules (26Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Koch N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9703-9706Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31Malcherek G. Gnau V. Jung G. Rammensee H.-G. Melms A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 41Gautam A.M. Pearson C. Quinn V. McDevitt H. Milburn P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The fact that IiP25 represents the Ii lumenal domain, including these anchor methionines, together with its secretion in the culture medium, prompted us to investigate the possibility that class II-restricted antigen presentation could be modulated by the presence of IiP25. As a source of IiP25, a recombinant form of IiP25 was generated by fusing the coding sequence for IiP25 (amino acid residues 99–216) to the signal sequence of the hemagglutinin molecule of fowl plaque virus (see under “Experimental Procedures”) (35Kretzschmar E. Veit M. Brunschön S. Kuroda K. Klenk H.-D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). When Chinese hamster ovary cells were stably transfected with this construct, IiP25 could readily be detected in the culture medium of metabolically labeled and chased cells, indicating transport through the secretory pathway (data not shown). In addition, recombinant baculovirus producing IiP25 protein was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the supernatant from infected insect cells was analyzed for the presence of IiP25. Ii is known to form trimers upon proper folding, and the domain responsible for trimerization is located within amino acid residues 163–183 (42Bertolino P. Staschewski M. Trescol Biemont M.C. Freisewinkel I.M. Schenck K. Chretien I. Forquet F. Gerlier D. Rabourdin Combe C. Koch N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5620-5629PubMed Google Scholar, 43Park S.J. Sadegh Nasseri S. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11289-11293Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As this region is present in IiP25, the ability of IiP25 expressed in insect cells to trimerize was analyzed. Following the addition of the chemical cross-linking reagent BS3, IiP25 monomers, dimers, and trimers were detected after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig.5), indicating its proper folding and transport through the secretory pathway in insect cells (44Marks M.S. Blum J.S. Cresswell P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 839-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of IiP25 on antigen presentation, we made use of splenic antigen-presenting cells that can internalize and process myelin basic protein and are able to present the 89–101 peptide from MBP in the context of MHC class II molecules to a T cell hybridoma (see under “Experimental Procedures”). When irradiated spleen cells were incubated with whole MBP, T cell activation could be readily measured via IL-2 production (see Fig.6 a). Addition of increasing amounts of IiP25, but not bovine serum albumin, resulted in up to ∼80% inhibition of IL-2 production, indicating that IiP25 can compete with peptides for MHC class II molecules (Fig. 6, a and b). To investigate whether IiP25 acted at the cell surface or an intracellular site, viable (Fig. 6 c) or fixed (Fig. 6 d) antigen-presenting cells were incubated with the 89–101 MBP peptide, and the effect of IiP25 on the ability to trigger a T cell hybridoma was analyzed. In the case of both nonfixed and fixed antigen-presenting cells, T cell activation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by IiP25, up to a maximum inhibition of 85–90% (Fig. 6). Immunodepletion of IiP25 abolished the inhibition of T cell activation. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of IiP25 most probably reflects its ability to compete with antigenic peptides for MHC class II molecules at the surface of antigen-presenting cells. Binding of IiP25 to the cell surface was analyzed directly by incubating living cells on ice with purified IiP25, followed by an incubation with anti-IiC antibodies. As shown in Fig.7, a and b, IiP25 can be readily detected at the cell surface. To analyze whether binding of IiP25 to the cell surface occurred via the CLIP sequence that is present in IiP25, binding of IiP25 to living cells was performed in the presence of synthetic CLIP peptide (amino acid residues 81–104). Inclusion of CLIP blocked IiP25 binding to the cell surface, indicating that IiP25 binds to cell surface MHC class II molecules via its CLIP sequence (Fig. 7, c and d). The MHC class II-associated invariant chain acts as an important regulator of antigen processing and presentation (1Pieters J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 45Teyton L. Peterson P.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Besides functioning as a chaperone in the folding of class II molecules early during biosynthesis, Ii directs the class II complex to MHC class II compartments in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (3Wolf P.R. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 267-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, Ii prevents the binding of antigenic fragments to MHC class II molecules prior to their deposition in the peptide loading compartment (20Ferrari G. Knight A.M. Watts C. Pieters J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the transport and extracellular secretion of a lumenal invariant chain form, IiP25, and present evidence that IiP25 can function as a modulator for MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation. A 25-kDa form of Ii has been detected in several human and mouse cell types (9Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 25Teyton L. O'Sullivan D. Dickson P.W. Lotteau V. Sette A. Fink P. Peterson P.A.

In which cellular compartment this form is generated is not clear. Although in some cases, the 25-kDa Ii form might be generated in the endoplasmic reticulum from the full-length 33-kDa Ii form (25Teyton L. O'Sullivan D. Dickson P.W. Lotteau V. Sette A. Fink P. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 32Mehringer J.H. Harris M.R. Kindle C.S. McCourt D.W. Cullen S.E. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 920-927PubMed Google Scholar), in other cells, IiP25 was found to be generated at the site of peptide loading (33Demotz S. Danieli C. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 46Thomas L.J. Nguyen Q.V. Elliott W.L. Humphreys R.E. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2670-2674PubMed Google Scholar). The IiP25 form, as detected here, was generated in the endoplasmic reticulum and readily transported through the early secretory pathway in association with MHC class II molecules in a manner similar to wild type Ii. The protease responsible for generation of IiP25 is currently unknown. The membrane spanning segment of Ii does contain a potential signal peptidase cleavage site residing in the middle of the membrane spanning region (40Lipp J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1103-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The N terminus of IiP25 was found to be represented by methionine 99, which is located behind the membrane spanning region at the lumenal side, but we cannot exclude the possibility that signal peptidase cleavage generates a partially N-terminal truncated Ii form. Such a partially truncated form might then be fully translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum and further acted upon by different proteolytic activities. The cotranslational assembly of Ii isoforms within the class II complex might prevent further cleavage of IiP25 due to inaccessibility of the Ii lumenal domain to protease activity. The precise oligomeric state of the Ii isoforms within the MHC class II complex is not known. One possibility is that in IiP25-expressing cells, mixed trimers containing IiP25 assemble with MHC class II molecules. As it has been reported that efficient targeting of Ii molecules from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes requires multimerization of the N-terminal cytoplasmic targeting sequence (47Arneson L.S. Miller J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), IiP25 containing trimers may be predominantly transported to the plasma membrane, rather then being targeted to the endocytic pathway. Following release of IiP25, these Ii/class II complexes may then become internalized from the plasma membrane by virtue of the internalization sequence present in the cytoplasmic tail of Ii (12Pieters J. Bakke O. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 831-846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Arneson L.S. Miller J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 48Warmerdam P.A. Long E.O. Roche P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Following transport of IiP25 through the biosynthetic pathway, IiP25 was secreted in the culture medium. Sequence analysis revealed that IiP25 contained methionine 99 of Ii at its N terminus, and it thus includes part of the sequence that has been implicated both in association with class II molecules and in preventing antigenic peptides from binding to class II molecules (1Pieters J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 5Cresswell P. Cell. 1996; 84: 505-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Both of these properties were retained in IiP25: first, IiP25 was associated with MHC class II molecules, and second, when added exogenously to cells presenting peptides in the context of class II, IiP25 inhibited T cell activation, indicating that IiP25 competes with peptides for MHC class II molecules. Inhibition of T cell activation by secreted IiP25 occurred directly at the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells through the binding of IiP25 via its CLIP sequence. In cells secreting IiP25, inhibition of peptide presentation to T cells by IiP25 may locally influence the type of T cell response that is generated. This effect may be important in those cases in which the peptide/MHC class II concentration at the cell surface is around the threshold required for T cell activation (49Valitutti S. Lanzavecchia A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); the presence or absence of IiP25 may dictate in that case whether or not a T cell response will be generated. Interestingly, the Mel JuSo cells used here are derived from melanoma cells, some of which have been reported to be deficient in antigen presentation (50Alexander M.A. Bennicelli J. Guerry D. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4070-4078PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the production of IiP25 may be one of the ways by which tumor cells can evade immune recognition in vivo. The MHC class II-associated invariant chain has been shown to perform a variety of different functions at various stages of the intracellular pathway of MHC class II molecules. The inhibitory effect of a secreted form of Ii as described here represents a novel mode of regulation exerted by Ii and may contribute to the type of T cell responses that are induced by MHC class II-peptide complexes.
