https://openalex.org/W2042511952,"A cDNA coding for the human interferon alpha receptor has been cloned using a gene transfer approach. This consists of transferring human DNA to mouse cells and selecting for cells sensitive to human interferon alpha. The transfected cells expressed the human interferon alpha receptor, and a 5 kb human DNA was isolated from a secondary transfectant. This DNA defects an mRNA present in human cells and was used to clone a 2.7 kb cDNA from a library constructed from human Daudi cells. The sequence of the cDNA is presented. It codes for a glycoprotein of 557 amino acids with an N-terminal hydrophobic region and a single transmembrane-spanning segment. Mouse cells expressing the cDNA become sensitive to the antiviral activity of and express binding sites for human interferon alpha, demonstrating that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional human interferon alpha receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2008415333,"The ATPase activity of SecA is stimulated by E. coli plasma membrane vesicles bearing SecY protein and a precursor protein such as proOmpA. This activity is termed ""translocation ATPase"". Liposomes alone can also stimulate SecA ATPase, but membrane proteins block this stimulation in native inner membranes. We define the stimulation of SecA ATPase by lipid as ""SecA/lipid ATPase"". SecA/lipid ATPase, translocation ATPase, and translocation into inner membrane vesicles require acidic phospholipids, suggesting an underlying unity of mechanism. ProOmpA and ATP stabilize liposome-bound SecA. Full SecA/lipid ATPase activity and stability are also seen when a mixture of a leader peptide and either OmpA or maltose binding protein (MBP) are added instead of proOmpA, while neither the leader peptide alone nor OmpA or MBP suffice. Cytosolic proteins in conjuction with a leader peptide are less active in this reaction, indicating that liposome-bound SecA protein recognizes both leader and mature domains."
https://openalex.org/W1607578883,"Two proteins which specifically bind tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were isolated from human urine by ligand (TNF)-affinity purification, followed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weights of the two proteins, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were similar (about 30,000). Both proteins provided protection against the cytocidal effect of TNF in vitro and both bound TNF-alpha more effectively than TNF-beta. Antibodies raised against each of the proteins had an inhibitory effect on the binding of TNF to cells, suggesting that both proteins are structurally related to the TNF receptors. However, the two proteins differed in NH2-terminal amino acid sequences: Asp-Ser-Val-Cys-Pro- in one and Val-Ala-Phe-Thr-Pro- in the other. The NH2-terminal sequence of the former protein was invariable, while that of the latter was truncated to varying degrees. The two proteins were also immunologically distinct. The relative efficacy of anti-sera against the two proteins in inhibiting the binding of TNF to cells varied markedly from one line of cells to another. Evidence has been presented recently for the existence of two distinct molecular species of cell surface receptors for TNF and for differential expression of those two receptors by cells of different lines. The findings presented in this study are consistent with the notion that the urinary TNF-binding proteins constitute soluble forms of the two molecular species of the cell surface TNF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1605277785,"Functional cDNA clones for rat neuromedin K receptor were isolated from a rat brain cDNA library by cross-hybridization with the bovine substance K receptor cDNA. Injection of the mRNA synthesized in vitro from the cloned cDNA into Xenopus oocytes elicited electrophysiological responses to tachykinins, with the most potent sensitivity being to neuromedin K. Ligand-binding displacement in membranes of mammalian COS cells transfected with the cDNA indicated the rank order of affinity of the receptor to tachykinins: neuromedin K greater than substance K greater than substance P. The hybridization analysis showed that the neuromedin K receptor mRNA is expressed in both the brain and the peripheral tissues at different levels. The rat neuromedin K receptor consists of 452 amino acid residues and belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, which are though to have seven transmembrane domains. The sequence comparison of the rat neuromedin K, substance P, and substance K receptors revealed that these receptors are highly conserved in the seven transmembrane domains and the cytoplasmic sides of the receptors. They also show some structural characteristics, including the common presence of histidine residues in transmembrane segments V and VI and the difference in the numbers and distributions of serine and threonine residues as possible phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic regions. This paper thus presents the first comprehensive analysis of the molecular nature of the multiple peptide receptors that exhibit similar but pharmacologically distinguishable activities."
https://openalex.org/W1568828918,"Purified alpha 2 beta 1 integrin from human platelets was compared in its function and immunoreactivity to alpha 2 beta 1 from endothelial cells. Both alpha 2 beta 1 integrins bound to type I collagen-Sepharose and had indistinguishable immunoreactivities when analyzed by a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal alpha 2-specific antibodies. However, functional analysis using rechromatography of purified receptors on laminin and collagen-Sepharose showed that endothelial alpha 2 beta 1 was able to bind to laminin, whereas its counterpart from platelets did not. Moreover, a receptor binding assay indicated that, in contrast to platelets, endothelial cells might also use alpha 2 beta 1 to bind to fibronectin. These results suggest that the alpha 2 beta 1 binding specificity may be modulated by cell-type specific factors."
https://openalex.org/W2139462257,"Highly purified chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) is shown to stimulate RNA synthesis directly in an in vitro transcription assay. Stimulation of transcription by cPR requires the presence of progesterone response elements (PREs) in the template and can be specifically inhibited by addition of competitor oligonucleotides containing PREs. Binding of receptor to two PREs is cooperative and leads to a synergistic (27-fold) stimulation of transcription. A purified fusion protein containing the DNA binding domain of cPR linked to yeast ubiquitin was produced in E. coli and also functions in the transcription assay. Using this in vitro transcription system, we demonstrate that hormone-free cPR activated by salt treatment induces transcription of a test gene in a hormone-independent manner. Finally, we present evidence that the progesterone receptor acts by facilitating the formation of a stable preinitiation complex at the target gene promoter and thus augments the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1577688470,"In order to clarify the mechanism(s) by which cyclic GMP inhibits the generation of inositol phosphates in rat aorta segments and cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells, we studied phosphoinositide hydrolysis and GTPase activity in homogenates and membrane preparations of cultured bovine aortic smooth muscle cells. Pretreatment of homogenate preparations with cyclic GMP plus ATP did not inhibit [8-arginine, 3H] vasopressin (AVP) binding, but resulted in a total suppression of the AVP-induced GTPase activation. The pretreatment with cyclic GMP and ATP also inhibited the formation of inositol phosphates induced by AVP in the presence of low concentrations of guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S), or by high concentrations of GTP gamma S alone. However, the formation of inositol phosphates by high concentrations of Ca2+ alone was not blocked. These results suggest that the ability of cyclic GMP to inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis results from an inhibition of a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein activation, and the interaction between guanine nucleotide regulatory protein and phospholipase C. While the precise site of this inhibition is not presently known, the inhibition by cyclic GMP is dependent upon the addition of ATP and probably entails a phosphorylation event since adenylylimidodiphosphate can not substitute for the ATP requirement."
https://openalex.org/W1559914591,"Selenate was found to have several insulin-like effects in rat adipocytes: stimulation of glucose transport activity by translocation of two types of glucose transporters from intracellular sites to the plasma membrane, stimulation of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, and stimulation of ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, in intact cells addition of 1 mM selenate stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of 210-, 170-, 120-, 95-, 70-, and 60-kDa proteins but failed to stimulate insulin receptor kinase activity, suggesting that selenate stimulated other tyrosine kinase. In the presence of insulin, selenate enhances insulin receptor kinase activity and phosphorylations of insulin-stimulated tyrosyl phosphoproteins. These results may provide clues for the elucidation of the role of selenium in animals and the mechanism of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1579843006,"Polyunsaturated free fatty acids (PUFAs) of both w-3 and w-6 series, induce a rapid increase of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in a leukemic T-cell line (JURKAT), measured by the fluorescent indicator fura-2. The early increase in [Ca2+]i was transient, falling to a sustained level which returned to base line after 10-15 min. In Ca2+-free medium, PUFAs still caused an early increase in [Ca2+]i but rapidly returned to basal. Depletion of endoplasmic reticular Ca2+ pool by addition of OKT3 (antibodies to CD3 of the T3-antigen receptor complex) to JURKAT cells (in Ca2+-free medium) abolished the PUFAs-mediated [Ca2+]i increase and vice versa. By using saponin-permeabilized JURKAT cells, the intracellular free Ca2+ released by PUFAs was found to be the non-mitochondrial, ATP-dependent sequestered Ca2+ pool which is sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. However, PUFAs do not induce any apparent increase in inositol phosphates in JURKAT cells. No Ca2+ influx was detected in JURKAT cells when stimulated with PUFAs. A correlation was observed between both the carbon chain length and the number of double bonds with the ability to mobilize cytosolic free [Ca2+]i in the w-3 PUFAs. These results demonstrate that PUFAs stimulate the release of Ca2+ from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ pool in the endoplasmic reticulum of JURKAT cells via a mechanism independent of inositol lipid hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1802787871,"Histochemical and ultrastructural analyses were performed postflight on hind limb skeletal muscles of rats orbited for 12.5 days aboard the unmanned Cosmos 1887 biosatellite and returned to Earth 2 days before sacrifice. The antigravity adductor longus (AL), soleus, and plantaris muscles atrophied more than the non-weight-bearing extensor digitorum longus, and slow muscle fibers were more atrophic than fast fibers. Muscle fiber segmental necrosis occurred selectively in the AL and soleus muscles; primarily, macrophages and neutrophils infiltrated and phagocytosed cellular debris. Granule-rich mast cells were diminished in flight AL muscles compared with controls, indicating the mast cell secretion contributed to interstitial tissue edema. Increased ubiquitination of disrupted myofibrils implicated ubiquitin in myofilament degradation. Mitochondrial content and succinic dehydrogenase activity were normal, except for subsarcolemmal decreases. Myofibrillar ATPase activity of flight AL muscle fibers shifted toward the fast type. Absence of capillaries and extravasation of red blood cells indicated failed microcirculation. Muscle fiber regeneration from activated satellite cells was detected. About 17% of the flight AL end plates exhibited total or partial denervation. Thus, skeletal muscle weakness associated with spaceflight can result from muscle fiber atrophy and segmental necrosis, partial motor denervation, and disruption of the microcirculation."
https://openalex.org/W1492921042,"Synthetic peptides corresponding to the autoinhibitory domains of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-(281-309)), smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK-(480-501)), and protein kinase C (PKC-(19-36)) as well as a peptide derived from the heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKI-tide) were tested for their inhibitory specificities. The inhibitory potencies of the four peptides were determined for each of the four protein kinases using both peptide substrates (at approximate Km concentrations) and protein substrates (at concentrations less than Km). In agreement with previous studies PKI-tide was a specific and potent inhibitor of only cAMP kinase, and none of the other inhibitory peptides gave significant inhibition of cAMP kinase at concentrations of less than 100 microM. With synthetic peptide substrates, PKC-(19-36) strongly inhibited native PKC (IC50 less than 1 microM) but also significantly inhibited autophosphorylated CaMK-II (IC50 = 30 microM) and proteolytically activated MLCK (IC50 = 35 microM). MLCK-(480-501) potently inhibited MLCK (IC50 = 0.25 microM) and also strongly inhibited both PKC and CaMK-II (IC50 = 1.4 and 1.7 microM, respectively). CaMK-(281-309) inhibited autophosphorylated CaMK-II, PKC, and proteolyzed MLCK almost equally (IC50 = 10, 38, and 48 microM, respectively). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with protein substrates. These studies validate the use of PKI-tide as a specific inhibitor of cAMP kinase in intact cell studies and suggest that PKC-(19-36) can also be used but only within a narrow concentration range. However, the autoinhibitory domain peptides from MLCK and CaMK-II are not sufficiently specific to be used in similar investigations."
https://openalex.org/W1496104502,"Activation of guanyl nucleotide regulatory proteins (G proteins) by hormones and neurotransmitters appears to require the formation of high affinity agonist-receptor-G protein ternary complexes. In the case of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor, multiple regions of the molecule have been implicated in coupling to the stimulatory G protein Gs. This finding raises the possibility that discrete regions of the receptor mediate ternary complex formation, whereas different loci may be involved in other aspects of G protein activation. To date, however, mutagenesis studies with the beta 2-adrenergic receptor have not clarified this question since mutant receptors with impaired abilities to activate Gs have generally possessed a diminished capacity to form the ternary complex as assessed in binding assays. We have expressed in a mammalian cell line a mutant beta 2-adrenergic receptor comprising a seven-amino acid deletion in the carboxyl-terminal region of its third cytoplasmic loop (D267-273), a region proposed to be critically involved in coupling to Gs. When tested with beta-adrenergic agonists, the maximal adenylyl cyclase response mediated by this mutant receptor was less than one-half of that seen with the wild-type receptor. Nevertheless, D267-273 exhibited high affinity agonist binding identical to that of the wild-type receptor. In addition, agonist-induced sequestration of the receptor, a property not mediated by Gs, was also normal. These findings indicate that the formation of high affinity agonist-receptor-Gs complexes is not sufficient to fully activate Gs. Instead, an additional stimulatory signal appears to be required from the receptor. Our data thereby suggest that the molecular determinants of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor involved in formation of the ternary complex are not identical to those that transmit the agonist-induced stimulatory signal to Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1568597106,"In this report we have taken the reconstitution approach to study which subunits of the heterotrimer core polymerase (alpha, epsilon, theta) participate in the highly processive replication of long DNA templates by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme). Comparison of the core and the alpha epsilon complex (the DNA polymerase and 3'-5' exonuclease subunits, respectively) shows they are both rapid and highly processive polymerases when they are reconstituted into a holoenzyme with the gamma complex (gamma delta delta' chi psi) and beta accessory proteins of holoenzyme. Specifically, holoenzyme reconstituted using either core or alpha epsilon completely replicates a uniquely primed 5.4-kilobase (kb) single-stranded DNA within 12 s in one binding event. Hence the theta subunit of core is not required for the processivity or speed of the holoenzyme. In contrast, when only the alpha subunit is reconstituted into the holoenzyme it is unable to replicate the entire 5.4-kb circle in one binding event but still retains a fairly high processivity of 1-3 kb and when given sufficient time for multiple binding events it finally finishes the entire circle. Therefore, highly processive DNA synthesis by holoenzyme is contingent on the epsilon exonuclease subunit. In light of these results the significance of the polymerase and exonuclease activities residing in two separate polypeptides is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1534174729,"Phagocytic leukocytes contain an activatable NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase. Components of this enzyme system include cytochrome b558, and three soluble oxidase components (SOC I, SOC II, and SOC III) found in the cytosol of resting cells. Previously, we found that SOC II copurifies with, and is probably identical to, a 47-kDa substrate of protein kinase C. In the present study we investigated the change in location of several of these oxidase components after activation of intact neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and separation of subcellular fraction on sucrose density gradients. On Western blots with fractions of resting cells, the alpha subunit of cytochrome b558 was detected with a monoclonal antibody as a doublet of Mr 22,000 and 24,000 in the specific granules and as a single band of Mr 24,000 in the plasma membrane. PMA induced an increase of cytochrome b558 in the plasma membrane, including the Mr 22,000 band. PMA also induced translocation of the 47-kDa protein from the cytosol to the membrane fraction, as revealed by in vitro phosphorylation experiments. When NADPH oxidase activity was determined in a cell-free system in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and GTP with plasma membranes from resting cells, cytosol from PMA-treated cells was deficient compared with cytosol from resting cells. This deficiency could be partially restored by the addition of SOC I. Concomitantly, SOC I activity appeared in the plasma membranes of PMA-treated cells. These studies support the hypothesis that PMA stimulation of neutrophils results in assembly of oxidase components from the cytosol and the specific granules in the plasma membrane with subsequent expression of NADPH oxidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1541670596,"Evidence of cellular transthyretin (TTR) binding was sought because of the observation that transthyretin can increase the uptake of its hormonal ligand. Transthyretin was bound by human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, reaching equilibrium within 2 h. Scatchard analysis was consistent with a single class of high affinity binding sites with a Kd of approximately 5 nM at 0 and 4 degrees C and 14 nM at 37 degrees C. These dissociation constants are more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration of transthyretin in human serum. The apparent capacity at 0 degrees C, corrected for internalized TTR, was approximately 20,000 sites/cell. Saturable, high affinity binding of human transthyretin was also demonstrable with rat primary hepatocytes and human renal adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, and transformed lung cells. Rat and human transthyretin were equipotent in displacing isotopically labeled, species-specific transthyretin from human hepatoma cells and rat primary hepatocytes, a finding that is consistent with the strong homology between rat and human transthyretin. Eighty-eight percent of the saturable uptake was internalized as determined by proteolytic removal of surface transthyretin. Internalization was dependent on receptor binding and was more markedly inhibited than surface binding at 0 degrees C. Concentrations of thyroxine within a range that saturated a significant proportion of the primary and secondary TTR iodothyronine binding sites increased the uptake and internalization of transthyretin in a dose-dependent manner. By analogy to the function of receptors for other transport proteins, the interaction between transthyretin and its receptor is likely to affect ligand delivery and may have additional metabolic effects."
https://openalex.org/W1493054301,"Vitellogenesis is the process of yolk formation in rapidly growing oocytes of oviparous species. The transport of yolk precursor proteins from the blood plasma into the oocyte is achieved by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Although the Xenopus oocyte is one of the prime experimental systems for expression of foreign genes and their products, the receptor for the main vitellogenic protein, vitellogenin, from this extensively utilized cell has not been identified. Here we have applied ligand and immunoblotting to visualize the Xenopus laevis oocyte receptor for vitellogenin as a protein with an apparent Mr of 115,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. The receptor from the amphibian oocyte also recognizes chicken vitellogenin, and vice versa; furthermore, the two receptor proteins are immunologically related as revealed by Western blotting with anti-chicken vitellogenin receptor antibodies. The receptors from both species bind the lipovitellin moiety of vitellogenin, as revealed by ligand blotting with radiolabeled lipovitellin polypeptides as well as by a novel reverse ligand blotting procedure utilizing nitrocellulose-immobilized ligand. Since vitellogenins of chicken and Xenopus have been shown to be structurally similar and evolutionarily related (Nardelli, D., van het Schip, F. D., Gerber-Huber, S., Haefliger, J.-A., Gruber, M., AB, G., and Wahli, W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15377-15383), it appears that conservation of key structural elements required for efficient vitellogenesis extends from the ligands to their receptors on the oocyte plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1577857257,"An experimental arrangement is described which enables high quality 31P NMR spectra of compressed spinach leaf pieces to be continuously recorded in which all the resonances observed (cytoplasmic and vacuolar Pi, glycerate-3-P, nucleotides) were sharp and well resolved. 31P NMR spectra obtained from intact chloroplasts showed a distinct peak of stromal Pi. An upfield shift of the stromal Pi resonance was associated with a decrease in the external Pi and vice versa. Nucleotides were largely invisible to NMR in intact chloroplasts, whereas the same nucleotides reappeared in a typical 31P NMR spectrum of an acid extract of intact chloroplasts. Perfusion of compressed spinach leaf pieces with a medium containing Pi triggered a dramatic increase in the vacuolar Pi over 12 h. Addition of choline to the Pi-free perfusate of compressed leaf pieces resulted in a steady accumulation of phosphorylcholine in the cytoplasmic compartment at the expense of cytoplasmic Pi. When a threshold of cytoplasmic Pi concentration was attained, Pi was drawn from the vacuole to sustain choline phosphorylation. In spinach leaves, the vacuole represents a potentially large Pi reservoir, and cycling of Pi through vacuolar influx (energy dependent) and efflux pathways is an efficient system that may provide for control over the cytosolic-free Pi and phosphorylated intermediate concentrations. 31P NMR spectra of neutralized perchloric acid extracts of spinach leaves showed well defined multipeak resonances (quadruplet) of intracellular phytate. The question of cytosolic Pi concentration in green cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1538606150,"Thiourea and superoxide dismutase were effective antidotes to paraquat toxicity in an HL60 cell culture system, whereas other hydroxyl scavengers were ineffective. The efficacy of thioureas was not due to blockage of intracellular paraquat uptake, inhibition of NADPH-P-450 reductase, or reaction with the paraquat radical. Thiourea also competitively inhibited the reduction of cytochrome c by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase superoxide-generating system, and the release of iron from ferritin by superoxide radicals. The reaction of superoxide with thiourea produced a sulfhydryl compound distinct from products formed by hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl radicals. Spectrophotometric and chromatographic studies indicated the carbon-sulfide double bond was converted to a sulfhydryl group which reacted with Ellman's reagent. Additional confirmatory evidence for the sulfhydryl compound was obtained with carbon-13 NMR and mass spectroscopies. Thus, thioureas are direct scavengers of superoxide radicals as well as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide. The rate constant for the reduction of thiourea by superoxide was estimated at 1.1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1. The implication of this finding on free radical studies, the mechanism of paraquat toxicity, and the metabolism of thioureas is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1565022554,"Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that mouse epidermal growth factor (mEGF) modulates the hormonal responsiveness of MA-10 Leydig tumor cells without affecting cell multiplication. In an attempt to characterize the intracellular signaling systems activated by mEGF in this cell type, we examined its effects on the labeling of phosphatidylinositols in cells that had been preincubated with different radioactive precursors. Here we report that exposure of MA-10 cells to mEGF, but not other ligands that affect their differentiated function, results in an increase in the labeling of an unusual phosphatidylinositol that does not appear to be present in unstimulated cells. This phosphatidylinositol has been identified as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1820058756,"The aim of this work was to characterize the changes in pH regulation that lead to increased intracellular pH (pHi) in well-spread cells on tissue culture plastic relative to cells on a nonadhesive surface. Bicarbonate was not required for maintenance of a control steady state pHi or of the difference in pHi between round and spread cells. In the absence of bicarbonate, lowering the sodium content of the medium led to decreased pHi and elimination of the difference between round and spread cells. In the presence or absence of bicarbonate, adding ethylisopropyl amiloride lowered pHi and eliminated the difference between round and spread cells. Measurements of recovery from acute acidification in the absence of bicarbonate confirmed that Na+/H+ exchange was enhanced in spread cells. However, recovery from both acidification and alkalinization in the presence of bicarbonate showed that bicarbonate-dependent recovery in both directions, most likely due to sodium-dependent and -independent HCO3-/Cl- exchangers, was also stimulated in spread cells. We conclude that Na+/H+ exchange has a primary role in determining steady state pHi in 3T3 cells in serum and is responsible for the lower pHi in round cells. Bicarbonate-dependent pH regulatory mechanisms are also inhibited in round cells."
https://openalex.org/W1499509362,"The acetaminophen phenoxyl radical was generated by the oxidation of acetaminophen by horseradish peroxidase in a fast-flow ESR experiment, and its reaction with glutathione and ascorbate was studied. Glutathione reduces the phenoxyl radical of acetaminophen to regenerate acetaminophen and form the thiyl radical of glutathione. This thiyl radical reacts with the thiolate anion of glutathione to form the disulfide radical anion, which was detected and characterized by ESR spectroscopy. In the presence of ascorbate, the ascorbyl radical was produced by the reduction of the acetaminophen phenoxyl radical by ascorbate. This reaction results in the complete reduction of the free radical of acetaminophen, whereas the glutathione reduction of the phenoxyl radical of acetaminophen was not complete on the fast-flow ESR time scale of milliseconds. This suggests that ascorbate rather than glutathione is more likely to react with the acetaminophen phenoxyl free radical in vivo. In the presence of both ascorbate and higher concentrations of glutathione, the reaction with ascorbate is dominant. When cysteine was used in the place of reduced glutathione in the above assay system, the disulfide radical anion of cystine was observed in a manner similar to glutathione. These reactions may have significance in the detoxification of acetaminophen and the free radical metabolites of xenobiotics in general. Only in cells containing low levels of ascorbate can glutathione play a direct role in the detoxification of the acetaminophen phenoxyl radical."
https://openalex.org/W1616340533,"The cellular events mediating the rapid, thyroid hormone-dependent modulation of membrane-bound, type II iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase were studied in dibutyryl cyclic AMP(bt2cAMP)-treated brain astrocytes. Unstimulated cells had undetectable type II 5'-deiodinating activity. Treating the cells with bt2cAMP and hydrocortisone induced enzyme expression by increasing transcription of the enzyme or an essential enzyme related protein(s), with steady-state levels of type II 5'-deiodinase attained after 8 h of bt2cAMP treatment. Glial cells grown in the absence of thyroid hormone had 10-15-fold higher levels of 5'-deiodinating activity than cells grown in the presence of serum. The increased type II 5'-deiodinating activity observed in serum-free cultures was due to a prolonged enzyme half-life with no change in the rate of enzyme synthesis. Addition of thyroxine or 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine to the serum-free culture medium resulted in a concentration-dependent fall in steady-state enzyme levels, with EC50 values of approximately 0.4 nM. 3,5,3'-Triiodothyronine was at least 100-fold less effective. Chloroquine, NH4Cl, tunicamycin, colchicine, and monodansylcadavarine had no effect on the t1/2 of the enzyme, while both carbonyl cynanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and cytochalasins completely blocked the inactivation of the type II 5'-deiodinase. These data indicate that in glial cells, an intact actin-cytoskeleton is required for thyroid hormone to modulate the energy-dependent regulation of the half-life of the short-lived, membrane-bound enzyme, type II 5'-deiodinase."
https://openalex.org/W1547423123,"Stable protein-DNA complexes or transpososomes mediate the Mu DNA strand transfer reaction in vitro (Surette, M. G., Buch, S. J., and Chaconas, G. (1987) Cell 49, 253-262; Craigie, R., and Mizuuchi, K. (1987) Cell 51, 493-501). Formation of the Type 1 complex, an intermediate in the strand transfer reaction, requires the Mu A and Escherichia coli HU proteins. Generation of the Type 2 complex, in which the Mu ends have been covalently linked to the target DNA, requires the Mu B protein, ATP, and target DNA in addition to A and HU. The protein content of these higher order synaptic complexes has been studied by immunoelectron microscopy using protein A-colloidal gold conjugates to visualize antibody-bound complexes. Under our in vitro transposition conditions, Type 1 complexes were found to contain A and HU; in addition, Type 2 complexes contained Mu B. However, both the HU and the Mu B protein were found to be loosely associated and could be quantitatively removed from the nucleoprotein core of both complexes by incubation in 0.5 M NaCl. Depletion of HU from the Type 1 complex did not affect the ability of this complex to be converted into the strand-transferred product. Hence, the indispensable role of the HU protein in the Mu DNA strand transfer reaction is limited to the formation of the Type 1 transpososome."
https://openalex.org/W1657353485,"Electron spin resonance (ESR) studies on spin trapping of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide (DMPO) were performed in NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase-paraquat systems at pH 7.4. Spin adduct concentrations were determined by comparing ESR spectra of the adducts with the ESR spectrum of a stable radical solution. Kinetic analysis in the presence of 100 microM desferrioxamine B (deferoxamine) showed that: 1) the oxidation of 1 mol of NADPH produces 2 mol of superoxide ions, all of which can be trapped by DMPO when extrapolated to infinite concentration; 2) the rate constant for the reaction of superoxide with DMPO was 1.2 M-1 s-1; 3) the superoxide spin adduct of DMPO (DMPO-OOH) decays with a half-life of 66 s and the maximum level of DMPO-OOH formed can be calculated by a simple steady state equation; and 4) 2.8% or less of the DMPO-OOH decay occurs through a reaction producing hydroxyl radicals. In the presence of 100 microM EDTA, 5 microM Fe(III) ions nearly completely inhibited the formation of the hydroxyl radical adduct of DMPO (DMPO-OH) as well as the formation of DMPO-OOH and, when 100 microM hydrogen peroxide was present, produced DMPO-OH exclusively. Fe(III)-EDTA is reduced by superoxide and the competition of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in the reaction with Fe(II)-EDTA seems to be reflected in the amounts of DMPO-OOH and DMPO-OH detected. These effects of EDTA can be explained from known kinetic data including a rate constant of 6 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for reduction of DMPO-OOH by Fe(II)-EDTA. The effect of diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DETAPAC) on the formation of DMPO-OOH and DMPO-OH was between deferoxamine and EDTA, and about the same as that of endogenous chelator (phosphate)."
https://openalex.org/W1578564933,"The synthesis of a major collagen-binding heat-shock protein of molecular weight 47,000 (hsp47) was shown previously to be decreased after transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts by Rous sarcoma virus (Nagata, K., and Yamada, K. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7531-7536; and Nagata, K., Saga, S., and Yamada, K. M. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 223-229). In this paper, further study demonstrated that the total amount and the synthesis of hsp47 are also decreased by a factor of three in BALB/3T3 cells transformed by simian virus 40 (SV40). Higher synthesis was observed for BALB/3T3 cells in the resting state compared to those in the proliferating state. The synthesis of hsp47 in SV40-transformed cells, however, was consistently lower than that in normal cells irrespective of the cell density. Pulse label and chase experiments revealed that hsp47 was stable in the cells for at least 6 h and that there was no difference between normal and transformed BALB/3T3 cells in terms of the half-life. Decreases in the amount and the synthesis of hsp47 by transformation apparently correlate with the decreased synthesis of collagen in transformed cells. Immunoprecipitation using rat monoclonal antibody against hsp47 demonstrated the association of hsp47 with intracellular procollagen. Immunofluorescence studies using anti-hsp47 monoclonal antibody and anti-collagen antibody confirmed the co-localization of hsp47 and procollagen in both nonshocked and heat-shocked cells. Furthermore, we determined the biochemical characteristics of hsp47 of heat-shocked cells."
https://openalex.org/W1907864307,"The dnaA initiator protein binds specific sequences in the 245-base pair Escherichia coli origin (oriC) to form a series of complexes which eventually are opened enough to admit dnaB helicase into a prepriming complex (Bramhill, D., and Kornberg, A. (1988) Cell 52, 743-755). ATP bound to a high-affinity site on dnaA protein is the preferred form for one or more of the early stages, but an elevated level of ATP is needed for a later stage; further evidence for a low-affinity site has now been obtained. We find that at limiting levels of dnaA protein only the ATP form produces an active initial complex; neither the ADP nor the non-nucleotide forms are effective. Augmentation of the activity of a limiting level of the ATP form of dnaA protein by the otherwise inert ADP form implies that at some stage of initiation both forms are active. The dnaA protein is essential up to the stage of forming the prepriming complex; upon salt dissociation from an oriC complex, the protein can be recycled to function at a fresh origin. Distinctive conformational states of the ATP form are implied by interactions with oriC DNA, by the influence of phospholipids on accelerating nucleotide exchange, and by the susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1544293719,"Two different types of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) have been purified 10,455-fold (DGK I) and 7,410-fold (DGK IV) from the cytosol and membrane fractions of rat brain, respectively. The cytosolic DGK was purified by successive chromatographies on Affi-Gel Blue, Q-Sepharose F.F., Mono Q, hydroxylapatite, and ATP-agarose. The membrane-bound DGK was purified from the 2 M NaCl extract of membranes by chromatography on Affi-Gel Blue, phenyl-Superose, hydroxylapatite, and ATP-agarose. The resultant preparations contained homogeneous enzymes with a Mr of 110,000 (DGK I) and 150,000 (DGK IV) as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These enzymes both phosphorylate 1,2-dioleoyl glycerol at rates of 11.5 mumol/min/mg protein for DGK I and 5.2 mumol/min/mg protein for DGK IV. Both enzymes require divalent cations and ionic detergents for activity. Magnesium is the most potent cation for both enzymes, but Ca2+ was also found to be fairly effective. Manganese is less effective than Mg2+ or Ca2+. Anionic detergents such as sodium deoxycholate or sodium cholate stimulate the activities of both enzymes, although DGK IV is stimulated more markedly than DGK I at lower concentrations. The optimal pH for the two enzymes was found to be the same, pH 7.4. Some phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol elevate the kinase activities of these kinases even in the absence of detergents. DGK IV is activated more significantly than DGK I by low amounts of phospholipids. The two enzymes also show structural differences. DGK I and DGK IV give different peptide maps after digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease or alpha-chymotrypsin. The results suggest that these enzymes are different forms of DGK and may be involved in different biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1494032084,"We have compared the pharmacological properties of the human placental brush-border membrane Na(+)-H+ exchanger with those of the rabbit renal brush-border membrane Na(+)-H+ exchanger. The exchanger activity in both preparations was inhibited by cimetidine, clonidine, and harmaline. Cimetidine was found to be 4-5 times more potent than clonidine in inhibiting the placental Na+-H+ exchanger. However, the order of potency was reversed for the renal exchanger, in which case clonidine was 3-4 times more potent than cimetidine as an inhibitor. There was, however, no difference between the potencies of harmaline to inhibit the two exchangers. When amiloride and four of its analogs were tested as inhibitors, the Na(+)-H+ exchanger of the placental brush-border membrane exhibited greater sensitivity to inhibition by all of these compounds than the Na(+)-H+ exchanger of the renal brush-border membrane. The difference between the two exchangers was more prominent with the 5-amino-substituted amiloride derivatives than with amiloride. The greatest difference between the Ki values was for dimethylamiloride (the kidney/placenta ratio was 185), followed by ethylisopropyl amiloride, hexamethylene amiloride, and t-butyl amiloride. These results indicate that the two Na+-H+ exchangers are pharmacologically distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1623742825,"We have recently reported that the expression of an in vitro mutated, kinase-defective insulin receptor (A/K1018) leads to cellular insulin resistance when expressed in Rat 1 fibroblasts. That is, despite the presence of normal numbers of activatable native insulin receptors in the host cell, the A/K1018 receptors prevent the normal receptors from phosphorylating endogenous substrates and from signalling insulin action, perhaps by competing for limiting amounts of these substrates. We report here that insulin-like growth factor I-stimulated phosphorylation of two endogenous substrate proteins, pp220 and pp170, is also inhibited in cells expressing A/K1018 receptors. Because insulin-like growth factor I stimulation of glucose uptake is not inhibited in cells with A/K1018 receptors while pp220 and pp170 phosphorylation is inhibited, it is unlikely that either pp220 or pp170 are involved in mediating the stimulation of glucose transport. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor I-mediated stimulation of mitogenesis is inhibited in cells with A/K1018 receptors. Thus, pp170 or pp220 could be involved in mitogenic signalling. We also report that both H2O2 and tetradecanoylphorbolacetate stimulate glucose transport normally in cells with A/K1018 receptors. Phorbol esters also lead to the phosphorylation of both normal and A/K1018 receptors on serine and/or threonine. This argues that phorbol esters or H2O2 bypass the normal proximal steps in signalling insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1546003769,"Five distinct low potential iron-sulfur clusters have been identified potentiometrically in the membrane particles from Thermus thermophilus HB-8. Three of these clusters (designated as [N-1H]T, [N-2H]T, and [N-3]T) exhibit the following midpoint redox potentials and g values (Em8.0 = -274 mV, gx,y,z = 1.93, 1.94, 2.02), (Em8.0 = -304 mV, gx,y,z = 1.89, 1.95, 2.04), and (Em8.0 = -289 mV, gx,y,z = 1.80, 1.83, 2.06), respectively. These clusters, one binuclear and two tetranuclear, have been shown to be components of the energy coupled NADH-menaquinone oxidoreductase complex (NADH dh I). They are reducible by NADH in the piericidin A-inhibited aerobic membrane particles as well as in the purified NADH dh I complex. Two additional very low potential iron-sulfur clusters (one binuclear, [N-1L]T, and one tetranuclear, [N-2L]T) were observed in membrane particles. These clusters possess the following physiochemical properties (Em8.0 = -418 mV, gx,y,z = 1.93, 19.5, 2.02) and (Em8.0 = -437 mV, gx,y,z = 1.89, 1.95, 2.04), respectively. No high potential tetranuclear cluster equivalent to the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster [N-2]B was found in this bacterial system. In membrane particles isolated from T. thermophilus HB-8 cells, four different semiquinone species have been identified based on their redox midpoint potentials [Em9(Q/QH2) = 40, -100, -160, -300 mV] and sensitivity to the quinone analogue inhibitor, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxy quinoline-N-oxide. Of these semiquinone species the -100 mV component has been suggested to be part of the NADH dehydrogenase. Piericidin A sensitive delta psi formation has been demonstrated to be coupled to the NADH-MQ1 oxidoreductase in membrane vesicles of T. thermophilus HB-8."
https://openalex.org/W1534435601,"Secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) by chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) is increased approximately 50-fold following transformation by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Using a cloned and fully sequenced chicken uPA cDNA probe, we have established that this increase in plasminogen activator production can be largely accounted for by an increase in cellular uPA mRNA. CEF contained on average less than 1 molecule of uPA mRNA/cell, whereas RSV-CEF contained 25-60 molecules/cell. The increase in cellular uPA mRNA levels was dependent on the activity of the RSV-encoded transforming protein, protein-tyrosine kinase pp60v-src. Cells infected with an RSV mutant encoding a temperature-sensitive form of the src protein (ts-NY68) contained low uPA mRNA levels when cultured at the nonpermissive temperature and high uPA mRNA levels when maintained at the permissive temperature. Temperature shift studies with tsNY68-CEF demonstrated that changes in pp60v-src activity rapidly altered uPA mRNA levels; the uPA mRNA content of total RNA extracts increased and decreased with half-time kinetics of 3-5 h. Serine/threonine-specific protein kinases also appear to modulate uPA mRNA levels in CEF cultures. Exposure of CEF and RSV-CEF for 24 h to the protein kinase C activating agent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) increased cellular uPA mRNA levels to 20 and 260 molecules/cell, respectively. These data are consistent with the previously observed synergism between RSV and PMA in increasing plasminogen activator secretion. Nuclear run-on transcription analyses established that both RSV and PMA increase cellular uPA mRNA levels by way of increased uPA gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1540748404,"We examined the effect of thyrotropin (TSH) stimulation of FRTL5 rat thyroid cells on ferritin H mRNA levels. On Northern blot analysis, TSH (in the presence of serum and insulin) increased ferritin H mRNA levels, with an initial response evident after 1 h of stimulation. Ferritin H mRNA levels increased approximately 4-fold over basal levels after 4 h of TSH stimulation and showed little increase thereafter, maintaining a plateau for up to 48 h of TSH stimulation. Inducers of cAMP also increased ferritin H mRNA levels in FRTL5 cells to about the same extent, but the rate of response was not as rapid as with TSH stimulation. In serum-poor medium without insulin, the TSH effect was considerably weaker, increasing only about 2-fold after 24 h of stimulation. Also in serum-poor medium, insulin-like growth factor-I alone had a weak stimulatory effect on ferritin H mRNA levels. TSH and insulin-like growth factor-I had additive effects under these conditions. Nuclear run-on transcription assays were performed using nuclei prepared from FRTL5 cells. In serum-containing medium, TSH increased the transcriptional activity of ferritin H mRNA 3-4-fold without an increase in beta-actin transcriptional activity. The kinetics of TSH stimulation of ferritin H transcriptional activity were similar to the cellular ferritin H mRNA response to TSH stimulation. Dibutyryl-cAMP (dB-cAMP) increased ferritin H transcriptional activity about 4-fold, but not as rapidly as did TSH stimulation. In summary, our data indicate that ferritin H mRNA levels in FRTL5 thyroid cells are transcriptionally regulated by both TSH and dBcAMP stimulation. These data contrast with the predominantly nontranscriptional regulation of ferritin H mRNA levels observed in other tissues. The difference in the kinetics of the response to TSH and dBcAMP is consistent with the concept that not all effects induced by TSH stimulation of thyroid cells are mediated by cAMP as a second messenger."
https://openalex.org/W1585840385,"In simian sarcoma virus (SSV)-transformed cells (SSV-NRK, SSV-NIH 3T3, and SSV-NP1 cells), the v-sis gene product was synthesized as a 36-kDa glycopolypeptide with one endoglycosidase (Endo) H-sensitive oligosaccharide chain and formed a dimer (p72) with a half-time of less than 5 min. p72 was proteolytically processed to generate sequentially p68 and p58 in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi complex, p44 in the post-Golgi complex compartments, and p27 in an endosomal/lysosomal compartment. A portion (20-30%) of p72 and p68 later became Endo H-resistant but Endo F-sensitive. During processing, the v-sis gene products exhibited rapid turnover, possibly in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi complex. The rate of turnover correlated with the tumorigenicity previously reported in these SSV-transformed cells. All three SSV-transformed cells secreted v-sis gene product (p44). p44 was secreted but remained tightly associated with the cell surface. This novel secretion provided an efficient system for the interaction of p44 with the cell surface platelet-derived growth factor receptor which resulted in the intracellular formation of p27. A fraction of secreted p44 was converted extracellularly to a 27-kDa product (extracellular p27) after a longer time in culture. The identical N-terminal amino acid sequence of p44 and extracellular p27 (H2N-SLGSLSVAEPAMIA) indicated a preferential site (Lys110-Arg111) for the proteolytic processing. The intracellular turnover of the v-sis gene product and its correlation with tumorigenicity as well as the demonstration of mitogenically active intracellular forms of v-sis gene product support the hypothesis of intracellular loop autocrine transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2160663079,"According to recent observations ADP stimulates platelets via activation of Na+/H+ exchange which increases cytosolic pH (pHi). This event initiates formation of thromboxane A2 (via phospholipase A2) and, thereafter, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (via phospholipase C) which is known to mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites. We investigated changes in pHi and cytosolic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, activating platelets with ADP and the thromboxane mimetic U 46619. We found that ADP (5 microM) increased pHi from 7.15 +/- 0.08 to 7.35 +/- 0.04 (n = 8) in 2'-7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-loaded platelets, whereas thromboxane A2 formation was inhibited by indomethacin. ADP also induced a dose-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in fura2-loaded platelets which again was not affected by indomethacin. [Ca2+]i increased by 54 +/- 10 nM (n = 8) at 1 microM and by 170 +/- 40 nM (n = 7) at 10 microM ADP above the resting value of 76 +/- 12 nM (n = 47). Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange by ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) reduced ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization by more than 65% in indomethacin-treated platelets. This inhibition could be completely overcome by artificially raising pHi using either NH4Cl or the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin. We found that U 46619 increased pHi by 0.18 +/- 0.05 at 0.1 microM and by 0.29 +/- 0.07 (n = 7) at 1.0 microM above the resting value via an EIPA-sensitive mechanism. In conflict with the proposed role of the Na+/H+ exchange we found that U 46619 raised [Ca2+]i via a mechanism that for more than 50% depended on intact Na+/H+ exchange. Again, artificially elevating pHi restored U 46619-induced Ca2+ mobilization despite the presence of EIPA. Thus, our data show that Na+/H+ exchange is a common step in platelet activation by prostaglandin endoperoxides/thromboxane A2 and ADP and enhances Ca2+ mobilization independently of phospholipase A2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1528970866,"The domain structures of the Escherichia coli Rep and Helicase II proteins and their ligand-dependent conformational changes have been examined by monitoring the sensitivity of these helicases to proteolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin. Limited treatment of unliganded Rep protein (73 kDa) with trypsin results in cleavage at a single site in its carboxyl-terminal region, producing a 68-kDa polypeptide which is stabilized in the presence of ATP, ADP, or adenosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S). The purified 68-kDa Rep tryptic polypeptide retains single-stranded (ss) DNA binding, DNA unwinding (helicase), and full ATPase activities. When bound to ssDNA, the Rep protein can be cleaved by trypsin at an additional site in its carboxyl-terminal region, producing a 58-kDa polypeptide that also retains ssDNA binding and ATPase activities. This 58-kDa Rep tryptic polypeptide can also be produced by further tryptic treatment of the 68-kDa Rep tryptic polypeptide when the latter is bound to ssDNA. This 58-kDa polypeptide displays a lower affinity for ssDNA indicating that the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal peptide facilitates Rep protein binding to ssDNA. The 58-kDa Rep tryptic polypeptide is also stabilized in the presence of nucleotides. Based on these and previous studies that showed that the 68-kDa Rep tryptic polypeptide cannot support DNA replication in a system that is dependent upon the phi X174 cis-A protein (Arai, N. & Kornberg, A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5294-5298), we conclude that the carboxyl-terminal end (approximately 5 kDa) of the Rep protein is not required for its helicase or ATPase activities. However, we suggest that this region of the Rep protein is important for its interactions with the phi X174 cis-A protein. Limited treatment of unliganded Helicase II protein (82 kDa) with chymotrypsin results in cleavage after Tyr254, producing a 29-kDa amino-terminal polypeptide and a 53-kDa carboxyl-terminal polypeptide, which remain associated under nondenaturing conditions. This chymotrypsin cleavage reduces the ssDNA binding activity and eliminates the ssDNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities of the Helicase II protein. The binding of ATP, ADP, ATP gamma S, and/or DNA to Helicase II protein results in protection of this site (Tyr254) from cleavage by chymotrypsin. Limited treatment of Helicase II protein with trypsin results in cleavage near its carboxyl-terminal end producing two polypeptides with apparent Mr = 72,000, in a manner similar to that observed with the Rep protein; these polypeptides are also stabilized by binding ATP or single-stranded DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Thus, p34cdc2 might interact through its conserved peptide domain with some component of the Ca2(+)-regulatory system."
https://openalex.org/W1577874660,"Using a novel Escherichia coli system we have successfully overexpressed a region of the chicken progesterone receptor which encodes both the DNA- and hormone-binding domains. The expression system produces the truncated receptor fragment as an in-frame fusion with ubiquitin. This strategy greatly enhances both the solubility and stability of fusion proteins expressed in E. coli. Synthesis has been further improved by induction of the lambda PL promoter with nalidixic acid at low growth temperatures (less than or equal to 30 degrees C) rather than use of conventional heat induction protocols. We can produce 10 mg of receptor fragment/liter of cells using this system, and we estimate that at least 0.3 mg of this receptor material is biologically active, as assessed by DNA-binding and hormone-binding assays. Receptor produced in this manner is almost indistinguishable from authentic oviduct progesterone receptor using the criteria of hormone-binding specificity and affinity and binding to a progesterone response element. This expression system offers a cheap convenient method for the production of mg amounts of biologically active derivatives of progesterone receptor for biochemical studies."
https://openalex.org/W1564893375,"5'-Deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), an important intermediate in methionine recycling, can be metabolized by one of two mechanisms that appear to be mutually exclusive. In human cells, MTA is degraded in one step to adenine and 5-methylthioribose 1-phosphate (MTR-1-P) via MTA phosphorylase. In contrast, certain microbes metabolize MTA in two steps: first to 5-methylthioribose (MTR) followed by conversion to MTR-1-P. The enzymes involved in this two-step conversion are MTA nucleosidase and MTR kinase. In both cases, MTR-1-P is subsequently recycled to methionine. Because MTR kinase is unique to microbes (it is also found in plant tissue) and since it is essential to microbial methionine salvage, we hypothesized that MTR kinase is a promising target for chemotherapeutic exploitation. We demonstrate that 5-trifluoromethylthioribose (TFMTR), a structural analog of MTR, is a potent inhibitor of the MTR kinase-containing organism Klebsiella pneumoniae. TFMTR not only inhibits the growth of K. pneumoniae in a dose-dependent manner (50% inhibition at approximately 40 nM) but also competitively inhibits MTR kinase activity (Ki approximately 7 microM). Furthermore, TFMTR is shown to be a substrate for MTR kinase (Km = 1.7 microM), suggesting that the drug could be converted to toxic products (e.g. trifluoromethionine or carbonothionic difluoride) in enzyme-containing organisms. Structural analogs of MTR represent a new class of compounds with the potential for treating diseases caused by MTR kinase-containing microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W1667541874,"We previously identified an alternative pathway for the metabolism of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) in calf brain. The enzyme responsible for the degradation of Ins(1,3,4)P3 was designated as inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase (Bansal, V. S., Inhorn, R. C., and Majerus, P. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9644-9647). We have now purified this enzyme 3390-fold from calf brain-soluble fraction. The isolated enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa as determined by gel filtration. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the enzyme migrates as a protein of 105 kDa, suggesting that it is monomeric. Among various 4-phosphate-containing inositol polyphosphates, the enzyme hydrolyzes only Ins(1,3,4)P3 and inositol 3,4-bisphosphate (Ins(3,4)P2), yielding inositol 1,3-bisphosphate and inositol 3-phosphate as products. The inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase has apparent Km values of 40 and 25 microM for Ins(1,3,4)P3 and Ins(3,4)P2, respectively. The maximum velocities for these two substrates are 15-20 mumol of product/min/mg protein. Ins(1,3,4)P3 is a competitive inhibitor of Ins(3,4)P2 hydrolysis with an apparent Ki of 27 microM implying that the same active site is involved in hydrolysis of both substrates. The final enzyme preparation retained a small inositol polyphosphate 3-phosphatase activity (less than 2% of rate of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase activity) which most likely reflects a contaminant. The enzyme displays maximum activity between pH 6.5 and 7.5. It is not inhibited by Li+, Ca2+, or Mg2+ except at 10 mM divalent ions. Mn2+ inhibits enzyme at high concentrations IC50 = 1.5 mM."
https://openalex.org/W1516229395,"Small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCC) expresses several characteristics of neuronal cells, including voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC), and also expresses muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR). In testing the possibility that VGCC may be functionally coupled to mAChR in SCC cell lines, we found that depolarization-dependent Ca2+ influx was inhibited by carbachol (IC50 = 0.78 microM) and oxotremorine (IC50 = 0.69 microM). Equilibrium dissociation constants for several mAChR antagonists indicated that a mAChR of M3 subtype was involved. Exposure of SCC to carbachol induced the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and increased the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The carbachol-mediated inhibition of depolarization-dependent Ca2+ influx did not directly correlate with increased [Ca2+]i but did correlate with inositol poly-phosphate generation. The protein kinase C activators phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol neither mimicked nor amplified the inhibitory effect of carbachol on Ca2+ influx. However, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate suppressed the carbachol-induced inositol polyphosphate generation and inhibition of depolarization-dependent Ca2+ influx. The inactive compound 4 alpha-phorbol had no effect. These data suggest that the inhibition of VGCC caused by carbachol is not due to protein kinase C activation, but rather is due to events mediated by inositol polyphosphates. This is the first documentation of a role for phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the functional coupling of mAChR and VGCC. The expression of M3 mAChR functionally coupled to VGCC could have therapeutic implications for SCC, in light of recent demonstrations that cell proliferation can be influenced by activation of neurotransmitter receptors."

The glycoprotein gB-1 of HSV contains a stretch of 69 hydrophobic amino acids near the COOH terminus and a 109-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. By oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, five gB-1 mutants were constructed which either lack a cytoplasmic tail or contained 3, 6, 22, or 43 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail. When expressed in COS cells all of the mutant glycoproteins were synthesized but the rate of intracellular transport and the appearance at the cell surface of the mutant gB-1 protein lacking the cytoplasmic tail or containing 3 and 6 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain was drastically reduced. The wild-type gB-1 as well as all of the mutants in the cytoplasmic tail were, however, located on the nuclear envelope. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein gB may play a role in intracellular transport but not in the nuclear localization."
https://openalex.org/W1491606924,"In this study, we characterized and compared the ligand-independent loss of surface galactosyl (Gal) receptor activity on isolated rat hepatocytes treated with monensin, chloroquine, microtubule depolymerizing agents, or NaN3 and NaF at 37 degrees C. Freshly isolated hepatocytes exhibit predominately one subset of surface Gal receptors, termed State 1 receptors (Weigel, P. H., Clarke, B. L., and Oka, J. A. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 140, 43-50). During equilibration at 37 degrees C, these cells also express a second subset of Gal receptors at the surface, termed State 2 receptors, and routinely double their total surface Gal receptor activity. Following equilibration at 37 degrees C and then inhibitor treatment, hepatocytes bound 40-60% less 125I-asialoorosomucoid (ASOR) at 4 degrees C than did untreated cells. Treated cells maintained a basal nonmodulated level of surface receptor activity regardless of temperature, perturbant concentration, or incubation time. Loss of surface Gal receptor activity on cells treated with multiple inhibitors simultaneously or sequentially was not additive. Thus, all treatments affected the same subpopulation of surface Gal receptors. None of these inhibitors decreased surface State 1 Gal receptor activity, but all prevented the normal appearance of State 2 Gal receptors on freshly isolated cells during incubation at 37 degrees C. The endocytic capability of residual surface State 1 Gal receptors on inhibitor-treated cells varied depending on the inhibitor. Hepatocytes treated first at 24 degrees C or with colchicine at 37 degrees C internalized greater than 85% of surface-bound 125I-ASOR. In contrast, monensin- or chloroquine-treated cells internalized approximately 50% of surface-bound 125I-ASOR. Azide-treated cells internalized less than 20% of surface-bound 125I-ASOR. We conclude that only surface State 2 Gal receptor activity is sensitive to these various perturbants. State 1 Gal receptor activity is not modulated. These data are consistent with the conclusion that only State 2 Gal receptors constitutively recycle."
https://openalex.org/W1502991088,"A cell-free system which reconstitutes early stages of receptor-mediated endocytosis has been developed, based on detection of the association between avidin-beta-galactosidase (Av beta Gal) and biotin-transferrin (B-Tf). Initially, Av beta Gal (a fluid-phase marker) and B-Tf (receptor-bound) are internalized and delivered to a common endosomal compartment in vivo and in vitro. Subsequently, these two probes enter divergent intracellular pathways: Av beta Gal is sorted from the endosome and directed for delivery to lysosomes, whereas B-Tf is segregated away from the fluid-phase marker, remaining bound to the transferrin receptor for return to the cell surface. Using the avidin-biotin association reaction to monitor the co-localization of these two probes, we have been able to reconstruct this sorting and segregation process in a cell-free system. The in vitro reaction is time-, temperature-, and ATP-dependent, and is not affected by NH4Cl; cell-free segregation of the two probes is also sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide. As these characteristics are also properties of in vitro endocytic vesicle fusion, it is likely that the latter event is a prerequisite for the sorting and segregation process. Both the in vivo and in vitro sorting of Av beta Gal and B-Tf to their respective and distinct destinations can be followed by subcellular fractionation on Percoll gradients. Our observations provide the first evidence that the cellular mechanism to identify, sort, and sequester endocytosed material can be reconstituted in a cell-free system."
https://openalex.org/W1507409004,"The ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase (cytochrome bc1 complex) purified from chromatophores of Rhodobacter sphaeroides consists of four polypeptide subunits corresponding to cytochrome b, c1, and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, as well as a 14-kDa polypeptide of unknown function, respectively. In contrast, the complex isolated from Rhodospirillum rubrum by the same procedure lacked a polypeptide corresponding to the 14-kDa subunit. Gel-permeation chromatography of the R. sphaeroides cytochrome bc1 complex in the presence of 200 mM NaCl removed the iron-sulfur protein, while the 14-kDa polypeptide remained tightly bound to the cytochromes; this is consistent with the possibility that the latter protein is an authentic component of the complex rather than an artifact of the isolation procedure. The individual polypeptides of the R. sphaeroides complex were purified to homogeneity by gel-permeation chromatography in the presence of 50% aqueous formic acid and their amino acid compositions determined. The 14-kDa polypeptide was found to be rich in charged and polar residues. Edman degradation analysis indicated that its N terminus is blocked and not rendered accessible by de-blocking procedures. Cyanogen bromide cleavage gave rise to a blocked N-terminal fragment as well as a C-terminal peptide comprising more than one-third of the protein. Gas-phase sequence analysis of this peptide established a sequence of 48 residues and identified a putative trans-membrane segment near the C terminus. The blocked N-terminal fragment was cleaved at tryptophan with BNPS-skatole. The resulting peptides, together with tryptic fragments derived from the intact protein, yielded additional sequence information; however, none of the sequences exhibited significant homologies to any known proteins. Tryptic fragments were also used to generate sequence information for cytochrome c1."

It has been shown in vitro that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is also dephosphorylated by a 5-phosphomonoesterase to inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate. However, we have found that exogenous Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is dephosphorylated to predominantly Ins(1,4,5)P3 in saponin-permeabilized platelets in the presence of KCl (40-160 mM). This inositol polyphosphate 3-phosphomonoesterase activity is independent of Ca2+ (0.1-100 microM), and it was also observed when the ionic strength of the incubation medium was increased with Na+. The action of KCl appears to be due to activation of a 3-phosphomonoesterase as well as an inhibition of the 5-phosphomonoesterase, because the dephosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,4)P2 was completely inhibited by KCl. The 3-phosphomonoesterase may be regulated by a protein kinase C, since both thrombin and phorbol dibutyrate increase 3-phosphomonoesterase activity and this is inhibited by staurosporine. The formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 from Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 reported here provides an additional pathway for the formation of the Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger in stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567185751,"The reactivity of recombinant and tumor-derived preparations of oncomodulin toward 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) (Ellman's reagent) and dansylaziridine was investigated. In contrast to previously published data (Mutus, B., Palmer, E. J., and MacManus, J. P. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 5615-5622), the apoprotein was observed to react far more rapidly than the calcium-bound form with Ellman's reagent. Attempts to quantitatively label the native protein with dansylaziridine met with little success, either with the metal-free or calcium-bound forms. In neither case did the extent of modification approach the level observed with the sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured form of the protein. These results suggest that access to the sulfhydryl group of Cys-18 is severely restricted in the native protein, particularly when the high affinity ion-binding sites are occupied. Consistent with these observations, prolonged incubation of native oncomodulin at room temperature in the absence of reductant did not result in the generation of disulfide-linked dimers, either in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Interestingly, however, Cu2+ ion was observed to facilitate the apparent dimerization of oncomodulin. This reaction, which occurs more rapidly with the Ca2(+)-free form of the protein, affords material with the expected electrophoretic mobility. However, in contrast with the results of Mutus et al., dimeric oncomodulin prepared in this manner fails to stimulate bovine heart cAMP phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1542533975,"The biochemical characteristics of complex formation in nuclear extracts from mock-infected and herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected Vero and HeLa cells with a sequence downstream of and adjacent to the promoter for the HSV thymidine kinase gene were studied using the mobility shift electrophoresis assay. This region is bound by host cell proteins, as evidenced by the formation of complexes after incubation in extracts from mock-infected cells. Unique virus-specific complexes form in extracts prepared from infected cells, and these complexes contain ICP4, the major regulatory protein of HSV. Examination of the salt requirements for assembly and the stability of preformed DNA-protein complexes to added salt demonstrate the distinct nature of the complexes that form in each extract. This finding is supported by analyses of the relative association and dissociation rates of these complexes which show that complexes formed in extracts prepared from infected cells are kinetically labile. After depletion with chelators, the divalent cation requirements for complex formation were assayed by supplementation with various metal salts. Addition of Mn2+ restored binding activity in extracts from both mock-infected and infected HeLa cells. Finally, footprinting assays revealed that sequences on each strand throughout this region of the thymidine kinase gene were involved in complex formation only in extracts from mock-infected cells. These experiments suggest that one consequence of virus gene expression is to alter the interaction of cell proteins with virus DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1585307244,"The effect of rat liver phosphatidylcholine transfer protein on the incorporation of CDP-choline and dioleoylglycerol into phosphatidylcholine catalyzed by rat liver microsomal CDP-choline: 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase was studied. In the presence of phosphatidylcholine transfer protein, the incorporation of CDP-choline into phosphatidylcholine was markedly stimulated. Phosphatidylcholine transfer protein isolated from either rat or bovine liver was capable of this stimulatory effect; in contrast, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein from rat liver had no effect on phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Kinetic analysis showed that microsomal phosphatidylcholine synthesis increased 2.4-fold after 1 min and reached a maximum of approximately 10-fold within 10 min in the presence of phosphatidylcholine transfer protein; in the absence of this protein phosphatidylcholine synthesis stopped after 2-4 min. These results suggest that phosphatidylcholine transfer protein permits phosphatidylcholine synthesis to proceed further. With the addition of phospholipid vesicles, as an acceptor membrane in the reaction mixture, there was a significant amount of protein-mediated transfer of synthesized phosphatidylcholine to the vesicles. Measurable transfer of synthesized phosphatidylcholine to vesicles could only be detected after a lag of 2-4 min. The stimulation of cholinephosphotransferase could be nearly abolished by increasing the amount of added phospholipid vesicles; concurrently, a greater transfer to the vesicles was observed. These results describe a new property of phosphatidylcholine transfer protein which may be of physiological significance in the regulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis in mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1582851991,"Previous studies of the substrate specificity of the purified insulin receptor tyrosine kinase using synthetic random polymers have demonstrated that the receptor kinase phosphorylates poly (Glu, Tyr) 4:1 but not poly (Glu, Tyr) 1:1. In the present study, insulin treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor was found to stimulate the ability of their membrane extracts to phosphorylate poly (Glu, Tyr) 1:1. It was concluded that this activity was due to the receptor itself because: 1) it was precipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the receptor; 2) the addition of various membrane extracts to purified insulin receptor preparations stimulated the ability of these preparations to phosphorylate poly (Glu, Tyr) 1:1; and 3) certain purified proteins, including bovine serum albumin and casein, were also capable of stimulating the purified receptor to phosphorylate poly (Glu, Tyr) 1:1. The effect of albumin was dose-dependent; 0.5 and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin stimulated the phosphorylation of poly (Glu, Tyr) 1:1 by 2- and 230-fold, respectively. In contrast, albumin had no effect on the phosphorylation of poly (Glu, Tyr) 4:1. These results indicate that the activity of the insulin receptor kinase on certain substrates can be modulated by the presence of other proteins."
