https://openalex.org/W2072375792,"Trace element, isotopic, and mineralogic studies indicate that the proposed impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary occurred in an ocean basin, although a minor component of continental material is required. The size and abundance of shocked minerals and the restricted geographic occurrence of the ejecta layer and impact-wave deposits suggest an impact between the Americas. Coarse boundary sediments at sites 151 and 153 in the Colombian Basin and 5- to 450-meter-thick boundary sediments in Cuba may be deposits of a giant wave produced by a nearby oceanic impact. On the southern peninsula of Haiti, a approximately 50-centimeter-thick ejecta layer occurs at the K-T boundary. This ejecta layer is approximately 25 times as thick as that at any known K-T site and suggests an impact site within approximately 1000 kilometers. Seismic reflection profiles suggest that a buried approximately 300-km-diameter candidate structure occurs in the Colombian Basin."
https://openalex.org/W1988082235,"Monochromatic images of Mercury at the sodium D2 emission line showed excess sodium emission in localized regions at high northern and southern latitudes and day-to-day global variations in the distribution of sodium emission. These phenomena support the suggestion that magnetospheric effects could be the cause. Sputtering of surface minerals could produce sodium vapor in polar regions during magnetic substorms, when magnetospheric ions directly impact the surface. Another important process may be the transport of sodium ions along magnetic field lines toward polar regions, where they impact directly on the surface of Mercury and are neutralized to regenerate neutral sodium atoms. Day-to-day variations in planetary sodium distributions could result from changing solar activity, which can change the magnetosphere in time scales of a few hours. Observations of the sodium exosphere may provide a tool for remote monitoring of the magnetosphere of Mercury."
https://openalex.org/W2077514268,"The various products from the reaction of chlorine (Cl) with the adatom layer of the Si(111)-(7x7) surface have been identified with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Initially, a single Cl atom reacts with the adatom dangling bond. At higher surface coverage, additional Cl atoms insert themselves into the Si-Si backbonds between the adatom and rest-atom layers, producing adatoms that have reacted with two or three Cl atoms. These products are characterized by different registries with respect to the underlying rest layer and appear in STM images as adatoms of different sizes, consistent with the breaking of Si-Si backbonds and the formation ofnew Si-Cl bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2130522298,"Monoamines and diamines dissolved in cyclohexane solution reversibly enhance the band-edge photoluminescence (PL) intensity of immersed n-type cadmium sulfide (n-CdS) and n-type cadmium selenide (n-CdSe) substrates through adsorption. The magnitude of the PL increase is used to estimate amine-induced contractions in the semiconductor's depletion width, and the dependence of the PL intensity on amine concentration provides an estimate of the adduct formation constant. Two diamines, ethylenediamine and o-phenylenediamine, exhibit unusually low reductions in depletion width and substantially larger adduct equilibrium constants relative to the other amines studied, consistent with chelation to surface Cd(2+) ions. These studies demonstrate that PL can be used as a contactiess, in situ technique for characterizing the steric and electronic landscape of semiconductor surfaces and for correlating molecular and surface chemistry."

Measurements taken on the missile launch tube indicated the presence of uranium-235 and plutonium-239-the essential ingredients of nuclear weapons. With the use of this equipment, these isotopes probably could have been identified at a distance of 4 meters from the warhead. Such inspections do not reveal detailed information about the design of the warhead."
