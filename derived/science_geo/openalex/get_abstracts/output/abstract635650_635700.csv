https://openalex.org/W2954124338,"Metabolic syndrome is characterized by a constellation of comorbidities that predispose individuals to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular pathologies as well as type 2 diabetes mellitus1. The gut microbiota is a new key contributor involved in the onset of obesity-related disorders2. In humans, studies have provided evidence for a negative correlation between Akkermansia muciniphila abundance and overweight, obesity, untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus or hypertension3–8. Since the administration of A. muciniphila has never been investigated in humans, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in overweight/obese insulin-resistant volunteers; 40 were enrolled and 32 completed the trial. The primary end points were safety, tolerability and metabolic parameters (that is, insulin resistance, circulating lipids, visceral adiposity and body mass). Secondary outcomes were gut barrier function (that is, plasma lipopolysaccharides) and gut microbiota composition. In this single-center study, we demonstrated that daily oral supplementation of 1010 A. muciniphila bacteria either live or pasteurized for three months was safe and well tolerated. Compared to placebo, pasteurized A. muciniphila improved insulin sensitivity (+28.62 ± 7.02%, P = 0.002), and reduced insulinemia (−34.08 ± 7.12%, P = 0.006) and plasma total cholesterol (−8.68 ± 2.38%, P = 0.02). Pasteurized A. muciniphila supplementation slightly decreased body weight (−2.27 ± 0.92 kg, P = 0.091) compared to the placebo group, and fat mass (−1.37 ± 0.82 kg, P = 0.092) and hip circumference (−2.63 ± 1.14 cm, P = 0.091) compared to baseline. After three months of supplementation, A. muciniphila reduced the levels of the relevant blood markers for liver dysfunction and inflammation while the overall gut microbiome structure was unaffected. In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study (clinical trial no. NCT02637115 ) shows that the intervention was safe and well tolerated and that supplementation with A. muciniphila improves several metabolic parameters. Supplementation with Akkermansia muciniphila, a gut microbe previously associated with metabolic health in preclinical models, is safe and well tolerated in humans and may improve metabolic parameters in overweight and obese patients."
https://openalex.org/W3103437717,"Intense, millisecond-duration bursts of radio waves (named fast radio bursts) have been detected from beyond the Milky Way1. Their dispersion measures—which are greater than would be expected if they had propagated only through the interstellar medium of the Milky Way—indicate extragalactic origins and imply contributions from the intergalactic medium and perhaps from other galaxies2. Although several theories exist regarding the sources of these fast radio bursts, their intensities, durations and temporal structures suggest coherent emission from highly magnetized plasma3,4. Two of these bursts have been observed to repeat5,6, and one repeater (FRB 121102) has been localized to the largest star-forming region of a dwarf galaxy at a cosmological redshift of 0.19 (refs. 7–9). However, the host galaxies and distances of the hitherto non-repeating fast radio bursts are yet to be identified. Unlike repeating sources, these events must be observed with an interferometer that has sufficient spatial resolution for arcsecond localization at the time of discovery. Here we report the localization of a fast radio burst (FRB 190523) to a few-arcsecond region containing a single massive galaxy at a redshift of 0.66. This galaxy is different from the host of FRB 121102, as it is a thousand times more massive, with a specific star-formation rate (the star-formation rate divided by the mass) a hundred times smaller. Use of a specially built radio interferometer shows that a non-repeating fast radio burst is localized to a few-arcsecond region containing a single massive galaxy, and is perhaps derived from an old stellar population."
https://openalex.org/W4235119951,"Hedgehog signalling is fundamental to embryonic development and postnatal tissue regeneration1. Aberrant postnatal Hedgehog signalling leads to several malignancies, including basal cell carcinoma and paediatric medulloblastoma2. Hedgehog proteins bind to and inhibit the transmembrane cholesterol transporter Patched-1 (PTCH1), which permits activation of the seven-transmembrane transducer Smoothened (SMO) via a mechanism that is poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure of active mouse SMO bound to both the agonist SAG21k and to an intracellular binding nanobody that stabilizes a physiologically relevant active state. Analogous to other G protein-coupled receptors, the activation of SMO is associated with subtle motions in the extracellular domain, and larger intracellular changes. In contrast to recent models3-5, a cholesterol molecule that is critical for SMO activation is bound deep within the seven-transmembrane pocket. We propose that the inactivation of PTCH1 by Hedgehog allows a transmembrane sterol to access this seven-transmembrane site (potentially through a hydrophobic tunnel), which drives the activation of SMO. These results-combined with signalling studies and molecular dynamics simulations-delineate the structural basis for PTCH1-SMO regulation, and suggest a strategy for overcoming clinical resistance to SMO inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2954968846,"The c-Myc oncogene drives malignant progression and induces robust anabolic and proliferative programmes leading to intrinsic stress. The mechanisms enabling adaptation to MYC-induced stress are not fully understood. Here we reveal an essential role for activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in survival following MYC activation. MYC upregulates ATF4 by activating general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase through uncharged transfer RNAs. Subsequently, ATF4 co-occupies promoter regions of over 30 MYC-target genes, primarily those regulating amino acid and protein synthesis, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), a negative regulator of translation. 4E-BP1 relieves MYC-induced proteotoxic stress and is essential to balance protein synthesis. 4E-BP1 activity is negatively regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of mTORC1 signalling rescues ATF4-deficient cells from MYC-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress. Acute deletion of ATF4 significantly delays MYC-driven tumour progression and increases survival in mouse models. Our results establish ATF4 as a cellular rheostat of MYC activity, which ensures that enhanced translation rates are compatible with survival and tumour progression. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) promotes MYC-driven tumour progression. Tameire et al. identify ATF4 and its target eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) as regulators of MYC-mediated amino acid biosynthesis and protein synthesis, thereby modulating tumour progression and survival in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2954031524,"Most human tumours are heterogeneous, composed of cellular clones with different properties present at variable frequencies. Highly heterogeneous tumours have poor clinical outcomes, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that minor subclones of breast cancer cells expressing IL11 and FIGF (VEGFD) cooperate to promote metastatic progression and generate polyclonal metastases composed of driver and neutral subclones. Expression profiling of the epithelial and stromal compartments of monoclonal and polyclonal primary and metastatic lesions revealed that this cooperation is indirect, mediated through the local and systemic microenvironments. We identified neutrophils as a leukocyte population stimulated by the IL11-expressing minor subclone and showed that the depletion of neutrophils prevents metastatic outgrowth. Single-cell RNA-seq of CD45+ cell populations from primary tumours, blood and lungs demonstrated that IL11 acts on bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, which induce pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic neutrophils. Our results indicate key roles for non-cell-autonomous drivers and minor subclones in metastasis. Janiszewska et al. show that minor subpopulations expressing IL11 and FIGF in breast cancer cells promote metastasis through altering local and systemic tumour microenvironments including neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W2955129730,"Most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) do not produce excess hormones and are therefore considered ‘non-functional’1–3. As clinical behaviors vary widely and distant metastases are eventually lethal2,4, biological classifications might guide treatment. Using enhancer maps to infer gene regulatory programs, we find that non-functional PNETs fall into two major subtypes, with epigenomes and transcriptomes that partially resemble islet α- and β-cells. Transcription factors ARX and PDX1 specify these normal cells, respectively5,6, and 84% of 142 non-functional PNETs expressed one or the other factor, occasionally both. Among 103 cases, distant relapses occurred almost exclusively in patients with ARX+PDX1− tumors and, within this subtype, in cases with alternative lengthening of telomeres. These markedly different outcomes belied similar clinical presentations and histology and, in one cohort, occurred irrespective of MEN1 mutation. This robust molecular stratification provides insight into cell lineage correlates of non-functional PNETs, accurately predicts disease course and can inform postoperative clinical decisions. Epigenetic states reminiscent of the cell of origin define clinically relevant markers for stratification of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2954120469,"Ischemic spinal cord injury (ISCI) results in the motor sensory dysfunction of the limbs below the injury site. In response to the injury, astrocytes develop into neuroprotective astrocytes [(neurotrophic reactive astrocytes (A2s)] to mitigate the damage. MicroRNA (miR)-21 can promote the development of neuroinflammation in previous studies. Our aim was to investigate the effect of miR-21 on its polarization. We used the abdominal aortic occlusion model in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the distribution of A2s in the spinal cord. We used an oxygen glucose deprivation method to model astrocytes ischemia in vitro and tested proliferation, migration, and excitability of A2s using an 5-ethynyl -2'-deoxyuridine kit, wound scratch assay, and calcium-ion probe. After adjustment, we detected the model and target genes of A2s using PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. We demonstrated in vivo that naive astrocytes were transformed into A2s by ischemia. And in vitro miR-21, which can regulate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 pathway, can transform neurotoxic reactive astrocyte into A2. Moreover, we also verified the mechanism of A2s promoting synaptic formation and nerve growth. miR-21 is a switch to regulate the polarization of reactive astrocyte, and it promoted synapsis formation and nerites growth after acute ISCI.-Su, Y., Chen, Z., Du, H., Liu, R., Wang, W., Li, H., Ning, B. Silencing miR-21 induces polarization of astrocytes to the A2 phenotype and improves the formation of synapses by targeting glypican 6 via the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 pathway after acute ischemic spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W2955542032,"mTORC2 plays critical roles in metabolism, cell survival and actin cytoskeletal dynamics through the phosphorylation of AKT. Despite its importance to biology and medicine, it is unclear how mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation is controlled. Here, we identify an unforeseen principle by which a GDP-bound form of the conserved small G protein Rho GTPase directly activates mTORC2 in AKT phosphorylation in social amoebae (Dictyostelium discoideum) cells. Using biochemical reconstitution with purified proteins, we demonstrate that Rho–GDP promotes AKT phosphorylation by assembling a supercomplex with Ras–GTP and mTORC2. This supercomplex formation is controlled by the chemoattractant-induced phosphorylation of Rho–GDP at S192 by GSK-3. Furthermore, Rho–GDP rescues defects in both mTORC2-mediated AKT phosphorylation and directed cell migration in Rho-null cells in a manner dependent on phosphorylation of S192. Thus, in contrast to the prevailing view that the GDP-bound forms of G proteins are inactive, our study reveals that mTORC2–AKT signalling is activated by Rho–GDP. Senoo et al. show that, in response to chemoattractant stimulation, phosphorylated Rho–GDP in complex with Ras–GTP and mTORC2 promotes AKT phosphorylation to mediate cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2954469510,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β)-induced fibrotic and inflammatory genes in renal mesangial cells (MCs) play important roles in glomerular dysfunction associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN). TGF-β regulates gene expression in MCs by altering key chromatin histone modifications at target gene promoters. However, the role of the repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) modification is unclear. Here we show that TGF-β reduces H3K27me3 at the Ctgf, Serpine1, and Ccl2 gene promoters in rat MCs (RMCs) and reciprocally up-regulates the expression of these pro-fibrotic and inflammatory genes. In parallel, TGF-β down-regulates Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), an H3K27me3 methyltransferase, and decreases its recruitment at Ctgf and Ccl2 but not Serpine1 promoters. Ezh2 knockdown with siRNAs enhances TGF-β–induced expression of these genes, supporting its repressive function. Mechanistically, Ezh2 down-regulation is mediated by TGF-β–induced microRNA, miR-101b, which targets Ezh2 3′-UTR. TGF-β also up-regulates Jmjd3 and Utx in RMCs, suggesting a key role for these H3K27me3 demethylases in H3K27me3 inhibition. In RMCs, Utx knockdown inhibits hypertrophy, a key event in glomerular dysfunction. The H3K27me3 regulators are similarly altered in human and mouse MCs. High glucose inhibits Ezh2 and increases miR-101b in a TGF-β–dependent manner. Furthermore, in kidneys from rodent models of DN, fibrotic genes, miR-101b, and H3K27me3 demethylases are up-regulated, whereas Ezh2 protein levels as well as enrichment of Ezh2 and H3K27me3 at target genes are decreased, demonstrating in vivo relevance. These results suggest that H3K27me3 inhibition by TGF-β via dysregulation of related histone-modifying enzymes and miRNAs augments pathological genes mediating glomerular mesangial dysfunction and DN.

https://openalex.org/W2953775435,"Transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A) is a widely expressed Ca2+-activated Cl− channel with various physiological functions ranging from mucosal secretion to regulating smooth muscle contraction. Understanding how TMEM16A controls these physiological processes and how its dysregulation may cause disease requires a detailed understanding of how cellular processes and second messengers alter TMEM16A channel gating. Here we assessed the regulation of TMEM16A gating by recording Ca2+-evoked Cl− currents conducted by endogenous TMEM16A channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, using the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique. During continuous application of Ca2+, we found that TMEM16A-conducted currents decay shortly after patch excision. Such current rundown is common among channels regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Thus, we sought to investigate a possible role of PIP2 in TMEM16A gating. Consistently, synthetic PIP2 rescued the current after rundown, and the application of PIP2 modulating agents altered the speed kinetics of TMEM16A current rundown. First, two PIP2 sequestering agents, neomycin and anti-PIP2, applied to the intracellular surface of excised patches sped up TMEM16A current rundown to nearly twice as fast. Conversely, rephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) derivatives into PIP2 using Mg-ATP or inhibiting dephosphorylation of PIP2 using β-glycerophosphate slowed rundown by nearly 3-fold. Our results reveal that TMEM16A regulation is more complicated than it initially appeared; not only is Ca2+ necessary to signal TMEM16a opening, but PIP2 is also required. These findings improve our understanding of how the dysregulation of these pathways may lead to disease and suggest that targeting these pathways could have utility for potential therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2954256798,"Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is recognized as a pivotal factor in DNA replication, long-patch excision repair, and telomere maintenance. Excessive FEN1 expression has been reported to be closely associated with cancer progression, but the specific mechanism has not yet been explored. In the present study, we demonstrated that FEN1 promoted breast cancer cell proliferation via an epigenetic mechanism of FEN1-mediated up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 and DNMT3a. FEN1 was proved to interact with DNMT3a through proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to suppress microRNA (miR)-200a-5p expression mediated by methylation. Furthermore, miR-200a-5p was identified to repress breast cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting the expression of its target genes, hepatocyte growth factor (MET), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Overall, our data surprisingly demonstrate that FEN1 promotes breast cancer cell growth via the formation of FEN1/PCNA/DNMT3a complex to inhibit miR-200a expression by DNMT-mediated methylation and to recover the target genes expression of miR-200a, MET, and EGFR. The novel epigenetic mechanism of FEN1 on proliferation promotion provides a significant clue that FEN1 might serve as a predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for breast cancer.-Zeng, X., Qu, X., Zhao, C., Xu, L., Hou, K., Liu, Y., Zhang, N., Feng, J., Shi, S., Zhang, L., Xiao, J., Guo, Z., Teng, Y., Che, X.

https://openalex.org/W2953451547,"Background Truenat is a novel molecular assay that rapidly detects tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin-resistance. Due to the portability of its battery-powered testing platform, it may be valuable in peripheral healthcare settings in India. Methods Using a microsimulation model, we compared four TB diagnostic strategies for HIV-negative adults with presumptive TB: (1) sputum smear microscopy in designated microscopy centers (DMCs) (SSM); (2) Xpert MTB/RIF in DMCs (Xpert); (3) Truenat in DMCs (Truenat DMC); and (4) Truenat for point-of-care testing in primary healthcare facilities (Truenat POC). We projected life expectancy, costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and 5-year budget impact of deploying Truenat POC in India’s public sector. We defined a strategy “cost-effective” if its ICER was <US$990/year-of-life saved (YLS). Model inputs included: TB prevalence, 15% (among those not previously treated for TB) and 27% (among those previously treated for TB); sensitivity for TB detection, 89% (Xpert) and 86% (Truenat); per test cost, $12.63 (Xpert) and $13.20 (Truenat); and linkage-to-care after diagnosis, 84% (DMC) and 95% (POC). We varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. Results Compared to SSM, Truenat POC increased life expectancy by 0.39 years and was cost-effective (ICER $210/YLS). Compared to Xpert, Truenat POC increased life expectancy by 0.08 years due to improved linkage-to-care and was cost-effective (ICER $120/YLS). In sensitivity analysis, the cost-effectiveness of Truenat POC, relative to Xpert, depended on the diagnostic sensitivity of Truenat and linkage-to-care with Truenat. Deploying Truenat POC instead of Xpert increased 5-year expenditures by $270 million, due mostly to treatment costs. Limitations of our study include uncertainty in Truenat’s sensitivity for TB and not accounting for the “start-up” costs of implementing Truenat in the field. Conclusions Used at the point-of-care in India, Truenat for TB diagnosis should improve linkage-to-care, increase life expectancy, and be cost-effective compared with smear microscopy or Xpert."

Gain–of–function mutations in the human TRPC6 channel cause autosomal-dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, but the molecular components involved in disease development remain unclear. Here, we found that overexpression of gain–of–function TRPC6 channel variants is cytotoxic in cultured cells. Exploiting this phenotype in a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas screen for genes whose inactivation rescues cells from TRPC6-associated cytotoxicity, we identified several proteins essential for TRPC6 protein expression, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex transmembrane insertase. We also identified transmembrane protein 208 (TMEM208), a putative component of a signal recognition particle-independent (SND) ER protein-targeting pathway, as being necessary for expression of TRPC6 and several other ion channels and transporters. TRPC6 expression was also diminished by loss of the previously uncharacterized WD repeat domain 83 opposite strand (WDR83OS), which interacted with both TRPC6 and TMEM208. Additionally enriched among the screen hits were genes involved in N-linked protein glycosylation. Deletion of the mannosyl (α-1,3-)-glycoprotein β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1), necessary for the generation of complex N-linked glycans, abrogated TRPC6 gain–of–function variant-mediated Ca2+ influx and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation in HEK cells, but failed to diminish cytotoxicity in cultured podocytes. However, mutating the two TRPC6 N-glycosylation sites abrogated the cytotoxicity of mutant TRPC6 and reduced its surface expression.

https://openalex.org/W2955024496,"Preoperative physical exercise is emerging as a growing field of research globally. There are still challenges in recruiting vulnerable older people, and time constraints in preoperative cancer care to consider. We therefore evaluated the feasibility of short-term supervised home-based exercise in older people prior to colorectal cancer surgery. This feasibility study was conducted between September 2016 and June 2018. People ≥70 years scheduled for colorectal cancer surgery were recruited and randomized to an intervention group receiving supervised home-based physical exercise at a high level of estimated exertion or a standard care group following the standard preoperative path. The exercise (respiratory, strength, and aerobic) consisted of 2-3 supervised sessions a week in the participants' homes, for at least 2-3 weeks or until surgery, and a self-administered exercise program in between. The primary outcome was process feasibility, including aspects specifically related to recruitment rate, compliance to the intervention, and acceptability. The secondary outcome was scientific feasibility including treatment safety, description of dose level and response, and estimation of treatment results. Twenty-three participants were included (recruitment rate 35%). A median of 6 supervised sessions was conducted over a 17-day exercise period. Compliance with the supervised sessions was 97%, and participants found the intervention acceptable. Concerning the self-administered exercise, a median of 19 inspiratory muscle training, 6 functional strength, and 8.5 aerobic sessions were reported. Challenges reported by program instructors were time constraints and difficulties in achieving high exercise intensities on the Borg CR-10 scale. A statistically significant between-group difference was only found in inspiratory muscle strength, favoring the intervention group (p<0.01). A short-term preoperative supervised home-based physical exercise intervention can be conducted, with respect to compliance and acceptability, in older people with similar physical status as in this study prior to colorectal cancer surgery. However, modifications are warranted with respect to improving recruitment rates and achieving planned intensity levels prior to conducting a definitive trial."
https://openalex.org/W2955145478,"Metabolic programming of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) could influence the function of progenitor osteoblasts or adipocytes and hence determine skeletal phenotypes. Adipocytes predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation, whereas osteoblasts use glycolysis to meet ATP demand. Here, we compared progenitor differentiation from the marrow of two inbred mouse strains, C3H/HeJ (C3H) and C57BL6J (B6). These strains differ in both skeletal mass and bone marrow adiposity. We hypothesized that genetic regulation of metabolic programs controls skeletal stem cell fate. Our experiments identified Bcl-2–like protein 13 (Bcl2l13), a mitochondrial mitophagy receptor, as being critical for adipogenic differentiation. We also found that Bcl2l13 is differentially expressed in the two mouse strains, with C3H adipocyte progenitor differentiation being accompanied by a >2-fold increase in Bcl2l13 levels relative to B6 marrow adipocytes. Bcl2l13 expression also increased during adipogenic differentiation in mouse ear mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs) and the murine preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1. The higher Bcl2l13 expression correlated with increased mitochondrial fusion and biogenesis. Importantly, Bcl2l13 knockdown significantly impaired adipocyte differentiation in both 3T3-L1 cells and eMSCs. Mechanistically, Bcl2l13 knockdown reprogrammed cells to rely more on glycolysis to meet ATP demand in the face of impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Bcl2l13 knockdown in eMSCs increased mitophagy. Moreover, Bcl2l13 prevented apoptosis during adipogenesis. Our findings indicate that the mitochondrial receptor Bcl2l13 promotes adipogenesis by increasing oxidative phosphorylation, suppressing apoptosis, and providing mitochondrial quality control through mitophagy. We conclude that genetic programming of metabolism may be important for lineage determination and cell function within the bone marrow."

https://openalex.org/W2955072467,"Two long-term potentially oil exposed Baltic Sea coastal sites near old oil refineries and harbours were compared to nearby less exposed sites in terms of bacterial, archaeal and fungal microbiomes and oil degradation potential. The bacterial, archaeal and fungal diversities were similar in oil exposed and less exposed sampling sites based on bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene and fungal 5.8S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from both DNA and RNA fractions. The number of genes participating in alkane degradation (alkB) or PAH-ring hydroxylation (PAH–RHDα) were detected by qPCR in all water and sediment samples. These numbers correlated with the number of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies in sediment samples but not with the concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons or PAHs. This indicates that both the clean and the more polluted sites at the Baltic Sea coastal areas have a potential for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation. The active community (based on RNA) of the coastal Baltic Sea water differed largely from the total community (based on DNA). The most noticeable difference was seen in the bacterial community in the water samples were the active community was dominated by Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria whereas in total bacterial community Actinobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The abundance, richness and diversity of Fungi present in water and sediment samples was in general lower than that of Bacteria and Archaea. Furthermore, the sampling location influenced the fungal community composition, whereas the bacterial and archaeal communities were not influenced. This may indicate that the fungal species that are adapted to the Baltic Sea environments are few and that Fungi are potentially more vulnerable to or affected by the Baltic Sea conditions than Bacteria and Archaea."

We developed a qPCR assay to detect two species of watersnake (Nerodia fasciata and Nerodia sipedon) introduced to California, USA, and we compared the efficacy of eDNA and aquatic trapping. We tested 3–9 water samples each from 30 sites near the known range of N. fasciata, and 61 sites near the known range of N. sipedon. We also deployed aquatic funnel traps at a subset of sites for each species. We detected N. fasciata eDNA in three of nine water samples from just one site, but captured N. fasciata in traps at three of ten sites. We detected N. sipedon eDNA in five of six water samples from one site, which was also the only site of nine at which this species was captured in traps. Traditional trapping surveys had a higher probability of detecting watersnakes than eDNA surveys, and both survey methods had higher detection probability for N. sipedon than N. fasciata. Occupancy models that integrated both trapping and eDNA surveys estimated that 5 sites (95% Credible Interval: 4–10) of 91 were occupied by watersnakes (both species combined), although snakes were only detected at four sites (three for N. fasciata, one for N. sipedon). Our study shows that despite the many successes of eDNA surveys, traditional sampling methods can have higher detection probability for some species. We recommend those tasked with managing species invasions explicitly compare eDNA and traditional survey methods in an occupancy framework to inform their choice of the best method for detecting nascent populations."
https://openalex.org/W2955057666,"Increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell mass and secretory functions are characteristics of airway inflammatory diseases, such as asthma. To date, there are no effective therapies to combat ASM cell proliferation, which contributes to bronchoconstriction and airway obstruction. Growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and the activation of the ERK1/2 are major regulators of ASM cell proliferation and airway remodeling in asthma. However, given the ubiquitous expression and multiple functions of ERK1/2, complete inhibition of ERK1/2 using ATP-competitive inhibitors may lead to unwanted off-target effects. Alternatively, we have identified compounds that are designed to target substrate docking sites and act as function-selective inhibitors of ERK1/2 signaling. Here, we show that both function-selective and ATP-competitive ERK1/2 inhibitors are effective at inhibiting PDGF-mediated proliferation, collagen production, and IL-6 secretion in ASM cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that both types of inhibitors had similar effects on reducing proteins related to TGF-β and IL-6 signaling that are relevant to airway remodeling. However, function-selective ERK1/2 inhibitors caused fewer changes in protein expression compared with ATP-competitive inhibitors. These studies provide a molecular basis for the development of function-selective ERK1/2 inhibitors to mitigate airway remodeling in asthma with defined regulation of ERK1/2 signaling.-Defnet, A.

This reduction is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a heterodimeric tetramer enzyme in mammalian cells, having one of two free radical-containing subunits called R2 and p53R2. R2 is S-phase specific and used for DNA replication, whereas p53R2 functions in DNA repair and mitochondrial DNA synthesis. The larger RNR subunit, R1, has catalytically active cysteine thiols in its buried active site and a C-terminal swinging arm, with a Cys-Leu-Met-Cys sequence suggested to act as a shuttle dithiol/disulfide for electron transport. After each catalytic cycle the active site contains a disulfide, which has to be reduced for turnover. Thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx) systems have been implicated as electron donors for the RNR disulfide reduction via the swinging arm. Using mouse R1–R2 and R1–p53R2 complexes, we found here that the catalytic efficiency of the GSH-Grx system is 4–6 times higher than that of the Trx1 system. For both complexes, the Vmax values for Grx are strongly depended on GSH concentrations. The GSH disulfide resulting from the Grx reaction was reduced by NADPH and GSH reductase and this enzyme was essential because reaction with GSH alone yielded only little activity. These results indicate that C-terminal shuttle dithiols of mammalian R1 have a crucial catalytic role and that the GSH-Grx system favors the R1–p53R2 enzyme for DNA replication in hypoxic conditions, mitochondrial DNA synthesis, and in DNA repair outside the S-phase.

https://openalex.org/W2955814015,"Background Strong primary health care (PHC) is essential for achieving universal health coverage, but in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) PHC services are of poor quality. Facility management is hypothesized to be critical for improving PHC performance, but evidence about management performance and its associations with PHC in LMICs remains limited. Methods We quantified management performance of PHC facilities in Ghana and assessed the experiences of women who sought care at sampled facilities. Using multi-level models, we examined associations of facility management with five process outcomes and eight experiential outcomes. Findings On a scale of 0 to 1, the average overall management score in Ghana was 0·76 (IQR = 0·68–0·85). Facility management was significantly associated with one process outcome and three experiential outcomes. Controlling for facility characteristics, facilities with management scores at the 90th percentile (management score = 0·90) had 22% more essential drugs compared to facilities with management scores at the 10th percentile (0·60) (p = 0·002). Positive statistically non-significant associations were also seen with three additional process outcomes—integration of family planning services (p = 0·054), family planning types provided (p = 0·067), and essential equipment availability (p = 0·104). Compared to women who sought care at facilities with management scores at the 10th percentile, women who sought care at facilities at the 90th percentile reported 8% higher ratings of trust in providers (p = 0·028), 15% higher ratings of ease of following provider’s advice (p = 0·030), and 16% higher quality rating (p = 0·020). However, women who sought care in the 90th percentile facilities rated their waiting times as worse (22% lower, p = 0·039). Interpretation Higher management scores were associated with higher scores for some process and experiential outcomes. Large variations in management performance indicate the need to strengthen management practices to help realize the full potential of PHC in improving health outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W2955993694,"Background Assessment of KRAS, NRAS (RAS) and BRAF mutations is a standard in the management of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Mutations could be assessed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) or real-time PCR-based assays. Times to results are 1 to 2 weeks for NGS and 1 to 3 days for real-time PCR-based assays. Using NGS can delay first-line treatment commencement and using PCR-based assays is limited by the number of possible analysed targets. The Idylla system is a real-time PCR cartridge-based assay, able to analyse hotspots mutations using one section of FFPE tumour tissue sample. To combine short delays and analysis of a large gene-panel, we propose here a laboratory workflow combining the Idylla system and NGS and compatible with FFPE samples with low tissue quantity. In this study we evaluated and validated the Idylla system for the analysis of RAS and BRAF mutations by pipetting directly DNA in the cartridge instead of FFPE section as recommended by the manufacturer. Materials and methods DNA extracted from 29 FFPE samples from mCRC patients with NGS-characterized RAS and BRAF mutations were tested with the Idylla KRAS and the Idylla NRAS-BRAF mutation tests to assess sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and limit of detection of each test. Results A 100% concordance was found between NGS and Idylla results for the determination of KRAS (12/12), NRAS (12/12) and BRAF (11/11) mutations with a sensitivity and a specificity of 100%. The system showed a good reproducibility with CV inferior to 3%. LOD was reached with 2.5 ng of DNA for KRAS and NRAS mutations and 5 ng of DNA for BRAF mutations. Conclusions The analysis of RAS and BRAF mutations using DNA pipetted directly in the cartridge of the Idylla system showed a good sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and LOD, and can be integrated in a laboratory workflow for samples with few tissue without compromising a further complete tumour characterization using NGS."
https://openalex.org/W2954832181,"Objectives One of the mechanisms of early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) after AF ablation is considered to be the inflammatory reaction of the atrial tissue. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical significance of ERAF at each stage for true AF recurrence between cryoballoon (CB) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation. Methods Among 798 paroxysmal AF patients who underwent an initial ablation, 460 patients (CB, n = 230; RF, n = 230) were selected by propensity score matching. Very ERAF (VERAF), ERAF-1M, ERAF-3M and true AF recurrence were defined as AF recurrence at 0–2, 3–30, 31–90 days and more than 90 days after the procedure, respectively. Results The patient characteristics of the two groups were similar. ERAF was observed 21% and 27% in the CB and RF groups, respectively. In both the CB and RF group, VERAF, ERAF-1M and ERAF-3M were more frequently observed in patients with true AF recurrence than in those without. In a multivariable analysis, ERAF-1M and ERAF-3M were found to be independent predictors of true AF recurrence in both the CB (P = 0.04 and P<0.001, respectively) and RF groups (P = 0.02 and P = 0.001, respectively). However, while VERAF was associated with true AF recurrence after RF ablation (P = 0.03), it was not associated with true AF recurrence after CB ablation (P = 0.19). Conclusion The relationship between ERAF and true AF recurrence differed between the RF and CB ablation groups. While VERAF was associated with true AF recurrence after RF ablation, it was not a predictor of true AF recurrence after CB ablation."
https://openalex.org/W3012773209,"An important aspect of the interaction between the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae and its human host is its ability to harvest host glycans. The pneumococcus can degrade a variety of complex glycans, including N- and O-linked glycans, glycosaminoglycans, and carbohydrate antigens, an ability that is tightly linked to the virulence of S. pneumoniae. Although S. pneumoniae is known to use a sophisticated enzyme machinery to attack the human glycome, how it copes with fucosylated glycans, which are primarily histo-blood group antigens, is largely unknown. Here, we identified two pneumococcal enzymes, SpGH29C and SpGH95C, that target α-(1→3/4) and α-(1→2) fucosidic linkages, respectively. X-ray crystallography studies combined with functional assays revealed that SpGH29C is specific for the LewisA and LewisX antigen motifs and that SpGH95C is specific for the H(O)-antigen motif. Together, these enzymes could defucosylate LewisY and LewisB antigens in a complementary fashion. In vitro reconstruction of glycan degradation cascades disclosed that the individual or combined activities of these enzymes expose the underlying glycan structure, promoting the complete deconstruction of a glycan that would otherwise be resistant to pneumococcal enzymes. These experiments expand our understanding of the extensive capacity of S. pneumoniae to process host glycans and the likely roles of α-fucosidases in this. Overall, given the importance of enzymes that initiate glycan breakdown in pneumococcal virulence, such as the neuraminidase NanA and the mannosidase SpGH92, we anticipate that the α-fucosidases identified here will be important factors in developing more refined models of the S. pneumoniae–host interaction."

Because ERK1/2 plays an important role in regulating thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generation in platelets, we investigated the function of PTPN7 in these cells. Using immunoblot analysis, we detected PTPN7 in both human and mouse platelets but not in PTPN7-null mice. PTPN7 KO mouse platelets exhibited increased platelet functional responses, including aggregation, dense granule secretion, and TXA2 generation, compared with platelets from WT littermates, upon stimulation with both G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) and glycoprotein VI (GPVI) agonists. Using the GPCR agonist AYPGKF in the presence of the COX inhibitor indomethacin, we found that PTPN7 KO mouse platelets aggregated and secreted to the same extent as WT platelets, suggesting that elevated TXA2 is responsible for the potentiation of platelet functional responses in PTPN7-KO platelets. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was also elevated in PTPN7 KO platelets. Stimulation of platelets with the GPVI agonist collagen-related peptide along with the COX inhibitor indomethacin did not result in phosphorylation of ERK1/2, indicating that GPVI-mediated ERK phosphorylation occurs through TXA2.

Very little is known about ERK regulation in platelets via protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). In lymphocytes, ERK activation is regulated by a PTP known as PTPN7. Thus, we wanted to evaluate the role of PTPN7 in the regulation of ERK in platelets. PTPN7 (alternatively called hematopoietic PTP) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase originally cloned from human T lymphocytes (13Zanke B. Suzuki H. Kishihara K. Mizzen L. Minden M.

To assess the presence of PTPN7 in platelets, we used an antibody that recognizes the N terminus of PTPN7. In Western blot analysis using platelet lysates, we observed that PTPN7 is present as a 38-kDa protein in WT mouse and human platelets but not expressed in PTPN7 KO platelets (Fig. 1). Thus, we conclude that PTPN7 is expressed in platelets. Because we demonstrated the presence of PTPN7 in platelets, we evaluated the role of PTPN7 in platelet functional responses using PTPN7 KO mice. However, prior to that analysis, we measured blood cell counts in PTPN7 and WT mice and found that PTPN7 deletion did not alter blood cell counts (Table 1). Platelets have two important classes of receptors: ITAM-based receptors, such as GPVI receptors, and GPCRs, such as PARs and ADP receptors (1Li Z. Delaney M.K. O'Brien K.A. Du X. Signaling during platelet adhesion and activation.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30 (21071698): 2341-234910.1161/ATVBAHA.110.207522Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of WT and PTPN7 KO platelets with lower concentrations of the PAR4 agonist AYPGKF, the ADP receptor agonist 2-MesADP, or the GPVI receptor agonist CRP, the extent of aggregation and the amount of ATP secretion were significantly greater in PTPN7 KO mouse platelets compared with platelets from the WT littermates (Fig. 2). PTPN7 KO mouse platelets that were stimulated with higher concentrations of AYPGKF, 2-MesADP, or CRP showed higher dense granule secretion compared with the WT, although the extent of aggregation was similar (Fig. 2). These data suggest that PTPN7 plays an important role in regulating platelet functional responses, such as aggregation and secretion, in platelets.Table 1Blood cell counts are unaltered in PTPN7 knockout miceParameterPTPN7+/+PTPN7−/−WBC (103/μl)7.18 ± 0.556.19 ± 0.62LY (103/μl)6.08 ± 0.515.11 ± 0.65NE (103/μl)0.69 ± 0.040.67 ± 0.04MO (103/μl)0.55 ± 0.130.40 ± 0.04RBC (106/μl)9.37 ± 0.3010.12 ± 0.07PLT (103/μl)721 ± 44806 ± 24MPV (fl)4.10 ± 0.074.18 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab To confirm whether the enhanced platelet aggregation and secretion in PTPN7 KO mouse platelets were due to enhanced TXA2 generation, both WT and PTPN7 KO mouse platelets were stimulated with an agonist, and the TXA2 levels were measured using a Thromboxane B2 (TXB2) (a stable analog of TXA2) assay, a competitive immunoassay. PTPN7 KO mouse platelets showed a significant increase in TXB2 levels compared with WT samples when stimulated with all agonists (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we conclude that TXA2 generation is potentiated in PTPN7 KO platelets. We also performed flow cytometry to examine p-selectin expression and active GPIIb/IIIa expression (JON/A binding) on WT and PTPN7 KO platelets. Stimulation with 200 μm AYPGKF resulted in enhanced p-selectin expression and JON/A binding (Fig. 3, B and C). Stimulation with 1 μg/ml CRP caused no significant change in p-selectin expression or JON/A binding, although the trend mirrored that of AYPGKF. Because the aggregation and secretion responses were potentiated in PTPN7 KO mice, we evaluated whether the potentiation was due to enhanced TXA2 generation. For this purpose, we pretreated WT and PTPN7 KO mouse platelets with 10 μm indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor that inhibits TXA2 generation, followed by stimulation with AYPGKF or CRP. We observed that the extent of aggregation and the amount of dense granule secretion in PTPN7 KO mice were the same as in the WT when the platelets were pretreated with indomethacin (Fig. 4). This result suggests that the potentiation of aggregation and secretion is due to enhanced TXA2 generation. Because ERK has been known to be regulated by PTPN7 in lymphocytes (15Gronda M. Arab S. Iafrate B. Suzuki H. Zanke B.W. Hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase suppresses extracellular stimulus-regulated kinase activation.Mol. Cell.

ERK was found to be hyper-phosphorylated in PTPN7 KO mouse platelets upon AYPGKF stimulation that were pre-treated with or without indomethacin (Fig. 5A). PTPN7 KO platelets stimulated with CRP also showed hyper-phosphorylation of ERK. However, in the presence of indomethacin, both WT and PTPN7 KO stimulated with 5 μg/ml of CRP showed no ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that ERK phosphorylation occurs downstream of GPVI only by the action of feedback agonists, consistent with the previous observations (20Roger S. Pawlowski M. Habib A. Jandrot-Perrus M. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. Costimulation of the Gi-coupled ADP receptor and the Gq-coupled TXA2 receptor is required for ERK2 activation in collagen-induced platelet aggregation.FEBS Lett. 2004; 556 (14706855): 227-23510.1016/S0014-5793(03)01430-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, based on the aggregation results in the presence of indomethacin, we conclude that GPVI effects are not directly regulated by PTPN7. PTPN7 is also known to regulate p38 MAPK in B-lymphocytes (19McAlees J.W. Sanders V.M. Hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase mediates β2-adrenergic receptor-induced regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in B lymphocytes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29 (19047375): 675-68610.1128/MCB.01466-08Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because platelets express both ERK and p38 MAPK, we evaluated the role of PTPN7 in p38 regulation. We observed that p38 MAPK is phosphorylated to the same extent in both WT and PTPN7 KO mouse platelets (Fig. 6, C and D). Because MEK is upstream of ERK in PAR signaling (21Nadal-Wollbold F.

Platelet ERK2 activation by thrombin is dependent on calcium and conventional protein kinases C but not Raf-1 or B-Raf.FEBS Lett. 2002; 531 (12435596): 475-48210.1016/S0014-5793(02)03587-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Tulasne D.

We observed that the activity of MEK was the same in PAR-activated WT and PTPN7 KO platelets (Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, we conclude that PTPN7 selectively regulates ERK in platelets without regulating its upstream kinase MEK. Because we observed potentiation of platelet functional responses with GPCR and GPVI agonists in PTPN7 KO mouse platelets, we evaluated the implications of PTPN7 deficiency in vivo. We evaluated hemostatic function by measuring bleeding times in WT and PTPN7 KO mice. Bleeding times were measured as the time for blood flow to stop after cutting 3 mm of the mouse tail. We observed that there were no significant differences in the average bleeding times between WT and PTPN7 KO mice (Fig. 7A). Finally, we evaluated in vivo thrombosis using a pulmonary embolism model. In this model, collagen and epinephrine are injected i.v., which causes pulmonary embolism. We observed that time to cessation of respiration was significantly lower in the PTPN7 KO mice compared with the WT (Fig. 7B). Thus, we conclude that platelet responses are potentiated in vivo in PTPN7-null mice. PTPN7 KO mice have been used previously to characterize the role of PTPN7 in T cell signaling (15Gronda M. Arab S. Iafrate B. Suzuki H. Zanke B.W. Hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase suppresses extracellular stimulus-regulated kinase activation.Mol. Cell.

T cells show enhanced ERK activation in PTPN7 KO mice, indicating that PTPN7 is a negative regulator of T-cell receptor-induced T cell activation. Similarly, ERK is hyperphosphorylated in K562 myelogenous leukemia cells undergoing megakaryocytic differentiation when subjected to inhibition by antisense for PTPN7 (23Pettiford S.M. Herbst R. The protein tyrosine phosphatase HePTP regulates nuclear translocation of ERK2 and can modulate megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells.Leukemia. 2003; 17 (12592337): 366-37810.1038/sj.leu.2402767Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In B cells, PTPN7 negatively regulates p38 MAPK activation (19McAlees J.W. Sanders V.M.

Based on these previous studies, we evaluated the role of PTPN7 as a regulator of MAPK activation in platelets using PTPN7 KO mice. Platelets express MAPKs such as ERK1/2 (24Papkoff J. Chen R.H.

ERK is hyperphosphorylated downstream of PAR activation in PTPN7 KO mouse platelets. As a result, there is enhanced TXA2 generation in PTPN7 KO mouse platelets. Previous studies showed that ERK phosphorylation downstream of the GPVI receptor is solely dependent on feedback signaling by TXA2 and ADP (20Roger S. Pawlowski M. Habib A. Jandrot-Perrus M. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M. Costimulation of the Gi-coupled ADP receptor and the Gq-coupled TXA2 receptor is required for ERK2 activation in collagen-induced platelet aggregation.FEBS Lett. 2004; 556 (14706855): 227-23510.1016/S0014-5793(03)01430-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Roger et al. (20Roger S. Pawlowski M. Habib A. Jandrot-Perrus M. Rosa J.P. Bryckaert M.

Our studies show that ERK is hyperphosphorylated downstream of GPVI receptor activation in PTPN7 KO mouse platelets; however, in the presence of indomethacin, ERK phosphorylation is abolished in both WT and PTPN7 KO platelets stimulated with CRP. Thus, our data are in sync with previously published results. Therefore, potentiation of ERK phosphorylation in PTPN7 KO mouse platelets downstream of the GPVI receptor is due to enhanced TXA2 generation in PTPN7 KO platelets. When TXA2 production is blocked by indomethacin, the extent of PAR-mediated aggregation and secretion in PTPN7 KO mice is similar to the WT. Under these conditions, ERK phosphorylation is greatly inhibited in both WT and PTPN7 KO mice. This shows that TXA2 generated upon activation of PARs feeds back on platelets and contributes to ERK phosphorylation via secondary signaling. However, even in the presence of indomethacin, ERK remains hyperphosphorylated in PTPN7 KO platelets downstream of PARs. These data suggest that PTPN7 KO mouse platelets show enhanced ERK phosphorylation in PAR primary signaling. Therefore, PTPN7 KO mouse platelets also show enhanced TXA2 generation. Similarly, the GPVI-mediated aggregation and secretion responses are normalized in indomethacin-treated PTPN7 KO mouse platelets. Therefore, we conclude that the potentiation of aggregation and secretion in PTPN7 KO platelets is due to enhanced secondary stimulation by TXA2. Apart from ERK, platelets also express p38 MAPK, which is activated downstream of thrombin (25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Johnstone E.M.

Several studies have suggested that p38 MAPK is essential for cPLA2 activation and TXA2 generation (25Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Johnstone E.M. Thrombin induces activation of p38 MAP kinase in human platelets.J. Biol.

Mohanlal R. Covic L. Effect of selective inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase pathway on platelet aggregation.Thromb.

This study demonstrates that p38 MAPK phosphorylation is comparable in WT and PTPN7 KO platelets upon PAR and GPVI receptor stimulation. These data suggest that PTPN7 selectively regulates ERK activation in platelets. Last, we evaluated the physiological implications of PTPN7 deficiency in mice. We used a pulmonary embolism model, which involves direct activation of platelets in vivo by injecting collagen and epinephrine into mice, to evaluate in vivo thrombosis. Our results indicate that PTPN7 KO mice were more resistant to pulmonary thromboembolism than controls. Intriguingly, PTPN7 KO mice showed normal tail bleeding times. Therefore, based on the pulmonary embolism model, we concluded that PTPN7 plays a significant role in in vivo thrombosis; however, PTPN7 is dispensable for primary hemostasis, as indicated by tail bleeding. In conclusion, we have established that PTPN7 negatively regulates ERK activation and, thereby, TXA2 generation in platelets.

Platelet lysates originating from human donors were used for identification of PTPN7. Experiments involving human donors were approved by the Temple University institutional review board. All studies involving human subjects abided by the Declaration of Helsinki principles. PTPN7 knockout mice were obtained from the Riken Research Institute (Japan). They were bred in the central animal facility of Temple University Medical School. All the experiments involving animals were approved by the Temple University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (4567). Mouse blood was collected as described previously (30Badolia R.

Blood was drawn via cardiac puncture into a one-tenth volume of 3.8% sodium citrate. Blood was spun at 100 × g for 10 min, and the platelet-rich plasma was separated. The remainder of blood was mixed with 400 μl of 3.8% sodium citrate and spun for another 10 min at 100 × g. The resulting platelet-rich plasma was combined, 1 μm prostaglandin E1 was added, and samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g. Platelet-poor plasma was removed, and the platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode’s buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.2 units/ml apyrase (pH 7.4)). Platelet counts were determined using a Hemavet 950FS blood cell counter (Drew Scientific Inc., Dallas, TX). Platelet counts were adjusted to 1.5 × 108 platelets/ml. Aggregation of 0.25 ml of washed platelets was analyzed using a lumiaggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp. Havertown, PA). Aggregation was measured using light transmission under stirring conditions (900 rpm) at 37 °C for the indicated time. 0.25 ml of washed platelets were stimulated with agonist for 3.5 min. The reaction was stopped by snap-freezing. The samples were thawed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells, and the supernatant was diluted 1:500. The diluted samples were used to evaluate thromboxane generation using a TXB2 EIA kit from Enzo Life Sciences (catalog no. ADI-901-002). Platelets were stimulated with agonists or vehicle control for the appropriate time under stirring conditions at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1/10 of a volume of 6.6 n HClO4 and placed at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the protein precipitate was washed with 0.5 ml of deionized water. The samples were again centrifuged as above, and the protein pellets were solubilized in sample buffer containing 0.1 m Tris base, 2% SDS, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 100 mm DTT. The samples were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min prior to loading onto the gel. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman Protran, Pittsburgh, PA). Membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with the desired primary antibody, and then washed four times with 1× Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary IR dye-labeled antibody (1:10,000) for 60 min at room temperature and washed four times with TBST. Membranes were imaged using a LI-COR Odyssey IR imaging system. Mice were weighed, anesthetized, and injected i.v. with 400 μg/kg of collagen and 60 mg/kg epinephrine or PBS (control). The time to cessation of respiration was recorded. Chicago Sky Blue dye was perfused through the right ventricle of the heart. The lungs of the mice were examined to verify that pulmonary embolism occurred, as the dye is excluded from the lungs if the circulation is obstructed because of thrombosis (data not shown). Mice (4–5 weeks old) were anesthetized using isoflurane. Four millimeters of the tail were excised and immediately immersed in 0.9% isotonic saline at 37 °C. The bleeding time was defined as the time required for blood flow into the saline to stop. Statistical analysis was performed using either two-way ANOVA or a Student’s t test depending on the dataset. The method of statistical analysis is indicated in the figure legends. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. V. V. I. and S. P. K. conceptualization; V.

https://openalex.org/W2954145895,"The Gram-negative pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a global nosocomial health threat affecting the majority of hospitals in the U.S. and abroad. The redox protein thioredoxin has been shown to play several roles in modulation of cellular functions affecting various virulence factors in Gram-negative pathogens. This study aims to explore the role of thioredoxin-A protein (TrxA) in A. baumannii virulence. We determined that deletion of the TrxA gene did not significantly affect resistance to environmental stressors such as temperature, salt, and pH. However, TrxA was critical for survival in the presence of elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide. Lack of TrxA was associated with decreased expression of type IV pili related genes and an inability to undergo normal twitching motility. Interestingly, the TrxA-null mutant was able to form biofilms better than the wildtype (WT) and was observed to be significantly less virulent than the WT in a pulmonary infection model. These results are supportive of thioredoxin playing a key role in A. baumannii virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2955085928,"Accumulating evidence has highlighted the role of maternal nutritional status on fetal development, birth outcomes and child health. The Mother and Infant Nutritional Assessment (MINA) cohort is a 3-year follow-up study of pregnant women and their children in Qatar and Lebanon. This study reports on the characteristics and determinants of pre-pregnancy BMI and Gestational Weight Gain (GWG) of MINA particiants, as well as birth outcomes. A total of 272 pregnant women were recruited during their first trimester from primary healthcare centers as well as private clinics in Beirut (n = 194) and Doha (n = 147). During the first visit, data collection included pre-pregnancy weight, sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. The weight before delivery and neonatal outcomes were extracted from the medical records. GWG was calculated as the difference between weight before delivery and pre-pregnancy weight and was classified into insufficient, adequate, and excessive, as per the IOM criteria. Overall, 42.1% of women had a pre-pregnancy BMI≥25 Kg/m2 (58% in Qatar vs 30.8% in Lebanon, p<0.001). Only 30.2% of women had adequate GWG, while 25.7% and 44.1% of women had insufficient and excessive GWG, respectively. In the cohort 68.7% of infants had a weight adequate-for-gestational age (AGA), 6.7% were SGA and 24.6% were LGA. The proportions of LGA were higher with greater GWG (p<0.05). After adjustment, Qatari women were 3 times more likely to be overweight or obese before pregnancy while a higher education level was associated with significantly lower odds of pre-pregnancy BMI≥25 Kg/m2. Pre-pregnancy BMI≥25 Kg/m2 and regular breakfast consumption were predictors of excessive GWG (OR: 3.20, CI: 1.48–6.91; OR: 2.84, CI: 1.15–7.02, respectively). The high prevalence of pre-pregnancy overweight and excessive GWG among MINA participants underscores the need for culture-specific intervention programs to promote healthy body weight in women of childbearing age, and prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2954204240,"Flavonoids are one of the largest secondary metabolite groups, which are widely present in plants. Flavonoids include anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, flavonols and isoflavones. In particular, proanthocyanidins possess beneficial effects for ruminant animals in preventing lethal pasture bloat. As a major legume forage, alfalfa (Medicago sativa) contains little proanthocyanidins in foliage to combat bloat. In an attempt to improve proanthocyanidin content in alfalfa foliage, we over-expressed two MYB transcription factors (CsMYB5-1 and CsMYB5-2) from tea plant that is rich in proanthocyanidins. We showed that, via targeted metabolite and transcript analyses, the transgenic alfalfa plants accumulated higher levels of flavonoids in stems/leaves than the control, in particular anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Over-expression of CsMYB5-1 and CsMYB5-2 induced the expression levels of genes involved in flavonoid pathway, especially anthocyanin/proanthocyanidin-specific pathway genes DFR, ANS and ANR in stems/leaves. Both anthocyanin/proanthocyanidin content and the expression levels of several genes were conversely decreased in flowers of the transgenic lines than in control. Our results indicated that CsMYB5-1 and CsMYB5-2 differently regulate anthocyanins/proanthocyanidins in stems/leaves and flowers. Our study provides a guide for increasing anthocyanin/proanthocyanidin accumulation in foliage of legume forage corps by genetic engineering. These results also suggest that it is feasible to cultivate new varieties for forage production to potentially solve pasture bloat, by introducing transcription factors from typical plants with high proanthocyanidin level."
https://openalex.org/W2953548789,"Breast cancer is a serious health problem that preferentially metastasizes to bone. We have previously shown that bone loss can be prevented by mechanical loading, but the efficacy of ankle loading for metastasis-linked bone loss has not been investigated. This study showed that body weight was decreased after inoculation of tumor cells, but ankle loading restored a rapid weight loss. The nonloading group exhibited a decrease in bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness, and trabecular number (all P < 0.01) as well as an increase in trabecular separation (P < 0.001). However, ankle loading improved those changes (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, although the nonloading group increased the tumor bearing as well as expression of IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinase 9, ankle loading decreased them. Induction of tumor in the bone elevated the osteoclast number (P < 0.05) as well as the levels of nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1, NF-κB ligand, cathepsin K, and serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5b, but ankle loading reduced osteoclast activity and those levels (all P < 0.05). Tumor bearing was positively correlated with the osteoclast number (P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with BV/TV and the osteoblast number (both P < 0.01). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that ankle loading suppresses tumor growth and osteolysis by inhibiting bone resorption and enhancing bone formation.-Yang, S., Liu, H., Zhu, L., Li, X., Liu, D., Song, X., Yokota, H., Zhang, P.

https://openalex.org/W2955900336,"Purpose High calorie intake leads to obesity, a global socio-economic and health problem, reaching epidemic proportion in children and adolescents. Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids from animal (lard) fat are major components of the western-pattern diet and its regular consumption leads to obesity, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, no clear evidence exists whether consumption of diet rich in saturated (SFAs) and monounsaturated (MUFAs) fatty acids has detrimental effects on cardiac structure and energetics primarily due to excessive calories. We, therefore, sought to determine the impact of high calories versus fat content in diet on cardiac structure and mitochondrial energetics. Methods Six-week-old C57BL/6J mice were fed with high calorie, high lard fat-based diet (60% fat, HFD), high-calorie and low lard fat-based diet (10% fat, LFD), and lower-calorie and fat diet (standard chow, 12% fat, SCD) for 10 weeks. Results The HFD- and LFD-fed mice had higher body weight, ventricular mass and thickness of posterior and septal wall with increased cardiomyocytes diameter compared to the SCD-fed mice. These changes were associated with a reduction in the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I and III activity compared to the SCD-fed mice without significant differences between the HFD- and LFD-fed animals. The HFD-fed animals had higher level of malondialdehyde (MDA) than LFD and SCD-fed mice. Conclusions We assume that changes in cardiac morphology and selective reduction of the OXPHOS complexes activity observed in the HFD- and LFD-fed mice might be related to excessive calories with additional effect of fat content on oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2955347622,"Background Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic mycosis commonly found in Latin America that is caused by distinct species of Paracoccidioides genus: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex (S1, PS2, PS3 and PS4) and Paracoccidioides lutzii. Its pathobiology has been recently explored by different approaches to clarify the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions underpinning PCM. The diversity of clinical forms of this disease has been attributed to both host- and fungus-related factors. Methodology/Principal findings For better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of host-fungus interactions, we evaluated in vivo virulence of nine Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex isolates and correlated it to protein expression profiles obtained by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Based on the recovery of viable fungi from mouse organs, the isolates were classified as those having low, moderate, or high virulence. Highly virulent isolates overexpressed proteins related to adhesion process and stress response, probably indicating important roles of those fungal proteins in regulating the colonization capacity, survival, and ability to escape host immune system reaction. Moreover, highly virulent isolates exhibited enhanced expression of glycolytic pathway enzymes concomitantly with repressed expression of succinyl-CoA ligase beta chain, a protein related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Conclusions/Significance Our findings may point to the mechanisms used by highly virulent P. brasiliensis isolates to withstand host immune reactions and to adapt to transient iron availability as strategies to survive and overcome stress conditions inside the host."
https://openalex.org/W2954512081,"Background With support of the national tuberculosis (TB) program, KHANA (a local non-governmental organization in Cambodia) has implemented an innovative approach using a seed-and-recruit model to actively find TB cases in the community. The model engaged community members including TB survivors as seed and newly diagnosed people with TB as recruiters to recruit presumptive TB cases in their social network in a snowball approach for screening and linkage to treatment. This study aimed to explore the acceptability of the active case finding with the seed-and-recruit model in detecting new TB cases and determine the characteristics of successful seeds. Methods This qualitative study was conducted in four provinces (Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Chhnang, Siem Reap, and Takeo) in Cambodia in 2017. Fifty-six in-depth interviews and ten focus group discussions (with a total of 64 participants) were conducted with selected beneficiaries and key stakeholders at different levels to gain insights into the acceptability, strengths, and challenges in implementing the model and the characteristics of successful seeds. Transcripts were coded and content analyses were performed. Results The seed-and-recruit active case finding model was generally well-received by the study participants. They saw the benefits of engaging TB survivors and utilizing their social network to find new TB cases in the community. The social embeddedness of the model within the local community was one of the major strengths. The success of the model also hinges on the integration with existing health facilities. Having an extensive social network, being motivated, and having good knowledge about TB were important characteristics of successful seeds. Study participants reported challenges in motivating the presumptive TB cases for screening, logistic capacities, and high workload during the implementation. However, there was a general consensus that the model ought to be expanded. Conclusions These findings indicate that the seed-and-recruit model is well-accepted by the beneficiaries and key stakeholders. Further studies are needed to more comprehensively evaluate the impacts and cost-effectiveness of the model for future expansion in Cambodia as well as in other resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2953786499,"When observing two individuals, people are faster and better able to identify them as other people if they are facing each other than if they are facing away from each other. This advantage disappears when the images are inverted, suggesting that the visual system is particularly sensitive to dyads in this upright configuration, and perceptually groups socially engaged dyads into a single holistic unit. This dyadic inversion effect was obtained with images of full bodies. Body information was sufficient to elicit this effect even when information about head orientation was absent. However, it has not been tested whether the dyadic inversion effect occurs with face images and whether the emotions displayed by the faces modulate the effect. In three experiments we obtained robust dyadic inversion with face images. Holistic processing of upright face pairs occurred for neutral, happy, and sad faces but not for angry and fearful face pairs. Thus, perceptual grouping of individuals into pairs appears to depend on the emotional expressions of individual faces and the interpersonal relations they imply."
https://openalex.org/W2954419136,"Background Late HIV diagnosis remains one of the challenges in combating the epidemic. Primary care providers play an important role in screening for HIV infection. Our study aims to evaluate the relationship between knowledge and barriers to HIV testing and screening outcomes. The impact of an education program for primary care providers, towards improving HIV testing and late diagnosis rates, is also assessed. Methods A self-administered questionnaire that was developed within the framework of the European project OptTEST was used to examine HIV knowledge and barriers to HIV testing scores before and after being involved in an HIV education program. A quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-intervention measures was performed to investigate its impact. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the relationship between variables for the HIV testing offer. Results A total of 20 primary care centers and 454 primary care staff were included. Baseline OptTEST results showed that more knowledgeable staff offered an HIV test more frequently (OR 1.07; CI 95% 1.01–1.13; p = 0.027) and had lower barrier scores (OR 0.89; CI 95% 0.77–0.95; p = 0.005). Nurses had lower scores in knowledge-related items (OR 0.28; CI 95% 0.17–0.46; p<0.001), but higher scores in barrier-related items than physicians (OR 3.28; CI 95% 2.01–5.46; p<0.001). Specific centers with more knowledgeable staff members had a significant association with a greater level of new HIV diagnosis rates (OR 1.61; CI 95% 1.04–2.49; p = 0.032). After the intervention, we found that 12 out of 14 individual questions showed improved scores. In the 6 months after the training program, we similarly found a higher HIV testing rate (OR 1.19; CI 1.02–1.42; p = 0.036). Conclusions This study highlights the association between knowledge and barriers to HIV testing, including HIV testing rates. It shows that it is possible to modify knowledge and reduce perceived barriers through educational programs, subsequently improving HIV screening outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2953462324,"The contemporary capacity of genome sequence analysis significantly lags behind the rapidly evolving sequencing technologies. Retrieving biological meaningful information from an ever-increasing amount of genome data would be significantly beneficial for functional genomic studies. For example, the duplication, organization, evolution, and function of superfamily genes are arguably important in many aspects of life. However, the incompleteness of annotations in many sequenced genomes often results in biased conclusions in comparative genomic studies of superfamilies. Here, we present a Perl software, called Closing Target Trimming (CTT), for automatically identifying most, if not all, members of a gene family in any sequenced genomes on CentOS 7 platform. To benefit a broader application on other operating systems, we also created a Docker application package, CTTdocker. Our test data on the F-box gene superfamily showed 78.2 and 79% gene finding accuracies in two well annotated plant genomes, Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, respectively. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of this program, we ran it through 18 plant genomes and five non-plant genomes to compare the expansion of the F-box and the BTB superfamilies. The program discovered that on average 12.7 and 9.3% of the total F-box and BTB members, respectively, are new loci in plant genomes, while it only found a small number of new members in vertebrate genomes. Therefore, different evolutionary and regulatory mechanisms of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases may be present in plants and animals. We also annotated and compared the Pkinase family members across a wide range of organisms, including 10 fungi, 10 metazoa, 10 vertebrates, and 10 additional plants, which were randomly selected from the Ensembl database. Our CTT annotation recovered on average 14% more loci, including pseudogenes, of the Pkinase superfamily in these 40 genomes, demonstrating its robust replicability and scalability in annotating superfamiy members in any genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2954695761,"Early changes in nutritional status may be predictive of subsequent HIV disease progression in people living with HIV (PLHIV). In addition to conventional anthropometric assessment using body mass index (BMI) and mid-upper arm circumferences (MUAC), measures of strength and fatigability may detect earlier changes in nutrition status which predict HIV disease progression. This study aims to examine the association between various nutritional metrics relevant in resource-scarce setting and HIV disease progression. The HIV disease progression outcome was defined as any occurrence of an incident AIDS-defining illnesses (ADI) among antiretroviral treatment (ART)-naïve PLHIV. From 2008–2009, HIV+ Zambian adult men and non-pregnant women were followed for 9 months at a Doctors without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers, MSF) HIV clinic in Kapiri Mposhi, Zambia. Since the study was conducted in the time period when former WHO recommendations on ART (i.e., ≤200 CD4 cell count as opposed to treating all individuals regardless of CD4 cell count or disease stage) were followed, caution should be applied when considering the implications from this study’s results to improve HIV case management under current clinical guidelines, or when comparing findings from this study with studies conducted in recent years. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the associations between baseline nutritional measurements and the outcome of incident ADI. Self-reported loss of appetite study (AOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.04, 3.45, P = 0.036) and moderate wasting based on MUAC classification (AOR 2.40, 95% CI 1.13, 5.10, P = 0.022) were independently associated with increased odds of developing incident ADI within 9 months, while continuous increments (in psi) of median handgrip strength (AOR 0.74, 95%CI 0.60, 0.91, P = 0.004) was independently associated with decreased odds of incident ADI only among women. The association between low BMI and the short-term outcome of ADI was attenuated after controlling for these nutritional indicators. These findings warrant further research to validate the consistency of these observed associations among larger ART-naïve HIV-infected populations, as well as to develop nutritional assessment tools for identifying disease progression risk among ART-naïve PLHIV."
https://openalex.org/W2954417144,"Mung bean (Vigna radiata), an important legume crop, has the property of desiccation tolerance (DT), which is lost in the final stage of germination (preimbibition, 18 h-24 h). We compared parameters related to the programmed cell death (PCD) of mung bean seeds before and after dehydration at different imbibition stages through various detection methods. The results of Evans blue and TTC staining methods showed that the dehydration process could lead to cell death. The results of optical and subcellular morphology showed that PCD occurred after dehydration. The destruction of DNA integrity and the activity changes in caspase and total nuclease in mung bean seeds after dehydration treatment indicated that the loss of desiccation tolerance was related to PCD. Dehydration resulted in the destruction of the mitochondrial structure, reversal of the membrane potential, and the entrance of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. These processes all indicate that the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was the main form of dehydration-induced PCD. The results of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration showed that Ca2+ signaling also played a role in inducing PCD, with the upstream signal being dehydration-induced changes in water potential and the downstream signal being the ROS and mitochondrial PT channel, according to the order in which these signals happened. The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway can be considered the main mechanism of dehydration-induced PCD based on our analysis of the sequence of major events in PCD. The main processes include dehydration induction, changes in Ca2+ and mitochondrial respiratory electron transport, the reversal of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by ROS and Ca2+, and the transmission and execution of PCD downstream signals induced by cytochrome C release."
https://openalex.org/W2954916779,"Introduction In sports related to low body weight, such as classical ballet, the assessment of body composition is important for monitoring performance and health status. This study aimed to cross-validate anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance (BIA) predictive equations for estimating body composition of non-professional classical ballet dancers, using dual-energy-X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a reference method. Materials and methods Thirty-seven female non-professional classical dancers (median age of 19 years), at intermediate/advanced level, were evaluated in a cross-sectional study. Body composition was evaluated by DXA, anthropometry and tetrapolar BIA. Twenty different predictive equations of anthropometry (n = 8) and BIA (n = 12) were used to estimate Body Fat (BF) and Fat-Free Mass (FFM), testing their validity against DXA using the Bland-Altman statistics. Results For BF estimated by anthropometry equations, just one equation showed agreement with DXA (r = 0.852, p < 0.0005; p = 0.600 for one sample T-test). According to the Bland-Altman analysis, this equation also showed validity, with the absence of proportional bias. Regarding the predictive BIA equations tested, none were valid for our study group. Conclusion Only one of the anthropometric equations, the one proposed by Durnin and Womerley (1974), but none of the BIA equations analyzed, was valid for the evaluation of body composition of the studied classical dancers. Our results emphasize the importance of previous cross-validation of existing equations or the development of specific equations for body composition assessment in specific populations."
https://openalex.org/W2954790415,"The microtubule (MT)-associated protein tau regulates the critical growing and shortening behaviors of MTs, and its normal activity is essential for neuronal development and maintenance. Accordingly, aberrant tau action is tightly associated with Alzheimer’s disease and is genetically linked to several additional neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. Although tau is known to promote net MT growth and stability, the precise mechanistic details governing its regulation of MT dynamics remain unclear. Here, we have used the slowly-hydrolyzable GTP analog, guanylyl-(α,β)-methylene-diphosphonate (GMPCPP), to examine the structural effects of tau at MT ends that may otherwise be too transient to observe. The addition of both four-repeat (4R) and three-repeat (3R) tau isoforms to pre-formed GMPCPP MTs resulted in the formation of extended, multiprotofilament-wide projections at MT ends. Furthermore, at temperatures too low for assembly of bona fide MTs, both tau isoforms promoted the formation of long spiral ribbons from GMPCPP tubulin heterodimers. In addition, GMPCPP MTs undergoing cold-induced disassembly in the presence of 4R tau (and to a much lesser extent 3R tau) also formed spirals. Finally, three pathological tau mutations known to cause neurodegeneration and dementia were differentially compromised in their abilities to stabilize MT disassembly intermediates. Taken together, we propose that tau promotes the formation/stabilization of intermediate states in MT assembly and disassembly by promoting both longitudinal and lateral tubulin–tubulin contacts. We hypothesize that these activities represent fundamental aspects of tau action that normally occur at the GTP-rich ends of GTP/GDP MTs and that may be compromised in neurodegeneration-causing tau variants.

https://openalex.org/W2953434864,"Controversy remains about how diet affects the vascular endothelial dysfunction associated with disordered insulin-glucose homeostasis. It is postulated that the type and level of certain macronutrients contribute to endothelial dysfunction in vascular diabetes complications. However, it is not well understood how specific macronutrients affect the molecular inflammatory response under conditions of hyperglycemia. Here, we examined retinal microvascular endothelial injury in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats fed a laboratory Western diet (WD). WD, characterized by its high content of saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar, significantly increased retinal leukocyte accumulation and endothelial injury in the STZ-diabetic rats. Suppression of endothelial NF-κB signaling in the STZ model reduced the WD-induced increase in leukocyte accumulation. To isolate the effect of dietary fat, we generated high-fat diets with varying fatty acid balance and type. These diets contained moderate amounts of carbohydrates but no sugar. We found that neither high levels of saturated or unsaturated fats per se increased retinal leukocyte accumulation and endothelial injury in the STZ-diabetic rat model but that the combination of high levels of dietary cholesterol with specific saturated fatty acids that are abundant in WD exacerbated leukocyte accumulation and endothelial injury in the retinas of STZ-diabetic rats.—Barakat, A., Nakao, S., Zandi, S., Sun, D., Schmidt-Ullrich, R., Hayes, K.

The time window for the last bout beneficial effect on postprandial lipaemia after football play is unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine whether playing affects postprandial TG during 1.5 day of reduced activity. Eighteen males were randomly allocated to perform either 1 (1FOOT; n = 9; age = 33.0 ± 5.0 yrs; body mass index = 24.2 ± 3.6 kg/m2) or 3 (3FOOT) consecutive days of 60-min 5 vs 5 football (n = 9; age = 32.8 ± 5.2 yrs; body mass index = 26.2 ± 4.1 kg/m2) matches across a 5-day study period. They arrived to the laboratory 10 hrs and 34 hrs after the final football session and blood samples were collected at fasted (0 min) and 45, 90, 240 and 360 min post a high fat load meal. There were non significant increase for postprandial TG AUC (9.1%; p = 0.17; 95%CI = -0.43 to 2.0; ES = -0.23) and iAUC (14.2%; p = 0.43; 95%CI = -0.92 to 1.9; ES = -0.24) between 10 and 34 hrs after the 1FOOT. For the 3FOOT, there was a non significant decrease in postprandial TG AUC (-2.7%; p = 0.73; 95%CI = -2.0 to 1.5; ES = 0.05) and iAUC (-17.5%; p = 0.41; 95%ci = -2.5 to 1.1; ES = 0.31) from 10 to 34 hrs, respectively. Performing three consecutive days of football exercise may offer no greater protective effect for postprandial TG before a period of reduced activity, compared to a single session."
https://openalex.org/W2953906421,"Seahorses are considered one of the most iconic examples of a monogamous species in the animal kingdom. This study investigates the relationship between stocking density and mating and competitive behavior from the context of the field biology of the dwarf seahorse, Hippocampus zosterae (Jordan & Gilbert). Animals were housed in 38 liter tanks at a range of densities and sex ratios (from 2-8 animals per tank), and their reproductive and other social behaviors were monitored from tank introduction through copulation. At low tank densities and even sex ratios but comparatively high field densities, frequency of both mating and competitive behaviors was low in trials. A higher level of males in tanks across all densities increased competition, activity levels, and aggression leading to egg transfer errors and brood expulsion, resulting in lower reproductive success. Across seahorse species, mean and maximum wild densities were consistently lower than those used in ex situ breeding, with adult sex ratios that were significantly female biased. However, significant variation exists in wild seahorse densities across species, with higher densities detected in focal/mark recapture studies and on artificial habitat structures than reported with belt transect sampling techniques. Interchange of knowledge gained in both aquarium and wild contexts will allow us to better understand the biology of this genus, and improve reproduction in captivity. Interpreting ex situ reproductive behaviors of seahorses within various densities reported from natural populations will help us predict the impact of conservation efforts and increase the likelihood of long-term persistence of populations for this threatened genus."

We designed an MC vector containing the sequences of basiliximab (anti-CD25 mAb) and IL-10. We verified the substantial production of the anti—CD25/IL-10 protein from the MC in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic effect of MC-derived anti—CD25/IL-10 was evaluated in a skin allograft mouse model by single intravenous infusion. Mice treated with the MC encoding anti—CD25/IL-10 exhibited prolonged skin allograft survival times accompanied by improved histologic changes and immunologic regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2953475078,"Previous school-based interventions have produced positive effects upon measures of children’s health and wellbeing but such interventions are often delivered by external experts which result in short-term effects. Thus, upskilling and expanding the resources available to classroom teachers could provide longer-term solutions. This paper presents a feasibility study of an online health resource (Healthy Schools Resource: HSR) developed to assist primary school teachers in the delivery of health-related education. Four schools (n = 2 intervention) participated in this study. Study feasibility was assessed by recruitment, retention and completion rates of several outcomes including height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and several metabolic markers including HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and dietary knowledge following a 10-12-week intervention period. The process evaluation involved fidelity checks of teachers’ use of the HSR and post-intervention teacher interviews. A total of 614 consent forms were issued and 267 were returned (43%), of which, 201 confirmed consent for blood sampling (75%). Retention of children participating in the study was also high (96%). Of the 13 teachers who delivered the intervention to the children, four teachers were excluded from further analyses as they did not participate in the fidelity checks. Overall, teachers found the online resource facilitative of teaching health and wellbeing and several recommendations regarding the resource were provided to inform further evaluations. Recruitment and retention rates suggest that the teacher led intervention is feasible and acceptable to both teachers, parents and children. Initial findings provide promising evidence that given a greater sample size, a longer intervention exposure period and changes made to the resource, teachers’ use of HSR could enhance measures of health and wellbeing in children."
