https://openalex.org/W2064731648,"IN many fungi, such as most of the Ascomycetes and Ustilaginales, the products of meiosis are arranged regularly in a linear order, and by examining them or by isolating them in order, it is possible to distinguish between segregation of a pair of allelomorphs at the first and at the second division of meiosis. The relative frequencies of first- and second-division segregation for a given locus are dependent on the frequency of crossing-over between that locus and the centromere of the chromosome. Hence, the centromere can be plotted on the cross-over map of the chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1998914539,"THE pathway by which the hypothalamus influences the secretion of the anterior pituitary gland has been the subject of much research. The possibility that the hypophysial portal vessels may form part of this pathway has been discussed1, and the anatomy of these structures in the rat and other forms has been described. In 1949, Harris2 observed that regeneration of the hypophysial portal vessels in the rat may follow section of the pituitary stalk, and later3 that post-operative return of reproductive activity can be correlated with such regeneration. In this work the hypophysial stalk was exposed by the sub-temporal route and either cut with a knife or torn with a hook. In the literature, accounts of stalk section made by a variety of methods show divergent results. Since the conditions for a regeneration of the portal vessels may vary according to the method used for severing the hypothalamo-hypophysial connexions, we have investigated the regenerative capacity of these vessels in different circumstances."

https://openalex.org/W2083100000,"THE non-catalytic reduction of thiophene by sodium and methanol in liquid ammonia at −40° C. has been shown to yield a mixture of the two isomeric dihydrothiophenes (thiacyclopentenes), 2-butene-1-thiol (crotyl mercaptan), normal butenes and hydrogen sulphide. The dihydrothiophenes correspond to the 1.2- and 1.4-addition of a molecule of hydrogen to the conjugated system of the thiophene, the ratio of the two products being approximately 1:2. The formation of the mercaptan is accounted for by the fission of the dihydrothiophene ring. This type of fission, involving the C—S linkage, has previously been observed to take place with dihydrothionaphthene1 and some alkyl alkenyl sulphides2 under conditions comparable with those employed by us. The presence of normal butenes and hydrogen sulphide among the products indicates that 2-butene-1-thiol is also capable of undergoing a similar fission, which was confirmed by treating the mercaptan by itself with sodium and methanol, when the same degradation products were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1969262827,"THERE is little published information about the spectra of the diatomic carbon halides, and only for CCl has the vibrational analysis of a band-system been completed1,2,6. We have, therefore, recently examined some sources which seemed likely to yield a band-spectrum of CF. The most useful of these has proved to be an electrodeless discharge through a stream of fluorocarbon vapour, using a valve-oscillator dissipating about 300 watts at a wave-length of about 30 metres. At relatively high pressures, excitation of impurities such as CO and SiF does not occur, and an extraordinarily rich banded spectrum is obtained, which so far has been found to extend from about 1970 to 4800 A."

https://openalex.org/W2062363180,"MOST existing accounts of the mitotic cycle in animals seem to indicate that the synthesis of desoxyribonucleic acid of the chromosome takes place during prophase of mitosis, so that at the end of this stage, the desoxyribonucleic acid content is double that of the interphase nucleus and this becomes halved during anaphase1. Support for this view by photometric analysis has been given by Caspersson2 and more recently by Ris3, who find an increase of desoxyribonucleic acid taking place during prophase."

https://openalex.org/W2022780700,"SINCE the discovery of the outstanding insecticidal activity of 1 : 1 : 1-trichloro-2 : 2-di-(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT), many analogues have been synthesized, and several investigators1,2 have reached the conclusion that the most toxic are also the most similar to DDT in shape and size. If the toxicity is due to its structural resemblance to some essential insect metabolite or to cholesterol3, then compounds isosteric with DDT ought to act similarly, and replacement of the three (β-chlorine atoms by spatially similar atoms or groups of atoms should not destroy activity. Suitable groups were thought to be —CH3 (radius 1.7 A.) and —OH (radius 2.0 A.), which conform reasonably well with Cl (radius 1.7 A.)—an agreement which has been shown4 to be well within the limits required for isosteric activity in serological reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2038517236,"THE kinetics of the pyrolysis of 1.2 dichlorethane have recently been described by Barton and Howlett1. Over the temperature-range 360°–480° C. they find that the reaction is first order and proceeds by a radical chain-mechanism in vessels coated with a carbonaceous film (k = 1010.81 exp − 47,000/RT). Strong evidence for the radical nature of the decomposition is provided by the powerful inhibiting effect of propylene. The maximally inhibited rate, which is independent of further increase in propylene concentration, is shown to be partially heterogeneous in character."

https://openalex.org/W1968191995,"IN our tests with a strain of the fungus Memnoniella echinata which requires preformed biotin for growth1,2, it was noticed that whereas no germination took place in heat-sterilized liquid Czapek–Dox medium without added biotin, appreciable growth resulted if the same medium was sterilized by Seitz filtration (using Ford's ‘Sterimats’ pad, grade SB, 6 cm., from Gallenkamp and Co.). This led to the suspicion that the filter pad might be contributing biotin, which was confirmed by the following experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1983092084,"THE inflorescence of rice is a panicle; its development is different from that of the spike of cereals studied by Purvis1 and Bonnet2,3. It has been noted by Purvis1, Purvis and Gregory4, Bonnet2,3 and Sharman5 that the development of a spike is preceded by the formation of double ridges on the main rachis; one of the ridges forming into a spikelet and the other a subtending bract under an effective photoperiod and with low temperature of germination. In the absence of these conditions the primordia grow into leaves. The whole theory of the hormonal mechanism of flowering by Purvis and Gregory is based on this fundamental fact. The behaviour of rice is different from that of rye in several important aspects. The effect of short days on rice is quantitative in its flowering response6. While in winter rye Purvis and Gregory have observed that short days up to six weeks accelerate flowering and that subsequent long days are essential. Exposure to short days for periods longer than six weeks retards flowering. Tillers in rye show the same behaviour as the main shoot, indicating that the whole plant is affected by the treatment, although at the end of the treatment the majority of the vegetative buds are not yet formed. In rice (var. Rupsail) the tillers behave differently from the main shoot in respect of their leaf number and ear emergence by short-day exposure. The growing apex in its transition from vegetative growth to reproduction elongates considerably at the top, and along the edges several small groups of cells protrude which ultimately develop into branch rachides bearing more than one spikelet. Nowhere in the present investigation have double ridges, as noted in wheat, barley and rye, been seen. With an adequate dose of photoperiodic treatment the vegetative apex gradually passes into a main rachis bearing branches on which spikelets are formed. Once the rachis is formed under short-day conditions it continues to form spikelets irrespective of subsequent long days. The photoperiodic stimulus acts quantitatively on the growing apex. A minimum of four weeks exposure is necessary for 100 per cent flowering of the main shoot; after three weeks 66 per cent, and two weeks 3 per cent flower. In the case of first and second tillers six weeks are essential. Anatomical changes in the growing apices reveal that after four weeks all the vegetative apices are transformed into inflorescences; after three weeks some apices are reproductive and others remain vegetative all through."
